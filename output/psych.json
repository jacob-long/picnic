          "authors": "Evan Mayo-Wilson, Sean Grant, Katherine S. Corker, David Moher",
          "abstract": "In 2013, the Center for Open Science proposed that journal articles be awarded “badges” for engaging in open-science practices, including preregistration. In 2015, the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines (TOP 2015) promoted preregistration of studies and analysis plans. Since then, the term “preregistration” has been used to describe different research outputs created at different times—sometimes, but not always, including study registration. Following a review of evidence about TOP 2015 implementation, including evidence that adherence could not be rated reliably, the TOP Guidelines Advisory Board updated these guidelines (TOP 2025). The TOP 2025 guidelines no longer use the term “preregistration.” Instead, TOP 2025 disambiguates specific research outputs, such as registrations, study protocols, analysis plans, code, and other research materials. TOP 2025 also explains that researchers should describe the time at which outputs are created and shared in relation to key study activities. In this article, we explain why adopting the terminology used in TOP 2025 and describing the times at which specific research outputs are created and shared will enhance understanding and support better implementation and reporting of open science.",

          "authors": "Kyle Cox, Benjamin Kelcey",
          "abstract": "Bayesian and structural-after-measurement (SAM) approaches have been developed, in part, to address limitations of conventional estimators in the context of structural equation models (SEMs) with latent interactions. Although both approaches have shown promise in a variety of contexts including small-sample studies, there is very little literature systematically comparing the relative benefits, limitations, and trade-offs among these approaches. In this study, we (a) compared the performance of estimators under each approach in multilevel SEMs with a within-, between-, or cross-level latent interaction and (b) demonstrated the flexibility of SAM approaches by extending and investigating them in partially nested SEMs with latent moderated mediation. The results suggest substantial differences between estimator performance as a function of the type of latent interaction. SAM approaches performed well with a variety of latent interactions in multilevel and partially nested SEMs, while Bayesian approaches, including those with informative priors, struggled with models that included a cross-level latent interaction and were not easily extended to partially nested SEMs. Overall, the results suggest that SAM approaches are a versatile and highly adaptable alternative or complement to conventional full-information estimators. To conclude, we outline estimator considerations based on the SEM type, latent interaction, and data structure.",

          "abstract": "Four longitudinal studies ( N = 1,035) examined whether telling others about personal goals enhances goal support received, goal pursuit effort, and goal progress. In Study 1, participants nominated a personal goal and 1 week later reported whether they had shared this goal during the week. Goal disclosure predicted more support received from others and greater goal pursuit effort. In Studies 2 and 3, participants assigned to share a goal in the coming week later reported receiving more support from others, which in turn was linked to greater goal pursuit effort and progress. In Study 4, participants were assigned either to share a goal with a person accompanying them at that moment or to keep it private; goal disclosure was again linked to goal pursuit effort, though not to support received. Together, these studies reveal the benefits of sharing goals and highlight the importance of considering the audience and manner of goal disclosure.",

          "abstract": "We examined how scientific research influences the beliefs of those most invested in the research. We focused specifically on violent video game (VVG) and aggression research and tested the hypothesis that non-players and non-habitual players would update their beliefs based on the study conclusions, whereas more habitual players would not. Participants read abstracts with either a positive effect or a null effect. Beliefs about the effect of VVGs on aggression were measured before and after reading. Results in both studies (overall N = 1,576) showed that at low VVG exposure levels, participants in both conditions updated their beliefs to align with the research. However, at high VVG exposure levels, participants maintained their belief that VVGs do not increase aggression, and at very high VVG exposure levels, positive-effect studies led participants to believe the opposite: that VVGs reduce aggression. We interpret this pattern of response as suggesting a process of psychological distancing, whereby individuals defensively shift their beliefs away from threatening claims. These findings highlight the need to understand how scientific information is received and to develop strategies that prevent reinforcing misconceptions.",

          "abstract": "Across 12 empirical studies ( N total = 2,615), this research systematically examined the stable tendency for individuals to overestimate others’ zero-sum beliefs, along with its underlying psychological mechanisms and behavioral consequences. Studies 1–3 and Supplementary Studies 1–4, using diverse experimental designs and measures, consistently showed that people tend to overestimate others’ zero-sum beliefs at both explicit and implicit levels. Studies 4–5, through surveys and experiments, provided converging evidence that construing others at a high construal level—as purely self-interested agents—serves as a key psychological mechanism driving this overestimation. Study 6 and Supplementary Studies 5–6 demonstrated that overestimating others’ zero-sum beliefs significantly reduced cooperative behavior, both in abstract game contexts and in more everyday settings. These findings enrich researchers’ understanding of the illusory nature of zero-sum beliefs and suggest that interventions based on the social norms approach may help correct this overestimation and foster cooperation.",

          "abstract": "Recognition memory refers to the process of distinguishing between previously experienced and novel events. Apart from the objective quality of stored memories, recognition depends on the retrieval context produced by all items (foils) presented together with actually memorized targets and causing confusion. Memory models often conceptualize target-foil confusability via distances in psychological spaces where greater confusability originates from shorter interitem distances. We tested whether recognition spaces change when other foils are added to the retrieval context or when target memory strength is changed ( N = 1,311 adults). Using signal-detection modeling, we found that separately measured distances, d ′s, from each foil to the target provide a good linear prediction of those distances for all foils being presented together against that target. Those predictions stay accurate even when the absolute distances are scaled up or down because of a change in memory strength. This suggests strong metric invariance of spaces used for recognition decisions under variable retrieval contexts.",

          "abstract": "Musical chills, a subjective emotional experience associated with goosebumps, shivers, and/or tingling sensations, have recently been linked to experiences of social bonding. Thus, there is some rationale for expecting music performance to afford chills, as performance can involve strong emotional responses and social bonding experiences. However, almost all musical chills research focuses on listening contexts. This study explores experiences of musical chills while performing music. Data for the study were collected through a questionnaire survey with 218 musicians about their chills experiences. Results show that chills are experienced by musicians during performance and that they are largely positive experiences. Important factors for chills in performance include various musical features, performance qualities, interpersonal connections between performers, and personal associations with the music and performance context. Findings align with links between chills and social bonding, although further research is required to understand underlying psychological mechanisms of the phenomenon. Finally, various characteristics of chills in music performance suggest that the experience may be linked to psychological wellbeing, posing a novel route for continued research.",
