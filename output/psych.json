          "authors": "Eleanor J. Junkins, Jaime Derringer",
          "abstract": "In this tutorial, we suggest ways to improve current practices for measuring gender identity, sexual orientation, and demographics about relationships based on previous datasets and a newly collected survey of people’s behavior and perceptions of alternative-response formats. We apply lessons learned from racial identity/ethnicity to suggest broader principles of improving demographic measurement. We offer guides to meet the expectations of diverse stakeholders, including participants. The response options we recommend were curated to balance global identities and emerging trends to be applicable for online international research and in-person psychology research conducted primarily by U.S. institutions. We also offer practical suggestions for researchers to handle more complex data, including multiselect response options, which tend to be preferred by participants. Improved demographic data allow researchers to more fully capture multidimensional and complex social identities that are related to social inequities. In sum, the current tutorial is a guide to and discussion about challenges in collecting demographic data on social identities in which we use illustrative data to address important points related to measuring gender, sexuality, and relational demographics, specifically.",

          "authors": "Jens H. Fünderich, Lukas J. Beinhauer, Frank Renkewitz",
          "abstract": "Data from rating scales underlie very specific restrictions: They have a lower limit, an upper limit, and they only consist of a few integers. These characteristics produce particular dependencies between means and standard deviations. A mean that is a non-integer, for example, can never be associated with zero variability, while a mean equal to one of the scale’s limits can only be associated with zero variability. The relationship can be described by umbrella plots for which we present a formalization. We use that formalization to explore implications for statistical power and for the relationship between heterogeneity in unstandardized and standardized effect sizes. The analysis illustrates that power is not only affected by the mean difference and sample size, but also by the position of a mean within the respective scale. Further, the umbrella restrictions of rating scales can impede interpretability of meta-analytic heterogeneity. Estimations of relative heterogeneity can diverge between unstandardized and standardized effects, raising questions about which of the two patterns of heterogeneity we would want to explain (for example, through moderators). We reanalyze data from the Many Labs projects to illustrate the issue and finally discuss the implications of our observations as well as ways to utilize these properties of rating scales. To facilitate in-depth exploration and practical application of our formalization, we developed the Shiny Umbrellas app, which is publicly available at https://www.apps.meta-rep.lmu.de/shiny_umbrellas/ .",

          "authors": "Emily N. Cyr, Jennifer R. Steele, Toni Schmader, Kayla Robinson, Stephen C. Wright, Steven J. Spencer, Hilary B. Bergsieker",
          "abstract": "Girls report lower belonging in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) than boys, which may carry costs for girls’ later STEM participation. We hypothesized that being socially included within a STEM context supports feelings of belonging—which then contributes to stronger intentions to pursue STEM, especially for girls. To investigate, we recruited girls and boys (N = 1,330; Mdn age = 12; 41% White, 35% East Asian) attending week-long Canadian STEM summer camps. We gathered precamp and postcamp STEM intentions (fit and interest), plus postcamp objective social inclusion and subjective belonging (with distinct metrics computed for female vs. male peers). Consistent with previous findings, girls had lower STEM intentions than boys. In addition, we found that, for girls, being more socially included (particularly by male peers) was associated with stronger STEM intentions, mediated by subjective belonging. For boys, social inclusion (via belonging) was less predictive of STEM intentions. These results highlight how childhood friendships may impact early intentions to pursue STEM education and careers, especially for girls.",

          "abstract": "Four studies examine whether demographic forms elicit social identity threat and institutional exclusion for Latine Americans before and after the 2020 Presidential election and leading up to the 2024 election. Using a mock-Census form and widely used ethnicity/racial designations, we manipulated the framing of Latine identity through a two-item (category listed separately) versus a single-item (combined) format, and also varied the inclusion of a citizenship question. Overall, Latine Americans who completed a two-item versus a single-item mock-Census form experienced greater social identity threat, institutional exclusion (e.g., threatened belonging), more negative external perceptions of Latine Americans, and lower Latine and American identification. Reactions to the citizenship question were particularly attenuated by study timepoint and sociopolitical context but also revealed a concern over confirming negative stereotypes about Latine Americans related to immigration and citizenship status. Results suggest Latine Americans face identity threat through demographic forms, and this may affect their sense of belonging within the United States.",

          "abstract": "Hostile sexism evokes women’s resistance necessitating benevolent sexism to promote cross-gender cooperation. Addressing inconsistent, primarily self-report evidence for ambivalent sexism theory principles, we test the actor and partner effects of sexist attitudes on behaviors exhibited within heterosexual couples’ interactions ( N = 855 dyadic interactions). Showing that men’s hostile sexism likely incites resistance, men’s hostile sexism predicted more hostile and less responsive behavior by men and their women partners. Providing new behavioral evidence that benevolent sexism may promote heterosexual cooperation, men’s benevolent sexism predicted less hostile and more responsive behavior by men and their partners. Illustrating that benevolent sexism is also likely to have costs for women and men, women’s benevolent sexism predicted more hostile behavior by women and their partners, particularly when men partners were low in benevolent or high in hostile sexism. We emphasize the importance of examining how sexist attitudes influence actor and partner behavior across different contexts.",

          "abstract": "Assertively pursuing sexual needs versus complying or accommodating to partner’s sexual desires has considerable implications. We apply and integrate general theories of power to identify how people’s own power (actor power) and perceptions of their partner’s power (perceived partner power) differentially relate to sexual behaviors and motivations in woman–man relationships. Across three studies (total N = 995), actors’ power predicted sexual approach–inhibition: actors higher in power reported more comfort initiating and refusing sex, more assertive sexual communication, and less sexual compliance. By contrast, perceived partner power predicted sexual accommodation–neglect: when partners were perceived to be higher in power, actors expressed greater willingness to compromise and sexual communal strength, and greater understanding when partners rejected sex. These distinct effects were not magnified by asymmetries in perceived power, nor did they differ across gender. Facilitating actor and partner power in intimate relationships should reduce rather than amplify harmful sexual behavior.",

          "authors": "Khaoula Chehbouni, Florian Carichon, Adrien Simonnot-Lanciaux, Gilles Caporossi, Danilo C. Dantas",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between the lexical typicality of song lyrics and song popularity in the UK Official Singles Chart from 1999 to 2013. Drawing on natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we develop a multidimensional measure of lyrics’ typicality that captures lexical repetition, complexity, thematic content, and emotional tone, addressing methodological limitations in previous research that relied heavily on static word dictionaries. By analysing 1,457 songs that reached the top five chart positions, we demonstrate that lyrics’ typicality significantly predicts the duration a song remains in the top five but does not affect the peak chart position or the trajectory of popularity (skewness and kurtosis). Our findings suggest that while typical lyrics may contribute to a song’s longevity within a given canon, they do not necessarily guarantee chart-topping success. This research contributes a replicable, dictionary-free methodology for assessing lyrics’ typicality and offers insights into the nuanced role of lyrics in shaping musical preferences.",
