          "title": "One Decade Into the Replication Crisis, How Have Psychological Results Changed?",
          "authors": "Paul C. Bogdan",
          "abstract": "A psychology article’s p values say a lot about how its studies were conducted and whether its results are likely to replicate. Examining p values across the entire literature can, in turn, shed light on the state of psychology overall and how it has changed since the start of the replication crisis. In the present research, I investigate strong ( p &lt; .01) and weak (.01 ≤ p &lt; .05) p values reported across 240,355 empirical psychology articles from 2004 to 2024. Over this period and across every subdiscipline, the typical study has begun reporting markedly stronger p values. Nowadays, articles reporting strong p values are also more often published in top journals and receive more citations. Yet it also appears that robust research is still not correspondingly linked to career success given that researchers at the highest ranked universities tend to publish articles with the weakest p values. Investigating language usage suggests that two-thirds of this association can be explained by highly ranked universities preferring laborious, expensive, and subtle research topics even though these generally produce weaker results. Altogether, these findings point to the strength of most contemporary psychological research and suggest academic incentives have begun to promote such research. However, there remain key questions about the extent to which robustness is truly valued compared with other research aspects.",

          "authors": "Katharina Groskurth, Nivedita Bhaktha, Clemens M. Lechner",
          "abstract": "To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥ .950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest. Therefore, we propose a novel approach combining a Monte Carlo simulation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. This so-called simulation-cum-ROC approach generates tailored cutoffs and additionally identifies the most reliable fit indices in the setting of interest. We provide R code and a Shiny app for an easy implementation of the approach. No prior knowledge of Monte Carlo simulations or ROC analysis is needed to generate tailored cutoffs with the simulation-cum-ROC approach.",

          "abstract": "We present SingleMALD, a large-scale auditory lexical decision study in English with a fully crossed design. SingleMALD is freely available and includes over 2 million trials in which 40 native speakers of English responded to over 26,000 different words and over 9000 different pseudowords, each in 67 balanced sessions. SingleMALD features a large number of responses per stimulus, but a smaller number of participants, thus complementing the Massive Auditory Lexical Decision (MALD) dataset which features many listeners but fewer responses per stimulus. In the present report, we also use SingleMALD data to explore how extensive testing affects performance in the auditory lexical decision task. SingleMALD participants show signs of favoring speed over accuracy as the sessions unfold. Additionally, we find that the relationship between participant performance and two lexical predictors – word frequency and phonological neighborhood density – changes as sessions unfold, especially for certain lexical predictor values. We note that none of the changes are drastic, indicating that data collected from participants that have been extensively tested is usable, although we recommend accounting for participant experience with the task when performing statistical analyses of the data.",

          "abstract": "Visually observing a touch quickly reveals who is being touched, how it might feel, and the broader social or emotional context, shaping our interpretation of such interactions. Investigating these dimensions is essential for understanding how tactile experiences are processed individually and how we empathise with observed sensations in others. Here, we expand available resources for studying visually perceived touch by providing a wide-ranging set of dynamic interactions that specifically focus on the sensory qualities of touch. The Validated Touch-Video Database (VTD) consists of a set of 90 videos depicting tactile interactions with a stationary left hand, viewed from a first-person perspective. In each video, a second hand makes contact either directly (e.g., with fingers or an open palm) or using an object (e.g., a soft brush or scissors), with variations across dimensions such as hedonic qualities, arousal, threat, touch type, and the object used. Validation by 350 participants (283 women, 66 men, 1 non-binary) involved categorising the videos as ‘neutral’, ‘pleasant’, ‘unpleasant’, or ‘painful’ and rating arousal and threat levels. Our findings reveal high inter-subject agreement, with painful touch videos eliciting the highest arousal and threat ratings, while neutral touch videos serve as a baseline. Exploratory analyses indicate that women rated the videos as more threatening and painful than men, suggesting potential gender differences in the visual perception of negatively valenced touch stimuli. The VTD provides a comprehensive resource for researchers investigating the sensory and emotional dimensions of observed touch.",

          "abstract": "The constructive disruption hypothesis proposes that nonnormative-nonviolent protest tactics can persuade resistant advantaged groups to grant concessions by balancing disruption with constructive intentions. We extended this hypothesis from asymmetrical intergroup contexts to two issue-based domains ( N = 457), animal welfare activism (Study 1) and religious blasphemy protests (Study 2). Although protest tactics did not directly affect support among resistant participants, we revealed significant indirect pathways through constructive disruption. Constructive intentions consistently predicted increased support, while disruption enhanced support among resistant bystanders (Study 1) or all participants (Study 2), even for violent protests, but decreased support among those open to change (Study 1). Response surface analyses revealed that in animal rights protests, optimal support emerged from combining high constructive intentions with moderate disruption among resistant bystanders, while religious blasphemy protests showed predominantly additive effects. These findings suggest that constructive disruption’s effectiveness varies by context and audience characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Even in environments offering ample opportunities to interact with people from diverse backgrounds, people differ in their tendency to form intergroup friendships. Whereas some develop intergroup friendships, others prefer befriending ingroup members, contributing to prejudice and polarization. We identify open-mindedness—an inclination to engage with and understand different perspectives—as an individual difference predicting the racial, political, and socioeconomic diversity of real-world friendship networks. In a longitudinal study of 1,423 eighth–ninth graders, more open-minded adolescents developed more racially diverse friendship networks over 2 years. Two additional studies (total N = 1,585 adults) replicated and extended this finding: Open-mindedness predicted greater racial, political, and socioeconomic diversity of friends, and was more consistently associated with friendship diversity than Big Five openness to experience. The associations between open-mindedness and friendship diversity were partly explained by open-minded individuals’ lower avoidance of interaction with outgroup members. Building open-mindedness may be one individual-level approach to promote friendships across divides.",

          "abstract": "Influential campaigns in the United Kingdom and the United States have argued that same-language television subtitles may help children learn to read. In this study, we investigated the extent to which primary-school children pay attention to and read subtitles and whether this is related to their reading proficiency. We tracked the eye movements of 180 British children in Years 1 to 6 who watched videos with and without subtitles. Results showed that attention to subtitles was associated with reading proficiency: Superior readers were more likely to look at subtitles than less proficient readers and spent more time on them. When children looked at words in the subtitles, they showed evidence of reading them. We conclude that some degree of reading fluency may be necessary before children pay attention to subtitles. However, by the third or fourth year of reading instruction, most children read sufficiently quickly to follow same-language subtitles and potentially learn from them.",

          "abstract": "Absolute pitch (AP) enables its possessors to identify musical notes and keys by qualities of tone height and tone chroma. With advancing age, an unknown proportion of AP possessors perceives changes in these qualities, usually described as in the sharp direction and to the extent of a semitone or tone. The phenomenon is identified here as absolute pitch shift (APS). Using a cellphone-based tone generator, the writer conducted an N = 1 examination of the APS in his central musical range. The shift was greater at the centre of the range than at its extremes, causing him to perceive incoming tones as 1 to 4 semitones sharper than his recall of them in the A = 440 cps (concert pitch range). The report focusses on the comparative flatness of his AP memories of the tones, expressed with greater precision in cycles per second than by the names commonly given to their physical versions. The altered pitch perceptions are considered due to changes at the basilar membrane level in older individuals, and are labelled here as basilar AP. The internal pitch template’s role in memorising tone frequencies in the inner ear is labelled cortical AP. Implications are considered for further studies of AP and APS latency.",

          "authors": "Elise Cournoyer Lemaire, Christine Loignon, Chelsea Grothe, Marie Jauffret-Roustide, André Lemaître, Karine Bertrand",
          "abstract": "Homeless young adults with problematic psychoactive substance (PS) use face multiple challenges that compromise their well-being. Despite these challenges, few of them access psychosocial services and rather rely on personal resources to promote their own well-being. However, literature has been largely centered on their difficulties, leaving their strengths and capacities unknown. Despite this lack of knowledge, literature suggests that music is very important in the lives of young adults, especially because it helps them meet multiple well-being needs. The objective of this study was to describe and understand the perspectives of homeless young adults who experience problematic PS use on the ways music contributes to their well-being. Fifteen participants took part in semi-directed qualitative interviews that covered their experiences regarding the role of music in well-being. We also performed an iterative thematic analysis. Results highlight the marked importance of music for participants. Our study also demonstrates participants’ capacity to adapt their use of music to address the emotional, psychological, and social challenges they face. This study contributes to a better understanding of young adults’ use of music in promoting their global well-being and to the development of adapted outreach interventions that account for their capacities and interests.",

          "abstract": "Many people do not seek mental health support due to self-stigma; however, music can assist people in seeking support. Therefore, the present study explored how attending a focused music listening event might promote self-compassion and mindfulness and, in turn, how experiencing these might promote mental health help-seeking intentions. This case study focused on the Indigo Project’s Listen Up event, in which participants engage with a curated music playlist (drawing on soundtrack, ambient and experimental music) along with oral guidance provided by a psychologist. After attending Listen Up , participants ( N = 270, 85.90% female, M age = 37.05) completed an online survey, including their attendance motivations and standardised measures of mindfulness, self-compassion, self-stigma of help-seeking, and help-seeking intentions. A subset of 18 participants were subsequently interviewed about their experience. Results indicated that attendees experienced feelings of mindfulness and self-compassion, processed challenging emotions during the event, and were prompted to practice self-care and connect with others following the event. Additionally, participants experiencing mindfulness during the event buffered the relationship between self-stigma of help-seeking and future help-seeking intentions. Study findings have implications for our understanding of the ways that music and mindfulness can be used in practices to promote mental health and well-being.",
