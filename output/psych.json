          "authors": "Daphne Xin Hou, Stuti Thapa, Louis Tay",
          "abstract": "Past research on cross-cultural equivalence has focused on statistical procedures and techniques for ensuring measurement equivalence in tests and surveys. With the rise of big data and machine learning (ML), particularly natural language processing, researchers have powerful tools to study culture using large-scale, organic language data from social media. However, the lack of methodological guidance on how to establish cross-language equivalence in cross-cultural studies, especially with multilingual or culturally diverse text data, poses a major challenge. To address this gap, in this article, we propose a framework to raise awareness of key equivalence challenges and offer practical guidance for reducing measurement biases when applying ML techniques to social media language data. The framework outlines five types of equivalence following the ML pipeline from data collection to evaluation: source equivalence, sample equivalence, input equivalence, psychological-ground-truth equivalence, and model-performance equivalence. We also draw parallels to survey-based research to highlight shared conceptual challenges and identify future directions to advance cross-cultural research with big data and computational-linguistic methods.",

          "abstract": "Many herbal remedies lacking scientific support receive largely favorable media coverage, misleading consumers. To foster more thoughtful consumption, we developed an inoculation-based strategic intervention: a random news generator exposing media tactics like appeals to nature, tradition, availability, and pseudoscientific jargon. Its effectiveness was tested in three preregistered experiments. In a laboratory study ( N = 243), active use of the generator helped participants counter media strategies, with effects persisting for 11 days. A novel online active inoculation tool also reduced uncritical acceptance of herbal product reporting, intentions to use herbs for health, and trust in complementary and alternative medicine industries/media in both a student ( N = 439) and a community sample ( N = 452). The intervention was especially effective among experiential thinkers and those believing in extrasensory perception. Scalable and resource-efficient, this tool inoculates consumers against misleading media tactics and is adaptable for use across educational, media, and healthcare contexts.",

          "abstract": "Widespread narratives frame mental illness as a sign of inherent personal weakness—an alleged weakness that would permanently undermine people’s ability to pursue goals in life. Do these narratives have self-fulfilling consequences? To test this hypothesis, and to attain a practical way to support people in realizing their strengths, we developed a brief (~20 min), highly scalable exercise that highlights the strengths people show when contending with depression. Three experiments ( N total = 748) show that this depression-reframing-exercise enhanced the confidence of people who had experienced depression to pursue their goals in life, 0.30≤ d s ≤0.68 ( N s = 158, 419, and 171); and, over 2 weeks, the progress they reported making towards a valued personal goal by 49% (from 43% reported completion to 64%), d = 0.47 (Experiment 3). While default inherent-weakness-narratives harm goal pursuit among people with depression, efforts to reframe depression can help people with depression recognize and access their strengths.",

          "abstract": "Do individuals possess a “gaze fingerprint” that reveals how they uniquely look at the world? We tested this question by examining intra- and intersubject gaze similarity across 700 static pictures of complex natural scenes. Independent discovery ( n = 105) and replication data sets ( n = 46) of adults aged 18 to 50 years (sampled from Italy and Germany) revealed that gaze fingerprinting is possible at relatively high rates (e.g., 52%–63%) compared with chance (e.g., 1%–2%). We also identify gaze-fingerprint barcodes , which reveal a unique individualized code describing which stimuli an individual can be gaze-fingerprinted on. Preregistered longitudinal follow-up experiments have shown that gaze-fingerprint barcodes are nonrandom within an individual over short and long time fraframmes. Finally, we find that increased gaze fingerprintability for social stimuli is associated with decreased levels of autistic traits. To summarize, this work showcases the potential of gaze fingerprinting for isolating traitlike factors that may be of high neurodevelopmental and biological significance.",

          "abstract": "Pretending not to know requires appreciating how one would behave without a given piece of knowledge and acting accordingly. Here, two game-based experiments reveal a capacity to simulate decision-making under such counterfactual ignorance. English-speaking adults ( N = 1,001) saw the solution to a game (ship locations in Battleship, the hidden word in Hangman) but attempted to play as though they never had this information. Pretenders accurately mimicked broad aspects of genuine play, including the number of guesses required to reach a solution, as well as subtle patterns, such as the effects of decision uncertainty on decision time. Although peers were unable to detect pretense, statistical analysis and computational modeling uncovered traces of overacting in pretenders’ decisions, suggesting a schematic simulation of their minds. Opening up a new approach to studying self-simulation, our results reveal intricate metacognitive knowledge about decision-making, drawn from a rich—but simplified—internal model of cognition.",

          "abstract": "Metacognition involves second-order judgments about first-order judgments. It remains unclear whether an individual’s confidence in being correct is generated by the same system across tasks ( domain generality ) or whether it is computed independently in the context of each task ( domain specificity ). Previous studies have focused on correlations across several tasks, yet the evidence is mixed, and more complex models of domain generality were not taken into account. Analyzing data from 10 tasks collected across three studies in Denmark and Poland ( N = 253–547 adult participants), we found a fixed pattern of cross-task correlations for both metacognitive bias and metacognitive efficiency. In accordance with previous studies, we found that hierarchical estimation of metacognitive efficiency led to higher correlations. We used confirmatory factor analyses to investigate the existence of general processes. We found evidence for a weak domain generality with a metacognitive module for perceptual tasks and another for cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the complex dynamics underlying musical taste by examining five dimensions of musical taste through psychological, sociological, and music-analytical perspectives. By focusing on specific musical styles, the study aims to identify key factors that shape style-specific preferences. Data were collected from N = 844 participants through an online survey. Participants selected one of 17 musical styles they were most passionate about and completed five scales assessing factors influencing musical taste development, functions and situations of music listening, musical value judgments, and perceived musical dislikes. The data were analyzed using factor analyses to identify underlying dimensions, followed by a random forest classification to explore the importance of these factors for musical preferences across styles. The results highlight the role of social influences in shaping musical taste, particularly among punk, metal, and rock fans, while these factors were less relevant for classical and jazz enthusiasts. Identity expression and the relevance of lyrics were also pivotal for punk, metal, and rock fans, whereas pop and rap listeners frequently cited perceptions of mainstream appeal as a reason for rejection. This study underscores the multifaceted and style-specific nature of musical taste, advocating for an integrative approach by bridging psychological, sociological, and music-analytical perspectives.",

To provide an empirical framework and tools for future research, we examined the relevance of the participatory music engagement for mental well-being model for autistic adults. The model outlines four pathways through which music supports well-being: managing and expressing emotion, providing respite, facilitating self-development, and facilitating connections. Based on the model, we developed a new questionnaire, the Participatory Music Engagement for Mental Well-being (PaMEW), and collected responses from 63 autistic adults. We found that most respondents believed the items were relevant to their experiences of the relationship between music and well-being, that the factorial structure of their responses aligned with the model, and that their comments reflected the four pathways; however, they also highlighted nuances not addressed by the model. The study underscores the need for nuanced tools that reflect the unique ways autistic individuals use music to support their well-being, suggesting future revisions of PaMEW in collaboration with the autistic community to enhance its relevance and clarity.",

          "abstract": "This article describes the results of an exploratory action research project that sought to implement an intervention proposal entitled Promoting Self-regulated Musical Learning in Online Lessons (PSRL). This PSRL was developed in accordance with self-regulated learning theory and the corresponding premise that self-regulation can be activated directly through teacher instructions and indirectly by enriching the learning environment with pedagogical tools that facilitate student self-regulation. The PSRL contained two components: (1) a diagnostic approach, which aimed to understand just which self-regulation processes students deployed during practice, and (2) a training approach, which included teacher instructions and tools for self-regulation. In addition, this study explored an online learning environment tailored to activate and enhance self-regulated learning skills. Two cello students from a music education BA programme in Brazil participated in the project. The PSRL was implemented throughout 4 weeks in eight cycles of action. The findings indicate that a questioning approach and the indirect support of the online environment were associated with increased metacognitive reflection in the two students. Although the results cannot be generalized due to the small sample size, the study provides insights into teaching strategies that may support the development of students’ self-regulated musical practice habits in online lessons.",

          "abstract": "To practise effectively, musicians must engage in self-regulated learning (SRL) through a cyclical process of planning, execution, and reflection. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a new questionnaire that measures SRL in the context of music practice. We generated an item pool by adapting items from existing scales and revising them based on feedback from an expert panel. This pool was administered to 290 musicians, randomly split into Subsamples A and B. Exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) was carried out on Subsample A to create the final Self-Regulated Learning in Music Practice Self-Report Scale (SRL-MP-SRS), which consisted of 27 items distributed across five subscales. ESEM of the final model on Subsample B demonstrated a good fit. Internal consistency was acceptable for both the global scale and each of the subscales. The SRL-MP-SRS scores correlated positively with self-efficacy and deliberate practice, while professional musicians scored higher on the SRL-MP-SRS than students. The SRL-MP-SRS provides a valid and reliable way to measure musicians’ self-regulated practice that can be utilised with large samples, although further studies are needed to investigate its validity and limitations further.",
