          "authors": "Yuning Sun, Elaine L. Kinsella, Eric R. Igou",
          "abstract": "The prototype approach provides a theoretically supported basis for novel research, detailing “typical” cognitive representations of targets in question (e.g., groups, experiences). Fairly recently, in social and cognitive psychology, this approach has emerged to understand how people categorize and conceptualize everyday phenomena. Although this approach has previously been used to study everyday concepts, it has predominantly been overlooked in cross-cultural research. Prototype analyses are flexible enough to allow for the identification of both universal and culture-specific elements, offering a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the concept in question. We highlight theoretical, empirical, and practical reasons why prototype analyses offer an important tool in cross-cultural and interdisciplinary research while also addressing the potential for reducing construct bias in research that spans multiple cultural contexts. The advantages and risks of conducting prototype analyses are discussed in detail along with novel ways of integrating computational approaches with traditional prototype-analyses methods to assist in their implementation.",

          "authors": "Yoel Shilat, Avishai Henik, Hanit Galili, Shir Wasserman, Alon Salzmann, Moti Salti",
          "abstract": "The stimuli presented in cognitive experiments have a crucial role in the ability to isolate the underlying mechanism from other interweaved mechanisms. New ideas aimed at unveiling cognitive mechanisms are often realized through introducing new stimuli. This, in turn, raises challenges in reconciling results to literature. We demonstrate this challenge in the field of numerical cognition. Stimuli used in this field are designed to present quantity in a non symbolic manner. Physical properties, such as surface area and density, inherently correlate with quantity, masking the mechanism underlying numerical perception. Different generation methods (GMs) are used to control these physical properties. However, the way a GM controls physical properties affects numerical judgments in different ways, compromising comparability and the pursuit of cumulative science. Here, using a novel data-driven approach, we provide a methodological review of non symbolic stimuli GMs developed since 2000. Our results reveal that the field thrives and that a wide variety of GMs are tackling new methodological and theoretical ideas. However, the field lacks a common language and means to integrate new ideas into the literature. These shortcomings impair the interpretability, comparison, replication, and reanalysis of previous studies that have considered new ideas. We present guidelines for GMs relevant also to other fields and tasks involving perceptual decisions, including (a) defining controls explicitly and consistently, (b) justifying controls and discussing their implications, (c) considering stimuli statistical features, and (d) providing complete stimuli set, matching responses, and generation code. We hope these guidelines will promote the integration of findings and increase findings’ explanatory power.",

Currently, there is no method for online monitoring phases of pupil size fluctuation. We introduce rtPupilPhase —an open-source software that automatically detects trends in pupil size in real time. This tool enables novel applications of real-time pupillometry for achieving numerous research and translational goals. We validated the performance of rtPupilPhase on human, rodent, and monkey pupil data, and we propose future implementations of real-time pupillometry.",

          "abstract": "Most current databases for bodily emotion expression are created in Western countries, resulting in culturally skewed representations. To address the obvious risk this bias poses to academic comprehension, we attempted to expand the current repertoire of human bodily emotions by recruiting Asian professional performers to wear whole-body suits with 57 retroreflective markers attached to major joints and body segments, and express seven basic emotions with whole-body movements in a motion-capture lab. For each emotion, actors performed three self-created scenarios that covered a broad range of real-life events to elicit the target emotion within 2–5 seconds. Subsequently, a separate group of participants was invited to judge the perceived emotional category from the extracted biological motions (point-light displays with 18 or 57 markers). The results demonstrated that the emotion discrimination accuracy was comparable to Western databases containing standardized performance scenarios. The results provide a significant step toward establishing a database using a novel emotional induction approach based on personalized scenarios. This database will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of emotional expression across diverse contexts.",

          "authors": "Małgorzata Kossowska, Hoi-Wing Chan, Ying Yi Hong, Ewa Szumowska",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the longitudinal effects of aiding war refugees on perceptions of intergroup threat and the prospective fear of being affected by military conflict. We hypothesized that engaging in helping behaviors directed towards refugees would prompt individuals to perceive these actions as serving vital self-functions (i.e., satisfying basic psychological needs), which, in turn, could potentially mitigate the intergroup threat perceived in relation to the refugees while amplifying the prospective fear of potential warfare. Data were collected over three waves of a panel study during the initial 2 months of the refugee crisis in Poland arising from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Our findings reveal that providing assistance to war refugees at Time 1 resulted in greater perceived personal benefits of helping at Time 2. This enhanced perceived functionality of helping subsequently predicted diminished intergroup refugee threat perceptions (both realistic and symbolic), but also heightened fear levels concerning the potential impact of war at Time 3. These results were consistent across models accounting for lagged-1 and more stringent lagged-2 autoregressive effects. Importantly, the observed temporal relationships regarding realistic threat and fear of war were less robust against individual difference factors. These findings enrich the ongoing discourse on the impacts of aiding individuals fleeing conflict zones and how beliefs about the purpose of such means of assistance shape constructive intergroup relations.",

          "abstract": "The state’s monopoly on sovereignty can be challenged by criminal systems capable of gaining legitimacy within communities. Understanding the psychological basis of such legitimacy requires broadening traditional conceptualizations of authority to consider how it operates without legal backing and outside formal channels. This research introduces the Legitimacy of Secret Power (L-SP) Scale, a tool measuring individuals’ appraisal of illegal groups’ power. We validated L-SP through three studies ( N total = 3,173). Findings demonstrate a reliable, 20-item mono-factorial structure. Study 3 tested L-SP’s measurement invariance in the UK, Italy, Japan, and the US. Across studies, L-SP correlated with support for illegality, ideologies of masculine honor, and social dominance. It was inversely related to the perceived national threat of criminal groups, democratic attitudes, and police legitimacy. Notably, L-SP predicted individuals’ willingness to report criminal groups independently of their fear of these groups or perceptions of police legitimacy. Theoretical implications and future directions are discussed.",

          "authors": "Mehrgol Tiv, Cody Spence",
          "abstract": "We examined whether exposure to context diversity in one domain relates to mental associations in another social domain. County-level metrics of racial diversity and segregation computed from restricted-use U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data were linked to a geolocated measure of sexual orientation implicit bias from over 825,000 respondents across the United States (2015–2021). Multilevel models revealed that living in more racially diverse counties was related to less stereotypic implicit associations of sexual orientation, and this relationship was moderated by racial segregation. This primary result was evaluated through a series of robustness checks. Weighted models accounting for the nonrepresentative nature of the sample revealed a robust association with diversity but not an interaction with segregation. The negative relationship with diversity was also replicated on a different Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit attitudes to disability, but the interaction with segregation was again insignificant. These results support the hypothesis that exposure to social diversity in one domain can generalize to intergroup attitudes in another domain. These results also highlight the dynamic interaction between an individual and their social environment, bolstering the need for socially contextualized research on human cognition.",

          "abstract": "This study theorizes a nativist bias in interpersonal advice seeking within organizations and empirically assesses its effects. Extending the existing discrimination and social networks research, I argue that the effects of nativism—a bias against foreigners—in advice seeking and other network relations cannot be validly inferred from native/nonnative outcome inequalities. Instead, the effects of nativism in social networks are revealed in natives’ asymmetric behaviors and attitudes that disadvantage nonnatives. It is hypothesized that, other things being equal, natives seek task-related advice across the nativity divide less frequently than nonnatives do. In another manifestation of nativism, native advice seeking targets perceive nonnatives who seek their advice as less competent than those nonnatives who do not seek their advice. Consistent evidence of these patterns was found in four separate networks of working professionals. These findings have implications for the study of discriminatory biases in social networks and for countering such biases in organizational and educational settings.",

Can people selectively respond to reputational cues relevant to the task at hand? Across three studies, we examined how people weigh cues about helpfulness and competence when forming expectations about strangers’ behavior. Using adapted investment games, we varied whether a stranger’s helpfulness or competence predicted participants’ future payoffs. We found that when helpfulness is task-relevant (Experiments 1 and 2), participants correctly use this cue in investment decisions. When competence matters most (Experiment 3), participants use it as the primary cue. Overall, a high reputation for outcome-irrelevant characteristics did not compensate for a low reputation for the outcome-relevant reputational cue. However, we also find an asymmetric spillover: Decision-makers prefer cooperating with others who are highly competent and highly helpful, regardless of task demands. We discuss our results within the theoretical framework of person perception and theories of reputation.",

          "abstract": "In this article, the impact of three experimental parameters in a harmonic expectancy study are evaluated: stimulus duration (specifically the lead-in time prior to an unexpected event), ecological validity of the stimulus (original recording vs. piano only), and familiarity. This article also presents a novel experimental paradigm for detecting expectancy violations in a real-time listening context with increased ecological validity, as well as a novel quasi-blind stimulus-selection procedure. Results suggest that the importance of the ecological validity of the stimulus may depend on the population of the study (i.e., musicians or non-musicians), and that the role of familiarity ought to be more rigorously examined. Specifically, it appears that the ability to notice a harmonic expectancy violation may be modulated by the degree of prior familiarity with the stimulus. In addition, stimuli with longer lead-in times lead to an increase in the probability of marking a harmonically surprising event. Implications for expectancy-violation theory, computational modeling, prediction error theory, and general stimulus-selection procedures in music perception and cognition research are discussed.",
