          "title": "Language Models Accurately Infer Correlations Between Psychological Items and Scales From Text Alone",
          "authors": "Björn E. Hommel, Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "Many behavioral scientists do not agree on core constructs and how they should be measured. Different literatures measure related constructs, but the connections are not always obvious to readers and meta-analysts. Many measures in behavioral science are based on agreement with survey items. Because these items are sentences, computerized language models can make connections between disparate measures and constructs and help researchers regain an overview over the rapidly growing, fragmented literature. Our fine-tuned language model, the SurveyBot3000, accurately predicts the correlations between survey items, the reliability of aggregated measurement scales, and intercorrelations between scales from item positions in semantic vector space. We measured the model’s performance as the convergence between its synthetic model estimates and empirical coefficients observed in human data. In our pilot study, the out-of-sample accuracy was .71 for item correlations, .89 for reliabilities, and .89 for scale correlations. In our preregistered validation study using novel items, the out-of-sample accuracy was slightly reduced to .59 for item correlations, .84 for reliabilities, and .84 for scale correlations. The synthetic item correlations showed an average prediction error of .17, and there were larger errors for middling correlations. Predictions exhibited generalizability beyond the training data and across various domains, with some variability in accuracy. Our work shows language models can reliably predict psychometric relationships between survey items, enabling researchers to evaluate new measures against existing scales, reduce redundancy in measurement, and work toward a more unified behavioral-science taxonomy.",

          "authors": "Xiang Wang, Keli Yin",
          "abstract": "In uncertain situations, people perform physical actions through rituals to attract good fortune. Five experiments ( N = 725) investigated the impacts of rituals, uncertainty, physical actions, and psychological distance on luck perception. Experiments 1A–1C examined whether performing rituals under uncertain situations influenced luck perceptions. The results showed that performing rituals increased the feeling of luck only under conditions of uncertainty, and not certainty. Experiment 2 compared the equivalent roles of different ritual movements (pulling versus pushing) and tested the mediating role of psychological distance in different rituals affecting luck perception. Experiment 3 illustrated that pulling actions increased the feeling of luck even without the ritual attribute, whereas pushing actions did not, thus explaining the mediation mechanism. Our research proposed new functions of rituals in enhancing luck perceptions and their psychological mechanisms and underscored the role of uncertain situations and actions in rituals that influence luck perceptions.",

          "abstract": "Five studies (total valid N = 1,781, primarily young adults from China, with one study involving residents of the United States) were conducted to investigate the link between relationship modes (exchange vs. communal) and meaning in life. Study 1 revealed significant associations among relationship modes, dehumanization, and meaning in life. Studies 2, 3a, and 3b showed that the priming of an exchange (vs. communal) mode led to lower meaning in life, with this effect mediated by the experience of dehumanization. Moreover, Study 3a also found that individuals with higher (vs. lower) relational-interdependent self-construal were more prone to feel dehumanized in exchange relationships. In Study 4, a causal relation between the experience of dehumanization and meaning in life was confirmed through a manipulation of dehumanization. The studies illustrate how relationship modes may influence our existence as human beings and shed light on the improvement of human experience and meaning in life.",

          "abstract": "Research involving self-report methods risks volunteer bias, which can undermine validity by attracting particular participant types. What is the risk of such bias when participants choose studies on online recruitment platforms? The current study (Study 1: N = 1,595; M age = 28.45; Study 2: N = 2,777; M age = 31.18) examined volunteer bias in online studies, using the context of recruiting individuals for singlehood and romantic relationship research. Participants were recruited via Prolific for a study about “people’s lifestyles,” or “singlehood [or romantic relationships] and people’s lifestyles.” We assessed and compared their demographics, individual differences, feelings about singlehood/partnership, and well-being. No consistent differences emerged across recruitment framings, suggesting that advertisement wording did not selectively attract distinct Prolific participants. These data support one aspect of the validity of online singlehood and relationship research, suggesting that low-effort studies conducted on online platforms may suffer less from volunteer bias than other research recruitment strategies.",

          "abstract": "The principle of impartial beneficence (IB) holds that we should strive to maximize others’ well-being regardless of their relationship to us. But does endorsement of IB in principle translate to more uniform concern for others irrespective of relationship type? Three pre-registered studies in online samples of U.S. participants (total N =1,716) found IB endorsement predicts greater and more uniform concern for others across social relationships varying in social distance: in care prescriptions (Study 1), as well as blame judgments (Study 2) and guilt expressions (Study 3) when care norms are violated or care is not provided. Heightened concern for others in socially distant relationships was not “offset” by less concern for those in close ones. IB was not associated with a motive to be generally admired, but was linked to a motive to form communal relationships. Across different types of moral judgments, a commitment to IB thus entails caring much more than average about the well-being of socially distant others, while maintaining a high level of concern for socially close ones.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental underlying question about the nature of overconfidence has continued to be subject to scholarly dispute: Is overconfidence a genuine psychological trait? To advance this contested research topic, we engaged in an adversarial collaboration in which two research teams agreed upon a set of critical tests and preregistered their analyses and predictions prior to data collection. Our study ( N = 942; U.S. adults from CloudConnect) leverages a methodological innovation: To measure trait overconfidence absent task-related confounds, we developed a set of novel tasks in which performance is ostensibly random. When we assess confidence this way, we find robust relationships across tasks as measured by both confirmatory factor analyses and raw correlations. This indicates that some people do believe that they are able to perform relatively well on tasks even when there is little reason for that confidence. Our results support the claim that overconfidence might be a trait.",

          "authors": "Konstantinos Giannos, Emilios Cambouropoulos",
          "abstract": "Harmonic expectations are actively connected with the syntactic and asymmetric organisation of Western tonal harmony. Their violation has been associated with concepts such as tension, surprise, completeness, or harmonic relatedness and coherence, among others. The aim of this study is to examine whether the violation of expected chord directionality is related to perceived consonance/dissonance (C/D) of entire short chord sequences, focusing on the impact of horizontal manipulations, whilst maintaining identical the vertical content (average C/D of the chords comprising a short sequence). We conducted two experiments, with chord progressions presented in an original and retrograde arrangement. Their harmonic content ranged from strictly diatonic and tonal to highly chromatic or 12-tone. Participants reported the perceived consonance/dissonance of each sequence. Findings suggest that chord directionality indeed affects C/D evaluation in tonal sequences as opposed to atonal sequences. In addition, chord directionality appears to play hardly any role when a clear tonal hierarchy is missing, that is, in the absence of a perfect cadence that unambiguously points to a specific tonal centre of equilibrium and closure. Cadences (related to closure effects) are privileged compared with other harmonic progressions as an influencing factor to consonance perception. Voice leading appears to have some influence in such evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated an audio-visual integration effect in supraliminal music-induced emotions. This study explores the effect of visual information on subliminal music-induced emotion and the audio-visual integration effect in subliminal music using combined behavioral and physiological measures. We introduced supraliminal and subliminal visual information to investigate their influence on subliminal music-induced emotion. The results indicate that, compared with audio-only presentation, audio-visual congruent presentation leads to a more intense emotional response, as evidenced by reduced heart rates and skin temperature. The differences in audio-visual congruence were more pronounced for positive music than for negative music, as indicated by reduced heart rates and skin temperature, along with increased alpha and beta power in the prefrontal cortex. In summary, the results suggest that audio-visual integration for subliminal music occurs with both supraliminal and subliminal visual information. Furthermore, positive subliminal music strengthens the perception of congruence between visual and auditory cues.",

          "authors": "Caroline Curwen",
          "abstract": "Musically evoked narrative imaginings (MENI) are mental stories that listeners construct in response to shifts in musical features such as dynamics, tempo, and timbre. Event segmentation – the cognitive process of identifying transitions in continuous stimuli – shapes these narratives. In music-colour synaesthesia (MCS), sounds involuntarily evoke colours and visual forms, offering perceptual anchors that may enhance event segmentation and narrative coherence. This article presents a novel theoretical framework integrating ideasthesia – the view that synaesthetic experiences are conceptually mediated rather than purely sensory-driven – with event segmentation theory to explain how MCS shapes MENI. It argues that synaesthetic percepts align with musical transitions to increase segmentation precision, strengthen narrative continuity, and deepen emotional and thematic engagement. Rather than treating MCS as an isolated phenomenon, it is situated within a broader continuum of music cognition and narrative construction, suggesting it magnifies processes shared across listeners. This perspective calls for further research into how multimodal mental imagery influences music perception, emotional response, and memory for musical narratives.",
