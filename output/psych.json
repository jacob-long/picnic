          "abstract": "In what aspects do replication studies differ from their primary studies? This question is central for providing insights into the reasons for the nonreplicability of psychological effects. So far, research on potential explanations for the nonreplicability of effects has mainly focused on publication bias and methodological challenges related to measurement error or statistical inference. The recently developed causal-replication framework directs attention toward controlling for differences in study characteristics, including variations in treatment conditions, outcome measures, recruitment, causal estimates, time, location, population, and setting. To contribute to this aim, we conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the design practices of current replication studies. We preregistered the assessment of study characteristics in a detailed review protocol and investigated the available information and intended or unintended variations across primary and replication studies. To do this, we compiled a database of studies that aimed to replicate a causal effect of a clearly stated primary study and that were published in impactful social- and cognitive-psychological journals between January 2017 and August 2022. Our review results highlight that compared with the primary study, authors of replication studies predominantly focus on controlling specific study characteristics in (i.e., methods, procedures, analysis) while often neglecting other study characteristics, such as population or setting. Furthermore, the results indicate that in most replication studies, multiple study characteristics are varied in the study comparison or are insufficiently reported. Accordingly, we discuss prevalent variations, reporting standards, and strategies for planning future replication studies.",

          "title": "On the Statistical Analysis of Studies With Attention Checks",
          "authors": "Maya B. Mathur",
          "abstract": "Attention checks are often used to identify and exclude participants who may be responding carelessly. There has been little statistical guidance on the analysis of such studies and on when it is indeed valid to simply exclude inattentive participants. To address this, I first formalize attention checks as measures intended to identify participants whose responses are free of measurement error. Measurement error could arise not only because of careless responding but also if some participants fail to receive the experimental manipulation in its intended form because they did not attend to its contents. I discuss the statistical assumptions under which it is valid to simply exclude inattentive participants. In randomized experiments, this standard analysis may lead to bias if (a) the dependent variable affects attentiveness or (b) there are variables that affect both attentiveness and the dependent variable. The latter assumption is stringent and is likely to be violated in many studies. I suggest a straightforward modification to the standard approach, that is, controlling for variables that affect both attentiveness and the dependent variable. This covariate-adjusted approach requires considerably less stringent assumptions. In two worked examples, I reanalyze previously published experiments on (a) a documentary intended to reduce consumption of meat and animal products and (b) flag-priming effects on political conservatism.",

          "title": "Thinking Clearly About Age, Period, and Cohort Effects",
          "authors": "Julia M. Rohrer",
          "abstract": "Psychological researchers are interested in how things change over time and routinely make claims about age effects (e.g., personality maturation), cohort effects (e.g., generational differences in narcissism), and sometimes, period effects (e.g., secular trends in mental health). The age-period-cohort identification problem means that these claims are not possible based on the data alone: Any possible temporal pattern can be explained by an infinite number of combinations of age, period, and cohort effects. This concern holds regardless of the study design (it also applies to longitudinal designs covering multiple cohorts) and the number of observations available (it also applies if researchers observe the whole population). Researchers usually rely on statistical models that impose constraints to pick one specific decomposition of effects. Unfortunately, these constraints often remain opaque, resulting in a lack of scrutiny of the underlying assumptions. How can researchers reason more transparently and systematically about age, period, and cohort? Here, I summarize advances in the understanding of the precise nature of the identification problem, provide an overview of ways to move forward, and highlight one approach that is particularly transparent about assumptions: bounding analysis, a framework developed by sociologists Ethan Fosse and Christopher Winship. To illustrate this approach, I analyze how age, period, and cohort affect attitudes toward working mothers in the German General Social Survey.",

          "abstract": "Evidence supporting the interaction between cognitive and motor processes is increasing. Conventional approaches to analyze balance control aggregate sway data over seconds up to minutes, which presents a challenge in discerning the impact of single cognitive processes on balance control. In this paper, we propose a novel, event-related approach to investigate how cognitive task performance affects balance control on small time scales using a force plate. A force plate continuously measures forces and moments in each spatial dimension over time. To facilitate the processing of the resulting time-series data, we developed an R-package called . This package segments the data so that each trial, corresponding to a cognitive task, has its own time-series data. A low-pass filter can be applied to remove artifacts (e.g., muscle twitches or electrical noise), and a baseline correction can be performed to improve the comparability of trials. For each trial’s time-series data, user-defined descriptive statistics (e.g., mean or standard deviation) can be calculated for user-defined time bins around an event (e.g., stimulus or response onset). The package generates a dataset with one or more measures per trial (depending on the number of time bins) that can be used for further analysis, such as a (mixed-effects) analysis of variance. The R-package and the described underlying procedure aim to establish a standard to process force-plate data collected in the context of cognitive experiments for the event-related approach. This facilitates the processing of force-plate data and enhances comparability between studies.",

          "abstract": "Social virtual reality (VR) setups allow two or more individuals to interact in a shared virtual environment while embodying computerized avatars. Such setups allow for detailed investigations into social-cognitive processes, can extend the functionality of existing single-user VR applications and can be used to design novel educational settings and psychotherapeutic treatments. While researchers may use commercially available social VR applications in addressing a range of research questions, an in-house software solution is typically developed when a research project requires more flexible experimental control or should conform to the highest data security standards. This tutorial demonstrates the construction of a social VR application based on an example software that mimics a VR setup but can be run and explored on an individual computer. Information flow emphasizes transparency to allow researchers to flexibly adapt the software to their own environment and research demands. The software is designed for use in controlled laboratory environments but can be extended for use in field research.",

          "abstract": "The problem: wearable eye trackers deliver eye-tracking data on a scene video that is acquired by a camera affixed to the participant’s head. Analyzing and interpreting such head-centered data is difficult and laborious manual work. Automated methods to map eye-tracking data to a world-centered reference frame (e.g., screens and tabletops) are available. These methods usually make use of fiducial markers. However, such mapping methods may be difficult to implement, expensive, and eye tracker-specific. The solution: here we present gazeMapper, an open-source tool for automated mapping and processing of eye-tracking data. gazeMapper can: (1) Transform head-centered data to planes in the world, (2) synchronize recordings from multiple participants, (3) determine data quality measures, e.g., accuracy and precision. gazeMapper comes with a GUI application (Windows, macOS, and Linux) and supports 11 different wearable eye trackers from AdHawk, Meta, Pupil, SeeTrue, SMI, Tobii, and Viewpointsystem. It is also possible to sidestep the GUI and use gazeMapper as a Python library directly.",

          "abstract": "Are scientific papers providing all essential details necessary to ensure the replicability of study protocols? Are authors effectively conveying study design, data analysis, and the process of drawing inferences from their results? These represent only a fraction of the pressing questions that cognitive psychology and neuropsychology face in addressing the “crisis of confidence.” This crisis has highlighted numerous shortcomings in the journey from research to publication. To address these shortcomings, we introduce PECANS (Preferred Evaluation of Cognitive And Neuropsychological Studies), a comprehensive checklist tool designed to guide the planning, execution, evaluation, and reporting of experimental research. PECANS emerged from a rigorous consensus-building process through the Delphi method. We convened a panel of international experts specialized in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology research practices. Through two rounds of iterative voting and a proof-of-concept phase, PECANS evolved into its final form. The PECANS checklist is intended to serve various stakeholders in the fields of cognitive sciences and neuropsychology, including: (i) researchers seeking to ensure and enhance reproducibility and rigor in their research; (ii) journal editors and reviewers assessing the quality of reports; (iii) ethics committees and funding agencies; (iv) students approaching methodology and scientific writing. PECANS is a versatile tool intended not only to improve the quality and transparency of individual research projects but also to foster a broader culture of rigorous scientific inquiry across the academic and research community.",

          "abstract": "The E ye movements on M achine-generated Te xts C orpus (EMTeC) is a naturalistic eye-movements-while-reading corpus of 107 native English speakers reading machine-generated texts. The texts are generated by three large language models using five different decoding strategies, and they fall into six different text-type categories. EMTeC entails the eye movement data at all stages of pre-processing, i.e., the raw coordinate data sampled at 2000 Hz, the fixation sequences, and the reading measures. It further provides both the original and a corrected version of the fixation sequences, accounting for vertical calibration drift. Moreover, the corpus includes the language models’ internals that underlie the generation of the stimulus texts: the transition scores, the attention scores, and the hidden states. The stimuli are annotated for a range of linguistic features both at text and at word level. We anticipate EMTeC to be utilized for a variety of use cases such as, but not restricted to, the investigation of reading behavior on machine-generated text and the impact of different decoding strategies; reading behavior on different text types; the development of new pre-processing, data filtering, and drift correction algorithms; the cognitive interpretability and enhancement of language models; and the assessment of the predictive power of surprisal and entropy for human reading times.

Here we present TittaLSL, a toolbox that enables creating networked multi-participant experiments using Tobii eye trackers with minimal programming effort. An evaluation using 600-Hz gaze streams sent between 15 different eye-tracking stations revealed that the end-to-end latency, including the eye tracker’s gaze estimation processes, achieved by TittaLSL was 3.05 ms. This was only 0.10 ms longer than when gaze samples were received from a locally connected eye tracker. We think that these latencies are low enough that TittaLSL is suitable for the majority of networked eye-tracking experiments, even when the gaze needs to be shown in real time.",

          "abstract": "Numerous language models propose a critical role of auditory short-term memory in spoken language processing, making reliable estimations of individual listeners’ memory capacities essential in linguistic research. Although a variety of cognitive tasks exist for assessing both visual and auditory short-term capacities in a laboratory environment (e.g., digit span), these types of tasks are typically not engaging for the participant. In the current study, we assess the validity and reliability of a novel “gamified” short-term memory assessment tool called Sandwich Builder . In Sandwich Builder , the participant completes 12 trials of a sandwich-building game. In each trial, a drive-thru customer’s sandwich order is presented auditorily, including a list of 1 to 10 sandwich ingredients (e.g., salami, cheddar cheese, mayo, and olives). The participant needs to remember these sandwich ingredients and then build the customer’s sandwich by selecting the necessary ingredients in the correct order. We evaluate Sandwich Builder as an estimate of auditory short-term memory, finding significant correlations with other classic short-term memory measures. Additionally, we measure affect (i.e., mood), fatigue, and motivation following Sandwich Builder as compared to classic tasks: Participants leave Sandwich Builder in a better mood, less fatigued, and more motivated than they leave other memory tasks. Sandwich Builder shows strong convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity, and moderate-to-good test–retest reliability. Finally, we examine the practicality of Sandwich Builder as a measure of individual differences in speech perception research, providing expected power curves for two common paradigms. Altogether, we robustly demonstrate the utility of Sandwich Builder , which is openly available online.",

The English tests were multiple-choice tests based on meaning recognition and consisted of a total of 150 items. From these, we were able to create two Spanish tests with 37 questions each. We constructed and validated the tests in two separate studies, including another established vocabulary test (Lextale-Esp, based on form recognition), general knowledge tests, and a test for reading comprehension. Two online studies with 161 and 196 participants confirmed that both vocabulary tests have reliability above .75 (.86 when combined) and correlate more highly with general knowledge and reading comprehension than Lextale-Esp. This shows that test translation is an efficient way to find useful items for language tests in different languages.

          "abstract": "The gambler’s fallacy is typically defined as the false belief that a random event is less likely to occur if it has occurred recently. Although forms of this fallacy have been documented numerous times, past work either has not actually measured probabilistic predictions but rather point predictions or used sequences that were not independent. To address these problems, we conducted a series of high-powered, preregistered studies in which we asked 750 adult Amazon Mechanical Turk workers from the United States to report probabilistic predictions for truly independent sequences. In contrast to point predictions, which generated a significant gambler’s fallacy, probabilistic predictions were not found to lead to a gambler’s fallacy. Moreover, the point predictions could not be reconstructed by sampling from the probability judgments. This suggests that the gambler’s fallacy originates at the decision stage rather than in probabilistic reasoning, as posited by several leading theories. New theories of the gambler’s fallacy may be needed to explain these findings.",
