          "authors": "Eleanor J. Junkins, Jaime Derringer",
          "abstract": "In this tutorial, we suggest ways to improve current practices for measuring gender identity, sexual orientation, and demographics about relationships based on previous datasets and a newly collected survey of people’s behavior and perceptions of alternative-response formats. We apply lessons learned from racial identity/ethnicity to suggest broader principles of improving demographic measurement. We offer guides to meet the expectations of diverse stakeholders, including participants. The response options we recommend were curated to balance global identities and emerging trends to be applicable for online international research and in-person psychology research conducted primarily by U.S. institutions. We also offer practical suggestions for researchers to handle more complex data, including multiselect response options, which tend to be preferred by participants. Improved demographic data allow researchers to more fully capture multidimensional and complex social identities that are related to social inequities. In sum, the current tutorial is a guide to and discussion about challenges in collecting demographic data on social identities in which we use illustrative data to address important points related to measuring gender, sexuality, and relational demographics, specifically.",

          "title": "Meeting the Bare Minimum: Quality Assessment of Idiographic Temporal Networks Using Power Analysis and Predictive-Accuracy Analysis",
          "authors": "Yong Zhang, Jordan Revol, Ginette Lafit, Anja F. Ernst, Josip Razum, Eva Ceulemans, Laura F. Bringmann",
          "abstract": "The network theory of psychopathology inspired clinicians and researchers to use idiographic networks to study how symptoms of an individual interact over time, hoping to find the target symptom(s) for intervention to most effectively break this self-sustaining network. These networks are often based on the vector-autoregressive (VAR) model and rely on intensive longitudinal data collected in patients’ daily lives. Nowadays, one major challenge these networks are faced with is that they are used without sufficient quality assessments. Because VAR-based temporal networks are complex and highly parameterized, they can easily face problems of low statistical power and overfitting, especially when the time series available is short. In this study, we review existing idiographic-network studies with a focus on the number of variables and time points used in the analysis and show that the “big network, short time series” problem is prevalent. As potential solutions, we propose two simulation-based methods that aim to find the optimal number of time points to be collected: power analysis and predictive-accuracy analysis. Two applications of both methods are demonstrated: (a) “a priori”—informing the sample-size planning of future network studies and (b) “retrospective”—evaluating whether the sample size of existing network studies was large enough to avoid problems of low statistical power and overfitting. Results confirmed the observation that the sample sizes in past network studies are often insufficient, suggesting that findings of existing network studies should be critically assessed. Future idiographic-network studies are thus strongly advised to make more guided decisions on sample size using the proposed methods.",

          "authors": "Jens H. Fünderich, Lukas J. Beinhauer, Frank Renkewitz",
          "abstract": "Data from rating scales underlie very specific restrictions: They have a lower limit, an upper limit, and they only consist of a few integers. These characteristics produce particular dependencies between means and standard deviations. A mean that is a non-integer, for example, can never be associated with zero variability, while a mean equal to one of the scale’s limits can only be associated with zero variability. The relationship can be described by umbrella plots for which we present a formalization. We use that formalization to explore implications for statistical power and for the relationship between heterogeneity in unstandardized and standardized effect sizes. The analysis illustrates that power is not only affected by the mean difference and sample size, but also by the position of a mean within the respective scale. Further, the umbrella restrictions of rating scales can impede interpretability of meta-analytic heterogeneity. Estimations of relative heterogeneity can diverge between unstandardized and standardized effects, raising questions about which of the two patterns of heterogeneity we would want to explain (for example, through moderators). We reanalyze data from the Many Labs projects to illustrate the issue and finally discuss the implications of our observations as well as ways to utilize these properties of rating scales. To facilitate in-depth exploration and practical application of our formalization, we developed the Shiny Umbrellas app, which is publicly available at https://www.apps.meta-rep.lmu.de/shiny_umbrellas/ .",

          "abstract": "Girls report lower belonging in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) than boys, which may carry costs for girls’ later STEM participation. We hypothesized that being socially included within a STEM context supports feelings of belonging—which then contributes to stronger intentions to pursue STEM, especially for girls. To investigate, we recruited girls and boys (N = 1,330; Mdn age = 12; 41% White, 35% East Asian) attending week-long Canadian STEM summer camps. We gathered precamp and postcamp STEM intentions (fit and interest), plus postcamp objective social inclusion and subjective belonging (with distinct metrics computed for female vs. male peers). Consistent with previous findings, girls had lower STEM intentions than boys. In addition, we found that, for girls, being more socially included (particularly by male peers) was associated with stronger STEM intentions, mediated by subjective belonging. For boys, social inclusion (via belonging) was less predictive of STEM intentions. These results highlight how childhood friendships may impact early intentions to pursue STEM education and careers, especially for girls.",

          "abstract": "Four studies examine whether demographic forms elicit social identity threat and institutional exclusion for Latine Americans before and after the 2020 Presidential election and leading up to the 2024 election. Using a mock-Census form and widely used ethnicity/racial designations, we manipulated the framing of Latine identity through a two-item (category listed separately) versus a single-item (combined) format, and also varied the inclusion of a citizenship question. Overall, Latine Americans who completed a two-item versus a single-item mock-Census form experienced greater social identity threat, institutional exclusion (e.g., threatened belonging), more negative external perceptions of Latine Americans, and lower Latine and American identification. Reactions to the citizenship question were particularly attenuated by study timepoint and sociopolitical context but also revealed a concern over confirming negative stereotypes about Latine Americans related to immigration and citizenship status. Results suggest Latine Americans face identity threat through demographic forms, and this may affect their sense of belonging within the United States.",

          "abstract": "Maximizers, as opposed to satisficers, are defined as decision-makers who consider many alternatives to make the best choice. We adopted records in Taobao (the largest e-commerce platform in China) in 2022 to quantify individual maximization strategy inclination (the number of within-subcategory items that a consumer account considers prior to a first-time purchase). Using this index, we examined whether real-world behaviors in Taobao could be explained by three aspects of theories suggested by previous studies on maximizers, namely, pre-purchase decision paralysis, post-purchase regret (maximization paradox), and the Sisyphus effect. The results revealed that maximizers (vs. non-maximizers) are more likely to end decision-making processes with abandonment, rely on their evaluations instead of those of others, ruminate alternatives even after decisions, retract decisions, and express dissatisfaction about decisions. When evaluating options for the second time, maximizers even construct a larger candidate option set. Most between-person effects remained significant after controlling within-person variations.",

          "abstract": "Punishment is a critical mechanism through which society regulates behavior, yet its efficacy depends on how observers interpret the legitimacy of punishers. Across five experiments, we examine how moral agreement with punished acts shapes perceptions of punishers’ legitimacy and willingness to obey laws. Experiment 1 finds that when observers morally agree with punished acts, they perceive punishers as less legitimate and report lower willingness to obey laws. Experiment 2 shows that this effect extends to compliance with a new, specific law introduced by the punishing authority. Experiment 3 finds that when moral agreement and procedural justice are manipulated simultaneously, only moral agreement predicts willingness to obey laws. Experiment 4 replicates these effects among participants with criminal records. Experiment 5 shows that these patterns persist when addressing potential confounds and when moral preferences are weaker. Our findings challenge procedural justice models, highlighting the importance of addressing moral disagreement in policy contexts.",

          "abstract": "Across eight preregistered studies ( N = 6,464), we apply an approach informed by social norm theory to investigate perceptions and realities of support for Initiatives for Future Generations (IFGs)—institutions and policies designed to ensure political representation for and protection of future generations. We find widespread bipartisan support for IFGs alongside pluralistic ignorance: Americans vastly underestimate their peers’ support. Correcting misperceptions enhances individual support, underscoring the role of social norms in shaping collective action. We also find modest—albeit mixed—evidence that interventions aimed at increasing intergenerational concern can boost support for IFGs without exacerbating pluralistic ignorance. These interventions may serve as a complement to norm-corrective approaches by engaging moral motivations alongside informational strategies. Beyond highlighting the value of correcting norm misperceptions in safeguarding future generations’ welfare, we explore motivational explanations for pluralistic ignorance and emphasize that policymakers hold the power to implement IFGs with confidence and the public is behind them.",

          "abstract": "Hostile sexism evokes women’s resistance necessitating benevolent sexism to promote cross-gender cooperation. Addressing inconsistent, primarily self-report evidence for ambivalent sexism theory principles, we test the actor and partner effects of sexist attitudes on behaviors exhibited within heterosexual couples’ interactions ( N = 855 dyadic interactions). Showing that men’s hostile sexism likely incites resistance, men’s hostile sexism predicted more hostile and less responsive behavior by men and their women partners. Providing new behavioral evidence that benevolent sexism may promote heterosexual cooperation, men’s benevolent sexism predicted less hostile and more responsive behavior by men and their partners. Illustrating that benevolent sexism is also likely to have costs for women and men, women’s benevolent sexism predicted more hostile behavior by women and their partners, particularly when men partners were low in benevolent or high in hostile sexism. We emphasize the importance of examining how sexist attitudes influence actor and partner behavior across different contexts.",

          "abstract": "Conflicting information can significantly undermine emotions, cognition, and behavior. This paper aims to understand the negative impact of conflicting information through the lens of conflictive uncertainty. Conflictive uncertainty encompasses two dimensions: the epistemological dimension, which involves uncertainty and ambiguity about outcomes and probabilities, and the interpersonal dimension, which arises from doubts about the credibility of sources. Three experiments were conducted to test this framework. Experiment 1 found that, under conflictive uncertainty, participants rated lower source credibility and exhibited weaker preferences compared to ambiguity. Experiment 2 revealed that the negative impact of conflicting information on the strength of preference was mediated by reduced source credibility and increased perceived uncertainty. Experiment 3 demonstrated that neutralizing the loss of credibility mitigated the adverse effects of conflicting information on the strength of preference. These findings highlight the roles of source credibility and perceived uncertainty in understanding the negative effects of conflicting information on decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Childhood language interventions appear promising for improving children’s lives and yielding economic returns. However, few studies have evaluated long-term effects of these interventions. Our study did this using a large, cluster-randomized trial of a preschool intervention for Norwegian children aged 4 to 5 years whose vocabulary was more limited than that of their peers. Results showed that effects on expressive language were maintained at the 7-month follow-up when the children were in first grade and that those with the weakest language skills initially had the largest and most persistent effects. However, 4 years after the intervention, the differences between the intervention and control groups were negligible. Thus, although effects from the preschool language intervention lasted into the first year of elementary school, effects eventually faded and were completely absent in fourth grade. Our findings suggest the need for a sustained approach to language and literacy support, focusing on persistent interventions and high-quality adapted instruction.",

          "authors": "Khaoula Chehbouni, Florian Carichon, Adrien Simonnot-Lanciaux, Gilles Caporossi, Danilo C. Dantas",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between the lexical typicality of song lyrics and song popularity in the UK Official Singles Chart from 1999 to 2013. Drawing on natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we develop a multidimensional measure of lyrics’ typicality that captures lexical repetition, complexity, thematic content, and emotional tone, addressing methodological limitations in previous research that relied heavily on static word dictionaries. By analysing 1,457 songs that reached the top five chart positions, we demonstrate that lyrics’ typicality significantly predicts the duration a song remains in the top five but does not affect the peak chart position or the trajectory of popularity (skewness and kurtosis). Our findings suggest that while typical lyrics may contribute to a song’s longevity within a given canon, they do not necessarily guarantee chart-topping success. This research contributes a replicable, dictionary-free methodology for assessing lyrics’ typicality and offers insights into the nuanced role of lyrics in shaping musical preferences.",
