          "title": "From the Illusion of Choice to Actual Control: Reconsidering the Induced-Compliance Paradigm of Cognitive Dissonance",
          "authors": "Shiva Pauer, Roman Linne, Hans-Peter Erb",
          "abstract": "The induced-compliance paradigm is a fundamental pillar in the literature on cognitive dissonance. A recent failed replication by Vaidis et al. casts doubt on the widely used experimental method, thereby challenging the literature and prevailing theorizing about the role of perceived choice in cognitive dissonance. However, the nonreplication of the experimental effects could be attributable to methodological factors, such as laboratory settings and cross-temporal dynamics. We therefore reanalyzed the replication data to further explore the relationship between dissonant-attitude change and choice perceptions, employing self-report items instead of the traditional experimental manipulation of choice. Our analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between perceived choice and dissonant behavior (writing a counterattitudinal essay vs. a self-chosen essay) on attitude change: Participants who wrote a counterattitudinal essay aligned their attitudes only if they reported high (vs. low) freedom of choice. These findings suggest a crucial role of choice perceptions in dissonance reduction, consistent with the original theorizing. Future research can employ various methods and draw from adjacent fields, especially from the literature on control perceptions, to reconsider the induced-compliance paradigm and advance research on cognitive dissonance.",

          "abstract": "In this commentary, we examine the implications of the failed replication reported by Vaidis et al., which represents the largest multilab attempt to replicate the induced-compliance paradigm in cognitive-dissonance theory. We respond to commentaries on this study and discuss potential explanations for the null findings, including issues with the perceived choice manipulation and various post hoc explanations. Our commentary includes an assessment of the broader landscape of cognitive-dissonance research, revealing pervasive methodological limitations, such as underpowered studies and a lack of open-science practices. We conclude that our replication study and our examination of the literature raise substantial concerns about the reliability of the induced-compliance paradigm and highlight the need for more rigorous research practices in the field of cognitive dissonance.",

          "abstract": "Quantitatively coding open-ended data (e.g., from videos, interviews) can be a rich source of information in psychological research, but reporting practices vary substantially. We provide strategies for improving validity and reliability of coding open-ended data and investigate questionable research practices in this area. First, we systematically examined articles in four top psychology journals ( N = 956) and found that 21% included open-ended data coded by humans. However, only about one-third of those articles reported sufficient details to replicate or evaluate the validity of the coding process. Next, we propose multiphase guidelines for transparently reporting on the quantitative coding of open-ended data, informed by concerns with replicability, content validity, and statistical validity. The first phase involves research design, including selecting data and identifying units reliably. The second phase includes developing a coding manual and training coders. The final phase outlines how to establish reliability. As part of this phase, we used data simulations to examine a common statistic for testing reliability on open-ended data, Cohen’s κ, and found that it can become inflated when researchers repeatedly test interrater reliability or manipulate categories, such as by including a missing-data category. Finally, to facilitate transparent and valid coding of open-ended data, we provide a preregistration template that reflects these guidelines. All of the guidelines and resources provided in this article can be adapted for different types of studies, depending on context.",

          "abstract": "Many musicians live with music performance anxiety (MPA), which may affect their psychological and physiological functioning. Mindfulness, being aware in the present moment without judgment, has been found to help ease anxiety. Mindfulness may also help alleviate the negative effects of MPA, but what is the neurophysiological basis for this effect? Core components of mindfulness, including emotional processing and acceptance, are related to specific patterns of brain activity. In the current study, 20 musicians with MPA underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (Time 1), a method to examine the communication between brain regions at rest. Notably, 10 musicians then underwent 2 weeks of mindfulness training, while 10 did not. The same scan sequence was repeated in all participants 2 weeks later (Time 2). Compared with Time 1, participants in the mindfulness group exhibited decreased resting-state functional connectivity between areas of the prefrontal cortex and the vermis-6 and crus-II at Time 2. These two areas of the cerebellum are related to emotional processing and acceptance. Changes in communication between these brain regions and the prefrontal cortex suggest the neurophysiological influences of mindfulness and how mindfulness can be used to strengthen emotion regulation networks in musicians with MPA.",

Participants completed personality questionnaires, sight-read an unfamiliar musical piece, received computer-generated feedback, and reported post-manipulation self-efficacy. Results showed that positive evaluations, even computer-generated, increased self-efficacy and were associated with a higher likelihood of choosing solo/ a cappella performance. While self-efficacy correlated with a greater preference for solo/ a cappella performance, it did not mediate the relationship between evaluation and performance choice. Findings align with Bandura’s self-efficacy theory, emphasizing the influence of mastery experiences and external feedback on self-efficacy development.",
