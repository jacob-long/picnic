          "authors": "Evan Mayo-Wilson, Sean Grant, Katherine S. Corker, David Moher",
          "abstract": "In 2013, the Center for Open Science proposed that journal articles be awarded “badges” for engaging in open-science practices, including preregistration. In 2015, the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines (TOP 2015) promoted preregistration of studies and analysis plans. Since then, the term “preregistration” has been used to describe different research outputs created at different times—sometimes, but not always, including study registration. Following a review of evidence about TOP 2015 implementation, including evidence that adherence could not be rated reliably, the TOP Guidelines Advisory Board updated these guidelines (TOP 2025). The TOP 2025 guidelines no longer use the term “preregistration.” Instead, TOP 2025 disambiguates specific research outputs, such as registrations, study protocols, analysis plans, code, and other research materials. TOP 2025 also explains that researchers should describe the time at which outputs are created and shared in relation to key study activities. In this article, we explain why adopting the terminology used in TOP 2025 and describing the times at which specific research outputs are created and shared will enhance understanding and support better implementation and reporting of open science.",

          "abstract": "Researchers in psychology traditionally use analysis of variance to examine differences between multiple groups or conditions. A less well-known, but valuable alternative is contrast analysis — a simple statistical method for testing directional, theoretically motivated hypotheses that are defined prior to data collection. In this article, we review the core concepts of contrast analysis for testing hypotheses in between-subjects and within-subjects designs. We also outline and demonstrate the largely unknown possibility of directly testing two competing contrasts against each other. In the tutorial part of the article, we show how such competing-contrast analyses can be conducted in the free, open-source software using the package . Because competing-contrast analysis is a straightforward, flexible, highly powered, and hypothesis-driven approach, it is a valuable tool to extend the understanding of cognitive and behavioral processes in psychological research.",

          "abstract": "Four longitudinal studies ( N = 1,035) examined whether telling others about personal goals enhances goal support received, goal pursuit effort, and goal progress. In Study 1, participants nominated a personal goal and 1 week later reported whether they had shared this goal during the week. Goal disclosure predicted more support received from others and greater goal pursuit effort. In Studies 2 and 3, participants assigned to share a goal in the coming week later reported receiving more support from others, which in turn was linked to greater goal pursuit effort and progress. In Study 4, participants were assigned either to share a goal with a person accompanying them at that moment or to keep it private; goal disclosure was again linked to goal pursuit effort, though not to support received. Together, these studies reveal the benefits of sharing goals and highlight the importance of considering the audience and manner of goal disclosure.",

          "abstract": "The present endeavor examines whether paternalistic stereotypes, associating some low-status groups with low competence but high warmth, are always genuine. We propose that not all individuals are sincere in their evaluations as their judgments of warmth are likely driven by normative concerns. Study 1 ( N = 201) confirmed the relationship between paternalistic stereotypes and perceived normative protection. Three additional studies manipulated participants’ beliefs about whether their true opinion could be uncovered or was socially expected. Specifically, individuals with high external motivation to respond without prejudice rated socially protected groups more harshly, especially on warmth, when they faced a bogus pipeline (Study 2, N = 160) or when norms emphasized honesty (Studies 3a and 3b, Ns = 137 and 247). These findings show the greater versatility of warmth compared to competence evaluations and provide new insights into why members of protected groups may continue to experience discrimination.",

          "abstract": "We examined how scientific research influences the beliefs of those most invested in the research. We focused specifically on violent video game (VVG) and aggression research and tested the hypothesis that non-players and non-habitual players would update their beliefs based on the study conclusions, whereas more habitual players would not. Participants read abstracts with either a positive effect or a null effect. Beliefs about the effect of VVGs on aggression were measured before and after reading. Results in both studies (overall N = 1,576) showed that at low VVG exposure levels, participants in both conditions updated their beliefs to align with the research. However, at high VVG exposure levels, participants maintained their belief that VVGs do not increase aggression, and at very high VVG exposure levels, positive-effect studies led participants to believe the opposite: that VVGs reduce aggression. We interpret this pattern of response as suggesting a process of psychological distancing, whereby individuals defensively shift their beliefs away from threatening claims. These findings highlight the need to understand how scientific information is received and to develop strategies that prevent reinforcing misconceptions.",

          "abstract": "Across 12 empirical studies ( N total = 2,615), this research systematically examined the stable tendency for individuals to overestimate others’ zero-sum beliefs, along with its underlying psychological mechanisms and behavioral consequences. Studies 1–3 and Supplementary Studies 1–4, using diverse experimental designs and measures, consistently showed that people tend to overestimate others’ zero-sum beliefs at both explicit and implicit levels. Studies 4–5, through surveys and experiments, provided converging evidence that construing others at a high construal level—as purely self-interested agents—serves as a key psychological mechanism driving this overestimation. Study 6 and Supplementary Studies 5–6 demonstrated that overestimating others’ zero-sum beliefs significantly reduced cooperative behavior, both in abstract game contexts and in more everyday settings. These findings enrich researchers’ understanding of the illusory nature of zero-sum beliefs and suggest that interventions based on the social norms approach may help correct this overestimation and foster cooperation.",

          "abstract": "Social hierarchies ultimately concern resource possession, yet psychological processes for regulating resource-related tensions remain underexplored. We examine how support for intergroup equality (egalitarianism) relates to explicit attitudes toward, and mental images of, the resource poor. In Study 1 ( N = 625), egalitarians report more favorable attitudes toward the resource poor than anti-egalitarians. However, using the reverse correlation paradigm, both groups generate similarly negative mental images of this group, as shown by pixel luminance comparisons (Study 1) and evaluated by independent raters of person-perceptual (Study 2, N = 394) and coalitional traits (Study 3, N = 348). While ideology did not shape image generation, it did influence image evaluation: egalitarian raters showed less polarization between resource-poor and resource-rich faces than anti-egalitarian raters. These findings suggest that despite ideological differences in explicit attitudes (divergence), egalitarians, and anti-egalitarians share similarly negative mental representations (convergence) of the resource poor, highlighting a nuanced interplay between social perception and hierarchy regulation.",

          "abstract": "Recognition memory refers to the process of distinguishing between previously experienced and novel events. Apart from the objective quality of stored memories, recognition depends on the retrieval context produced by all items (foils) presented together with actually memorized targets and causing confusion. Memory models often conceptualize target-foil confusability via distances in psychological spaces where greater confusability originates from shorter interitem distances. We tested whether recognition spaces change when other foils are added to the retrieval context or when target memory strength is changed ( N = 1,311 adults). Using signal-detection modeling, we found that separately measured distances, d ′s, from each foil to the target provide a good linear prediction of those distances for all foils being presented together against that target. Those predictions stay accurate even when the absolute distances are scaled up or down because of a change in memory strength. This suggests strong metric invariance of spaces used for recognition decisions under variable retrieval contexts.",

          "abstract": "Musical chills, a subjective emotional experience associated with goosebumps, shivers, and/or tingling sensations, have recently been linked to experiences of social bonding. Thus, there is some rationale for expecting music performance to afford chills, as performance can involve strong emotional responses and social bonding experiences. However, almost all musical chills research focuses on listening contexts. This study explores experiences of musical chills while performing music. Data for the study were collected through a questionnaire survey with 218 musicians about their chills experiences. Results show that chills are experienced by musicians during performance and that they are largely positive experiences. Important factors for chills in performance include various musical features, performance qualities, interpersonal connections between performers, and personal associations with the music and performance context. Findings align with links between chills and social bonding, although further research is required to understand underlying psychological mechanisms of the phenomenon. Finally, various characteristics of chills in music performance suggest that the experience may be linked to psychological wellbeing, posing a novel route for continued research.",
