          "title": "How accurately can we estimate spontaneous body kinematics from video recordings? Effect of movement amplitude on OpenPose accuracy",
          "authors": "Atesh Koul, Giacomo Novembre",
          "abstract": "Estimating how the human body moves in space and time—body kinematics—has important applications for industry, healthcare, and several research fields. Gold-standard methodologies capturing body kinematics are expensive and impractical for naturalistic recordings as they rely on infrared-reflective wearables and bulky instrumentation. To overcome these limitations, several algorithms have been developed to extract body kinematics from plain video recordings. This comes with a drop in accuracy, which however has not been clearly quantified. To fill this knowledge gap, we analysed a dataset comprising 46 human participants exhibiting spontaneous movements of varying amplitude. Body kinematics were estimated using OpenPose (video-based) and Vicon (infrared-based) motion capture systems simultaneously. OpenPose accuracy was assessed using Vicon estimates as ground truth. We report that OpenPose accuracy is overall moderate and varies substantially across participants and body parts. This is explained by variability in movement amplitude. OpenPose estimates are weak for low-amplitude movements. Conversely, large-amplitude movements (i.e., &gt; ~ 10 cm) yield highly accurate estimates. The relationship between accuracy and movement amplitude is not linear (but mostly exponential or power) and relatively robust to camera–body distance. Together, these results dissect the limits of video-based motion capture and provide useful guidelines for future studies.",

          "authors": "Aylin König, Uwe Thomas, Frank Bremmer, Stefan Dowiasch",
          "abstract": "The analysis of eye movements is a noninvasive, reliable and fast method to detect and quantify brain (dys)function. Here, we investigated the performance of two novel eye-trackers—the Thomas Oculus Motus-research mobile (TOM-rm) and the TOM-research stationary (TOM-rs)—and compared them with the performance of a well-established video-based eye-tracker, i.e., the EyeLink 1000 Plus (EL). The TOM-rm is a fully integrated, tablet-based mobile device that presents visual stimuli and records head-unrestrained eye movements at 30 Hz without additional infrared illumination. The TOM-rs is a stationary, video-based eye-tracker that records eye movements at either high spatial or high temporal resolution. We compared the performance of all three eye-trackers in two different behavioral tasks: pro- and anti-saccade and free viewing. We collected data from 30 human subjects while running all three eye-tracking devices in parallel. Parameters requiring a high spatial or temporal resolution (e.g., saccade latency or gain), as derived from the data, differed significantly between the EL and the TOM-rm in both tasks. Differences between results derived from the TOM-rs and the EL were most likely due to experimental conditions, which could not be optimized for both systems simultaneously. We conclude that the TOM-rm can be used for measuring basic eye-movement parameters, such as the error rate in a typical pro- and anti-saccade task, or the number and position of fixations in a visual foraging task, reliably at comparably low spatial and temporal resolution. The TOM-rs, on the other hand, can provide high-resolution oculomotor data at least on a par with an established reference system.",

          "authors": "Clemens Draxler, Andreas Kurz",
          "abstract": "This article addresses the problem of measurement invariance in psychometrics. In particular, its focus is on the invariance assumption of item parameters in a class of models known as Rasch models. It suggests a mixed-effects or random intercept model for binary data together with a conditional likelihood approach of both estimating and testing the effects of multiple covariates simultaneously. The procedure can also be viewed as a multivariate multiple regression analysis which can be applied in longitudinal designs to investigate effects of covariates over time or different experimental conditions. This work also derives four statistical tests based on asymptotic theory and a parameter-free test suitable in small sample size scenarios. Finally, it outlines generalizations for categorical data in more than two categories. All procedures are illustrated on real-data examples from behavioral research and on a hypothetical data example related to clinical research in a longitudinal design.",

          "abstract": "Measuring attention and engagement is essential for understanding a wide range of psychological phenomena. Advances in technology have made it possible to measure real-time attention to naturalistic stimuli, providing ecologically valid insight into temporal dynamics. We developed a research protocol called Trace , which records anonymous facial landmarks, expressions, and patterns of movement associated with engagement in screen-based media. Trace runs in a standard internet browser and resembles a contemporary media player. It is embedded in the open-source package PsychoJS (the JavaScript sister library of PsychoPy) hosted via Pavlovia, and can be integrated with a wide range of behavioral research methods. Developed over multiple iterations and tested with over 200 participants in three studies, including the official broadcast of a major theatre production, Trace is a powerful, user-friendly protocol allowing behavioral researchers to capture audience attention and engagement in screen-based media as part of authentic, ecologically valid audience experiences.",

Unlike previous photosets, the BRIC focused on nonrealistic visuals. This collection includes abstract and non-abstract paintings and nonrealistic photographs depicting objects, scenes, animals, humans, and fantastical creatures with varying degrees of unreal elements. We collected evaluative ratings of the photos, using a convenience sample of 16,208 participants in a total of 25,321 sessions. We used multiple evaluation measures: binary positive/negative and like/dislike categorization, seven-point ratings on these attributes, both under no time pressure and under time pressure, and evaluative priming scores. The mean evaluation of the photos on the different measures was highly correlated, but some photos consistently elicited a discrepant evaluative reaction between the measures. The BRIC is a valuable resource for eliciting evaluative reactions and can contribute to research on evaluative processes and affective responses.",

          "abstract": "People with social anxiety disorder tend to interpret ambiguous social information in a negative rather than positive manner. Such interpretation biases may cause and maintain anxiety symptoms. However, there is considerable variability in the observed effects across studies, with some not finding a relationship between interpretation biases and social anxiety. Poor psychometric properties of interpretation bias measures may explain such inconsistent findings. We evaluated the internal consistency, test–retest reliability, convergent validity, and concurrent validity of four interpretation bias measures, ranging from more implicit and automatic to more explicit and reflective: the probe scenario task, the recognition task, the scrambled sentences task, and the interpretation and judgmental bias questionnaire. Young adults ( N = 94) completed interpretation bias measures in two sessions separated by one week. Psychometric properties were poor for the probe scenario and not acceptable for the recognition task. The reliability of the scrambled sentences task and the interpretation and judgmental bias questionnaire was good, and they correlated highly with social anxiety and each other, supporting their concurrent and convergent validity. However, there are methodological challenges that should be considered when measuring interpretation biases, even if psychometric indices suggest high measurement validity. We also discuss likely reasons for poor psychometric properties of some tasks and suggest potential solutions to improve the assessment of implicit and automatic biases in social anxiety in future research.",

          "abstract": "Across a series of eight high-powered studies ( N = 6,866), we develop a method for assessing impartial intergenerational beneficence, defined as intergenerational concern for all possible future generations. Across our studies, roughly 20% of participants displayed impartial intergenerational beneficence. Participants with impartial intergenerational beneficence expressed greater perceptions that future threats can be resolved, support for policies seeking to protect future generations of people, and a profound sense of responsibility for the long-term survival and prosperity of humanity. Similarly, associations with various future-oriented attitudes, patterns of prosociality, and longtermism-related behaviors and intentions were noted. This research thus introduces a method to capture impartiality in expressed intergenerational concern and finds that people who display impartial intergenerational concern endorse prosocial principles, such as altruism and utilitarianism, while also being more concerned about their own future, the future of others, and how they will be remembered by others.",

          "abstract": "Anonymization of job applicant resumes is a recommended strategy to increase diversity in organizations, but large-scale tests have shown mixed results. We consider decision-makers’ social dominance orientation (SDO), a measure of anti-egalitarianism/endorsement of group-based hierarchy, to illustrate the limits of anonymization. Across four pre-registered studies ( N = 3,150), we show that (a) lower SDO individuals are less likely to hire individuals from underrepresented groups when job materials are anonymized and (b) they are more likely to opt into using anonymization. Taken together, these results suggest that opt-in anonymization policies may sometimes reduce the diversity of who is selected. Furthermore, people appear to have inaccurate lay beliefs about the consequences of anonymization. Our results suggest policy evaluations of diversity interventions should consider the interaction of heterogeneous treatment effects and selection effects, which may inadvertently lead to outcomes that are contrary to the stated policy goals.",

          "authors": "Jacinth J. X. Tan, Amos Y. E. Tai",
          "abstract": "The causal effects of one’s socioeconomic status (SES) on outcomes are typically examined by experimentally manipulating SES self-perceptions based on one of three SES dimensions—absolute resource, relative resource, and general social position. We investigated the efficacy of these manipulations by systematically meta-analyzing their effects on SES self-perceptions. Based on 107 eligible samples ( N = 26,203), manipulations of SES self-perceptions across the three SES dimensions were effective overall ( g = 0.56–0.95). Explicit priming of absolute resource and relative resource manipulations comparing high versus low SES were consistently effective—although bias-corrected effects were attenuated—suggesting the importance of salient SES information and social comparisons. Moderation tests revealed stronger manipulation effects on SES self-perceptions among samples at earlier life stages (university and younger samples) and with stronger interdependent orientation (lower independence and higher female composition). We discuss implications on understanding the determinants of SES self-perception and designing experimental studies on SES effects.",

          "authors": "Michael Puntiroli, Serhiy Kandul, Valéry Bezençon, Bruno Lanz",
          "abstract": "Ambiguity acts as a veil that can help conceal and justify dishonest behavior. While an individual’s ability to disambiguate information in a task may help remove the veil of ambiguity and thus promote honesty, the relationship between ambiguity, ability, and dishonesty is currently unexplored. To investigate this, we employed an experimental design where participants attempted to resolve an ambiguous task and reported their performance. Results showed that ambiguity and dishonesty increase in unison. Importantly, the participants who resolved ambiguity acted less dishonestly (Study 1). In Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, we increased participants’ ability by briefly training them to disambiguate the information presented in the task. The results showed that participants acted less dishonestly when their ability levels were increased. Overall, the findings indicate that dishonesty can be reduced not only by making tasks less ambiguous but also by enhancing an individual’s ability to successfully resolve ambiguity.",

          "authors": "Patrick Racine, Samuel Vachon Laflamme, Patrick Gaudreau, Frédéric Langlois",
          "abstract": "Musicians have normalized performance anxiety (PA) to be part of their musical career. Perfectionism has been proposed as a possible personality risk factor for PA. Although perfectionistic concerns have been consistently positively correlated to PA, results have been inconsistent for perfectionistic standards. This inconsistency is potentially attributable to the fact that past studies did not differentiate the pursuit of high standards and the pursuit of perfectionistic standards. In this study, we aimed to compare the levels of PA of students who pursue high standards (excellence) from those who pursue perfection with the model of excellencism and perfectionism. As a supplementary analysis, we have also investigated if different standards predicted different positive and negative affect levels. A total of 94 music students completed questionnaires on perfectionism, PA, and positive and negative affect. They were recruited through their music conservatory ( N = 69) and recruitment ads on Facebook ( N = 25). Results of multiple linear regression demonstrated that only perfectionistic standards were positively and significantly associated with cognitive state anxiety, overall score of PA, and negative affect. Overall, aiming for excellence rather than perfection seemed to help mitigate levels of PA and the negative affect felt by musicians.",
