          "abstract": "The prevalence of effect-size (ES) reporting has risen significantly, yet studies comparing two groups tend to rely exclusively on the Cohen’s d family of ESs. In this article, we aim to broaden the readers’ horizon of known ESs by introducing various ES families for two-group comparisons, including indices of standardized differences in central tendency, overlap, dominance, and differences in variability and distributional tails. We describe parametric and nonparametric estimators in each ES family and present an interactive web application (R Shiny) for computing these ESs and facilitating their application. This one-stop calculator allows for the computation of 95 applications of 67 unique ESs and their confidence intervals and various plotting options and provides detailed descriptions for each ES, making it a valuable resource for both self-guided exploration and instructor-led teaching. With this comprehensive guide and its companion app, we aim to improve the clarity and accuracy of ES reporting in research design that involves two-group comparisons.",

          "authors": "Tsz Keung Wong, Jorge N. Tendeiro",
          "abstract": "The Bayes factor is often proposed as a superior replacement to p  values in testing null hypotheses for various reasons, with the availability of many user-friendly and easily accessible statistical software tools facilitating the use of Bayesian tests. Meanwhile, Bayes factor design analysis (BFDA), the counterpart of power analysis, is also proposed to ensure the maximum efficiency and informativeness of a study. Despite tools for conducting BFDA being limited and mostly relying on Monte Carlo methodology, methods based on root-finding algorithms have been recently developed (e.g., Pawel and Held, 2025), overcoming weaknesses of simulation approaches. This paper builds on these advancements by presenting a method generalizing the existing approach for conducting BFDA for sample size determination in t tests. The major advantage of the current method is that it does not assume normality of the effect size estimate, allowing more flexibility in the specification of the design and analysis priors. We developed and showcase a user-friendly Shiny app for facilitating the use of BFDA, illustrated with an empirical example. Furthermore, using our method, we explore the operating characteristics of the Bayes factors using various priors.",

          "abstract": "The ability to perceive others’ emotions and one’s own interoceptive states has been the subject of extensive research. Very little work, however, has investigated the ability to recognise others’ interoceptive states, such as whether an individual is feeling breathless, nauseated, or fatigued. This is likely owing to the dearth of stimuli available for use in research studies, despite the clear relevance of this ability to social interaction and effective caregiving. This paper describes the development and validation of two stimulus sets for use in research into the perception of others’ interoceptive states. The Interoceptive States Vocalisations (ISV) database and the Interoceptive States Point Light Displays (ISPLD) database include 191 vocalisation and 159 point light display stimuli. Both stimulus sets underwent two phases of validation, and all stimuli were scored in terms of their quality and recognisability, using five different measures. The ISV also includes control stimuli featuring non-interoceptive vocalisations. Some interoceptive states were consistently recognised better than others, but variability was observed within, as well as between, stimulus categories. Stimuli are freely available for use in research, and are presented alongside all stimulus quality scores, in order for researchers to select the most appropriate stimuli based on individual research questions.",

          "authors": "Katharina Groskurth, Nivedita Bhaktha, Clemens M. Lechner",
          "abstract": "To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥ .950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest. Therefore, we propose a novel approach combining a Monte Carlo simulation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. This so-called simulation-cum-ROC approach generates tailored cutoffs and additionally identifies the most reliable fit indices in the setting of interest. We provide R code and a Shiny app for an easy implementation of the approach. No prior knowledge of Monte Carlo simulations or ROC analysis is needed to generate tailored cutoffs with the simulation-cum-ROC approach.",

          "abstract": "Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the field of gaze estimation, yet the development of these algorithms is often hindered by a lack of appropriate publicly accessible training datasets. Moreover, models trained on the few available datasets often fail to generalize to new datasets due to both discrepancies in hardware and biological diversity among subjects. To mitigate these challenges, the research community has frequently turned to synthetic datasets, although this approach also has drawbacks, such as the computational resource and labor-intensive nature of creating photorealistic representations of eye images to be used as training data. In response, we introduce “Light Eyes” (LEyes), a novel framework that diverges from traditional photorealistic methods by utilizing simple synthetic image generators to train neural networks for detecting key image features like pupils and corneal reflections, diverging from traditional photorealistic approaches. LEyes facilitates the generation of synthetic data on the fly that is adaptable to any recording device and enhances the efficiency of training neural networks for a wide range of gaze-estimation tasks. Presented evaluations show that LEyes, in many cases, outperforms existing methods in accurately identifying and localizing pupils and corneal reflections across diverse datasets. Additionally, models trained using LEyes data outperform standard eye trackers while employing more cost-effective hardware, offering a promising avenue to overcome the current limitations in gaze estimation technology.",

          "abstract": "Visually observing a touch quickly reveals who is being touched, how it might feel, and the broader social or emotional context, shaping our interpretation of such interactions. Investigating these dimensions is essential for understanding how tactile experiences are processed individually and how we empathise with observed sensations in others. Here, we expand available resources for studying visually perceived touch by providing a wide-ranging set of dynamic interactions that specifically focus on the sensory qualities of touch. The Validated Touch-Video Database (VTD) consists of a set of 90 videos depicting tactile interactions with a stationary left hand, viewed from a first-person perspective. In each video, a second hand makes contact either directly (e.g., with fingers or an open palm) or using an object (e.g., a soft brush or scissors), with variations across dimensions such as hedonic qualities, arousal, threat, touch type, and the object used. Validation by 350 participants (283 women, 66 men, 1 non-binary) involved categorising the videos as ‘neutral’, ‘pleasant’, ‘unpleasant’, or ‘painful’ and rating arousal and threat levels. Our findings reveal high inter-subject agreement, with painful touch videos eliciting the highest arousal and threat ratings, while neutral touch videos serve as a baseline. Exploratory analyses indicate that women rated the videos as more threatening and painful than men, suggesting potential gender differences in the visual perception of negatively valenced touch stimuli. The VTD provides a comprehensive resource for researchers investigating the sensory and emotional dimensions of observed touch.",

          "abstract": "We present SingleMALD, a large-scale auditory lexical decision study in English with a fully crossed design. SingleMALD is freely available and includes over 2 million trials in which 40 native speakers of English responded to over 26,000 different words and over 9000 different pseudowords, each in 67 balanced sessions. SingleMALD features a large number of responses per stimulus, but a smaller number of participants, thus complementing the Massive Auditory Lexical Decision (MALD) dataset which features many listeners but fewer responses per stimulus. In the present report, we also use SingleMALD data to explore how extensive testing affects performance in the auditory lexical decision task. SingleMALD participants show signs of favoring speed over accuracy as the sessions unfold. Additionally, we find that the relationship between participant performance and two lexical predictors – word frequency and phonological neighborhood density – changes as sessions unfold, especially for certain lexical predictor values. We note that none of the changes are drastic, indicating that data collected from participants that have been extensively tested is usable, although we recommend accounting for participant experience with the task when performing statistical analyses of the data.",

          "abstract": "The constructive disruption hypothesis proposes that nonnormative-nonviolent protest tactics can persuade resistant advantaged groups to grant concessions by balancing disruption with constructive intentions. We extended this hypothesis from asymmetrical intergroup contexts to two issue-based domains ( N = 457), animal welfare activism (Study 1) and religious blasphemy protests (Study 2). Although protest tactics did not directly affect support among resistant participants, we revealed significant indirect pathways through constructive disruption. Constructive intentions consistently predicted increased support, while disruption enhanced support among resistant bystanders (Study 1) or all participants (Study 2), even for violent protests, but decreased support among those open to change (Study 1). Response surface analyses revealed that in animal rights protests, optimal support emerged from combining high constructive intentions with moderate disruption among resistant bystanders, while religious blasphemy protests showed predominantly additive effects. These findings suggest that constructive disruption’s effectiveness varies by context and audience characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Even in environments offering ample opportunities to interact with people from diverse backgrounds, people differ in their tendency to form intergroup friendships. Whereas some develop intergroup friendships, others prefer befriending ingroup members, contributing to prejudice and polarization. We identify open-mindedness—an inclination to engage with and understand different perspectives—as an individual difference predicting the racial, political, and socioeconomic diversity of real-world friendship networks. In a longitudinal study of 1,423 eighth–ninth graders, more open-minded adolescents developed more racially diverse friendship networks over 2 years. Two additional studies (total N = 1,585 adults) replicated and extended this finding: Open-mindedness predicted greater racial, political, and socioeconomic diversity of friends, and was more consistently associated with friendship diversity than Big Five openness to experience. The associations between open-mindedness and friendship diversity were partly explained by open-minded individuals’ lower avoidance of interaction with outgroup members. Building open-mindedness may be one individual-level approach to promote friendships across divides.",

          "abstract": "Jordan et al., 2011, demonstrated that people underestimated the prevalence of others’ negative emotional experiences and that these were associated with higher well-being. We conducted a preregistered replication of Studies 1b and 3 by Jordan et al., 2011 ( N = 594) with adjustments and added extensions. Building on their methodology, we examined both prevalence and intensity of emotional experiences, and our findings suggest a much more complex story with surprising effects. We found an underestimation of the prevalence of negative emotions, but also unexpectedly of an underestimation of the prevalence of positive emotions, with stronger effects for negative than for positive emotions. However, we found an opposite effect for emotional intensity; people overestimated the intensity of both positive and negative emotional experiences, again with stronger effects for negative. Surprisingly, associations between prevalence estimations and well-being were in the opposite direction to the target article’s. Materials, data, and code: https://osf.io/bwmtr/",

          "abstract": "Beauty has pervasive implications for success in various domains of life. Given this broad and visible nature, whether and how a belief in the improvability of this important human attribute influences judgment and decision-making is largely unknown. We found that beauty implicit theories can produce strong cross-domain impact on risk-taking behavior. Using both hypothetical choices and real behaviors in one cross-country survey and nine experiments, including three supplementary studies ( N = 4,015), we found that (a) incremental theorists, who believed that beauty is malleable and improvable, took greater risks than entity theorists, who believed that beauty is fixed, and (b) an incremental belief of beauty heightens a sense of optimism that one will achieve positive outcomes in various domains of life, which consequently promotes risk-seeking behavior. These findings demonstrate that domain-specific implicit theory (i.e. beauty in our case) can affect behavior beyond that domain (non-beauty related risk-taking).",

          "abstract": "Misinformation is widespread, but only some people accept the false information they encounter. This raises two questions: Who falls for misinformation, and why do they fall for misinformation? To address these questions, two studies investigated associations between 15 individual-difference dimensions and judgments of misinformation as true. Using Signal Detection Theory, the studies further investigated whether the obtained associations are driven by individual differences in truth sensitivity, acceptance threshold, or myside bias. For both political misinformation (Study 1) and misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines (Study 2), truth sensitivity was positively associated with cognitive reflection and actively open-minded thinking, and negatively associated with bullshit receptivity and conspiracy mentality. Although acceptance threshold and myside bias explained considerable variance in judgments of misinformation as true, neither showed robust associations with the measured individual-difference dimensions. The findings provide deeper insights into individual differences in misinformation susceptibility and uncover critical gaps in their scientific understanding.",

          "abstract": "Calling into question the pervasive assumption that people lack awareness of their own implicit evaluations, a growing body of research has demonstrated that people are quite accurate when predicting how they will perform on implicit measures. However, given both the theoretical and practical implications of understanding the extent to which people are aware of the cognitions reflected on implicit measures, it is crucial to examine the generality of this finding. Across four studies using two different measures of implicit evaluations, two different prediction tasks, and multiple target categories, we replicated the key finding that people are quite accurate in predicting their performance on implicit measures. Combining these results with those from existing work strongly suggests that people’s ability to accurately predict their performance on implicit measures is not simply an artifact of the particular measure used to tap implicit evaluations or the particular way in which predictions are assessed.",

In this study, we investigated the extent to which primary-school children pay attention to and read subtitles and whether this is related to their reading proficiency. We tracked the eye movements of 180 British children in Years 1 to 6 who watched videos with and without subtitles. Results showed that attention to subtitles was associated with reading proficiency: Superior readers were more likely to look at subtitles than less proficient readers and spent more time on them. When children looked at words in the subtitles, they showed evidence of reading them. We conclude that some degree of reading fluency may be necessary before children pay attention to subtitles. However, by the third or fourth year of reading instruction, most children read sufficiently quickly to follow same-language subtitles and potentially learn from them.",

          "abstract": "Absolute pitch (AP) enables its possessors to identify musical notes and keys by qualities of tone height and tone chroma. With advancing age, an unknown proportion of AP possessors perceives changes in these qualities, usually described as in the sharp direction and to the extent of a semitone or tone. The phenomenon is identified here as absolute pitch shift (APS). Using a cellphone-based tone generator, the writer conducted an N = 1 examination of the APS in his central musical range. The shift was greater at the centre of the range than at its extremes, causing him to perceive incoming tones as 1 to 4 semitones sharper than his recall of them in the A = 440 cps (concert pitch range). The report focusses on the comparative flatness of his AP memories of the tones, expressed with greater precision in cycles per second than by the names commonly given to their physical versions. The altered pitch perceptions are considered due to changes at the basilar membrane level in older individuals, and are labelled here as basilar AP. The internal pitch template’s role in memorising tone frequencies in the inner ear is labelled cortical AP. Implications are considered for further studies of AP and APS latency.",

          "abstract": "Homeless young adults with problematic psychoactive substance (PS) use face multiple challenges that compromise their well-being. Despite these challenges, few of them access psychosocial services and rather rely on personal resources to promote their own well-being. However, literature has been largely centered on their difficulties, leaving their strengths and capacities unknown. Despite this lack of knowledge, literature suggests that music is very important in the lives of young adults, especially because it helps them meet multiple well-being needs. The objective of this study was to describe and understand the perspectives of homeless young adults who experience problematic PS use on the ways music contributes to their well-being. Fifteen participants took part in semi-directed qualitative interviews that covered their experiences regarding the role of music in well-being. We also performed an iterative thematic analysis. Results highlight the marked importance of music for participants. Our study also demonstrates participants’ capacity to adapt their use of music to address the emotional, psychological, and social challenges they face. This study contributes to a better understanding of young adults’ use of music in promoting their global well-being and to the development of adapted outreach interventions that account for their capacities and interests.",

This case study focused on the Indigo Project’s Listen Up event, in which participants engage with a curated music playlist (drawing on soundtrack, ambient and experimental music) along with oral guidance provided by a psychologist. After attending Listen Up , participants ( N = 270, 85.90% female, M age = 37.05) completed an online survey, including their attendance motivations and standardised measures of mindfulness, self-compassion, self-stigma of help-seeking, and help-seeking intentions. A subset of 18 participants were subsequently interviewed about their experience. Results indicated that attendees experienced feelings of mindfulness and self-compassion, processed challenging emotions during the event, and were prompted to practice self-care and connect with others following the event. Additionally, participants experiencing mindfulness during the event buffered the relationship between self-stigma of help-seeking and future help-seeking intentions. Study findings have implications for our understanding of the ways that music and mindfulness can be used in practices to promote mental health and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Given the rise in awareness of the mental health crisis, we set out to determine a baseline for mental wellness among current music educators. In a nationwide survey, music educators ( N = 695) responded to a series of questions focused on mental wellness, stress, and personality. Music educators shared that they struggle with mental wellness at a higher rate than the general population while data revealed personality traits we would expect in music educators from the literature. Participants represented a broad sample of music educators, comprising practitioners who indicated an average of 16.34 years of experience while remaining busy with requirements of the profession outside of the classroom. They also indicated higher than normal stress levels ( M = 19.09 with a normed range of 12–14.7). Music educators’ responses indicated qualities of anxiety and depression at higher rates as compared with the national averages as well. We share insights into how these data fit with previous studies, possible approaches to establishing effective coping strategies, and potential next steps for our profession.",
