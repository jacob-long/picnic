          "authors": "Cosimo Iaia, Alessandro Tavano",
          "abstract": "To investigate how the human brain encodes the complex dynamics of natural languages, any viable and reproducible analysis pipeline must rely on either manual annotations or natural language processing (NLP) tools, which extract relevant physical (e.g., acoustic, gestural), and structure-building information from speech and language signals. However, annotating syntactic structure for a given natural language is arguably a harder task than annotating the onset and offset of speech units such as phonemes and syllables, as the latter can be identified by relying on the physically overt and temporally measurable properties of the signal, while syntactic units are generally covert and their chunking is model-driven. We describe and validate a pipeline that takes into account both physical and theoretical aspects of speech and language signals, and operates a theory-driven and explicit alignment between overt speech units and covert syntactic units.",

          "authors": "Merlin Monzel, Christian O. Scholz, Joel Pearson, Martin Reuter",
          "abstract": "Since mental imagery cannot be observed from the outside, it is all the more important to make it measurable. Yet, many so-called mental imagery tasks confuse object and spatial imagery or can be solved entirely without mental imagery, making them inappropriate for the assessment of mental imagery strength. One promising measurement method is the binocular rivalry task by Pearson et al. (Current Biology 18(13):982–986, 2008), which uses mental imagery priming to quantify mental imagery strength. Here, we propose an improved equation for the binocular rivalry priming score to significantly increase its predictive validity. In a sample of 38 aphantasics and 73 controls, we demonstrate that the binocular rivalry priming score calculated by the new equation explains more variance in the self-reported mental imagery capacity than the original equation. The improved binocular rivalry priming score is particularly beneficial when only a few trials are recorded (e.g., due to time or attention constraints) or when people with low mental imagery (i.e., aphantasics) have to be identified. The improved binocular rivalry priming score is advantageous in many situations, making it the preferred measure for future research.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Yartsev, Oliver P. John, Özlem N. Ayduk",
          "abstract": "The differential affective habituation hypothesis argues that affective reactions decrease faster for positive than for negative information due to the greater evolutionary importance of threat over reward. However, limited evidence and low-powered studies hinder strong conclusions about this hypothesis from the extant literature, a gap the present research aimed to address. Because anxiety entails heightened threat anticipation, a second aim was to examine if higher anxiety intensifies this differential habituation pattern (i.e., anxiety potentiation hypothesis ). Two experiments ( N 1 = 104, N 2 = 211) provided within-subject exposure to International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images, manipulated stimulus valence, and assessed anxiety at baseline (Studies 1 and 2) or following an anxiety manipulation (Study 2). Results supported both hypotheses, highlighting the importance of examining positive habituation as a key mechanism in psychological functioning and suggesting that, despite its potential survival function, differential habituation may carry psychological costs.",
