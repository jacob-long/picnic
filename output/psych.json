          "title": "Comparing perceptual judgments in large multimodal models and humans",
          "authors": "Billy Dickson, Sahaj Singh Maini, Craig Sanders, Robert Nosofsky, Zoran Tiganj",
          "abstract": "Cognitive scientists commonly collect participants' judgments regarding perceptual characteristics of stimuli to develop and evaluate models of attention, memory, learning, and decision-making. For instance, to model human responses in tasks of category learning and item recognition, researchers often collect perceptual judgments of images in order to embed the images in multidimensional feature spaces. This process is time-consuming and costly. Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) provide a potential alternative because such models can respond to prompts that include both text and images and could potentially replace human participants. To test whether the available LMMs can indeed be useful for this purpose, we evaluated their judgments on a dataset consisting of rock images that has been widely used by cognitive scientists. The dataset includes human perceptual judgments along 10 dimensions considered important for classifying rock images. Among the LMMs that we investigated, GPT-4o exhibited the strongest positive correlation with human responses and demonstrated promising alignment with the mean ratings from human participants, particularly for elementary dimensions such as lightness, chromaticity, shininess, and fine/coarse grain texture. However, its correlations with human ratings were lower for more abstract and rock-specific emergent dimensions such as organization and pegmatitic structure. Although there is room for further improvement, the model already appears to be approaching the level of consensus observed across human groups for the perceptual features examined here. Our study provides a benchmark for evaluating future LMMs on human perceptual judgment data.",

          "authors": "Yixia Wang, Yanxue Wang, Qi Chen, Emmanuel Keuleers",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the Simplified Chinese Lexicon Project (SCLP), which collects lexical decision data for all 8105 characters in the List of Commonly Used Standard Chinese Characters and for 4864 pseudocharacters, which were generated using a novel method that leveraged the hierarchical nature of Chinese characters. We compared the collected data to existing megastudies on Chinese characters, and found that the newly collected data performed similarly in terms of reliability. The comprehensive coverage of simplified Chinese characters in the present study added to the existing studies by allowing for a more fine-grained investigation of the effects of a variety of character attributes on visual processing. We illustrated these advantages by performing virtual experiments on visual complexity and on the interplay between neighborhood size and regularity. Our results indicated that characters with higher visual complexity were harder to recognize, in line with previous findings, while regular characters took longer to process when the neighborhood size was small. In addition, we present a new evaluation of the interaction between character frequency and subcomponent frequency, resulting in a three-way interaction among character frequency, radical frequency, and residual component frequency. Extending the investigation of subcomponent frequency to the analysis of pseudocharacters, we found that the interaction of radical frequency and residual component frequency also modulated pseudocharacter rejection. To support researchers in conducting behavioral experiments or statistical modeling, we provide both trial-level data and experiment materials.",

          "authors": "Hazel A. van der Walle, Wei Wu, Elizabeth H. Margulis, Kelly Jakubowski",
          "abstract": "Musical stimuli are commonly used in psychological research for investigating a range of emotional, cognitive, and physiological processes. Despite this widespread use, many studies continue to rely on ad hoc music stimulus selection, compromising experimental control, reliability, and comparability across studies. Existing musical stimulus sets tend to be limited in variability in terms of style (e.g. comprising 1–3 genres) and familiarity (e.g. focusing on highly familiar or unfamiliar music). In this paper, we introduce MUSIFEAST-17; a music stimulus set featuring 356 instrumental 30-s clips from commercially released music across 17 genres, aiming to increase the ecological validity of studies tailored for UK and US listeners. Designed to reflect the diversity of everyday Western musical experiences, MUSIFEAST-17 includes art music, popular music, and music composed for media. MUSIFEAST-17 includes normative data from 701 UK and US participants, sampled evenly across adulthood (ages 18–75), on familiarity, enjoyment, emotional expression, perceived contrast, genre recognition, thought types, and contextual associations evoked by each excerpt. Analyses indicated that, while some responses vary by genre, nationality, and age group, MUSIFEAST-17 constitutes a set of stimuli that exhibit stylistic diversity, span familiar to unfamiliar music, and cover a range of emotional expressions. The stimulus set prompted various thought types, including memories and fictional imaginings, and contextual associations such as “movie”, “club”, and “concert”. This resource enables systematic stimuli selection for diverse applications within psychology (e.g. emotion studies, aesthetic experience, music-evoked imaginings) and supports Open Research practices.",

          "abstract": "Data collection in experimental linguistics is frequently conducted in laboratory rooms within a research institute, which can be difficult to reach for some participants, for example, those with mobility issues or living further away and in remote areas. This article presents SPRAAKLAB, a mobile laboratory that facilitates the collection of high-quality acoustic and articulatory data outside of university walls, thus bringing the laboratory environment closer to the participants. We present an acoustic analysis of recordings collected inside and outside of the SPRAAKLAB, including transmission loss, signal-to-noise ratio, and harmonics-to-noise ratio. All three measures reveal that the SPRAAKLAB is suitable for collecting consistent, high-quality speech data even in loud environments. Finally, we discuss how the SPRAAKLAB allows us to collect data more easily and facilitates public outreach activities.",

          "authors": "Ihnwhi Heo, Fan Jia, Sarah Depaoli",
          "abstract": "Bayesian piecewise growth models (PGMs) are useful tools to capture nonlinear trends comprised of distinct developmental phases. An important parameter in Bayesian PGMs is the knot location – the time at which transitions arise between phases. While researchers can specify knot locations when they are known a priori, a more flexible approach is to estimate knot locations based on data. The Bayesian estimation of knot locations is largely affected by prior distributions and missing data; however, little is known about the impact of these two factors in recovering knot placements. In the current article, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the impact of different prior specifications and the presence of missing data on the recovery of knot placements in Bayesian PGMs. Simulation results indicated that in small sample sizes, knot location estimates were dictated by prior distributions. Even with larger sample sizes, the estimates remained sensitive to informative and inaccurate prior specifications. The presence of missing data complicated the recovery linked to certain priors. While negative consequences, such as bias in parameter estimates, were caused by a larger amount of missing data, this could be alleviated by informative and accurate priors. These findings emphasize the critical role and intertwined influence of prior distributions and missing data in reaching conclusions about changepoints. We present an illustrative example using real data with missing values to demonstrate the Bayesian estimation of knot locations under realistic scenarios. Recommendations for applied researchers are discussed.",

          "authors": "Andrew B. Speer, Frederick L. Oswald, Dan J. Putka",
          "abstract": "Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly used within organizational research and practice to generate scores representing constructs (e.g., social effectiveness) or behaviors/events (e.g., turnover probability). Ensuring the reliability of AI scores is critical in these contexts, and yet reliability estimates are reported in inconsistent ways, if at all. The current article critically examines reliability estimation for AI scores. We describe different uses of AI scores and how this informs the data and model needed for estimating reliability. Additionally, we distinguish between reliability and validity evidence within this context. We also highlight how the parallel test assumption is required when relying on correlations between AI scores and established measures as an index of reliability, and yet this assumption is frequently violated. We then provide methods that are appropriate for reliability estimation for AI scores that are sensitive to the generalizations one aims to make. In conclusion, we assert that AI reliability estimation is a challenging task that requires a thorough understanding of the issues presented, but a task that is essential to responsible AI work in organizational contexts.",

The extension of study 2 found a small correlation between the tendency to experience regret and risk preferences of participants in the Safe ONLY condition. In Study 3, we failed to replicate Wong and Kwong’s (2007) results that showed a causal effect of personal responsibility and regret possibility on the escalation of commitment. Moreover, study 3’s extension found no support for individual differences in neuroticism on the escalation of commitment. The impact of this replication on our understanding of decision-making processes and the factors that contribute to individuals’ commitment to their choices will be discussed.",

Almost all participants revised their beliefs to align with the consensus; many also qualitatively changed their minds. A consensus was also more persuasive for claims more likely to have a ground truth (i.e., more knowable claims). Although most people were insensitive to consensus independence, some were more persuaded by a consensus formed independently, whereas some were equally convinced by a consensus formed using the same sources.",

          "abstract": "Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys is considered one of the most prolific artists of the 20th century. At the same time, he is also known for his persisting struggles with mental health. Considering that most of his 60+-year career consists of published songs and lyrics, he makes an interesting case study to understand the dynamics of language use in relation to psychological experiences over the course of an individual’s life and career. We identified song lyrics for which he is credited as (co-)writer and analyzed their lyrics ( N = 250) using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. Considering features previously associated with mental health (I-talk, Emotional Tone, Analytic language and Cognitive Processes words) over time, we found that I-talk and Cognitive Processes showed an initial increase, followed by a plateau (in 1967), while Emotional Tone showed a cubic relationship with time, being sensitive to changes in Brian Wilson’s life. Analytic language was highly variable and did not show any patterns. Our data suggest that even carefully crafted language, such as song lyrics, can carry information about the writer’s mental health and that considering language use over the course of an individual’s lifespan can provide crucial insights into psychological processes.",
