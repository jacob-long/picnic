          "title": "Does Truth Pay? Investigating the Effectiveness of the Bayesian Truth Serum With an Interim Payment: A Registered Report",
          "authors": "Claire M. Neville, Matt N. Williams",
          "abstract": "Self-report data are vital in psychological research, but biases such as careless responding and socially desirable responding can compromise their validity. Although various methods are employed to mitigate these biases, they have limitations. The Bayesian truth serum (BTS) offers a survey scoring method to incentivize truthfulness by leveraging correlations between personal and collective opinions and rewarding “surprisingly common” responses. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the BTS in mitigating socially desirable responding to sensitive questions and tested whether an interim payment could enhance its efficacy by increasing trust. In a between-subjects experimental survey, 877 participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: BTS, BTS with interim payment, and regular incentive (RI). Contrary to the hypotheses, participants in the BTS conditions displayed lower agreement with socially undesirable statements compared with the RI condition. The interim payment did not significantly enhance the BTS’s effectiveness. Instead, response patterns diverged from the mechanism’s intended effects, raising concerns about its robustness. As the second registered report to challenge its efficacy, this study’s results cast serious doubt on the BTS as a reliable tool for mitigating socially desirable responding and improving the validity of self-report data in psychological research.",

          "authors": "Connor Mayer, Arya Kondur, Megha Sundara",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the UCI Phonotactic Calculator (UCIPC), a new online tool for quantifying the occurrence of segments and segment sequences in a corpus. This tool has several advantages compared to existing tools: it allows users to supply their own training data, meaning it can be applied to any language for which a corpus is available; it computes a wider range of metrics than most existing tools; and it provides an accessible point-and-click interface that allows researchers with more modest technical backgrounds to take advantage of phonotactic models. After describing the metrics implemented by the calculator and how to use it, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study comparing how well different types of metrics implemented by the UCIPC predict human responses from eight published nonce word acceptability judgment studies across four different languages. These results suggest that metrics that take into account the relative position of sounds and include word boundaries are better at predicting human responses than those that are based on the absolute position of sounds and do not include word boundaries. We close by discussing the usefulness of tools like the UCIPC in experimental design and analysis and outline several areas of future research that this tool will help support.",

          "authors": "Xuan Wen, Leo Malchin, Thilo Womelsdorf",
          "abstract": "Multidimensional 3D-rendered objects are an important component of vision research and video-gaming applications, but it has remained challenging to parametrically control and efficiently generate those objects. Here, we describe a toolbox for controlling and efficiently generating 3D-rendered objects composed of 10 separate visual feature dimensions that can be fine-adjusted using Python scripts. The toolbox defines objects as multidimensional feature vectors with primary dimensions (object body related features), secondary dimensions (head related features), and accessory dimensions (including arms, ears, or beaks). The toolbox interfaces with the freely available Blender software to create objects. The toolbox makes it possible to gradually morph features of multiple feature dimensions, determine the desired feature similarity among objects, and automatize the generation of multiple objects in 3D object and 2D image formats. We document the use of multidimensional objects in a sequence learning task that embeds objects in a 3D-rendered augmented reality environment controlled by the gaming engine Unity. Together, the toolbox features enable the efficient generation of multidimensional objects with fine control of low-level features and higher-level object similarity useful for visual cognitive research and immersive visual environments.",

          "authors": "Hojeong Lee, Soul Kim, Eunsoo Choi",
          "abstract": "Within the past few years, claims of reverse discrimination have been on the rise. However, most studies exploring perceived discrimination among the majority have focused on racial and ethnic conflicts. This study addresses the consequences of perceived discrimination among young South Korean men and explores potential methods to reduce anti-female attitudes based on theories of competitive and common victimhood. Across three studies, we reveal that young Korean men believe they suffer more than women and that their competitive victimhood is associated with anti-female attitudes. In addition, men who read a common victimhood narrative express lower anti-female attitudes compared to those who read a female victimhood narrative or a control narrative. Individual differences, such as anti-feminist attitudes, generally did not moderate the effects of reading a common victimhood narrative. The results of these studies broaden the understanding of intergroup conflict by applying theories of victimhood to the underexplored context of gender conflict and suggest that a common victimhood narrative may be a viable method for reducing anti-female attitudes.",

          "authors": "Crystal L. Hoyt, Jeni L. Burnette, E. Nathan Kyler",
          "abstract": "We investigated two related mindsets about the malleable or fixed nature of socioeconomic mobility and their distinct influences on stigma toward those in poverty. Across four studies, conducted in the United States ( N = 1,057), we explored mindsets about individual potential to change social class, what we called individual mobility mindsets (I_MM), and mindsets about societal opportunities for socioeconomic mobility, or societal mobility mindsets (S_MM). Although the mindsets were positively correlated, they had distinct focal points and, importantly, they differentially predicted outcomes. For example, I_MM was positively linked to individual-level attributes like grit, whereas S_MM was negatively linked to systemic attributions for social class and to beliefs that inequality is unjust. Additionally, I_MM was negatively related to stigma toward those in poverty, whereas S_MM was positively linked to it. This was largely due to the differential links to essentialism—that is, to the view that poverty is an inherent and defining characteristic. Although both types of mindsets were positively linked to blame, which is a known driver of stigma, I_MM was negatively linked to essentialism and S_MM was positively linked to it. We discuss different models of mindsets and stigma.",

          "abstract": "Although interpersonal confrontation is a powerful means of curbing bias, perpetrators often levy social costs on confronters. Two experiments with U.S. undergraduate participants tested whether social costs and bias reduction have separate underlying processes that occur independently or are interrelated. We also investigated the effect of perpetrator–confronter proximity on social costs (Experiment 1) and persistence of social costs (Experiment 2). Results indicated (a) confrontation elicited negative other-directed affect, which was a mediator of social costs but not bias reduction; (b) confrontation elicited negative self-directed affect, which was a mediator of bias reduction but largely unrelated to social costs; and (c) social costs and bias reduction were unrelated. Furthermore, face-to-face compared to more remote confrontation amplified social costs, and social costs increased across time. In contrast, proximity and time did not influence bias reduction. These findings demonstrate the persistence of social costs and the independence of social costs and bias reduction.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, forced-choice (FC) measures have received considerable attention from researchers and practitioners in industrial and organizational psychology. Despite the growing body of research on FC measures, there has not yet been a comprehensive review synthesizing the diverse lines of research. This article bridges this gap by presenting a systematic review of post-2000 literature on FC measures, addressing ten critical questions, including: 1) validity evidence, 2) faking resistance, 3) FC IRT models, 4) FC test design, 5) FC measure development, 6) test-taker reactions and response processes, 7) measurement and predictive bias, 8) reliability, 9) computerized adaptive testing, and 10) random responding. The review adopts a historical perspective, tracing the development of FC measures and highlighting key empirical findings, methodological advances, current trends, and future directions. By synthesizing a substantial body of evidence across multiple research streams, this article serves as a valuable resource, providing insights into the psychometric properties, theoretical underpinnings, and practical applications of FC measures in organizational contexts such as personnel selection, development, and assessment.",

          "abstract": "Research is a paradoxical process. Scholars confront conflicting yet interwoven pressures, considering methodologies that engage complexity and simplicity, induction and deduction, novelty and continuity, and more. Paradox theory offers insights that embrace such tensions, providing empirical examples that harness creative friction to foster more novel and useful, rigorous, and relevant research. Leveraging this lens, we open a conversation on research tensions, developing the foundations of a Paradox Approach to Methods applicable to organization studies more broadly. To do so, we first identify tensions raised at six methodological decision points: research scope, construct definition, underlying assumptions, data collection, data analysis, and interpretation. Second, we build on paradox theory to identify navigating practices: accepting, differentiating, integrating, and knotting. By doing so, we contribute to organizational research broadly by embracing methods of tensions to advance scholarly insight.",

          "abstract": "Using a DNA-based polygenic index, we explored geographical and historical differences in polygenic associations with educational attainment in East and West Germany around the time of reunification. This index was derived from a prior genome-wide association study on educational attainment in democratic countries. In 1,930 individuals aged 25 to 85 years from the SOEP-G[ene] cohort, the magnitude of polygenic associations with educational attainment did not differ between East and West Germany before reunification but increased in East Germany thereafter. This gene–environment interaction remained robust when we probed for variance dispersion. A control analysis using a polygenic index of height suggests that this interaction is unlikely to reflect a general trend toward greater genetic associations in East Germany after reunification. The observed amplification of education-genetic associations aligns with theories suggesting heightened genetic influences on educational attainment during periods of greater social and educational opportunity. We emphasize the need for replication in larger German genetic data sets.",

          "abstract": "Music listening can evoke a wide range of thought types, including autobiographical memories, fictional stories, visual imagery, and mind-wandering. Previous studies have typically examined these thought types individually, which precludes investigation of why certain music evokes certain thought types over others. This study investigates the impact of musical genre, familiarity, enjoyment, contrast, and emotional expression on the occurrence of different thought types during music listening across 17 genres targeted towards UK and US listeners. We systematically selected 356 music excerpts and collected data from 701 participants from the United Kingdom and the United States, analysing the frequency of thoughts occurring during these excerpts and various excerpt ratings (e.g., familiarity, emotional expression). We found significant genre-specific effects on thought types, such as Film music primarily evoking media memories and fictional imaginings. Familiarity, contrast, enjoyment, valence, and arousal ratings all significantly influenced certain thought types, suggesting that both compositional features and one’s previous experiences of music affect listeners’ inner mental worlds. This study extends previous research by exploring a broader range of genres and musical features, offering new insights into the mental landscape of thoughts occurring during music listening.",
