          "authors": "Mehdi Ebrahimi Mehr, Jamal Amani Rad",
          "abstract": "This study critically examines the cognitive and theoretical foundations of the alpha parameter within the Lévy flight model (LFM), an extension of the diffusion decision model (DDM) that incorporates heavy-tailed noise distributions. The alpha parameter, which modulates the tail of these distributions, is assessed for its test–retest reliability – an essential criterion for its classification as a cognitive style measure. Utilizing data from three previous studies, we observed that alpha demonstrates consistent reliability across tasks and time points, supporting its role as a trait-like characteristic. Our observation regarding the interrelations between LFM parameters showed that although most parameters exhibited weak correlations, reflecting their representation of distinct aspects of data, moderate correlations were observed between alpha and both threshold and non-decision time. Furthermore, investigating practice effects, we observed consistent reductions in non-decision time, threshold, and often alpha across sessions, accompanied by a corresponding increase in drift rate in demanding tasks. Notably, alpha showed a strong relationship with the mean reaction time of error responses, indicating its critical role in explaining fast error responses. Additionally, our examination of the predicted decision-time distribution found that lower alpha values correspond to shorter response times in the first quartile of both correct and error responses, highlighting its impact on capturing the dynamics of fast decision-making. Employing the BayesFlow framework for parameter estimation, we evaluated its precision across varying trial counts. These findings offer insights for future research on LFM and similar models.",

          "authors": "Ti-Fen Pan, Jing-Jing Li, Bill Thompson, Anne GE Collins",
          "abstract": "Extracting time-varying latent variables from computational cognitive models plays a key role in uncovering the dynamic cognitive processes that drive behaviors. However, existing methods are limited to inferring latent variable sequences in a relatively narrow class of cognitive models. For example, a broad class of relevant cognitive models with intractable likelihood is currently out of reach of standard techniques, based on maximum a posteriori parameter estimation. Here, we present a simulation-based approach that leverages recurrent neural networks to map experimental data directly to the targeted latent variable space. We first show in simulations that our approach achieves competitive performance in inferring latent variable sequences in both likelihood-tractable and intractable models. We then demonstrate its applicability in real world datasets. Furthermore, the approach is practical to standard-size, individual data, generalizable across different computational models, and adaptable for continuous and discrete latent spaces. Our work underscores that combining recurrent neural networks and simulated data to identify model latent variable sequences broadens the scope of cognitive models researchers can explore, enabling testing a wider range of theories.",

          "abstract": "High-level cognition, such as intelligence and creativity, are considered the hallmark of human cognition; however, their complexity hinders the identification of underlying common mechanisms. We focus on one such likely mechanism—mental navigation. We utilize converging computational methods to demonstrate how mental navigation—operationalized via verbal fluency tasks—predicts individual differences in creativity, intelligence, and openness to experience (the personality trait most closely related to them). Participants’ ( N = 479) responses to two tasks—a 2-min animal fluency task and a 2-min generating synonyms of the word “hot” fluency task—were modeled over a multidimensional model (a cognitive multiplex network) of the mental lexicon. Quantitative measures of their mental navigation were used to build regression models that significantly predicted their assessed high-level cognition (replicating across both fluency tasks). Finally, we developed an online tool that capitalizes on our approach—the High-level Cognitive Prediction tool. Overall, we show how converging computational tools can elucidate the complexity of high-level cognition.",

The gains that Black Americans have made were seen as coming at the expense of Asian Americans, suggesting a potential zero-sum perception. Three studies ( N = 1,475 CloudResearch online participants) examined the extent to which Asian, Black, and White Americans perceived a zero-sum competition between Asian and Black people. Studies 1 and 2 showed that Asian and White participants were more likely than Black participants to endorse the zero-sum belief that Asian Americans are losing to Black Americans. Studies 2 and 3 showed that participants perceived Asian Americans as losing more to White than Black people. Study 3 found that when Asian Americans perceived the Asian-Black relations in zero-sum terms, they were less supportive of Black people and perceived less support from Black people, but belief in Asian-White competition predicted stronger pro-Black sentiments.",

          "abstract": "Cross-sectional research demonstrates that intimate partners generally hold similar political preferences. It is unclear, however, whether intimate partners influence each other’s preferences over time. We address this oversight by investigating the transmission of political party support across 1,613 woman-man couples in long-term intimate relationships using 10 annual waves of longitudinal panel data. Actor-partner interdependence random intercepts cross-lagged panel models revealed that within-person increases in an intimate partner’s party support predicted within-person increases in the other couple member’s party support the following year. These partner effects emerged for six political parties in New Zealand and, with only one exception, did not differ in strength across women and men. Partner effects for self-rated political orientation were not significant. These results suggest that couples mutually reinforce each other’s political party support over time, advancing understanding of the interpersonal transmission of political preferences and identifying a dyadic process that may contribute to political polarization.",

          "abstract": "When leaders forgive, does it influence follower trust? This study examines whether forgiveness creates an integrity–benevolence dilemma for leaders, potentially reducing follower trust. Across three studies ( N = 1,235), findings reveal that forgiveness has a dual impact: it decreases integrity-based trust while enhancing benevolence-based trust. These findings were consistent across studies with controlled scenarios depicting typical organizational misconduct and a behavioral experiment with real stakes. Moreover, the negative impact of forgiveness on integrity-based trust was more pronounced in cases involving moral transgressions rather than competence, and when the consequences of the misconduct were severe (Study 1). However, when leaders explicitly articulated the moral principles behind their forgiveness, the negative effect on integrity was mitigated (Studies 2 and 3). These findings offer theoretical insights into leader forgiveness and trust as well as practical guidance for leaders to manage the forgiveness dilemma effectively.",

          "abstract": "The self-interest bias describes an inclination of people to evaluate transgressors morally better when the latter’s actions serve the former’s interests. Effective interventions to mitigate this type of self-serving bias remain underexplored. The current research investigates education and accountability as potential moderators of this bias. In preregistered Study 1 ( N = 668), as predicted, educating participants about the self-interest bias eliminated its effect on their moral character judgments. However, across three preregistered accountability studies ( N = 2,239), holding participants accountable for their judgments did not attenuate the bias. Similarly, in preregistered Study 5 ( N = 641), we found no evidence of a combined effect of education and accountability on reducing the bias. These findings suggest that while increasing awareness through education may effectively reduce biased moral judgments, accountability, especially when lacking external scrutiny or consequences, does not. Theoretical implications, methodological limitations, and future research opportunities are discussed.",

This study aimed to test the efficacy of very slow pentatonic melodic sequences in facilitating sleep onset compared with a silence control condition. Twenty-two participants slept for four nights in a sleep lab with polysomnographic recording. The four nights included a first adaptation night and three experimental nights. Two nights included musical stimulation with speed in the delta and sub-delta range (1 Hz and 0.2 Hz, respectively), and one night included silence (control). The two musical stimulations consisted of pentatonic melodic sequences. Music was played from lights off until the onset of the slow-wave sleep (SWS) stage. Sleep onset latency, N1 duration, N2 latency, first N2 duration, SWS latency, sleep architecture, and spectral power of the interval from lights off to sleep onset were assessed from polysomnographic recordings. The results showed shorter latencies for sleep onset, N2, and SWS latencies with 0.2 Hz pentatonic sequences. Spectral analysis of the electroencephalography (EEG) data from lights off to sleep onset showed a significant increase in delta EEG oscillations in both musical conditions. Very slow musical stimulation can facilitate sleep onset.",

In contrast, research focussed on professional musicians indicates they experience higher than general population average rates of anxiety and depression symptoms. In addition, despite the creative process of ensemble music-making being a joint endeavour, current approaches to addressing mental wellbeing largely focus on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms and suggest individual solutions. In response, the aim of this research is to understand how professional orchestral musicians themselves perceive mental wellbeing (both their own and that of other musicians they know), with a particular focus on relational aspects. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 musicians from full-time professional orchestras across Australia and were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. This study contributes to knowledge about wellbeing for professional orchestral musicians by demonstrating a range of relational issues and how they impact the individual wellbeing of musicians both positively and negatively. In particular, the interconnectedness of experience and the impact of close, longstanding work relationships are discussed, as well as the contrast between experiences of secrecy and open communication.",

In two experiments, we examined listeners’ preferences for Baroque violin music performed on period and modern instruments. In Experiment 1, collegiate musicians listened to an excerpt from Telemann’s Concerto à 4 Violini No. 1 performed both on period instruments and modern instruments and indicated which performance they preferred. Results revealed a small but nonsignificant preference for the period instruments and participants explained that their preferences were primarily due to elements related to tuning, intonation, and key. In Experiment 2, participants listened to both recordings and rated their enjoyment and perceived performance quality. However, participants heard one of the three types of framing information (congruent, incongruent, or none) regarding the instruments used in the recording (period vs. modern instruments). Participants provided significantly higher enjoyment ratings when they were told they were listening to period instrument recordings, whether or not they actually heard period instruments. However, significant condition by order interaction effects indicate that participants’ perceptions were further influenced by the order of recordings.",
