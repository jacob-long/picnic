          "abstract": "Postpublication critique, such as letters to the editor, can contribute to the validity and trustworthiness of scientific research. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the policy and practice of postpublication critique in (a) randomly selected ( N = 100) and (b) prominent ( N = 100) psychology journals. In 2023, an explicit submission option for postpublication critique was available at 23% (95% confidence interval [CI] = [16%, 32%]) of randomly sampled psychology journals and 38% of the most prominent psychology journals. Journals sometimes imposed limits on the length and time allowed to submit critiques. We manually inspected two random samples of empirical articles published in 2020 (articles per sample: N = 101), estimating the prevalence of postpublication critique to be 0% (95% CI = [0%, 3.7%]) in psychology journals generally and 1% (95% CI = [0.2%, 5.4%]) in the most prominent psychology journals. The policy and practice of postpublication critique is seriously neglected in psychology journals.",

          "abstract": "Concerns for the replicability, reliability, and generalizability of MRI and functional MRI (fMRI) research have led to debates over the contributions of sample size, open-science practices, and recruitment methods, particularly in the psychological sciences. Key to understanding the state of a science is an assessment of reporting practices. In this structured review, we evaluated select reporting practices across three domains: (a) demographic (e.g., age), (b) methodological (e.g., inclusion/exclusion criteria), and (c) open science and generalizability (e.g., preregistration, target-population identification). Included were 919 published MRI and fMRI studies from 2019 in nine top-ranked journals. Reporting across domains was infrequent; participant racial-ethnic identity (14.8%), reasons for missing imaging data (31.2%), and identification of a target population (19.4%) were particularly low. Reporting likelihood varied by study characteristics (e.g., journal) and was correlated across domains. Finally, study sample size but not reporting frequency was positively associated with 2-year citation counts. Results call for recentering transparency in reporting practices in MRI and fMRI studies, with direct implications for study generalizability.",

          "abstract": "Mobile eye-tracking is increasingly used to study human behavior in situ; however, the analysis of the footage is typically performed manually and therefore is slow and laborious. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which the footage obtained using mobile eye-tracking could be annotated automatically using computer vision algorithms. We developed an open-source Python package that combined two computer vision algorithms to automatically annotate human-body-related areas of interest when two participants interacted with each other. To validate the algorithm, three experienced human raters coded the gaze direction with respect to one of seven a priori defined areas of interest during the task. To test the reliability of the algorithm, the agreement between the human raters was compared with the results obtained from the algorithm. A total of 1,188 frames from 13 trials were compared, with the results revealing substantial agreement between the algorithm and human raters (Krippendorff’s alpha = 0.61). The algorithm strictly annotated whether gaze was within or outside of the specified areas of interest, whereas human raters seemed to apply a tolerance when gaze was lying slightly outside the areas of interest. In sum, the computer algorithmic approach appears to provide a valid means of automatically annotating mobile eye-tracking footage in highly dynamic contexts. The possibility of automatically annotating eye-tracking footage of human interactions allows for automatic assessment of visual attention, gaze, and intentions across sectors such as educational settings, pedestrian navigation, and sport.",

          "authors": "Filip Moons, Ellen Vandervieren",
          "abstract": "Cohen’s and Fleiss’ kappa are well-known measures of inter-rater agreement, but they restrict each rater to selecting only one category per subject. This limitation is consequential in contexts where subjects may belong to multiple categories, such as psychiatric diagnoses involving multiple disorders or classifying interview snippets into multiple codes of a codebook. We propose a generalized version of Fleiss’ kappa, which accommodates multiple raters assigning subjects to one or more nominal categories. Our proposed $$\\kappa $$ κ statistic can incorporate category weights based on their importance and account for hierarchical category structures, such as primary disorders with sub-disorders. The new $$\\kappa $$ κ statistic can also manage missing data and variations in the number of raters per subject or category. We review existing methods that allow for multiple category assignments and detail the derivation of our measure, proving its equivalence to Fleiss’ kappa when raters select a single category per subject. The paper discusses the assumptions, premises, and potential paradoxes of the new measure, as well as the range of possible values and guidelines for interpretation. The measure was developed to investigate the reliability of a new mathematics assessment method, of which an example is elaborated. The paper concludes with a worked-out example of psychiatrists diagnosing patients with multiple disorders. All calculations are provided as R script and an Excel sheet to facilitate access to the new $$\\kappa $$ κ statistic.",

          "abstract": "Researcher degrees of freedom in data analysis present significant challenges in social sciences, where different analytical decisions can lead to varying conclusions. In this work, we propose an example of an exploratory multiverse simulation to empirically compare various decision pathways to identify an effect’s sensitivity to different analytical choices. The approach is demonstrated on the congruency sequence effect (CSE), a well-studied phenomenon in cognitive control research. We reviewed existing literature to identify common non-theory-specific analytical decisions, such as outlier exclusion criteria and hypothesis testing methods, and incorporated these into our simulation framework. Using 20,000 simulated datasets, we compared the true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) across 50 different decision pathways, resulting in a total of 1 million analyses. Our results indicate substantial differences in power and type I error rates across the analytical pathways, with some posing a significant risk of producing high false positives. The findings underscore the importance of running extensive simulations to investigate different data handling and hypothesis testing approaches in certain research fields. This case study serves as an example for conducting similar simulation procedures in research fields characterized by high variability in analytical decisions when investigating an otherwise widely accepted effect.",

          "authors": "Lukas W. Mayer, Desislava Bocheva, Joanne Hinds, Olivia Brown, Lukasz Piwek, David A. Ellis",
          "abstract": "Across disciplines, research often relies on groups of people to participate in experiments or attend events at the same time. Typically, researchers try to maximize attendance by manually identifying a set of times that suit the diaries of many individuals. However, this is inefficient, is prone to error, and can lead to a final sample that is not large enough to provide meaningful inferences. While current scheduling tools are useful for individual-based research, enabling participants to select times convenient to them within a researcher's preset parameters, they are less useful in research that requires specific or flexible group sizes. In response, we present Optimeet , a web application that allows researchers to upload participants’ availability data and generate an optimal allocation schedule for multiple groups. We describe the function of the underlying applet, which identifies a schedule to maximize attendance by treating it as a computational problem involving combinatorial optimization (Experiment 1). Our solution relies on an empirical comparison of parameter-free heuristics to make allocation decisions that make the best use of participants’ availabilities and the derivation of appropriate performance metrics. Of the algorithms evaluated, one consistently outperformed comparable versions of existing tools, which we verified in a further exercise (Experiment 2) involving a large human sample ( N = 5,289). We consider the methodological utility and practical value of these developments, and include detailed documentation, code, and a video tutorial so that researchers can rapidly employ Optimeet to support group research.",

          "abstract": "The present research integrates lay theories of activism and inequity-framing literatures to investigate how Black and White Americans perceive antiracism organizations with different expressed goals (i.e., tackling White power/privilege, tackling discrimination, or increasing people of color’s strengths). White Americans perceived a power-focused (vs. discrimination-focused and strength-focused) organization as less valuable, expressed less interest in engaging the organization in their local community, and perceived the organization as less effective at responding to people of color’s needs and reducing discrimination (Studies 1–2; N = 799). In contrast, Black Americans perceived nonsignificant or significantly smaller differences across organizational goals. When Black Americans’ perceptions were communicated to White Americans, White people’s perceptions of a power-focused organization were significantly improved (Study 3; N = 471). Findings highlight a need and a novel strategy to educate White people toward dismantling White power and privilege.",

          "authors": "Mengsi Xu, Jiayu Wen, Zhiai Li",
          "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between social exclusion and behavioral inhibition is essential for mitigating its detrimental effects and developing targeted interventions. This study examines the impact of short- and long-term social exclusion on reactive and intentional inhibition through three experiments. Experiment 1 utilized the Cyberball game to induce a short-term experience of exclusion, Experiment 2 employed the Future Life Alone paradigm to evoke imagined long-term exclusion, and Experiment 3 used a questionnaire to identify individuals who had experienced actual long-term exclusion. Reactive and intentional inhibition were assessed using the Free Two-Choice Oddball Task. Three key findings emerged: First, both short- and long-term social exclusion significantly impaired intentional inhibition. Second, diffusion model analyses revealed distinct mechanisms underlying these impairments: short-term social exclusion increased the tendency toward standard responses during free-choice trials, while long-term exclusion led to more conservative response criteria. Third, reactive inhibition was unaffected by short-term or imagined long-term exclusion but was impaired by actual long-term exclusion. Collectively, these findings suggest that although short- and long-term exclusion share some similarities in their effects on behavioral inhibition, they also exhibit notable differences. This study provides novel insights into the influence of social exclusion on behavioral inhibition, with theoretical, methodological, and practical implications.",

          "authors": "Peiling Cao, Rongzi Ma, Yue Yuan, Xiaomin Sun",
          "abstract": "Time poverty, a persistent feeling of insufficient time, significantly affects interpersonal dynamics, particularly help-seeking and help-giving. Across five studies using hypothetical scenarios (Studies 1a and 1b), academic (Study 2), and everyday contexts (Study 3), we found that time poverty consistently fosters a mismatch wherein individuals’ help-seeking behaviors exceed their willingness to provide help, regardless of task interdependence (Studies 1a and 1b). Zero-sum beliefs about time emerge as a key mediator explaining the effect of time poverty on this imbalance, a mechanism substantiated by both correlational (Studies 2 and 3) and causal (Study 4) evidence. Moreover, findings reveal that time poverty reduces both help-provider’s and help-seeker’s preference for autonomy-oriented help relative to dependency-oriented help (Studies 1b and 3), suggesting an additional adverse consequence for personal growth and development.",

          "authors": "Xavier Mínguez-Alcaide, Magdalena Bobowik",
          "abstract": "Research on the relationship between identification factors and musical preference show contradictory results. Some studies do not find relationship between these, while others show that social identification predicts stronger music preference. The present study further delves into that controversy in the understudied context of Electronic Dance Music (EDM). Furthermore, we examine the role of two categories of emotions, namely, vitality (representing energy, joy, and power) and sublimity (representing feelings of transcendence, tranquility, or nostalgia) in the relationship between identification factors and EDM preference. To test these ideas, we conducted two studies, including a correlational survey study with a sample of 222 EDM fans in the Basque Country and a qualitative study using a focus group methodology with 25 members of the same community. Results show that stronger musical identification is associated with preference for EDM only indirectly via vitality emotions and to a lesser degree, sublimity emotions. In contrast, the more negative (and not positive) musical collective self-esteem, the stronger was the preference for EDM, and again this link was explained via mostly vitality emotions. The qualitative study corroborated the existence and acceptance of negative collective self-esteem among EDM fans, an aspect related to the strong stigma generated by the Basque society.",
