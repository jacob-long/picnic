          "abstract": "Latent class analysis (LCA) can help identify unobserved classes of individuals in a population based on collected categorical data. It is commonly used in psychology to test hypotheses about sources of heterogeneity and class characteristics. However, careful decision-making is required in the modeling process. Its flexibility may explain why it is becoming more commonly used in psychology; however, it also highlights that there are many decision points in the modeling process, thus warranting a systematic literature review to document the use of LCA in psychology, mapping both the prevalence and quality of LCA studies. This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines and involved a comprehensive search across multiple databases, yielding 7,580 records related to latent class analysis. After removing duplicates and selecting a representative subsample, 377 documents were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 251 publications (comprising 313 LCAs) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were reviewed for this study. Each study was meticulously coded to map how the authors performed and reported each step of the LCA. Our analysis of these studies, in comparison with published guidelines, revealed notable discrepancies in how LCA is applied and reported. To support researchers in enhancing the quality of future LCA applications, we summarize key recommendations in a final section that outlines best practices for future LCA applications. The findings indicate a growing use of LCA in psychology but also highlight the need for greater methodological rigor and transparency in its implementation.",

          "abstract": "Researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs are enthusiastically exploring and promoting ways to apply generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools to qualitative data analysis. From promises of automated coding and thematic analysis to functioning as a virtual research assistant that supports researchers in diverse interpretive and analytical tasks, the potential applications of GenAI in qualitative research appear vast. In this paper, we take a step back and ask what sort of technological artifact is GenAI and evaluate whether it is appropriate for qualitative data analysis. We provide an accessible, technologically informed analysis of GenAI, specifically large language models (LLMs), and put to the test the claimed transformative potential of using GenAI in qualitative data analysis. Our evaluation illustrates significant shortcomings that, if the technology is adopted uncritically by management researchers, will introduce unacceptable epistemic risks. We explore these epistemic risks and emphasize that the essence of qualitative data analysis lies in the interpretation of meaning, an inherently human capability.",

          "abstract": "Previous research attributes differences in working styles (e.g., diligence, excessive hours) primarily to individual traits or values, such as workaholism, neglecting cultural context. This research introduces cultural work ideals—subjective perceptions of societal expectations about work—and distinguishes between perceived cultural values of (a) hard work (i.e., efficiency, high quality, wise time use) and (b) excessive work (i.e., long hours, high quantity, constant work prioritization). We develop and validate the I ndividual Perceptions of C ultural H ard and E xcessive W ork (I-CHEW) Scale across six diverse North American samples ( N = 1,902), including full-time employees, business undergraduates, MBA students, and alumni. Psychometric analyses support the I-CHEW’s reliability and validity. As hypothesized, perceiving a cultural ideal of hard work predicts beneficial outcomes (e.g., lower cynicism, higher engagement) beyond individual, organizational, and cultural factors. Conversely, perceiving a cultural ideal of excessive work predicts negative outcomes, including greater emotional exhaustion, reduced well-being and job satisfaction, and poorer physical health.",

          "abstract": "In spontaneous trait transference (STT), communicators describing the behavior of others (i.e., actors) are perceived as having the personality traits implied by the behavior they describe. We tested whether this effect relies on moderators that are indicative of rule-based, attributional processes: the communicator-actor relation (friends vs. enemies; Experiment 1), the diagnosticity of the statement for inferring the implied trait to the communicator (Experiment 2), and the validity of the statement (i.e., whether it was actually provided by the communicator; Experiment 3). In line with attributional theories, trait ratings revealed a joint impact of the three moderators. Experiment 4 showed that communicators were attributed alternative traits—not implied by the behavior itself, but by the fact that they described the behavior. Together, our results suggest that participants attribute traits to the communicator based on the communicator’s behavior (i.e., the act of describing the behavior of someone else).",

          "abstract": "Voting is a pillar of democracy, yet its psychological correlates remain understudied outside the West. We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample ( N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",
