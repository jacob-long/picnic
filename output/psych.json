          "authors": "Kushin Mukherjee, Holly Huey, Laura M. Stoinski, Martin N. Hebart, Judith E. Fan, Wilma A. Bainbridge",
          "abstract": "The development of large datasets of natural images has galvanized progress in psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. Notably, the THINGS database constitutes a collective effort towards understanding of human visual knowledge by accumulating rich data on a shared set of visual object concepts across several studies. In this paper, we introduce ( DoT ), a novel dataset of 28,627 human drawings of 1854 diverse object concepts, sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language, mirroring the structure of the THINGS image database. In addition to data on drawings’ stroke history, we further collected fine-grained recognition data for each drawing, along with metadata on participant demographics, drawing ability, and mental imagery. We characterize people’s ability to communicate and recognize semantic information encoded in drawings and compare this ability to their ability to recognize real-world images of the same visual objects. We also explore the relationship between drawing understanding and the memorability and typicality of the objects contained in THINGS. In sum, we envision DoT as a powerful tool that builds on the THINGS database to advance understanding of how humans express knowledge about visual concepts.",

          "authors": "Matthew K. Robison, Stephen Campbell, Lauren D. Garner, Ciara Sibley, Joseph Coyne",
          "abstract": "The present study examined individual differences in 24 measures of cognitive ability in a sample of young adults ( N = 255). Each measure was completed twice, separated by a period of 2 weeks, to assess test–retest reliability and retesting (i.e., practice) effects. Latent variable modeling was used to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the measures, as they were selected to measure seven different cognitive constructs (attention control, processing speed, working memory, primary memory, secondary memory, fluid intelligence, and spatial ability). The measures showed adequate to high intrasession and intersession reliability. Construct-level estimates were highly reliable, and the measurement structure was invariant across the two testing occasions. In several instances, correlations among latent variables warranted further testing to ensure adequate discriminability. Finally, latent state-trait modeling indicated that the majority of systematic variance in cognitive measures is due to latent traits, rather than state-specific or task-specific factors. We discuss the practical and theoretical implications of these findings.",

          "authors": "Hiromichi Hagihara, Kazuki Miyazawa",
          "abstract": "This study examined how well large language models (LLMs) approximate human psychological ratings for early-acquired English words. We used four state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o and Meta-Llama-3.1, to evaluate 21 static psychological features for 695 words and compared these estimates with human norms. The results showed that LLMs aligned well with human ratings for some features (e.g., Concreteness, Bodily Interactiveness) in terms of rank correlations ( r s &gt; .82) and distributional similarities but diverged notably for others (e.g., Iconicity, Arousal; r s &lt; .48). Compared with content words, function words showed more pronounced discrepancies between human and LLM ratings. We also assessed how similarly human- and LLM-derived psychological features predicted words’ age of acquisition (AoA), revealing both strong correspondences and systematic biases, depending on the model (differences in correlations ranged from −.27 to .28). Based on these analyses, we identified which features may be reliably estimated using LLMs, which require further refinement, and what methodological considerations are necessary for applying LLM-based measures in cognitive science. We discuss the implications of using LLMs as methodological tools in psychology and cognitive science, highlighting both their practical advantages (e.g., data coverage and data collection efficiency) and theoretical relevance. The present study provides a novel framework for evaluating the cognitive plausibility of LLMs by using lexical psychological features, complementing existing benchmarks.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup attitudes can be positively influenced by peers, but it remains unclear whether this occurs primarily through ingroup socialization or outgroup contact. Prior studies concurrently exploring both pathways have yielded mixed results. This paper introduces two key factors, ingroup identification and interpersonal dislike, as potentially moderating or counteracting the effects of these processes. We incorporate these factors into a comprehensive statistical model that accounts for various mechanisms associated with outgroup attitude change, including peer influence, ingroup and outgroup contact, ethnic and attitudinal homophily in friendship selection, and general relationship formation dynamics. Using stochastic actor-oriented modeling (SAOM), we analyze longitudinal data on coevolving networks and attitudes among 380 German secondary school adolescents. Our findings show that both outgroup contact among German adolescents and ingroup socialization significantly influence outgroup attitude change. However, interpersonal dislike and ingroup identification do not play a meaningful role in these processes.",

          "authors": "Maxim Trenkenschuh, Helen Landmann",
          "abstract": "Understanding our relation to animals is essential to tackle global challenges that arise out of the prioritization of human over nonhuman animal interests, like in the case of meat consumption. Meat is linked to ethically questionable animal agriculture practices, climate change, biodiversity loss, and pandemics. To understand the prioritization and legitimization of the human–animal relation, we utilized the ingroup projection model for human–animal relations. In a correlational study ( N 1 = 652) and an experiment ( N 2 = 309), we investigated ingroup projection—the process in which humans project “their” traits onto the superordinate category of the animal kingdom. Ingroup projection was associated with less speciesism and less meat consumption justification. Opposite to interhuman relations, for those high in supremacy beliefs, diversity perception was related to reduced ingroup projection. Experimental evidence for the effect of diversity perception was inconsistent. However, ingroup projection was associated with less legitimizing beliefs across both studies. Based on these findings, we introduce the (ingroup projection model for human–animal relations as a special case of the ingroup projection model, which bridges research on human–animal relations with dehumanization and anthropomorphization research. Our work provides a further step towards an interdependent understanding of our connectedness to and detachment from the animal kingdom.",

          "abstract": "Group and intergroup research often addresses the ways in which people care about a specific group but focuses less on caring about groups in general. Here, we investigate individual differences in how likely people are to join and invest in the groups to which they belong. This idea is related to collectivism, but collectivism measures have been plagued by theoretical and measurement weaknesses. We therefore developed a Group Orientation Scale and a Generalized Identification Scale to measure how much people care about groups, and test the scales’ predictive validity alongside related constructs. Both measures are reliable but the Group Orientation Scale items were found to be easier to comprehend. Furthermore, group orientation predicts identification with real and minimal groups, the intensity of emotional reactions to group concerns, contributions made in a public goods dilemma, intentions to engage in personal sacrifice to limit coronavirus infections, and motivation in group tasks.",

          "abstract": "Fostering prosociality in adolescents is essential for social cohesion and well-being, yet the psychological processes underlying individual differences remain understudied. Guided by moral identity theory, this research examined how moral identity internalization and symbolization relate to prosociality and whether moral elevation mediates these associations. Across three studies, moral identity internalization showed a stronger and more consistent association with prosociality than symbolization. Study 1, using cross-sectional data, found that both moral identity internalization and symbolization were related to prosociality through moral elevation. Study 2 utilized a mediation pathway analysis and found that moral identity internalization was positively associated with moral elevation and prosociality, and that moral elevation was further associated with prosociality. Study 3 employed a measurement-of-mediation design, providing additional evidence that moral elevation mediates the link between moral identity internalization and prosociality. These findings suggest that moral elevation is a key mechanism linking moral identity to prosociality and that interventions fostering moral elevation may support adolescents’ prosocial development.",

          "abstract": "Organizations often endure across multiple generations of members—and what one generation preaches may not always align with what another generation practices. We demonstrate that people attribute such inconsistency to hypocrisy, even when over half a century separates the practicing and preaching. Five experiments and three supplemental studies demonstrate this intergenerational hypocrisy effect ( N = 4,482). Organizations were perceived as more hypocritical, their actions seemed less legitimate, and people were more motivated to protest against them when the organization’s words and deeds were (vs. were not) misaligned across generations of members. We test several moderators, and find that to attenuate the intergenerational hypocrisy effect, organizations can attribute their word–deed inconsistency to moral principles that they paid a tangible cost to uphold. The results suggest that organizations risk reputational damage in a wider array of situations than previously appreciated.",

          "authors": "Julia A. Schreiber, Özden Melis Uluğ, John Drury",
          "abstract": "Most research on solidarity focuses on democratic, low-repressive contexts. However, support for Palestinians in the Global North shows that solidarity can also emerge in democracies with issue-specific repression, where costs and risks for solidarity are higher, and dominant narratives limit alternative perspectives. This article explores which beliefs, emotions, and attitudes predict low-cost (i.e., low effort/risk) and high-cost (i.e., high effort/risk) solidarity in such contexts. We conducted three studies during major Israel/Palestine escalations: a 2009 German convenience sample ( N = 305) and two 2024 representative samples from Germany ( N = 412) and the United Kingdom ( N = 409). Perceived peaceful intentions and guilt toward Palestinians predicted both types of solidarity. Perceived injustice and moral outrage were more linked to low-cost solidarity, while perceived collective ownership of the land was stronger for high-cost solidarity. Power imbalance, admiration, sympathy, hate, and antisemitism played no or minor roles for solidarity in these contexts. The results highlight the distinct nature of conflict-related solidarity under issue-specific repression compared to solidarity under low repression.",

          "abstract": "While it is well-established that educational attainment and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) are negatively correlated, it remains unclear why, as causal effects are hard to distinguish from the effects of confounders. Here, we use an adaptation of the discordant twin design in a structural equation framework (ACE-β models) with 1264 Norwegian monozygotic and dizygotic twins, to investigate whether education and RWA remain associated after controlling for confounders from genes and environmental influences shared by twins. Our model estimates that 25% of the covariance between education and RWA reflects genetic confounders, 47% reflects shared-environmental confounders, and 28% of the covariance remains unaccounted for. This remaining covariance then reflects causal effects and/or environmental confounders not shared by twins. Perceived socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood accounted for about one-third of the shared-environmental confounding. We did not find evidence that effects of education on RWA are mediated by perceived SES in adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Widespread narratives frame mental illness as a sign of inherent personal weakness—an alleged weakness that would permanently undermine people’s ability to pursue goals in life. Do these narratives have self-fulfilling consequences? To test this hypothesis, and to attain a practical way to support people in realizing their strengths, we developed a brief (~20 min), highly scalable exercise that highlights the strengths people show when contending with depression. Three experiments ( N total = 748) show that this depression-reframing-exercise enhanced the confidence of people who had experienced depression to pursue their goals in life, 0.30≤ d s ≤0.68 ( N s = 158, 419, and 171); and, over 2 weeks, the progress they reported making towards a valued personal goal by 49% (from 43% reported completion to 64%), d = 0.47 (Experiment 3). While default inherent-weakness-narratives harm goal pursuit among people with depression, efforts to reframe depression can help people with depression recognize and access their strengths.",

          "abstract": "The spread of disinformation is widely regarded as one of the most serious global risks. In one laboratory and three online experiments ( N total = 3,066), we measured trust in true, false, and disinformation statements related to the Russo–Ukrainian war (Experiments 1–3) and to politics, climate, and health (Experiment 4). We examined longer-term effectiveness of a fact-based corrective message delivered either before (prebunking) or after (debunking) participants’ initial evaluation of disinformation statements. Across all four experiments, debunking intervention consistently and substantially reduced trust in disinformation, with effects persisting for at least two weeks. Prebunking intervention produced similarly durable benefits only when it was immediately followed by evaluation of the just-corrected disinformation. When evaluation was delayed, prebunking had no reliable impact. We found no significant backfire effects on trust in disinformation across any ideological groups. However, debunking induced a more conservative response pattern overall, reducing trust in true statements as well.",

          "title": "*Social Rewards Protection Theory: Why People Morally Derogate Prosocial Actors for Undisclosed Personal Benefits",
          "authors": "Sebastian Hafenbrädl",
          "abstract": "Prosocial behavior is common and often socially rewarded (e.g., via liking, status, and trust). Yet prior research has found that if actors themselves also benefit from their prosocial behavior, then they are morally derogated: They are evaluated as worse than purely selfish actors. This tainted-altruism effect has been explained by the use of different counterfactuals for the evaluation of prosocial and selfish actors. Here I propose social rewards protection theory , which explains why evaluators use these different counterfactuals in the first place: Social rewards are treated as being reserved for costly prosocial actions. Claiming such rewards without incurring costs seems like cheating and thus deserves moral derogation. Accordingly, being transparent about the action’s costs and benefits prevents such derogation. I conducted six experiments (five preregistered) with Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers in the United States and lab participants in Spain (total N = 4,732 adults). The findings provide support for the proposed functional explanation of tainted altruism, which also sheds light on related phenomena, such as overhead aversion and hypocrisy.",

          "abstract": "Nedergaard and Lupyan (2024) presented four studies aimed at validating anendophasia (i.e., experiencing no inner speech). 1 However, Lind (2025) held that no one, including Nedergaard and Lupyan, has demonstrated that anendophasia exists. In both articles, the authors support their positions using the findings of descriptive experience sampling. Here, I show that descriptive experience sampling is a fidelity-aspiring method; I highlight the distinction between fidelity and validity (an important distinction for psychological science in general and for anendophasia in particular). Anendophasia is an experiential phenomenon, not a construct, and therefore requires incorporating fidelity-based investigations. Nedergaard and Lupyan treated anendophasia as a construct (providing validity-based investigations), but drew phenomenon-based conclusions. I distinguish between completely and mostly anendophasic individuals, noting that, in practice, that distinction might be impossible to make. I suggest that anendophasic (or at least mostly anendophasic) individuals do in fact exist (probably frequently) and are worthy of fidelity-based (as well as validational) investigations.",

          "abstract": "Does dissonance enhance the pleasantness of the following consonance due to the ensuing contrast? The contrast between the affective characteristics of successive stimuli is considered an important factor for the perceived pleasantness of the final stimulus, known as the contrast effect. We tested the contrast effect of dissonance and consonance by employing short chord sequences ending with a manipulated penultimate chord, resolving to the final tonic as stimuli. The dissonance level of the penultimate chord was manipulated by varying both its acoustic roughness and cultural familiarity, and 49 participants rated the pleasantness of the final chord. We hypothesized that the final chord would be more pleasant when the penultimate chord was more dissonant. However, the results showed the opposite: greater dissonance in the penultimate chord led to lower pleasantness ratings for the following final chord. It could be that greater dissonance in the penultimate chord makes it less tonally related to the final chord and that its dissonance may have violated listeners’ tonal expectations. Rather than demonstrating the contrast effect, this result demonstrates dissonance’s strong association with unpleasantness and its influence on the pleasantness of the following consonance.",
