          "abstract": "Communication constitutes organizing (CCO) theorizing offers compelling explanations of how organizations are constituted through communication, yet CCO is often criticized for paying scant attention to issues of power. This article draws upon communicative relationality and the recent Deleuzian inspired techniques and forces (T&amp;F) framework to investigate how power materializes in the relations/links/connections communicatively constituting a fluid social movement aimed at stopping construction of a police training facility. Through interviews, observation, and social media analysis, I theorize how diverse multimodal communication by activists and the state materialize links constituting the movement. This article contributes to T&amp;F by empirically specifying a boundary condition of techniques, adding the concept of substantiating to describe fleeting materializations, and revealing how relations constituting fluid organizing coalesce around identity, geography, temporality, and civic issues. Ultimately, the article deepens CCO theorizing of power and shows how T&amp;F and relationality offer broader theorizing of communicative constitution of organizing.",

          "authors": "Biying Wu-Ouyang",
          "abstract": "Individuals increasingly express thoughts by clicking “likes,” following groups, and leaving comments. These communicative acts not only express individual preferences but also convey signals to important curators such as algorithms, advertisers, friends, and journalists, which jointly shape social media feeds. In a word, people consume what they curate. Despite its significance, current theories lack clarity on the concept explication of personal curation. This paper addresses this gap by examining the types, motivations, and impacts of personal curation on users’ information intake. Importantly, as individuals engage in curation not from a single reason or convey a single message, this study theorizes personal curation into five dimensions based on platform features (expansiveness), content (heterogeneity), subjects (news attentiveness), sources (belongingness), and the number of platforms involved (multiplatform connectedness). This theorization provides a conceptual framework for understanding how seemingly mundane social media behaviors convey communicative meaning and exert significant influence in daily life.",

          "authors": "Jialu Chen, Rachael Kent",
          "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of digital devices to manage everyday life and public concern about the negative impact on individual health and well-being, media coverage and research on ‘digital detox’ have accelerated in the last decade, as an alternative to tech ‘addiction’, as well as being heavily capitalised upon by many tech and wellness companies. A key solution presented is the introduction of various digital well-being applications to help individuals improve digital health by building health boundaries around technology, such as screen-time-limiting applications. Much of the literature on digital detox and the studies on these applications is largely Western-centric and often carries out quantitative analysis. The research presented in this paper, therefore, fills this research gap through a qualitative analysis of Chinese users’ engagement with the screen-time-limiting application – Forest , and examines to what extent Forest helps individuals improve digital health. Through a triangulation of the walkthrough method and semi-structured interviews, this paper argues that Forest helps users reduce unintentional digital use via the embedded app designs of gamification, self-tracking and community support. However, its contribution to individual tech-life balance is limited in consideration of the problems of commodification of digital detox and the cultural context in which Forest is used. In short, through the commercialised co-optation to digital detox, the public’s anti-tech sentiment (which criticises digital capitalism) is transformed by technology companies into a pursuit of productivity improvement and self-optimisation consistent with Western Neoliberalism and Chinese involution culture, reinforcing the original power system and making digital detox lose its power of critique.",

          "abstract": "This research explores and analyses the relationship between AI and the concept of creative expression within the realm of games art, as well as whether AI can potentially benefit or harm this form of expression in the industry. To do so, this dissertation investigates existing research relevant to this topic, as well as various case studies of digital media products that have already been impacted using AI-generated art. These findings will then be applied to a comprehensive comparison process, in which AI-generated artistic components will be viewed alongside assets made without the use of artificial intelligence by research participants so that various factors can be analyzed. Through this empirical research, factors such as production time, ethical considerations, accuracy and aesthetic appeal are discussed to shed light on the broader implications and benefits of AI-generated art on the creative landscape.",

          "authors": "Sarah Martindale, Helen Kennedy, Anna-Maria Piskopani, Richard Ramchurn, Aislinn Gomez Bergin",
          "abstract": "This article demonstrates the capability of Virtual Production (VP) technologies and techniques as new, and potentially very powerful, research tools. We do so through a case study in which a multi-user Virtual Reality (VR) environment was created so that participants could come and explore the troubling topic of online misogyny, sexism and antifeminism in a co-created, playful and embodied way. For this project, the interdisciplinary team developed a multi-stage methodology to deliver a critical, participatory research intervention using VP. Secondary data about participants’ lived experiences of online misogyny, the coping mechanisms they deploy in these situations and the in-built biases and failures of platform regulation that they identify was used to sensitise the case study. Participants’ ideas about familiar and fantastical environments, multiple spaces for creativity and collaboration with variable privacy levels, and customisable avatars for identity expression were used for inspiration by a dramaturg and creative technologist, who worked together to devise a virtual environment and activities for multiple users to explore together in VR. This took place during an all-day in-person workshop with eight participants at a University-based innovation and research driven VP studio. Through facilitated activities and reflective discussions, the participants and research team co-created positive interactions and experiences in the virtual environment based on clear, shared rules, cooperation around tasks, mutual learning and purposeful movement between online and offline contexts. We present this case study to share these findings, and to serve as a template for other researchers who could use VP to prototype provocative scenarios and devise socio-technical alternatives in response to different research questions.",

          "authors": "Christopher Ball, Kuo-Ting Huang, Xuan Nie, Elaine Kong, JM Shalani Dilinika",
          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a branch of AI capable of producing novel content from human input, is poised to transform various aspects of society. However, the benefits and challenges of GenAI adoption are not equally distributed, contributing to a new layer of digital inequality, the GenAI divide. This study examines the individual factors associated with psychological barriers, GenAI competency, and adoption readiness. Using data from a stratified online survey of 305 participants, the study explores sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, age, race, education, and income), as well as competency factors (e.g., operational and creative skills) and psychological factors (e.g., attitudes toward AI, GenAI decision reliance, and self-efficacy). Findings reveal that operational skills and comfort with AI were significantly associated with lower anxiety and higher adoption readiness, whereas negative technology attitudes were associated with increased barriers. Furthermore, greater reliance on GenAI for decision-making was associated with lower self-assessed competency, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in which less confident users may increasingly depend on automated recommendations. These results highlight the multi-dimensional nature of the GenAI divide, emphasizing the interplay between individual-level factors and inequality-related outcomes. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions, such as AI literacy programs and supportive digital communities, to address these disparities and promote equitable access to the benefits of GenAI. By identifying key factors associated with GenAI adoption, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of digital inequality in the age of generative AI technologies.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the role of social media and influencers in promoting harmful physical stereotypes that increase adolescents’ vulnerability to eating disorders (EDs). Using a mixed-method approach, we analyse national and international news on EDs published by El País and El Mundo in 2024 ( N = 24), along with a content analysis of 10 Instagram profiles of celebrities who have publicly acknowledged suffering from EDs. Although information about these disorders is abundant, adolescents do not always interpret it critically. Social media has become a space where unhealthy aesthetic ideals and unverified health content circulate widely. Influencers often reinforce extreme thinness and perfection, while messages on mental health or body diversity remain scarce. We also identify digital subcultures that normalise risky practices, including viral challenges and pro-anorexia communities. The study highlights the importance of enhancing media literacy, promoting positive role models and demanding greater accountability in content targeted at minors.",

          "abstract": "Understanding covert discrimination is as critical as overt discrimination in combating injustices. This study examines how news media consumption and trust shape covert discriminatory preferences. By analyzing various news media sources (television, newspapers, and social media) and various discrimination grounds, we highlight the complex relationship between factors driving covert discrimination. We use data from an online survey among 3000 Belgian adults, employing a conjoint experimental design to capture implicit bias in the seating preferences on public transport. Results show that media consumption and trust significantly moderate discriminatory preferences. Light consumers of public television news and heavy consumers of commercial television news display greater discriminatory preferences. Higher trust in public broadcasters and quality newspapers aligns with favoring individuals without visible minority traits, while lower trust correlates with preferences for overweight and transgender individuals. TikTok, X, and Instagram consumption also influences these patterns. Our findings have implications for media policy and diversity interventions.",

Focusing on issues such as journalistic professionalism, platformisation, changing business models and content production under conditions of technological change, the contributions address developments that are embedded in broader global transformations of journalism. At the same time, the articles demonstrate that global trends intersect with distinct historical, political and market contexts in CEE, producing divergent outcomes across media systems. By situating national case studies within a comparative framework, the special issue highlights how political pressures, market constraints and technological dependencies reshape journalism in uneven ways, contributing to persistent diversity in journalistic cultures and professional practices across the region.",

          "authors": "Guangyu Xiao, Choong-Ki Lee, V.G. Girish, Hesam Olya",
          "abstract": "Purpose Virtual exploration has emerged as a promising option to enhance individuals' mental well-being amid growing mental health challenges. This article tests a conceptual model that examines the effects of virtual exploration's online atmosphere (OA) on users' mental well-being. It also investigates changes in users' perceptions and behavioral intentions associated with well-being improvement. Design/methodology/approach This article adopts a mixed-methods design. First, a quantitative survey (n = 523) tests the proposed model, linking OA cues (interface aesthetics, background music congruency, scene vividness, interactivity and convenience) with mental well-being via virtual visit experience and healing effects (stress reduction and restoration). Second, a multi-group analysis compares the effects of natural and urban destinations. Finally, the qualitative phase analyzes open-ended responses to explore the broader implications of improved mental well-being resulting from virtual exploration. Findings The findings show that these OA cues positively influence the virtual visit experience, which in turn enhances well-being through stress reduction and restoration, with natural (vs. urban) destinations exerting a stronger effect on these relationships. The qualitative results further reveal that participants reported increased psychological resilience, greater interest in and attachment toward explored destinations and higher readiness for digital engagement. Originality/value This article pioneers the understanding of how the OA within virtual exploration (specifically destination live streaming) fosters mental well-being through stress reduction and restoration. It provides empirical evidence for the OA's positive impact on well-being via these mechanisms and reveals differences across destination types.

          "authors": "Panpan Wang",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore how different gamification affordances interact with motivational goals to shape IT-embedded pro-environmental behavior (PEB) within gamified green IT applications. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the affordance theory, goal-framing theory and goal systems theory, the study adopts a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to identify combinations of gamification features and user motivations that lead to high levels of IT-embedded PEB. Findings The results reveal four distinct configurations where motivational goals (normative, gain, hedonic) interact under different gamification affordances (social-related, achievement-related, immersion-related) to drive PEB in Green IT. These pathways demonstrate how different goals can either align or conflict depending on the gamification structure. In some configurations, multiple goals operate in synergy, while in others, a single dominant goal drives behavior despite the absence of normative or hedonic motivations. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamic interplay between gamification design and user goal structures, extending theoretical insights into how gamified environments can shape sustainable behavior. Practical implications This study offers practical guidance for tailoring gamified green IT designs by aligning specific combinations of gamification affordances and motivational goals to drive sustainable behavior through distinct behavioral pathways. Originality/value By integrating three theoretical lenses through a configurational method, this study offers a novel perspective on how gamification affordances configure motivational pathways. It moves beyond linear models to explain how diverse user motivations can be effectively activated in green IT applications.",

          "authors": "Junping Qiu, Chenchong Feng, Zhongyang Xu",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines digital hoarding behavior (DHB) among short video platform (SVP) users to reduce unnecessary accumulation, enhance information management efficiency and support SVP sustainability. Design/methodology/approach Guided by the cognition–affect–conation (C-A-C) framework, we analyzed 402 valid responses using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Findings PLS-SEM results show that perceived usefulness (PU), subjective norm (SN) and information overload (IO) significantly increase fear of missing out (FoMO), while PU, time pressure (TP) and SN enhance emotional attachment (EA). Both FoMO and EA promote DHB. fsQCA further reveals three distinct pathways leading to DHB, highlighting multifactorial interactions and configurational patterns. Practical implications This study provides actionable strategies for SVP managers, including optimizing recommendation algorithms, enhancing users’ digital information literacy and implementing intelligent content management tools. Additionally, campaigns and tailored interventions addressing offline and online behavioral differences can promote healthy digital habits, improve information management and reduce unnecessary DHB. Originality/value This study is the first to apply the C-A-C framework to DHB in SVPs, which feature high interactivity and large-scale user engagement. By integrating PLS-SEM and fsQCA, it systematically uncovers the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of DHB, emphasizing its multidimensional nature. The findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of user behavior in high-speed information environments and offer practical insights for fostering SVP sustainability.",

          "abstract": "The notion of machine companions has long been embedded in socio-technological imaginaries. Recent advances in AI have moved those media musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as “companions,” yet there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71; 2017–2025). Works varied widely in considerations of MC according to guiding theories, dimensions of a priori specified properties (subjectively positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts (with more than 50 distinct measured variables). We ultimately offer a literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive; through a facet-theoretical lens, we suggest how this definition can scaffold future research.",

          "authors": "Jiaqi Zeng, Rain Wuyu Liu",
          "abstract": "Interpersonal conflict research has traditionally emphasized cultural determinants of conflict styles while overlooking their context-sensitive nature. Addressing this gap, our study examines how generational differences, cultural values, and socio-demographic factors relate to romantic conflict management among Chinese women. The evolving conflict styles reflect how macro-social changes influence interpersonal relationships, capturing the dynamic interplay between tradition and modernity. Drawing from Rahim and Ting-Toomey’s conflict frameworks, we examined seven conflict styles through a multi-generational online survey ( N = 469): dominating, avoiding, obliging, productive integrating, third-party help, emotional expression, and passive-aggressive. Results revealed distinct generational patterns, with Gen X (Chinese women born in 1960–1979) reporting higher use of power-oriented approaches (e.g., dominating and avoiding) compared to younger generations, who indicated greater inclinations toward problem-solving strategies (e.g., third-party help and obliging). Cultural values emerged as significant correlates, with individualism positively associated with both confrontational (dominating) and indirect strategies (passive-aggressive), whereas collectivism was positively related to cooperative approaches (productive integrating and obliging) but negatively related to avoidance. Socio-demographic characteristics, including argument frequency, education, and relationship status, were also significantly related to conflict styles, highlighting the influence of contextual variability in romantic conflict management. Our findings offer both theoretical insights and practical guidance for romantic relationship counseling and conflict resolution interventions.",

          "abstract": "The main aim of this study is to investigate the mediating role of partner-specific insecure attachment (i.e., attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) in the relationship between perceived partner responsiveness and self-objectification in a dyadic context. Data were collected from 139 heterosexual romantic partners (18–59 years old) with a mean relationship duration of 72 months. Dyadic analysis was conducted through the Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Model framework. Among women, those who perceived their partners as more responsive tended to feel less anxious and less avoidant in their attachment to their partners, and women who felt more anxious in their attachment reported higher levels of self-objectification. Among men, those who perceived their partners as more responsive tended to feel less avoidant to their partners. A partner effect was observed in women, where their perceived partner responsiveness predicted lower attachment anxiety in their male partners. In addition, the association between women’s perceived partner responsiveness and self-objectification was mediated by their attachment anxiety. The findings highlight the potentially critical role of core romantic relationship dynamics, i.e., perceived partner responsiveness and partner-specific attachment, on self-objectification. Thus, the current preliminary findings could be noteworthy in contributing to the growing literature on self-objectification in romantic relationships.",

          "abstract": "Challenges faced by adult-child caregivers can intensify during calamitous events, potentially resulting in adjustment disorder symptoms. This study examined the contribution of demographic characteristics (age and gender), self-reported number of war-related stressful events, intolerance of uncertainty, and caregiver burden to explaining adjustment symptoms among adult-child caregivers who resided in Israel during the initial months of the Israel-Gaza war. A total of 402 Israeli adult-child caregivers participated in the study. We performed a three-step multiple hierarchical regression analysis. All independent variables included in the regression model had a significant contribution to explaining the variance in the dependent variable. Being female, younger, experiencing a higher number of war-related stressful events, higher reported intolerance of uncertainty, and greater reported caregiver burden were related to higher levels of adjustment disorder symptoms. The findings underscore the complex relationship between caregiving demands, wartime stressors, caregiver characteristics, and adjustment disorder symptoms among adult-child caregivers residing in Israel. Amidst 21st-century uncertainties, the challenges associated with caring for an older parent may intensify, along with their potential negative consequences. These findings lay the groundwork for developing policies and services tailored to provide adapted support to family caregivers during such challenging times.",

We recruited 299 Chinese parent-child dyads, with adult children aged 18–29. Participants completed self-reported measures on (perceived) parenting styles, parent-child relationship quality. Adult children reported their mate preferences, while parents reported in-law preferences. We used latent profile analysis to classify profiles based on the combination of adult children’s mate preferences and parents’ in-law preferences, identifying five subgroups: Congruent-Low Standards, Incongruent-Parent Idealist, Congruent-Resource De-emphasis, Congruent-Resource Emphasis, and Incongruent-Child Gene Emphasis. The predictors of both parents’ and children’s (perceived) parenting styles, and parent-child relationship quality differed across the profiles. This study provided initial exploration of the profiles of parent-child congruence and incongruence in adult children’s mate preferences, shedding light on the associations between these profiles and parenting and parent-child relationship quality. We further discussed the practical implications of the findings.",

Drawing on the affect-as-information framework and theories of perceived partner responsiveness, this study tested whether responsiveness helps explain the link between daily affect and marital satisfaction. Data came from 203 heterosexual married couples in Sikkim, India. Using the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model with mediation, we examined positive and negative affect as simultaneous predictors of perceived partner responsiveness and marital satisfaction. Positive affect was linked to greater marital satisfaction through one’s own perception of partner responsiveness. Negative affect also showed an asymmetrical pattern, with only one partner’s negative affect predicting lower marital satisfaction for both spouses, partly through reduced responsiveness. Partner-mediated indirect effects were minimal. These findings highlight the role of everyday affect and perceived responsiveness in shaping marital satisfaction in cultural contexts that are less often studied.",

          "authors": "Salvatore Romano, Miazia Schueler, Natalie Kerby, Davide Beraldo",
          "abstract": "Considering TikTok’s increasing geopolitical influence, this article presents the TikTok Global Observatory (TKGO) as a case of data-reappropriation and introduces the concept of platform-mediated proximity as a counter-data mapping framework for data activist research. While TikTok enables global connection beyond local and cultural boundaries, its content is sensitive to locally specific conditions to which the platform provides no public insight. To counter this lack of transparency, the TKGO makes data for global and cross-national analysis of TikTok feeds available and navigable to the research community. The TKGO is an archive, updated daily, that collects the metadata of videos scraped from the non-logged-in web version of TikTok’s for you page (FYP) across 197 countries and territories. The tool’s main feature is a geographic map that allows users to view, filter, sort, and extrapolate the FYP data as prioritized in different geographical locations. This offers a unique access point for researchers, journalists, and activists investigating cross-national trends, content moderation, and content promotion. In this article, we firstly present the TKGO and contextually position its development in the contentious politics of data access, archiving, and mapping practices. Secondly, we elaborate on the notion of platform-mediated proximities, a conceptual lens that highlights how TikTok remediates geographical proximities through algorithmic content recommendation. Lastly, we apply this framework to the mapping of a three-month sample of the TKGO data, showing how TikTok’s cross-national content prioritization patterns generate new geographical boundaries, observing regional and geopolitical clustering as well as notable exceptions.",

          "abstract": "This thematic issue shares research that critically analyzes counter-mapping undertaken by community groups who appropriate, collect, and utilize counter-datasets to unveil and reshape spatial realities. The articles consider a range of multidimensional sociotechnical cartographic practices, including the politics embedded in various uses of representation, visualization, interactivity, and cartographic imaginaries, framing counter data mapping as communicative practices of resistance. They deepen our understanding of how counter-mapping can be understood as a sociotechnical communicative practice through which communities inhabiting marginalized and vulnerable positions have collectively mobilized the affordances of mapping technologies to both visibilize and contest the root causes and consequences of marginalization. Scholars here consider how counter-mapping is embedded in notions of spatiality and relationality, probing dimensions of analysis that include data sourcing, objectives, capacities, processes, collaborations, ownership, strategic invisibility, and so on, providing evidence of the emerging importance of sociotechnical multidimensionality in the production and cartopolitics of community counter-maps.",

          "authors": "Carolina Monteiro de Carvalho",
          "abstract": "Participatory mapping’s main aim is to represent the community’s voice. It stimulates a powerful social mobilization that provides support for better and more efficient urban policies and social inclusion of marginalized populations, especially in Global South countries, such as Brazil. Our main urban challenges, such as poverty, inequality, and social injustice, are aggravated by climate change. The marginalized populations are often excluded from the decision-making process for planning our cities, which creates a mismatch between urban planning and the real demands of citizens. This article assesses how participatory mapping in informal settlements in Brazil can help to collect data from citizens that can make a difference in better local urban planning through prioritizing their demands and bringing to light their real concerns. Also, this article seeks to show how participatory mapping can provide products that improve communication between stakeholders and society reinforcing the need for urban planning improvements. Three case studies are presented, developed in São Paulo and Guarulhos informal settlements, with citizens’ perceptions about their urban life conditions, highlighting inequalities such as environmental racism, gendered perspectives, and social injustice, as well as potential solutions and specific areas for interventions. The three study cases provided citizens a space to speak and to be heard, to identify problems and concerns in a deprived environment through community mapping and look for solutions and alternatives for better urban scenarios together. Also, this article highlights the importance of the development of an urban agenda, putting the periphery in the center of the decision-making process through participatory mapping and communication products development.",

This article encourages us to think more deeply, and differently, about concepts and practices of mobile media and mobile communication by examining the uses and consequences of MMC among whales . By looking at MMC in the animal world, we gain a new vantage point for thinking about the core elements of mobility, media, and communication, and how they can come together to shape everyday life and survival. By looking beyond the Anthropocene, this more-than-human perspective offers conceptual enrichment for scholarship in the field, while using MMC as a lens for considering how humans (“culture”) and animals (“nature”) are entangled in meaningful ways (natureculture).",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms increasingly offer users control over their feeds, promising to reduce toxic discourse. This study tests how the mere offer of algorithmic control shapes user experiences. Respondents evaluated identical posts from a fictional platform, with half given the option to filter out toxic political content. Those given this choice reported greater platform satisfaction. However, those who opted for filtering rated content as more hostile than similar respondents who were not offered the choice. A follow-up experiment showed that exposure to only positive content did not reduce hostility ratings; it heightened them compared to exposure to both positive and negative content. These findings challenge the assumption that user autonomy will improve content experiences. Instead, algorithmic choice raises expectations, prompting users to scrutinize content more critically or attempt to “train” the algorithm to align with their preferences. Platforms must consider how expectations, not just content exposure, shape online experiences.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming adult content production by enabling users to generate highly customized sexual media through AI pornography platforms. Despite growing concerns about risks (e.g. illegal material generation and sex worker exploitation), AI pornography platform governance remains largely undocumented. We conceptualize AI pornography governance as fantasy arbitration, the process by which platforms determine which sexual fantasies can be technologically instantiated. Using an inductive content analysis of governance materials from 98 AI pornography platforms, we examine content prohibitions, moderation strategies and enforcement mechanisms, liability allocation, intellectual property rights, and privacy policies. Findings reveal heterogeneous governance regimes that create differential risk environments and illuminate how platforms independently dictate legitimate sexuality, determine who captures value from content generation, and commodify intimate data. Collectively, these governance practices position AI pornography platforms as corporate arbiters of sexual possibilities, with broader implications for intimate freedom, labor exploitation, and our co-evolution with technologies.",

          "abstract": "This study explores online deliberation and discursive (in)civility within Vietnam’s authoritarian context, focusing on Facebook discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines how different types of Facebook pages (i.e. government information pages, state-sponsored media, foreign media, and private discussion groups) shape deliberative quality and how (in)civility can both facilitate and hinder public discussion. Quantitative analysis reveals that foreign media pages foster more rational, diverse, reflexive, and interactive discussions, despite higher levels of incivility. In contrast, government and state-sponsored media pages maintain greater civility but demonstrate lower deliberative quality, while private groups show high incivility with minimal deliberation. To further contextualize these patterns, a close reading identifies emotional triggers and target-induced behaviors in uncivil comments. By integrating macro-level metrics with micro-level discursive practices, this study offers valuable insights for scholars and policymakers seeking to enhance deliberative engagement in digital environments under varying degrees of state control.",

          "abstract": "During the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires and amid uncertainty over a TikTok ban, Xiaohongshu (RedNote) unexpectedly emerged as a site of transnational environmental discussion. This study examines how transnational conversations unfolded and their implications for community empowerment and environmental justice during a crisis. Drawing on qualitative content analysis and social network analysis of 505 wildfire-related posts, we find that user engagement centered on participatory practices (44.45%), including reporting and the circulation of practical information. Another substantial share of posts focused on building social ties through emotional support (16.33%), while critically questioning the causes of the fires (11.02%). Social network analysis further shows that grassroots users occupied central positions in the discourse. Together, these findings suggest that Xiaohongshu enabled communicative agency and empathetic transfer across borders, facilitating emergent forms of collective resilience. However, such potentials remain contingent, as algorithmic visibility and geopolitical conditions unevenly shape participation and recognition in digital spaces.",

It uncovers dominant conventional narratives, experiences, and understandings of online concerts, captured under the term ‘live music imaginaries’. Recent scholarship, journalism, and other commentary typically emphasise the limitations of online music events compared to in-person performances. Most pressingly, online concerts are pervasively viewed as merely a temporary lifeline for live music during the COVID-19 pandemic. They need not be. Commentators also frame technology as determining online performance practices, based on speculation about some inevitably virtual future of entertainment. Yet the history and variety of online concerts as a media form and cultural practice are under-considered. By highlighting and evaluating the historically and culturally situated live music imaginaries that shape the experience of online concerts, this article sets the stage for a theoretical reframing of the value of online music events.",

          "abstract": "This article explores “soft launching,” a digital phenomenon predominantly associated with female users that involves deploying deliberately “askew” photographs to subtly reveal one’s romantic partner on their Instagram profile. I use soft launching as a case study to interrogate the relationship between intimate publics and platformization, especially as it concerns feminized cultural production. I argue that intimate publics are platform-specific, and I recenter cultural production as a tool for studying intimate public spheres. Following this, I analyze the cross-platform existence of soft launching by applying discursive and textual methods. Examining the cultural products that surround and constitute soft launching reveals how platform-specificity contours both intimate publics and what I call meta-intimate publics , defined as intimate publics that reflexively and ambivalently repackage others. I offer meta-intimate publics as a framework for identifying and understanding how users (in particular, women and historically disenfranchised users) construct and present themselves across hypercommodified platform ecologies amid the “impasses” of contemporary digital life.",

My specific focus is on the LunaNet’s interoperability discourse which situates it within the technical, historical, and political trajectories of the Internet and within socio‑technical structures that shape power here on Earth. By analyzing this discourse, I argue that, when applied to outer space, the visions of interoperability are limited, overlooking what makes LunaNet distinctive—its ability to function without continuous connectivity. To foreground this point, I introduce the concept of extraoperability, a speculative framework that challenges Earth‑bound assumptions about Internet connectivity and proposes that alternative modes of relation may emerge when we network beyond our Blue Planet.",

As a result, some users flock to alternative platforms, like Telegram, Signal, VK, Parler, or Gettr. This study examines the roles of political ideology, anti-establishment views, and privacy concerns in the use of these five platforms. Based on survey data gathered in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany ( n = 1500 each), we find that alternative platform use is highest in the United States and in Germany. Digitally skilled, young, male, educated, and right-wing individuals are drawn to alternative social media. Across all five platforms, right-wing ideology is a stronger predictor of usage than anti-establishment views. In the pooled sample, privacy concerns do not correlate with usage. However, given inconsistencies in the roles of privacy concerns and anti-establishment views, we highlight the importance of specific platform affordances and national context.",

This article offers a systematic, cross-disciplinary review of empirical research on digital populism published between 2015 and early 2025. Analysing 188 studies from political communication, media studies and political science, we map how platform affordances structure populist communication, how digital populism is conceptualised and how it is studied. The literature portrays digital populism as the communicative enactment of populist ideology in environments that privilege personalisation, affective intensity and direct leader–follower engagement. Methods span qualitative, computational and experimental designs, with research concentrated on Twitter/X and Facebook. Most studies examine exclusionary, right-wing cases in European and Western contexts and associate them with polarisation, misinformation and declining institutional trust. Evidence remains largely correlational, and inclusionary or participatory variants are underexplored. We identify key gaps and call for greater analytical precision in assessing democratic consequences.",

Methodologically, the study was conducted in 2024 using a social lab framework and the idea of a ‘social lab’ space, in which 19 older people with intersecting vulnerabilities creatively shared insights into their experiences of good aspects of the digital. By combining manual and NVivo-assisted thematic and discourse analysis with visual analysis, we found that the digital good coexists with challenges in the digital domain, and that participants emphasised challenges more than positive experiences in all life domains except education and training. Regarding interventions, they recommended practical assistance, skills training and other support from those with lay knowledge or professional expertise, while discursively placing responsibility for support-seeking on themselves as individual users.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on the complementarity perspective of romantic attraction, we examined dyadic initial attraction in a speed‐dating context among individuals characterized by light and dark personality traits. As hypothesized, analyses of dating success, involving over 1.400 heterosexual dates with 128 participants, showed that Machiavellianism was negatively related to dating success, and this relationship significantly interacted with the light triad personality traits exhibited by their dating partners. Although individuals with light personalities were not especially attracted to partners scoring high on Machiavellianism, they did not dislike them as strongly as others did. The same data pattern was found for sadism. In contrast, narcissism and psychopathy were not related to dating success, and light triad personality traits did not moderate these relationships. This pattern suggests that individuals with light personalities are less likely to reject those who are generally rejected by others. These results illuminate the dynamics of the early stages of dating, raising the question of whether individuals with light personalities deliberately give partners who are generally rejected a chance, or whether they simply fail to recognize their partners' Machiavellian and sadistic traits.",

          "abstract": "Do people have their psychological needs fulfilled uniformly or unevenly within romantic relationships? We measured fulfillment of seven psychological needs and used latent profile analysis to identify potential heterogeneity in need fulfillment (NF) across two convenience samples: a sample of dating college students (Study 1: N = 688) and a sample of cohabiting participants recruited from Prolific (Study 2: N = 294). Five profiles consistently emerged: low fulfillment of all needs except independence (independence NF driven); greater fulfillment of personal needs than relational needs (personal NF driven); greater fulfillment of relational needs than personal needs (relational NF driven); moderate fulfillment of all needs (moderate NF); and high fulfillment of all needs (high NF). All these profiles differed from one another in relationship commitment and satisfaction, except that the personal NF driven profile was not significantly different from the relational NF profile in commitment in both studies and in relationship satisfaction in Study 2. The current research introduces a novel use of a person‐centered approach to advance understanding of individual differences in need fulfillment in romantic relationships.",

          "authors": "Sydney G. Wicks, H. Colleen Sinclair",
          "abstract": "Although romantic relationships are often idealized, many individuals find satisfaction in being single. Evidence shows social networks influence commitment within romantic relationships—with network approval being a boon, and disapproval a detractor—but whether this social network effect extends to commitment to being single remains unclear. This study examined whether perceived approval from parents and friends predicts commitment to singlehood and fear of being single, and if associations differ according to one's sexual orientation. Single US adults ( N = 501, 47% women, 50% White) identifying as heterosexual ( n = 256) and sexually diverse (e.g., gay, pansexual; n = 245) completed an online survey assessing aspects of singlehood. Network approval—especially from friends—is related to higher commitment and lower fear. After including covariates, approval was no longer associated with commitment or fear in either group. Combining heterosexual and sexually diverse participants, parent and friend approval remained significant predictors of lower fear, even after covariates were included. Subjective norms, calculated as opinions weighted by motivation to comply, showed little consistency in their associations. Approval from friends appears especially important for sexually diverse singles, who may rely more on their chosen family for social support. Findings extend understanding of the nuanced nature of the social network effect when applied to singlehood.",

I make this point by building on my experiences of studying science communication projects and by reflecting on their internal heterogeneity in terms of what they were ‘about’ for those organising them. By showing this diversity in the meanings of science communication to those carrying it out, and in particular how this is exacerbated by the conditions of precarity and scarcity that frequently frame science communication activities, I argue for the importance of understanding science communication practice as not only being ‘about’ the communication or negotiation of scientific knowledge, but myriad other aspects, from personal prestige to the need for a job.",

          "abstract": "American public discourse about online misinformation often exaggerates its prevalence and persuasiveness, potentially harming Americans’ evaluations of democratic governance. This project uses two studies conducted during the 2020 and 2022 elections to test whether the presumed prevalence/persuasiveness of online misinformation (P3OM)—the perception that online misinformation is both widespread and persuasive—undermines Americans’ satisfaction with democracy. Fixed-effects regression analysis of an eight-wave online panel survey reveals that both dimensions of P3OM are correlated with reduced democratic satisfaction. A follow-up online survey experiment provides evidence that exposure to messages about online misinformation reduces democratic satisfaction. Theoretical implications and strategies for reducing the presumed influence of online misinformation on democratic satisfaction are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Nuanced studies have scrutinized the facilitative role of digital media in fostering political deliberation and in contributing to the prospect of democratization in (semi-) authoritarian societies. This study illuminates a less-explored facet of non-democratic contexts’ digital politics by shedding light on discourse quality in cyberspace. Guided by Gastil and Black’s analytical–social framework of deliberation, we propose an integrated analytical model comprising seven dimensions and employ a case study approach combined with supervised machine learning to analyze Chinese netizens’ digital engagement with the public policy of “delaying retirement age” on the popular Q&amp;A platform. The findings reveal deliberative virtues—topic relevance, rationality, and civility—alongside a low presence of political alienation and minimal institutional alignment, suggesting generally strong analytical performance. In contrast, the social dimension, represented by argument reciprocity and transpositional consideration, remains weak, reflecting a lack of sustained interaction. Based on these empirical results, we coin the concept of the “ solo of deliberator ” to describe a pattern of online deliberation where analytical reasoning prevails while social engagement is subdued. Implications for deliberative democracy in non-democratic nations are discussed.",

          "authors": "Mathilda Åkerlund",
          "abstract": "Sexual hate and violence are core tenets of incel ideology, yet few studies have examined in detail how rape is understood and articulated within these digital communities. This article addresses this gap through a critical discourse analysis of 3,353 posts published in one of the largest international incel forums. It investigates (1) how women are portrayed in the context of rape; (2) how rape is understood among incels and how these understandings are substantiated; (3) how incels situate themselves in these discussions; and (4) how claims about women and rape are mitigated or reinforced through user interactions. The analysis highlights the contradictions and inconsistencies embedded in incel discourse about sex, rape and women, as well as incels’ strategic use of victimhood. The article further demonstrates the extremism of gender-based hate and the abhorrent language used to construct meaning around women and rape. Importantly though, the article shows how incel articulations of rape do not fundamentally diverge from mainstream misogyny. Instead, they are intensifications of ideas about rape and women which persist through the rape culture and rape myths in mainstream society, but are exacerbated by collective culture, lack of moderation and the separatist nature of the incel communities.",

          "abstract": "The line between “influencers with expertise” and “experts with influence” in the health and wellness industry has blurred and has confused the public on whom they can rely for their health information. Influencers with expertise in the wellness industry are those who have amassed authority through their online content and their ability to reflect an authentic self, often questioning and even outright denying the role of institutional experts and science. Experts with influence, on the contrary, are institutionally credentialed leaders with professional acumen in health and medicine who share credible information while attempting to debunk rampant misinformation. First, I describe the relationship between knowledge, expertise, and credibility, the last of which is considered a central norm of the influencer industry. Then, I offer differentiation between influencers with expertise and experts with influence. Then, through semi-structured interviews, I ask how influencers understand their perceived expertise and how they navigate and communicate their role to their audiences. The findings explicate the utilization of embodied knowledge in the wellness influencer industry, the use of disclaimers and claims to knowledgeability as protection from critique, and how many wellness influencers ultimately see themselves as a “different kind” of expert.",

          "abstract": "Prior work shows that passive news engagement, such as selection and consumption, exhibits strong news selectivity. Far less attention has been given to more active forms of news engagement, however. News commentary, an active form of engagement, may reflect cross-cutting engagement rather than pro-attitudinal selectivity, given its expressive and often confrontational nature. Using ten years of commenting data from South Korea’s largest news aggregator—amounting to over 250 million comments posted by approximately six million users—and a deep-learning content analysis to classify political attitudes and hostility, we examine whether hostile commentary is indeed characterized by cross-cutting patterns across both content and source levels. We specifically analyze whether users comment on counter-attitudinal news stories and whether hostile commenters are structurally confined within fragmented outlet clusters in co-engagement media networks. Findings show that hostile commenters are more likely to cross boundaries by targeting opposing news stories and exhibit weaker echo chamber structures, reflecting cross-cutting engagement beyond their clusters. This pattern is especially pronounced in political and societal domains. In today’s media environment, hostility and opposition may ironically disrupt, rather than reinforce, echo chambers.",
