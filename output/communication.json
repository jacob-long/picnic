          "authors": "Christel W van Eck, Michael Hameleers, Emma van der Goot",
          "abstract": "The concept of the “fake expert” has been used as a label to delegitimize established expertise but also refers to experts that are invoked to support misinformation claims. This study examines how “fake experts” and their expertise are constructed in misinformation. Analyzing fact-checked misinformation on climate change and COVID-19, we investigate how sources are framed as experts (RQ1), how their expertise is linked to misinformation (RQ2), and to what extent these references are misleading or inaccurate (RQ3). Our findings show that expertise in misinformation is shaped more by content and communicative context than by credentials alone. Misinformation employs rhetorical strategies such as selective quoting and epistemic trespassing to create credibility. We propose a framework for identifying “illegitimate” expertise in misinformation, integrating content- and actor-based indicators. This framework offers a structured approach for analyzing how misinformation manipulates expert credibility and provides a foundation for future empirical research.",

          "authors": "Qian Hu, Yan Xie",
          "abstract": "In order to develop one for a morphologically difficult language like Korean, the paper investigates the problem of homograph disambiguation in NMT. Homographs – words with a common form but several meanings and context differences – cause significant issues for NMT systems because they often assign meanings at random, leading to translation errors. This work introduces UTagger, a tool that uses the Standard Korean Language Dictionary (SKLD) to provide homographs distinct sense-codes in order to resolve homograph ambiguity. These sense-codes are then integrated into the parallel corpus, where each indexed homograph is treated as an individual word by the NMT system, minimizing ambiguity-related translation errors. The addition of UTagger improves the quality performances of the translation systems with BLEU, TER, and DLRATIO measures, according to experiments conducted on Korean-English and Korean-Vietnamese translation pairings. The outcome shows that for languages with complex morphology, UTagger enhances translation accuracy and dependability. The study concludes with a discussion of extending the application of UTagger to a wider range of homographs, particularly favourable evaluations, and outlines future work to further enhance UTagger, including enhancing its capacity to adapt to various languages and dialects.",

          "authors": "Kyle Barrett",
          "abstract": "Although Blade Runner (1982) initially failed at the box office, Ridley Scott’s cyberpunk/neo-noir film has since become a seminal work, widely regarded for its enduring influence and inspiration. The release of Blade Runner: The Director’s Cut (1992) removed elements Scott considered to be producer-imposed weaknesses, a vision fully realised in Blade Runner: The Final Cut (2007). A belated sequel, Blade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017), also underperformed commercially but reaffirmed the enduring relevance of Scott’s dystopian future, one drenched in perpetual rain, climate disaster, overpopulation, and moral decline. While Blade Runner has been extensively examined across philosophical, aesthetic, and cultural contexts, this article shifts focus to its lesser-studied 1997 videogame adaptation by Westwood Studios. By transposing Scott’s cinematic universe into a point-and-click adventure format, the game, in some respects, enhances the film by addressing the challenges of adapting cinematic narratives into interactive media.",

          "authors": "Ioanna Georgia Eskiadi, Nikolaos Panagiotou",
          "abstract": "This study examines the transformative potential of Virtual Production (VP) technologies within news media organizations. By leveraging tools such as real-time game engines, LED walls, and Extended Reality (XR), VP redefines storytelling, enhances audience engagement, and alters journalistic workflows. This research focuses on case studies of innovative media organizations that have integrated VP, analyzing its impact on immersive journalism practices, audience interaction, and ethical considerations. The qualitative thematic analysis reveals how VP fosters participatory news consumption, aligns with the expectations of digital-native audiences, and addresses the complexities of integrating AI and blockchain tools in production. Findings highlight VP’s capacity to democratize content creation and promote inclusivity while also discussing the challenges of infrastructure investment, energy consumption, and accessibility. This paper offers a roadmap for news organizations to adopt VP technologies, emphasizing their role in shaping the future of journalism in the digital age.",

          "abstract": "Fact-checking is vital in combating misinformation, yet concerns persist regarding potential unintended effects on media trust. This study investigates causal dynamics between exposure to fact-checks and media trust over time, using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) with longitudinal panel data from Flanders (Belgium) across three waves in 6 months before the 2024 elections. Findings indicate that people who encounter more fact-checks are also more likely to have higher trust in media. However, we found no causal relationship, suggesting that fact-checking neither erodes nor enhances media trust over time. Amid growing scrutiny of fact-checking by political actors and technology platforms, these results challenge assumptions about negative spillover effects of fact-checking.",

          "authors": "Markus Appel, Juliane Gabel, Lena Wimmer, Marieke Klöppel, Tobias Richter",
          "abstract": "People prefer attitude-consistent information over attitude-inconsistent information (congeniality bias). Connecting theory on the processing of stories to selective exposure theory, we assumed that the congeniality bias is reduced or even nullified when it comes to fictional messages. Across two experiments examining two different, polarizing topics (refugees, N1 = 1,326; theistic faith, N2 = 1,316) a highly consistent pattern of results could be observed: Participants were more willing to read a narrative message (exposure preference) in which the story events were in line with their attitudes rather than a message contrasting attitudes. This congeniality bias was unaffected by the fictionality of the information (i.e., whether the events were introduced as a fictional short story or a non-fictional journalistic reportage). Interestingly, the congeniality bias emerged for positive characterizations of refugees or theistic faith but not for negative characterizations. Implications regarding the role of fictionality and congeniality in selective exposure are discussed.",

          "authors": "Yang Liu, Yuan Chen, Yuchen Xu",
          "abstract": "Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally transformed workplace dynamics, compelling organizations to transition employees to work from home abruptly. Since corporate online forums played an important role as an online communication channel during the shift, this paper aimed to investigate the effect of enforced working from home (WFH) on employee engagement behaviors in such forums during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach Leveraging the Wuhan lockdown as a natural experiment, this study employed a year-to-year difference-in-differences approach to analyze a unique panel dataset from a large company. Findings We found that enforced WFH increased passive engagement but significantly reduced active contributions. We also found an interesting recovery effect: while the drop in contributions subsided within a month of adaptation, elevated login and free-riding behaviors persisted. Further heterogeneity analyses uncovered critical disparities: male employees contributed less, senior employees participated less in low-cost activities, while employees under a stricter containment policy exhibited a smaller decrease in contributions. Practical implications Our findings provide insights for organizations to design equitable engagement incentives, recalibrate forum management strategies, and prioritize mental health support in future WFH policies. Our results also inform policymakers on tailoring containment measures to mitigate unintended workforce online disengagement. Originality/value Our study advances WFH research by analyzing enforced remote work’s impact on corporate forum engagement during COVID-19. It also enriches pandemic-related literature by incorporating crisis-specific factors and highlighting recovery patterns and policy-driven heterogeneity.",

          "title": "Consequences of illegitimacy perceptions: understanding Internet users’ resistance to firms’ information requests",
          "authors": "Ding Wu, Benjiang Lu",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the digital economy, value creation hinges critically on users’ voluntary compliance with corporate data acquisition initiatives. Nevertheless, it is reported that a significant number of users tend to adopt a defensive stance and resist these requests. Efficient coping endeavors of firms must be established on the basis of a systematic understanding of such user resistance, which remains under-explored. Accordingly, in this paper, we establish a theoretical model to provide an in-depth understanding of the diverse resistant behaviors exhibited by Internet users, adopting an integrative perspective grounded in relational contract appraisals. Design/methodology/approach We self-develop two theoretical constructs, namely perceived request excessiveness and perceived option restrictiveness, to characterize Internet users’ perceptions of the illegitimacy of firms’ information requests. From the integrative perspective of relational contract appraisals, specifically privacy contract concerns and psychological contract violations, we investigate the impacts of these constructs on users’ representative resistant behaviors, such as refusal, switching and complaining. To test the model, we conducted a scenario-based online experiment (N = 633) and analyzed the data using structural equation modeling. Findings The empirical results yielded two major findings. First, users’ perceptions of request excessiveness and option restrictiveness collectively impact their appraisals of relational contracts. Meanwhile, the perception of option restrictiveness can also exert a negative moderating effect. Second, Internet users’ psychological contract violations and privacy contract concerns further shape their resistant behaviors, where the two dominate defending and complaining behaviors, respectively, and the latter can also play a mediating role. Originality/value The originality of this work is threefold. First, we self-develop two constructs to characterize online users’ typical illegitimacy perceptions of firms’ information requests and systematically examine their functional roles. Second, we propose and examine the novel lens of relational contract appraisals to better understand users’ resistant responses. Third, we discuss a wide range of privacy-related defending and complaining behaviors and reveal their differential predominant mechanisms. Overall, our research lays the foundation for future work that aims to promote the harmonious use of user information.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Given the need for social consciousness among public figures and the increasing social influence of influencer CEOs, we examined how influencer CEO activism, influencer CEO styles of social media use (e.g. self-disclosure) and political ideology of followers interact to affect perceived intimacy and attitudes. Design/methodology/approach We conducted an online experiment with 219 participants randomly assigned to one of six conditions manipulating influencer CEO activism and influencer CEO self-disclosure on social media posts. Participants' political ideologies were measured. From the perspective of social penetration theory, we assessed perceived intimacy and examined a moderated mediation model. Findings The three-way interaction effect among influencer CEO activism, CEO self-disclosure and political ideology on intimacy was significant, affecting attitudes toward the activism, the CEO and the brand. The two-way interaction of influencer CEO activism and political ideology was significant in the professional self-disclosure condition but not in the personal self-disclosure condition. Practical implications This research underscores the importance of aligning influencer CEO activism with audience characteristics, highlighting personal disclosure as a potential buffer against backlash. Originality/value The findings show that the personal self-disclosure of influencer CEOs in their social media posts can insulate CEOs when their expressed opinions diverge from the opinions of their audience. Delving into the intrinsic mechanism behind this phenomenon through the lens of social penetration theory sheds light on the role of perceived intimacy in the persuasive power of influencer CEOs.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study integrates affordance theory and self-determination theory to examine how gamification affordances on consumer-to-consumer (C2C) secondary marketplace apps influence users' pro-environmental behaviors. Drawing on the concepts of warm glow and moral licensing, it investigates how pro-environmental actions via apps may unintentionally lead to overconsumption. Design/methodology/approach We recruited 613 respondents who had recently used Xianyu, a leading C2C secondary marketplace app in China, to sell their unwanted possessions. Data were analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0 to test the proposed path relationships. Findings The findings showed that instrumental and hedonic affordances, but not social affordances, are crucial for enhancing pro-environmental motivations. Users' engagement in pro-environmental actions is driven by autonomous (intrinsic) and controlled (extrinsic) motives. Engaging in pro-environmental actions via apps can increase the warm glow effect, which, in turn, may unintentionally contribute to overconsumption behaviors, including over-purchase, hedonic consumption and impulse purchase. Moral licensing strengthened the impact of warm glow on hedonic consumption and impulse purchase. Practical implications This study suggests C2C secondary marketplace apps can design gamified elements to sustain pro-environmental motivations while reducing overconsumption by leveraging instrumental and hedonic affordances, emphasizing long-term environmental impact and mitigating moral licensing through ongoing commitment. Originality/value This research offers a novel perspective by demonstrating how gamification affordances promote pro-environmental behaviors yet may indirectly drive overconsumption through the emotional benefits of these actions. By highlighting both positive motivations and potential unintended consequences, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of gamification's impact in C2C secondary marketplaces.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates how firms’ social media strategies, including firm-initiated owned social media (OSM) and customer-generated earned social media (ESM) content, affect customer perceptions of quality, value and satisfaction. By analyzing sentiment across millions of social media posts and linking them to customer mindset data, we aim to provide insights for optimizing social media engagement and enhancing customer outcomes. Design/methodology/approach We analyze a large multi-year sample, combining over 250,000 customer survey responses and 3.5 million social media posts from 167 US consumer goods companies. Using a novel positive valence surplus (PVS) metric, we assess the impact of social media sentiment and engagement on customer perceptions of quality, value and satisfaction across posts from both firms and consumers on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter). Findings Both PVS and engagement positively affect customer perceptions for ESM posts, influencing satisfaction. For OSM posts, PVS is negatively related to user engagement, but engagement still improves quality perceptions. Overly positive OSM content leads to a backfire effect, particularly on Facebook, where it is more detrimental than on X. Originality/value This research utilizes PVS to measure the sentiment balance of social media content, which is a novel approach for assessing firm-initiated and customer-generated posts. Our unique dataset allows us to analyze the distinct impacts of OSM and ESM content on customer perceptions across two major social media platforms (Facebook and X). The findings provide actionable insights for managers to refine social media strategies.",

Guided by the framework of contextual integrity (CI), this study examined how privacy norms compare across four mobile health technological contexts: telehealth, online patient portals, mobile health applications, and wearable devices. Analysis of 34 semi-structured interviews revealed context-specific actors, information types, and transmission principles, and identified instances that represent points of departure from entrenched privacy norms. In addition, we found that people use privacy heuristics—evoked by CI parameters—to guide their privacy evaluations. Findings theoretically contribute to CI by identifying parameters in the novel context of mobile health and by proposing privacy heuristics as the explanatory mechanism underlying the evaluation of privacy norms. Practically, findings can inform more user-centered mobile health design and communication practices.",

          "authors": "Cantyo A. Dannisworo, Esther S. Kluwer, Ximena B. Arriaga, Johan C. Karremans",
          "abstract": "Previous research has revealed various negative outcomes when victims of intimate partner violence justify their partner’s behavior, including reductions in self-worth and the persistence of violence. The current research tested the temporal dynamics of the justification of violence and its negative effect on the need for support and help-seeking behavior. Additionally, we explored whether victims’ level of violence justification moderates the impact of frequency of violence on the perceived need for support. A longitudinal study was conducted among pre-screened participants who are currently victims of partner violence using self-report measures via online research platforms (T1 N = 335, T2 N = 286, T3 N = 261). The data were collected at three time points, each three weeks apart. The findings were mixed. Across the entire sample, we did not find that justification of violence was directly or indirectly associated with support need and help-seeking, either cross-sectionally or longitudinally, nor were changes in justification of violence associated with changes in support need. However, the results among men (but not women) showed a pattern consistent with our general prediction: male victims who justified violence to a greater extent were less likely to seek help. Moreover, exploratory analyses showed that victims’ justification of violence dampened the association between frequency of violence and their perceived need for support. The current findings provide novel insights into the processes underlying support need and help seeking among victims of intimate partner violence.",

Cross-sectionally, students’ individual-level social network measures were associated with better adjustment at the start of the year. Longitudinally, being part of a group with better social connections at the start of the year was associated with students’ higher grade point average, lower hostility, and greater institutional attachment at the end of the school year.

          "abstract": "Interparental conflict is a common issue in families. Guided by the family systems theory, conflict between parents may not only impact their relationship but also influences child’s development. While previous research has established links between interparental conflict and children’s outcomes, fewer studies have examined how changes in conflict over time may affect children’s development. Using three waves of data from a national and longitudinal dataset, Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), this study investigated changes in mothers’ and fathers’ reports of interparental conflict and how these changes relate to children’s socioemotional skills at the third wave, when they are 4-year-old. Results from multilevel growth curve models indicate a significant decrease in fathers’ reports of conflict frequency, while a significant increase in mothers’ reports of conflict. Furthermore, an increase in mother-reported conflict frequency was associated with lower socioemotional skills in children at age 4. Findings highlight the importance of examining couple relationships from a dynamic perspective.",

          "abstract": "As young adults increasingly turn to social media for news, they rely on an eclectic mix of journalistic and non-journalistic sources to shape their daily news intake. To navigate this complexity, social media news users develop personal curation practices such as (un)liking or (un)following content to construct their personal news feeds. The study examines how these practices inform the roles that news users attribute to journalists. Using a novel mixed-methods approach that integrates visualized Instagram and TikTok data donations (DDPs) as elicitation tools within interviews ( n = 21), we capture how and why social media users manage their exposure to news. The findings identify four key drivers underlying these personal news curation practices: the pursuit of positivity, opinion affirmation, clarity, and diversity. Within this context, journalists are positioned as both diversifiers of content and benchmarks for clarity.",

This article presents findings from a mixed-methods investigation of 12 case studies, comparing eight grassroots counter-mapping sources against four mainstream mapping sources, created by government and academic institutions, that will be referred to here as “hegemonic.” The purpose of this study was to investigate how visuals presented online by community-focused counter-mapping collectives differed from those presented by mainstream sources, examining what these differences might indicate about the social imaginaries at play. Case studies from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the US produced a corpus of 1,556 images manually collected from online sources. An initial content analysis using NVivo generated quantitative data forming the foundation for later semiotic analysis examining each individual image while also considering the collection holistically. Informed by social semiotics, the findings highlight how counter-mapping employs bespoke illustrations and community insights to portray a more nuanced perspective of the impacts of the pandemic. In contrast, hegemonic maps rely on vector-based graphics that reflect dominant worldviews. Altering the practices of mapping, counter-mapping empowers communities, challenges systemic inequities, and reimagines how visual data shapes public knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Social media have become essential channels for government communication with the public, creating opportunities for engagement with citizens, greater complexities in messaging and interactions, and distinct challenges in addressing government-citizen relations. This thematic issue brings together several articles that explore how governments, officials, and citizens interact on social media platforms. Collectively, the contributions illuminate how social media reshape communicative roles, redefine the boundaries between journalism, propaganda, and public service, and challenge democratic accountability. The studies employ a wide range of theoretical frameworks (from mediatization and affordance theory to principal-agent models and boundary work theory), distinct contexts (such as crisis communication, health communication, and military intervention), and several methodological approaches including text mining, machine learning, and mixed-methods approaches, among others.",

          "authors": "Aqsa Farooq, Adam Rutland, Luke McGuire",
          "abstract": "Adolescents’ online habits may contribute to the spread of misinformation due to their preference for trusted peers as sources of information over credible sources. This propensity can also make adolescents a population more vulnerable to misinformation, particularly during crises when misinformation levels surge. In situations of uncertainty and risk, such as during public health crises, trust plays an important and influential role. This study explored whether adolescents’ trust in an individual sharing misinformation, and trust in their misinformation about Covid-19, differed based on adolescents’ perceived risk of harm from Covid-19 (risk vs reduced risk) and the age of the misinformer (peer vs adult). When shown misinformation about a hypothetical Covid-19 variant, adolescents (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 131; 14–17 years old) trusted a misinformer more when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents were also asked to provide open-ended justifications for their trust evaluations which were analysed in accordance with the elaboration likelihood model. We found that adolescents who reported to more regularly scrutinising information were more likely to consider information and source credibility when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents who reported engaging in less information-scrutinising behaviours were more likely to consider their relationship with the misinformer when the misinformer was a peer. These findings suggest how the elaboration likelihood model can play an important role in risk communication amongst adolescents and emphasise the need for educating adolescents about the importance of scrutinising information, particularly during crises.",

          "authors": "Anna Smoliarova",
          "abstract": "Effective government communication is crucial for promoting inclusive governance, especially in increasingly diverse societies. However, a significant gap remains in engaging residents with migration backgrounds, often leaving these communities underinformed and underserved in public discourse. This shortfall becomes especially critical during crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. Among transnational migrants in various countries, social networks were the main sources of information about Covid-19. Social media influencers with migration backgrounds became crucial transmitters of governmental information to their audiences. For instance, in 2020, Russian-speaking female bloggers in almost 40 countries started a global discussion about the Covid-19 outbreak on Instagram. This article presents the results of a content analysis of 113 Instagram posts by 58 Russian-speaking female influencers in 37 countries during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. It demonstrates that influencers acted as primary information sources. Instead of relying on news media, they spread information from governmental sources to audiences within their countries of residence and globally. In this article, I highlight how strategic use of social media can bridge the communication divide, ensuring that residents with migration backgrounds integrate better into the public information ecosystem while balancing public service with ethical governance",

          "authors": "Lisa Thomas, Catherine V. Talbot",
          "abstract": "Social media has long facilitated self-presentation, but the tension between authenticity and performativity remains. BeReal, launched in 2020, promised a more ‘authentic’ experience by requiring users to share unedited, real-time images. This study examines the platform’s perceived value, its initial appeal, and subsequent decline in user engagement. Through a large-scale qualitative survey ( N = 333), we present motivations for (dis)engagement, revealing a trajectory of enthusiasm, scepticism, and eventual disinterest. Participants valued BeReal for fostering social connection and serving as a digital memory archive. However, growing cynicism about authenticity – along with increasing performative behaviours and feature creep – diminished its appeal. Applying Ng’s post-adoption model we map users’ transition from adoption to discontinuance, situating BeReal’s decline within broader trends of social media fatigue. Our findings contribute to debates on ethical social media design, performative authenticity and user disengagement, providing insight into the ephemeral nature of digital platforms.",

          "abstract": "This study examined people’s motives, perceived affordances, and gratifications of using BeReal, a photo-sharing mobile social media app. Through an online survey of 146 English-speaking BeReal users, the study applied the affordance framework and uses and gratifications theory to analyze user experiences and perceptions. Findings revealed the most significant gratifications obtained were expressing the authentic self, entertainment, connecting to others, and presenting the ideal self, and these perceived affordances moderated the relationships between motives and gratifications obtained. Users seeking companionship were more likely to alleviate loneliness through BeReal when they perceived stronger social presence. Those using BeReal to pass time found it more entertaining when the app was seen as less editable and ephemeral. In addition, users aiming to connect with others experienced greater satisfaction when they perceived content as less editable. This study provides insights into how affordances impact how satisfied users are with BeReal’s ability to gratify their needs.",

Extending De Certeau’s spatial framework of place, space, and subject positions to digital platforms, this article explores how ordinary Instagram users negotiate platform power by approaching resistance as spatial negotiation embedded in everyday use. Based on 15 in-depth interviews, the analysis identifies everyday tactics that transform Instagram from a structured place into a lived space : users abandon places, make the platform habitable, play with its materiality, and repurpose it for unexpected uses. The study demonstrates how users resist by how they position and move within platform structures. It categorizes users as voyeurs and walkers , based on De Certeau’s subject positions, and introduces a new category, transients , each reflecting distinct spatial relations to the platform. This article argues that spatial relations shape user agency and the conditions under which resistance becomes possible.",

          "abstract": "Constant connectedness and social media overuse have prompted disconnection practices like quitting and digital detoxing. Besides these approaches, mindfulness stands as a promising quality to benefit from social media without being overwhelmed by their drawbacks. Accordingly, this study investigates whether mindful technology use (MTU) can help manage social media use. Based on the Affordance-Use-Reflection-Automaticity Model, MTU was proposed as a means to regulate the effects of social media affordances (i.e. hedonic and utilitarian content gratification), habit, satisfaction, and system use. The research model was tested on three different social media—Facebook ( n = 220), Instagram ( n = 132), and Twitter/X ( n = 123)—using a cross-sectional survey. The results show that MTU is associated with lower habit and system use, and a stronger positive link between hedonic content gratification and habit. These findings indicate that MTU can be a disconnection strategy by supporting mindful consumption and weakening habitual use.",

We draw on empirical insights from five creative workshops to examine how university students perceive and respond to the logics of this ‘algorithmic event’ and assertion of identity through ‘wrappification’. Our analysis identifies four themes: the resonance of Wrapped, limits of the Wrapped self, ambience of music and contestations of Spotify’s governance. These themes reflect the multifaceted emotions evoked in users, ranging from celebration of personalisation to critique of data capture. They also demonstrate contradictory views of classification systems. While our participants are deeply attuned to the algorithmic and commercial forces of streaming, their engagement with music often transcends the platform’s affordances. By examining these negotiated practices during an algorithmic event, our study extends debates on the platformisation of culture, especially regarding music’s aesthetic and functional values.",

Contending the value of a more porous and resilient definition able to recognise a spectrum of online political influence, we interrogate scholarship on opinion leadership, influentials, micro-celebrities, and social media influencer studies to reveal a range of identifying traits that can characterise different types of political influencers. Introducing a new approach to categorising these varied manifestations, we discuss six key attributes: personalised communication, compensation, audience size, political topical focus, control, and formal political role. Showing how this approach can be deployed to capture different manifestations of political influencers, we aim to build understanding that is resilient to change over time and that can support comparative empirical work.",

          "abstract": "The ultra-Orthodox community is characterized by high levels of commitment to community and religion and insulation from the outside world. Leaving such a community resembles the process of migration, in which the individual encounters new cultures, norms, and behaviors. This presents challenges with integration and disaffiliated community members do indeed often lack the tools, skills, and knowledge to successfully integrate into their new societies. Through qualitative in-depth interviews, we examine the role of information communication technologies (ICTs) and media in the processes of disaffiliation from ultra-Orthodox communities. Findings reveal the enablers and constraints these individuals experience in their journey and shed light on the importance of media and ICTs in individuals’ attempts to build new lives outside the ultra-Orthodox community. This study contributes to a better understanding of the role of media and ICTs in the lives of people undergoing major life changes, such as disaffiliation from the ultra-Orthodox community.",

Drawing on school-based workshops, we explore tensions between authenticity, normative ideals and self-presentation in girls’ interactions with influencers. Participants expressed agency in content consumption alongside pressures to conform, shaped by social interactions online and offline. We argue that influencer culture perpetuates dominant femininity norms through reciprocal dynamics between influencers and audiences. Girls navigated this terrain ambivalently, often endorsing authenticity and diversity while feeling constrained by normative expectations. We propose a post-digital literacy framework to conceptualise girls’ critically engagements with influence as part of everyday life, highlighting implications for education and digital practice.",

The present research explores whether measures such as fear of being single (FOBS), desire for a relationship (DFR), and satisfaction with relationship status (SWRS) represent distinct perspectives associated with singlehood experiences or, conversely, a general attitude toward relationship status. In two samples of singles ( N 1A = 172, N 1B = 257), the three measures loaded onto distinct factors. Exploratory analyses revealed distinct associations with well‐being, relationship pursuit tendencies, and perceived rewards/costs of singlehood and relationships. Results suggest that unique experiences of singlehood and relationships associated with FOBS, DFR, and SWRS reflect distinct motivational underpinnings. Careful consideration of research goals and implications should be used when selecting different operational and methodological framings of attitudes toward relationship status.",

Within our samples, 15.1% and 26.1% of singles reported being sexually active. These sexual relationships were characterized by limited exclusivity, low emotional closeness, and little interest in transitioning to a committed romantic relationship. Across both studies, singles engaging in casual sex reported lower attachment avoidance, greater sexual satisfaction, and higher self‐perceived mate value compared to those not sexually active, challenging previous research linking casual sex participation with negative outcomes. Considering casual sex as one part of lives lived single may provide a clearer picture of both decisions around casual sex opportunities and thriving during singlehood.",

We therefore adapted the widely used Dyadic Trust Scale (DTS) and examined its psychometric properties in two independent Chinese samples (Study 1: N = 204; Study 2: N = 377). Item analysis and EFA identified a two‐factor structure, contrasting with the DTS's usual unidimensional form in Western samples and suggesting cultural differences in trust conceptualization. Item 1 was removed for weak loading and model misfit in CFA, yielding a final seven‐item structure of Faith (five items) and Security (two items). CFA showed good fit (CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.09) alongside high internal consistency, good convergent and discriminant validity, and strong criterion validity with relationship satisfaction (total DTS: r = 0.69; Faith : r = 0.56; Security : r = 0.51; all p s &lt; 0.001).

These stressors extend to LGBTQ+ individuals' romantic relationships and can result in relationship dissolution. To inform strategies for relationship maintenance specific to LGBTQ+ identity‐related stressors, it is important to examine how individuals' LGBTQ+ identities impact their romantic relationships. In the current paper, we used a mixed methods design to examine open‐ended responses from 138 LGBTQ+ college students ( M age = 19.8) describing how their LGBTQ+ identities contributed to the dissolution of a prior romantic relationship. We also examined potential differences in theme prevalence of transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) compared to cisgender students. A coding reliability thematic analysis indicated five themes: sexual orientation/gender identity (SOGI) identity exploration, SOGI identity disclosure, negative biases/experiences, societal issues, and no contributions. TGNC students were more likely to provide responses aligning with the themes of SOGI identity exploration and SOGI identity disclosure as reasons for romantic relationship dissolution than cisgender students. Our results underscore the importance of understanding minority stressors and their role in relationship dissolution for LGBTQ+ college students.",

However, previous research has identified a gap between these ideals and actual practices, where conventional norms of objectivity and expert authority often prevail. Drawing on Irwin’s (2021) framework of socio-technical orders of thinking, we analyse interviews with 12 leading Danish sustainability scientists. Our thematic analysis shows that scientists pragmatically navigate between first-order (expert-led), second-order (inclusive), and third-order (reflexive and power-aware) modes of thinking. While third-order thinking emerges as integral to sustainability science, traditional assumptions about authority and neutrality continue to shape scientists’ communication practices. These findings invite science communication scholars to view sustainability science as a fertile ground for developing and testing pluralistic, reflexive, and power-aware communication models, while also learning from the situated practices of scientists who already navigate these complexities in context.",

          "authors": "Tianchan Mao, Chris Chao Su, Ngai Keung Chan, Lei Guo",
          "abstract": "In this article, we argue that social media platforms communicate their governance strategies both about and through values across diverse sites of communication— about values in presenting normative ideals and through values to justify their content moderation practices. Moreover, we highlight the significance of analyzing platform values across temporal and regional contexts, especially beyond the Western sphere. Focusing on X and Weibo, we employed content and network analysis to examine how they articulated values in different venues to regulate public expression from 2007 to 2024. Our findings reveal an increasing convergence in how the two platforms communicate about values in their community guidelines, suggesting a trend of institutional isomorphism in response to shared challenges such as misinformation and online safety. However, they diverged in communicating through values in administrative posts. While X emphasized personal-level values such as self-expression, Weibo prioritized social-level values, particularly social and political security, often in the context of addressing concrete cases.",

          "authors": "Aliaksandr Herasimenka, Ralph Schroeder",
          "abstract": "Social media communities are increasingly considered as spaces where evidence-based information about history is undermined. We combine expert interviews and content analysis of debates about genocide in a popular online contrarian community to understand how to mitigate the spread of misleading information across such communities in the domain of history. We analyse 1725 entries on 10 Reddit forums dedicated to debating and promoting scepticism towards international consensus about prominent historical topics. The entries we analyse cover three topics referred to as genocide by forum members: the Holocaust, the Holodomor, and the COVID-19 vaccination. The prevailing view suggests that contrarian expression fosters smaller, ideologically homogeneous, and relatively radical online spaces where differing views are diminished or entirely absent. To the contrary, we analyse real-life behavioural data to demonstrate substantial scepticism towards contrarian narratives even in some of the most popular dedicated online communities, which may suggest that these spaces are more internally contested than prevailing theories imply.",

          "authors": "Meng Wang",
          "abstract": "In the platformized era, digital games have become key arenas for romantic connection, yet their role in shaping intimacy between strangers remains underexplored. This study examines how such relationships are initiated, developed, and evaluated in Honor of Kings, China’s most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. Based on 25 in-depth interviews with young players, it addresses four questions: the stages of romantic intimacy formation, enabling digital affordances, reasons for choosing games over dating or social apps, and evaluations of game-based romantic relationships. Findings reveal a four-stage process—encounter, acquaintance, development, and establishment or termination. Conceptualizing games as affective infrastructures, the study shows how platform design structures and commodifies digital intimacy while enabling embodied, performative commitment. Comparative analysis with dating apps, social media, and Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) highlights the distinctiveness of fast-paced, interaction-intensive play in fostering embedded emotional commitment. It also uncovers players’ tactical workarounds to reclaim autonomy from platforms. By theorizing intimacy as both enabled and contested within socio-technical systems, this research advances an infrastructural account of how love is imagined, enacted, and negotiated in contemporary digital culture.",
