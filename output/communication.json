          "authors": "Renan Petersen-Wagner, Jan Andre Lee Ludvigsen",
          "abstract": "The penetration of social media platforms in the cultural production and consumption circuits of sport mega-events means that organisations like the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) are afforded new and alternative channels to engage with their audiences. TikTok, one of the largest platforms, is characterised by a higher degree of playfulness and humorous content and has been used to mobilise audiences for prosocial political aims. Using TikTok’s Research API access, this article relies on automatically collected metadata from all IPC posts between May 2023 and May 2024. After consolidating and manipulating the data through Python, statistical analyses were performed on SPSS to understand how certain content becomes more visible on the platform. In a second stage, videos with most virality underwent visual discourse analysis. We hold that the IPC, to challenge invisibilities, arguably one of the biggest obstacles for disability sport, engages in the circulation of humorous content with the aim of promoting inclusion and social change for persons with disabilities. While TikTok and the circulation of humorous content afford the IPC wider visibility to new audiences, it might provoke unintended consequences through further stigmatisation of disability sport as non-serious activity.",

          "authors": "Ming Zhang, Yuxin Liu",
          "abstract": "The evolution of social media platforms has provided opportunities for diasporic Chinese individuals and foreigners settled in China to transition into content creators, utilizing their transitional creator identities to negotiate algorithmic visibility and cultivate audiences with an appetite for novel or cosmopolitan interpretations of Chineseness. However, due to the stigmatization of Burmese individuals as cybercriminals, transnational influencers creating content about Myanmar has encountered a complex phenomenon fraught with challenges. In this exploratory study, we focus on the visibility labour among three transnational influencers creating content about Myanmar, examining their strategies for managing digital visibility on Douyin and negotiating the cybercriminal associations linked to their Burmese heritage. Through our netnographic research, we identify the intricate interaction of nationalism, gender, sexuality, and entrepreneurship in shaping their identity negotiation and pursuit of digital visibility.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Online patient reviews are of considerable importance on online health platforms. However, there is limited understanding of how these reviews are generated and their impact on patients' choices of physicians. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the antecedents and consequences of online patient reviews on online health platforms. Design/methodology/approach This study introduced an online interaction model with multiple stages aimed at examining how physicians' service quality affects patients' review behavior and, consequently, influences patients' choices of physicians. Findings The results revealed that technical quality and emotional care significantly influenced the effort that patients exert and their use of positive emotional words when writing reviews, which, in turn, positively influenced patients' selection of physicians. Moreover, it was found that the voice channel had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between physician service quality and patient review behavior. Practical implications The study’s findings can help online health platform managers improve the platform system by optimizing the integrated text and voice interaction functions. The findings can also support physicians in improving service quality, managing online reviews and attracting patients’ choices. Originality/value This study enriches the literature on physician service quality, patient online reviews and choices in online health platforms. Furthermore, this study offers a novel perspective on the social exchange process in online healthcare settings by highlighting the role of media in shaping physician–patient interactions.",

Design/methodology/approach The data were gathered by conducting an online survey ( n  = 476) from young adults exposed to fashion retail metaverse platforms. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings The findings discovered that social presence dimensions positively impact CBE, which substantially impacts the PI of young consumers in the fashion retail metaverse. The findings demonstrate that self-efficacy moderates the relationship between CBE and PI. Research limitations/implications This study uses cross-sectional data in the fashion retail metaverse for young consumers. Future studies can use longitudinal data in the context of other industries and demographic profiles to assess changing customer behavior. Practical implications This study implies that customer experiences can be enriched through social presence dimensions, helping brands adapt their offers to create more engaging and rewarding customer interactions. It offers insights for brand managers aiming to augment the relationship between CBE and PI. Originality/value The study uniquely explores the relationship between social presence dimensions and CBE within the fashion retail metaverse. It examines self-efficacy as a moderator between CBE and PI, providing fresh insights into consumer behavior in the fashion retail metaverse.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The metaverse enables users to create their own avatars in a shared virtual space, giving rise to a new avatar personality that differs from their real-self personality. The aim of this research is to explore how users' real-self and avatar personalities may affect their behavioral engagement and satisfaction in the metaverse context. Design/methodology/approach This research applies self-discrepancy theory to investigate how the big five traits of both real-self and avatar personalities influence users' engagement and satisfaction in the metaverse. The present research employed a mixed-methods approach, beginning with a qualitative study to identify prevalent personality cues among users on metaverse social media platforms. Subsequently, a quantitative study was conducted to further validate the findings of the qualitative study. Findings The results indicated that avatar personality scored higher than the real-self personality in the dimensions of openness, conscientiousness and extraversion, while scored lower in the dimensions of agreeableness and neuroticism. Both real-self and avatar personality traits positively influenced metaverse satisfaction via behavioral engagement in the metaverse. Notably, avatar personality traits had a stronger impact on behavioral engagement compared to real-self personality traits, which further influence metaverse satisfaction. Practical implications The present study offers practical insights for metaverse developers and managers to enhance user satisfaction by focusing on users’ big five traits of both real-self and avatar personality. It suggests implementing personalized tools, organizing personality-based social activities and other initiatives to encourage user’s behavioral engagement and ultimately enhance metaverse satisfaction. Originality/value Unlike existing research that concentrates on a single facet of personality traits, this research employs a mixed-methods approach to conceptualize users' real-self personality and avatar personality, further exploring their impacts on metaverse satisfaction.",

          "authors": "Jasmina Berbegal-Mirabent, Inés Alegre, Dolors Gil-Doménech",
          "abstract": "Purpose Multiple crowdfunding platforms have been created over the last decade. Some have become extremely successful, but many others have failed. This study focuses on those strategic choices that founders of crowdfunding platforms need to make early on and which determine the basic characteristics of a platform. Specifically, it examines which combination(s) of these initial strategic choices shape(s) the survival of a platform. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative comparative analysis is used to analyze the design configurations that are especially relevant for the long-term survival of crowdfunding platforms. Several robustness checks are performed. The empirical setting consists of a unique dataset of all crowdfunding platforms created in Spain over a period of ten years. Findings Ten configurations are obtained (four in the case of reward and donation platforms, and six for equity and lending), suggesting different paths to platform survival. Although equity and lending platforms tend to be more likely to survive than donation and reward platforms, the type of platform is not definitive. Another interesting observation is that when platforms fail, they do so quite fast. Practical implications We acknowledge that strategic choices are a combination of different elements; therefore, our approach offers a holistic view that mirrors the heterogeneity of resources and capabilities of entrepreneurs. Our study derives a different set of recommendations for lending and equity platforms than for reward and donation platforms, underlining the importance of designing and treating each type of platform in a particular way. Originality/value Most crowdfunding literature has the individual crowdfunding project as the main level of analysis. Research to date has focused on the characteristics that projects must possess to succeed. The present study explores differences at the platform level. Our research brings new evidence on some of the decisions entrepreneurs need to confront when starting a crowdfunding platform and provides useful recommendations that might help them increase the chances of survival for their platform.",

          "authors": "Michael Hameleers",
          "abstract": "Despite the potential of visual disinformation to deceive people on pressing socio-political issues, we currently lack an understanding of how online visual disinformation (de)legitimizes partisan truth claims at times of war. As an important next step in disinformation theory and research, this article inductively mapped a wide variety of global visual disinformation narratives on armed conflicts disseminated via social media. The narratives were sampled through various international fact-checking databases, involving multiple social media platforms and countries. The analyses reveal that visual disinformation mainly consisted of existing footage that was decontextualized in a deceptive manner based on time, location, or fictionality. Moving beyond existing research exploring how decontextualized visuals offer proof for counter-factual narratives, our findings indicate that visuals contribute to the process of othering by constructing a “delusional rationality” that legitimizes mass violence and the destruction of the other. These findings have crucial ramifications for international policy and interventions at times of global armed conflicts that are covered widely across social media channels.",

          "abstract": "Changing levels of public trust in the news are of deep concern to both researchers and practitioners. We use data from 2015 to 2023 in 46 countries to explore how trust in news has changed, while also exploring the links with sociodemographic variables, differences by media system, and changing patterns of news use. We find that (a) there has been a small overall decline in trust in news since 2015, but also that (b) there are different trends in different countries. More specifically, trust has declined more in media environments that have become less structured by television news use, and increasingly structured by social media news use. Our findings underscore how changing structures of media use may be central to explaining trust dynamics in recent years, which suggests new avenues for restoring trust where it has eroded.",

          "abstract": "Sense of personal agency (SPA) is crucial for adolescents’ psychosocial adjustment and well-being. The relationships with parents and peers, as well as the adolescent’s sex, have been suggested as important correlates of adolescents’ SPA. Nevertheless, no prior study has adopted a gender perspective to analyze how the intertwining of relationships between parents and peers relates to adolescent’s sense of agency. The current study investigates whether attachment to peers mediates the links between attachment to parents and SPA and whether these links are equal for boys and girls. The sample includes 1119 Portuguese adolescents (56.2% girls; 43.8% boys) aged 14 to 19. Structural equation modeling results suggest that attachment to peers is more strongly associated with boys’ SPA than girls. Results also indicate that regardless of adolescent sex, the quality of the emotional bond with the mother, but not the father, is positively associated with adolescents’ SPA. Furthermore, the results suggest that attachment to peers mediates the links between attachment to parents and adolescents’ SPA. Quality relationships with the adolescent’s different-sex parental figures (mother-son, father-daughter) are associated with higher-quality peer relationships, which are associated with a stronger SPA. On the contrary, inhibition relationships with the adolescent’s same-sex parental figure (mother-daughter, father-son) are associated with lower quality in adolescent’s peer relationships, which is associated with a lower SPA. These findings underline the importance of considering a gender perspective to understand better the role of family and peer contexts in the adolescent SPA.",

          "abstract": "Romantic attachment orientations are important predictors of individuals’ and their partners’ well-being and health. However, less is known about whether similarity in attachment between partners predicts better well-being and health outcomes. In two studies (total N couples = 1,602), we tested with actor-partner interdependence and dyadic polynomial regression models if partners’ attachment and their similarity were linked to their well-being and health (i.e., life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, self-rated health, medical conditions). Results revealed significant actor effects between anxiety and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), self-rated health (both studies), and medical conditions (Study 2 only). For avoidance, significant actor effects were found for life satisfaction (Study 1, female partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), and self-rated health (both studies). Partner effects emerged for anxiety and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2) and depressive symptoms (Study 1 only) and for avoidance and life satisfaction (Study 1, male partners Study 2), depressive symptoms (both studies), and self-rated health (both studies). The results of dyadic polynomial regression and response surface analyses, however, provided no evidence for any similarity effects of romantic attachment on well-being and health in both studies. In sum, the findings suggest that lower anxiety and avoidance in both partners is generally associated with higher well-being and health. However, similarity in partners’ attachment seem unimportant for concurrent well-being and health. Implications of the findings are discussed considering attachment theories and relationship processes.",

          "authors": "Alexander C. Jensen, Sarah Ashby, Naomi M. Noorda, Jennie Jasperson",
          "abstract": "Approximately 80% of individuals from the United States have at least one sibling. Of those with siblings, a little more than half have two or more siblings. Yet, research on siblings across the life course, including young adulthood, has focused primarily on sibling dyads rather than larger sibling groups or multiple sibling dyads from the same family. The overarching aim of the current study was to explore the form and impacts of entire sibling groups and multiple sibling dyads for young adults with two or more siblings. Data were collected from an online survey of 975 young adults aged 19–29 years from across the United States ( M age = 25.43, SD = 2.52; 48% male; 73% white). Results showed that participants reported greater variation in sibling relationship quality when their siblings were not all the same gender and when their siblings had greater differences in age. Young adults were more likely to report a close aged sibling as the sibling with whom they have the closest relationship or most conflict. Relationship quality also showed links with psychosocial outcomes. In some cases, greater variation in sibling conflict and closer relationships with one particular sibling were linked to better outcomes. More conflict was linked to poorer outcomes. Multiple effects were moderated by gender, gender of the sibling, and characteristics of the entire sibling subsystem. Overall, our findings suggest that sibling relationships in medium to larger families are multifaceted and complex. Our results are in line with a family systems perspective that siblings have unique roles but that sibling dyads within families mutually influence and interact with one another.",

          "abstract": "Using internet shutdowns as a reaction to civil unrest has become a common response from the Indian state. In 2022, India remains at the top with the highest number of recorded shutdowns in the world, for the fifth consecutive year. Several state and central governments have used this tactic to suspend the flow of information, either to curtail the ability of citizens to organise through social media networks, dominate discourse around an event, or both. Many such instances have increased the circulation of misinformation, leading to polarised online spaces created partly due to the lack of internet connectivity. Digital disconnection then becomes a condition forced upon its citizens rather than a voluntary choice made by individuals. To explore the impact of internet shutdowns on civic discourse, I look at the case of the farmers’ protest in India, that lasted from September 2020 to November 2021. The movement successfully led to the repeal of the three controversial farm laws. The protest faced challenges due to internet shutdowns along with other forms of crackdown by authorities. I use in-depth interviews to bring in the voices of the various stakeholders who participated in this movement. In this article, I would like to place the farmers’ protest as a vantage point from where one can look at how the Indian state has used internet shutdowns to control dissent.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the complex, multi-layered mechanisms of internet censorship in China, emphasizing its role as both a tool of control over public engagement and a mechanism for elites to disconnect themselves from spaces of public scrutiny, and avoid potential threats such as doxxing by bottom-up populist online movements. Through in-depth interviews with social media users, this study investigates how individuals perceive, assess, and navigate the boundaries of internet censorship, focusing on their awareness of censorship practices, the assessment of sensitive content, and the tactics they employ to circumvent restrictions. We further examine how a sophisticated censorship mechanism—comprising self-censorship, platform censorship, and physical enforcement—works to disconnect netizens from grassroots collective actions. The findings reveal that internet censorship in China not only regulates online populist activism but also serves as a protective shield for elites, allowing them to curate a controlled digital space that suppresses critical discourse. By highlighting the ways in which both ordinary users and elites navigate the challenges of digital engagement in this heavily regulated environment, this study provides theoretical insights into the practice of disconnectivity as an elite privilege. It enhances our understanding of the interplay between connectivity, censorship, and disconnectivity in shaping the digital landscape and its implications for social change and political engagement in China and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) can place people in unique environments and facilitate engagement, making it a compelling tool for storytelling and learning. However, experiencing narratives requires immersion, which can be difficult for those who are anxious about technology. Prior research has shown that training new users on how to use VR before they engage in learning tasks housed in VR is critical. The right kind of training and targeted guidance may help people, including those with computer anxiety, better navigate virtual experiences. However, best practices for how training should be administered remain unclear. This study examined how training type (paper, video, and VR) and computer anxiety influenced outcomes using a large sample size (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 284). We measured performance and self-reported outcomes while participants navigated computer-graphic scenes, manipulated three-dimensional objects, and watched a narrative 360° video. Results showed that participants who received training via video or VR mastered more VR functions than those who received training via paper. Additionally, those who trained directly in VR had less of a negative experience using VR for completing tasks. Furthermore, participants who trained in VR perceived the training as more useful and found the VR tasks to be easier compared to those who received training in paper or video. Finally, those with high levels of computer anxiety, regardless of training, had more negative outcomes than those with low computer anxiety, including having less mastery of VR functions and engagement with the 360° video content, perceiving the training as being less useful, completing tasks with more difficulty, and having more of a negative experience. Our results suggest that keeping the medium the same both during training and doing is ideal. We discuss implications for theories of information processing in VR, as well as implications for scaled engagement with narratives and learning in VR.",

          "abstract": "Three-hundred-and-sixty-degree videos visualized through virtual reality (VR) technologies are recognized as an effective tool for fostering positive attitudes towards environmental stewardship by immersing users in persuasive storytelling narratives. However, a lack of an overarching framework hinders the understanding of its role in promoting prosocial environmental behaviors, particularly its effects on information processing and behavioral intentions. Notably, recent studies have suggested that feeling transported into a VR environment (i.e., presence) could positively bias message evaluation and the way people process information by activating heuristics connected to immersive experiences (i.e., the bias hypothesis of the heuristic-systematic model). Drawing on this proposition, this study conducted a between-subject design experiment (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 60), comparing a 360-degree pro-environmental campaign video in VR with that in a two-dimensional format. Results from partial least squares structural equation modeling indicated that a 360-degree video in VR induced a higher sense of presence, yet heuristic evaluation of message credibility decreased when a sense of presence was low. Moreover, message credibility was found to be positively associated with the valence (consistency) of message-relevant thoughts, but moderate evaluation of message credibility buffered the generation of consistent message-relevant thoughts. Finally, the valence (consistency) of message-relevant thoughts had a curvilinear relationship with the intention to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, albeit with a small effect size. Results suggest the complexity in influencing behavioral intentions via 360-degree videos in VR. Nonetheless, the findings support the proposition that the immersive affordance of immersive storytelling content could prompt users to align with campaign messages by activating a positive heuristic bias.",

Next, drawing on the media practice model, we investigated how sociodemographic and sociopsychological factors contribute to those usage patterns and found that girls, older adolescents, and adolescents with higher scores for depressive symptoms and flourishing were more likely to belong to Class 2. Those findings offer new insights into adolescents’ social media connection and disconnection that can inform interventions to promote healthier smartphone use among adolescents.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing body of literature on the use and selection of social media platforms for political activism. However, less attention has been given to identifying citizens who are politically disconnected—those registered on social media platforms but not engaging in political activities. Additionally, whether patterns of non-use of social media for politics vary across different platforms remains understudied. Based on an online survey of 1,978 respondents conducted after the 2022 French presidential election campaign, this article aims to address these questions by examining the patterns and factors contributing to political disconnection from social media, particularly across six platforms: Facebook, private social networks, Instagram, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok. Our findings indicate that three main factors explain political disconnection: digital skills, interest in politics (except for platforms less frequently used for politics), and social media efficacy. These results provide significant and original contributions to the broader debate on how and why individuals disconnect socially and technologically on social media platforms. While many studies focus on the variables that account for political participation in the age of social media, ours examines the conditions that explain non-use in the context of political disconnection. We also contribute to the existing literature by analysing the phenomenon of non-use holistically, addressing platform type, demographics, digital literacy, and political traits (e.g., interest and competence).",

          "abstract": "This article aims to show the applicability and evaluation of a teaching-learning method based on user experience (UX) design and extended reality (XR) in architectural studios. In the summer of 2023, the XR Assisted: Transformable and Interactive Design studio utilized the UX+XR teaching-learning method. During the studio, the emphasis was on designing a transformable and interactive architectural installation, with the UX as a center and XR, artificial intelligence, and inmotics as design and visualization tools. In the UX+XR method, the users were the students, and each student designed transformable architecture by applying UX strategies to their specific urban installation users. The UX+XR method had four phases. Each phase incorporated a cross-strategy UX+XR during the design process stages. Using UX+XR, the participants designed an architectural installation where the concepts of transformability, ephemerality, interactivity, flexibility, adaptability, versatility, and playfulness were present. Based on testing the six architectural installations designed during the studio using the UX+XR method, our data showed that XR enhanced the designer’s perception, constituted a new means of expression on an accurate scale, and is a highly immersive and interactive resource for communicating ideas and reinforcing visualization, simulation, stimulation, and interaction. XR is a powerful tool that, as used in the designed method, allows an elevated level of visual communication, understanding of spatial dimensions, and an effective multi-user collaborative strategy for evaluating the designed proposals.",

This concept, dubbed technoference, underlies the current study on how technological intrusions influence the parent–child relationship. This study of U.S. co-parents in families of preschool- and kindergarten-aged children examines the extent to which such interruptions are perceived to have negative consequences on the relationships that co-parents have with their children. The study found that the more the participant perceived the other co-parent as allowing technology to interfere during parent–child time together, the more likely the participant was to rate their co-parent's parent–child relationship quality negatively. Additional studies are needed to understand the young child's view of their parents' media use and how it impacts on their relationships.",

          "abstract": "An increasing number of researchers are focusing on the adverse consequences of parental phubbing, however, it remains unstudied whether and how parental phubbing impact adolescent materialism. To address the research gap, we investigated the temporal and bidirectional relationships between parental phubbing, loneliness, and adolescent materialism. To be thorough, the mediating role of loneliness and the moderating role of gender were examined. Data were collected from 1,447 Chinese adolescents in June 2019 (T1) and January 2020 (T2). The results showed that T1 parental phubbing positively predicted T2 adolescent materialism, and T1 adolescent loneliness positively predicted T2 materialism, whereas neither of the reverse associations held. There were bidirectional relationships between parental phubbing and adolescent loneliness. Loneliness mediated the association between parental phubbing and subsequent adolescent materialism. There were no gender differences in these relationships. These findings enrich the literature by providing the first empirical support for how parental phubbing increases adolescent materialism.",

          "abstract": "Right-wing think tanks are a major source of partisan knowledge. Their influence is rooted in their strategic hybridity, namely their ability to use the resources of fields outside politics to promote their partisan messages. This strategic hybridity is especially powerful in relation to the academy, as arguments can be framed with the trappings of scholarship without first passing muster in the scholarly community. This article documents how strategic hybridity has deepened online as the organization PragerU embraces a new tactic—the influencer-intellectual—and a new genre—social media ads—to advance its right-wing cause. To illustrate this new complexity, I analyze ads PragerU ran on Meta platforms that attacked the 1619 Project and had at least 20 million impressions. Beyond reconceptualizing hybridity, I review the shortcomings of Meta’s Ad Library while making the case for its value in tracking the spilling of partisanship from formal politics into culture.",

          "abstract": "This article explores how the influencer and traditional entertainment industries are converging in the “child idol” phenomenon—a celebrity genre and system that had existed prior to the emergence of the influencer industry but has now been remixed with the influencer industry’s convention and refashioned as the stepping stone to lubricate children’s journeys toward professional idol careers in the wake of K-pop culture. We examine the “child idol” phenomenon as a case study wherein children perform as a younger version of K-pop idols under entertainment agencies’ in-house training systems, with calibrated construction of social media personae by influencer agencies and their parents. Despite ongoing attempts to protect children in the industry, undertaken by the Korean government and human rights organizations, the exploitative environment of child stars becomes even more serious as it becomes a template adopted by other countries emulating the success of K-pop.",

This study examined the heterogeneity of Chinese youth's cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies and conflict resolution responses, as well as their collective influence on individuals' perceived partner responsiveness (PPR) and relationship satisfaction. We recruited 300 Chinese youth who were currently involved in romantic relationships to complete self‐reported measures of CER (reappraisal and suppression), conflict resolution responses in romantic relationships (exit, voice, neglect, and loyalty), PPR, and relationship satisfaction. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to classify the combined effects of CER and conflict resolution responses, identifying four profiles: releasing, gentle, proactive, and inhibiting. Proactive communicators have significantly higher levels of relationship satisfaction compared to the other three groups and significantly higher levels of PPR compared to individuals in releasing and inhibiting profiles. Individuals in releasing and gentle profiles have significantly higher relationship satisfaction and PPR than individuals in the inhibiting profile. This study uncovered the possible associations between Chinese young adults' emotion regulation and conflict response profiles and romantic relationship process and outcome by adopting the person‐centered approach. We further discussed the practical implications of the findings.",

          "abstract": "People in romantic relationships experience a decline in sexual desire as the relationship progresses, leading them to seek couples therapy. Discrimination and added stress exacerbate this decline. Prior research has identified self‐expansion (i.e., a person's need to expand their selves to take on more perspectives and worldviews) as a relational process to bolster sexual desire. It remains untested if self‐expansion can enhance sexual desire among couples who are the targets of discrimination, such as people in interracial relationships. We considered previous research that identified perspective‐taking as a process to promote positive self‐expansion (i.e., perceiving greater positive vs. negative traits from one's partner into their self‐concept) among White partners in interracial relationships. In our pre‐registered study, we predicted discrimination salience will be positively associated with positive self‐expansion for people who engage in high levels of perspective‐taking and negatively associated with positive self‐expansion for those who engage in low levels of perspective‐taking. In turn, greater positive self‐expansion would be associated with greater sexual desire. There was no interaction between discrimination salience and perspective‐taking on positive self‐expansion. Alternatively, we did find that White partners who considered their partner's perspective, regardless of discrimination salience, reported greater positive self‐expansion, which predicted greater sexual desire.",

          "abstract": "Negative attributions about the cause of and blame for relationship problems are highly predictive of relationship dysfunction and depression. Consequently, researchers have attempted to understand the role of negative relationship attributions in the association between depression and relationship functioning, with theory and research suggesting negative attributions may mediate the association between depression and relationship functioning. However, these studies were conducted on individuals, not couples. Including a couple of data and employing a dyadic design can provide a more holistic picture of the associations among these variables. The present study used the actor‐partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM) to examine associations among depressive symptoms, relationship functioning, and negative partner attributions. Different‐gender couples ( N = 200) seeking couples’ clinical services completed measures of negative relationship attributions, relationship distress, and depressive symptoms. Results revealed depressive symptoms to be indirectly related to one's own and one's partner's relationship functioning through one's own negative causal attributions. Actor and partner effects of responsibility attributions and depressive symptoms on relationship functioning were also observed. Results underscore the possible mechanistic role of negative attributions—particularly causal attributions—in maintaining the depression‐relationship dysfunction association.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the rising trend of loneliness and depression among adolescents in the context of Chinese culture, investigating the relationship between different patterns of disclosure and secrecy and adolescent anxiety and loneliness. A person‐centered approach was used to explore disclosure and secrecy in relationships of 253 adolescents ( M = 15.52, range = 14–18, 54.4% female) from Nanjing's public schools and the impact of these patterns on their levels of depression and loneliness. The results indicate that adolescent disclosure and secrecy toward parents and good friends are correlated with adolescent depression and loneliness. Five groups can be identified based on disclosure and secrecy, with each group demonstrating significant differences in the degree of disclosure and secrecy and distinct characteristics. Significant differences exist in the levels of adolescent depression and loneliness among the different groups. This study emphasizes the value of a person‐centered approach. Findings suggest that having multiple avenues for dialogue is more beneficial than merely increasing the volume of disclosure within any single channel. This emphasizes the importance of a diversified support network in enhancing adolescent well‐being. The research also recognizes that small samples can uncover more complex or diversified groups that exhibit unique behavioral patterns within specific cultures.",

          "abstract": "In the ever-evolving landscape of online communication, memes have emerged as potent tools for influencing public opinion. This qualitative study explores the motivations, intentions, and strategic approaches of six meme creators through semi-structured in-depth interviews. It analyses how meme creators perceive and recognize their evolving roles as political actors, challenging traditional communication paradigms, resonating with audiences, driving conversations, and democratizing political engagement. The results reveal meme creators’ nuanced understanding of their content’s educational potential and ability to sway and influence perceptions. Meme creators view themselves as agents of change and perceive their role as crucial in the landscape of contemporary political communication, where they can shape public discourse and influence collective attitudes. They strategically frame political messages and set agendas, viewing their work as a continuation of political satire’s rich tradition. This study highlights their awareness of the ethical complexities involved and analyses how these meme creators turned into modern political actors and grapple with concerns around the monetization of memes and the spread of misinformation. Overall, this research offers a rare glimpse into the world of meme creators as it sheds light on their innovative strategies, their role in democratizing media, and their ability to transform the way we engage with politics. It underscores the transformative potential of memes and highlights that the meme creators’ work is not just about humor, but about making a significant impact on political engagement and public discourse.",

          "abstract": "Content moderation is commonly used by social media platforms to curb the spread of hateful content. Yet, little is known about how users perceive this practice and which factors may influence their perceptions. Publicly denouncing content moderation—for example, portraying it as a limitation to free speech or as a form of political targeting—may play an important role in this context. Evaluations of moderation may also depend on interpersonal mechanisms triggered by perceived user characteristics. In this study, we disentangle these different factors by examining how the gender, perceived similarity, and social influence of a user publicly complaining about a content-removal decision influence evaluations of moderation. In an experiment ( n = 1,586) conducted in the United States, the Netherlands, and Portugal, participants witnessed the moderation of a hateful post, followed by a publicly posted complaint about moderation by the affected user. Evaluations of the fairness, legitimacy, and bias of the moderation decision were measured, as well as perceived similarity and social influence as mediators. The results indicate that arguments about freedom of speech significantly lower the perceived fairness of content moderation. Factors such as social influence of the moderated user impacted outcomes differently depending on the moderated user’s gender. We discuss implications of these findings for content-moderation practices.",

While the question of turning on one’s camera has pedagogical consequences, our study sets out to examine the implications for pupils’ and teachers’ privacy. Focusing on a comparative approach, and drawing on communication privacy management and contextual integrity theories, we examine the negotiations over privacy during ERT in high schools in two distinct privacy cultures (Israel and Germany). Based on semi-structured interviews with pupils and teachers ( n = 35) we found that despite substantively different cultural predispositions, legal environments, and rhetorical rationales, the established norms and privacy management strategies related to camera use were strikingly similar among both teachers and students in the two countries.",

          "abstract": "This article contextualizes contemporary forms of digital ghosting by examining how two of its historical precursors—Victorian calling culture and answering machines—have been represented in North American women’s magazines. To do so, we develop mediated avoidance as an analytical heuristic. This concept captures the material, relational and social dimensions of a set of understudied media practices that seek to strategically engage with the gaps that are inherent in all communication, to defer, deflect, or disrupt mediated connections. Representations of mediated avoidance from respective eras were found to reflect different anxieties over the management of the public/private divide. Calling culture relied on unpaid labor to facilitate the transmission of printed messages between bourgeoise women and was constrained by an array of social protocols that regulated interactions along conceptions of propriety. The disconnective features of answering machines, meanwhile, were represented as giving women the upper hand in courtship, as well as providing means for increased productivity and self-care, foreshadowing contemporary justifications of digital disconnection. Concerns over contemporary ghosting are discussed as produced by a spillage of media practices. Ghosting is considered acceptable in feminine-coded spheres like courtship. But it is viewed as inappropriate—sometimes even as signaling a broader social crisis—when it bleeds into other contexts, like when an employee ghosts their employer.",

The images provoke a dialogue about how photography can be used, not only as an ethnographic passport, but also in a broader sense of encountering spaces, processes and organizations, thus assisting in unpacking various layers of society and how it (dis)connects with nature. Developing a ‘go-along’ ethnographic approach, such as taking ‘toxic tours’ with research subjects, the techniques of portraiture, landscape and documentary photography were used to produce a sequence of vignettes (as opposed to photographic series) that reveal interlocking modalities of contestation and questions of environmental (in)justices. The combination of images and text uniquely afforded by the format of the photo-essay engenders an understanding not only of the unique individual stories of the people embroiled in this coastal problem, but their connection to wider social structures amidst a seemingly ‘local’ siting struggle.",
