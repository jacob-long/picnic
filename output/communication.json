          "abstract": "In this paper, we will present the horror game SOMA and the artistic game Morphogenic Angels: Chapter 1 as exemplary cases within science fiction for the expression and experience of cultural understandings of technologically augmented beings and environments. Locating contemporary cultural myths of technology within both games, we will show the protopian and dystopian function of both cases and locate them in a broad socio-cultural context of technology forecasting. Considering the specific nature of the digital game as an in-itself augmenting technological medium, we will additionally introduce a somaesthetic perspective of player experience to the game analysis, in order to point out the relevance of the immediate bodily perception of games for informing the reflection of diegetic realities. Finally, this paper will provide an overview on how science-fiction games represent and establish experiences and reflections of the progressing augmentation of bodies and their environment.",

          "authors": "Kateryna Kasianenko",
          "abstract": "This paper identifies the visibility practices of Japanese Twitter users supporting Ukraine during Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. Studies of digital visibility often suggest that moral goals and ideals are not attainable in such practices, as they clash with conditions of visibility configured by social media. This has led scholars to suggest that moral paradoxes, or the need to reconcile conflicting considerations, are the main characteristic of visibility on social media platforms. In this study, through an innovative mixed-methods approach for analysing visibility practices, I also outline several moral paradoxes underlying practices through which Japanese Twitter users enhance or decrease the visibility of actors associated with Russia’s war on Ukraine. However, by adopting the conceptual approach of ‘ethics as practice’ which emphasises the moral considerations of practitioners when faced with a moral conundrum, I argue that users driven by the moral call to support Ukraine recognise the limitations of Twitter’s regime of visibility. Their grappling with the identified paradoxes as they engage in visibility practices is what gives moral value to these practices.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores how the major studios’ decision to release blockbuster movies on streaming services during the COVID-19 pandemic altered moviegoers’ perception of the theatrical experience. The study utilizes qualitative textual analysis of Twitter/X conversations to analyze how moviegoers’ attitudes toward streaming blockbuster movies changed across various phases of the pandemic. Operating within the framework of media substitution theory, the research highlights how brand equity and social word-of-mouth (sWOM) influence consumer attitudes towards streaming services as a potential substitution for the traditional moviegoing experience. The findings offer significant implications for industry practices and contribute valuable insights for future scholarly research in this area.",

          "authors": "AnneMarie K McClain, Marie-Louise Mares",
          "abstract": "In an online experiment, 498 U.S. Black parents (child aged 3–5, 9–11, 15–17) were randomized to imagine their child had “an okay day” or experienced peer racism. They watched four age-appropriate video trailers that varied in affective tone (positive vs. mixed) and theme (race-related vs. not), rated their likelihood of encouraging their child to watch each and selected one. Regardless of condition and child age, encouragement was higher for race-related versus “nonracial” videos. Parents in the racism (vs. okay day) condition had greater odds of selecting race-related content, including racism depictions. As such, results were more consistent with the Selective Exposure Self- and Affect-Management model than Mood Management predictions. Perceptions of child identity strength and parent identity strength predicted encouragement; parent identity strength predicted selection; child age group mostly did not predict outcomes. Effects of condition on selection of racial vs. entertainment content were mediated by three types of goals. Public significance This study suggests U.S. Black parents can see value in showing their child age-appropriate content featuring racial pride messages and youth racism experiences. Following a child racism experience, Black parents had greater inclinations to select both types of race-related content over race-unrelated content, with little differences by child age.",

          "authors": "Tingting Liu, Quanwu Zhao",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the dynamics of solver engagement in online creative crowdsourcing competitions through the lens of social comparison between entries. Using data from ZBJ.com, a leading Chinese crowdsourcing platform, the authors examine how competitors’ prior entries, reviewed by seekers and incorporating both positive and negative feedback, influence subsequent solver behavior. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on data from the logo design crowdsourcing competitions held on ZBJ.com in 2020, this study categorized solvers based on their exposure to competitors’ entries with positive feedback, negative feedback, or both. Logistic regression and sentiment analysis, using Naive Bayes, CNSenti, and SnowNLP models, along with a fusion model, were employed for the analysis, with various heterogeneity and endogeneity checks to ensure result reliability. Findings The results demonstrate that the number of competitors’ visible entries receiving either positive or negative feedback from seekers is positively correlated with the likelihood of solvers submitting a second entry. The distance between the seeker-reviewed entries and the solvers’ second entries weakens these positive effects. When simultaneously exposed to both positive and negative feedback entries, solvers show greater attention to the positive feedback entries, indicating a “positive bias”. Originality/value This study deepens our understanding of social comparison dynamics and the phenomenon of entry visibility in creative crowdsourcing competitions. It reveals how the combination of publicly visible entries and their associated feedback influences solver engagement, as well as the moderating effect of the entry location, providing novel insights into the motivations of solvers.",

          "authors": "Gerit Tänzer, Christian Matt",
          "abstract": "Purpose The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has confronted management with substantial challenges, requiring organizations to respond to dynamic market changes and continuously adapt to a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted this necessity by exposing VUCA concepts to substantial shock. However, whether the COVID-19 pandemic marks a phase of abnormal VUCA characteristics or whether organizations will face different VUCA challenges in the post-COVID-19 era is unclear. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a literature review to synthesize and compare VUCA research before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a trend matrix, we illustrate and specify the evolution of research themes that address VUCA characteristics. Findings We present a VUCA evolution model that reveals a shift toward operational adaptability and continuous learning as key drivers in the post-COVID-19 era, as emphasized by the increased priority of people-centered approaches. The results indicate an organizational transformation toward self-organization that enables resilience through a holistic perspective of continuous learning and co-creation. Our study contributes to understanding organizations’ resilience and bridges the gap between the theoretical and practical VUCA research dimensions. Originality/value VUCA concepts were not coined with global pandemics in mind but were created to support organizations dealing with crises. We explored how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected VUCA’s conceptual foundations and research focus. Our results orient scholarship toward new foci of VUCA research and assist practitioners in identifying critical areas of focus regarding VUCA challenges in the post-COVID-19 era.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary discourse on the affordances of organizational information and communication technologies (ICTs) has largely been captivated by the allure of visibility. This article challenges that glare by elucidating the overlooked yet pivotal roles of a set of other organizational ICT affordances. Through a dominance analysis, our findings illuminate that awareness—the capacity of ICTs to link information and actors in an ongoing digital tapestry—and pervasiveness—the widespread nature, across time and space, of digital content and interactions—hold greater explanatory power compared to visibility in understanding some types of interactions fostered by ICTs (communication frequency, information-sharing quality at work [within and across departments], and identity processes [departmental and organizational]). By spotlighting the explanatory strength of affordances such as awareness and pervasiveness and somewhat dimming the role of visibility, this study urges scholars and practitioners alike to broaden their focus on the affordances of media in the digital workplace.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: This study aimed to gain an understanding of what makes learning effective in educational virtual reality (VR) experiences. By integrating insights from cognitive load theory and the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing, we investigated the role of different dimensions of cognitive load as potential predictors (i.e., intrinsic and extraneous load) and outcomes (i.e., germane load) of interactivity and consequently learning. A one-group pretest-posttest laboratory experiment was conducted among young adults ( N = 102). The results show that intrinsic load hinders learner-content interactions, whereas extraneous load hinders overall interactivity. However, interactivity did not affect germane load, nor was germane load found to predict learning scores. Taken together, these findings call for refinements in cognitive load theory to account for the interplay between the different types of cognitive load in VR learning environments. Furthermore, the results suggest that instructional designers should be cautious in assuming that more interactions will necessarily lead to better learning outcomes. Instead, the focus should be on facilitating high-quality learner-content interactions that are directly aligned with learning objectives.",

Through semi-structured interviews with community partners and environmental health experts, an iterative design process refined a VR experience to ensure cultural appropriateness and narrative relevance. The findings highlight the potential of integrating CBPR and SRD approaches to create VR narratives on systemic inequities and environmental racism that are co-created with affected communities. Challenges in balancing interactivity and narrative coherence were identified, underscoring the need for ongoing community involvement and iterative refinement. This approach shifts VR design from a top-down model to one rooted in shared agency and appropriate representation, pushing the narrative’s potential for understanding lived realities shaped by systemic racism.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: While there has been several decades of augmented reality (AR) research in terms of psychological effects and outcomes, the level of theoretical development in the AR space has been fairly limited. The manuscript identifies several factors that contribute to this, starting from the historical definitions of AR, to how it has become an umbrella term for a wide range of technologies, and how ongoing development in AR continues to stretch that definition. By understanding some of the factors that make theoretical development difficult, this article identifies some areas of media psychology theory that would be relevant to all implementations of AR as well as some contextual theories that would only be brought in with specific implementations of AR. The manuscript then advances a framework for thinking about these differences in AR implementations and theory building, whether that is to isolate specific variables and build theory in that way, combine these variables and attempt to combine/bridge theory, or identify unique features of AR that might necessitate transforming existing media theories. This article aims to help researchers understand the current state of theorization and identify certain pathways for improving theoretical development with future studies into AR media technologies.",

Results demonstrate that tangram performance and partner trust increase as a function of neural similarities among interacting participants.

          "abstract": "Abstract: While the application of virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies to enhance learning motivation in science education remains a hot topic that garners significant interest from scholars, there is a paucity of studies addressing whether and how VR or MR may be more effective in motivating students’ learning intention. Accordingly, the current study investigates the distinctive effects of VR and MR on students’ learning intention through the theoretical lenses of plausibility illusion and enjoyment. Employing a within-subject design experiment ( N = 71), the current research explores whether and how the learning experience of the solar system, either via VR or MR headsets, may impact students’ intention to learn using VR or MR. We posited that the sense of plausibility illusion and enjoyment will serially mediate the impact of XR modality (VR vs. MR) on students’ learning intention. Results from a two-condition within-subjects mediation analysis confirmed the significant mediating effects of plausibility illusion and enjoyment on the relationship between XR modality and learning intention. By exploring the differences in the structural affordances of VR and MR technologies, this study provides insights into understanding the distinctive roles of VR and MR technologies on students’ learning intentions.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines two early steps in friendship initiation: (1) Perceiving potential friends’ interest, and (2) responding to that interest. We also consider how attachment insecurity might create challenges with these steps. In Study 1, two unacquainted participants briefly interacted, then reported their own interest in friendship and their perceptions of the other person’s interest in friendship. People generally underestimated others’ interest, yet they also projected their own interest onto others and reciprocated others’ interest. Avoidantly-attached individuals were especially likely to underestimate others’ interest. They were also less interested in others, regardless of others’ interest; this link was mediated by lower perceptions of others’ interest. Anxiously-attached individuals’ interest was not associated with others’ interest. In Study 2, participants interacted with a potential friend (a confederate) who expressed experimentally-manipulated interest or disinterest in friendship. Avoidantly-attached individuals felt more hostility in response to disinterest than did others; anxiously-attached individuals felt more fear in response to interest than did others. We discuss how attachment insecurity might impede friendship initiation at its earliest stages.",

          "authors": "Corinna Jenkins Tucker, Tanya Rouleau Whitworth, David Finkelhor",
          "abstract": "Research on aggressive and abusive sibling dynamics has grown significantly but is characterized by a disjointed literature, confusion about the identification of harmful behaviors, and missed opportunities for increasing awareness and prevention and intervention activities. This paper proposes several important suggestions about the classification and differentiation of sibling aggression. First, there is a level of sibling aggression that merits the terminology of sibling abuse and is on a par with the severity of child abuse and spousal abuse within the larger rubric of family violence. Sibling abuse should be characterized as relationships involving repetitive ongoing emotional and physical violence, in a context of power imbalance, with signs of harm and intimidation. Second, there should be another category of sibling aggression that does not rise to the level of abuse, but still merits active intervention and repair. This is termed destructive conflict, which can be divided into mild and severe sub-categories. Severe destructive conflict entails aggression that is likely mutual and includes objects as weapons, injury, or threats of serious injury. In addition, we distinguish two categories that we would categorize as non-pathological: rivalry and constructive conflict. We assert that efforts to apply bullying terminology to sibling aggression have some important drawbacks and should be avoided. Research is needed to help confirm the utility of a classification of this sort. The proposed classification could enhance the cohesiveness of the research literature and lead to changes in professional practice, which often lacks training and access to evidence-based guidelines on sibling dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Following an adapted vulnerability stress adaptation (VSA) model, we used the Building Strong Families (BSF) project data to examine how mothers’ and fathers’ depressive symptoms and financial stress relate to adaptive processes, namely, constructive conflict and coparenting alliance. The sample consisted of racially diverse, low-income parents who were unmarried at the conception of their child ( N = 3,027 couples). All study variables were measured when children were 36 months old. Some results were in line with the theory: For both mothers and fathers, higher depressive symptoms were associated with (1) lower constructive conflict and lower coparenting alliance (direct effects) and (2) lower constructive conflict via higher financial stress (indirect effects). Contrary to theoretical predictions, there was no support for the proposed indirect effects for mothers’ and fathers’ coparenting alliance. Implications of the findings include the value of adapting the VSA to focus on both depressive symptoms and financial stress as vulnerabilities and stressors when working with populations similar to the BSF to promote relational adaptive processes, such as constructive conflict and coparenting alliance.",

          "authors": "Kyosuke Kakinuma, Keise Izuma",
          "abstract": "When people experience conflicts between their ideal standards and their partner’s actual state, they often resolve conflict through communication. Numerous observational studies suggest that direct regulation attempts (e.g., requesting one’s partner to change) are positively associated with the behavior change of the target partner. However, previous research using between-person and correlational designs has provided limited evidence. Moreover, the psychological components of partner regulation that affect targets’ intentions and behavior remain unclear. Therefore, we employed a within-person experimental paradigm to rigorously test targets’ psychological processes underlying interpersonal conflict resolution through communication. This focused on the discrepancy between targets’ actual states and requesters’ ideals. In the paradigm, we systematically manipulated targets’ perceived discrepancy. In our experiment (N = 78 couples), targets were asked to rate the actual frequency of 40–80 important actions, and requesters were asked to rate the ideal frequency of the targets’ actions. These actions were then randomly assigned to either the discrepancy feedback or no-feedback condition. Results showed that, in the feedback condition, discrepancies were positively associated with targets’ intentions to improve their behavior (but not with behavioral changes). These findings suggest that although people can facilitate their partners’ intention to change important actions by simply communicating their ideals, they must make additional efforts (e.g., suggesting a solution and promoting prospective memory) to get their partners to execute the intention. This study provides critical insight into the psychological process underlying conflict resolution in close relationships using a within-person experiment.",

Warmth was significantly higher in Türkiye than the other countries, and conflict was significantly higher in the US than in the other samples. Sibling size played an important role in sibling relationships in Türkiye, Israel, and Korea. Frequency of contact between participant and focal sibling predicted warmth in all countries. Marital status of the focal sibling was also associated with warmth in the sibling relationship in Korea and the US.

          "abstract": "During challenging periods like the transition to parenthood, support from one’s partner becomes of vital importance for maintaining a healthy relationship. Responsiveness describes that relationship partners attend to and react in a supportive manner to one’s disclosed concerns and feelings in times of need. Perceived partner responsiveness occurs when one partner acts in a way that the other partner perceives as responsive to his or her needs, conveying understanding, validation, and care. However, such perceptions are highly subjective and shaped by attachment orientations of the perceiver, especially during challenging times. Besides, when partner behavior is perceived as responsive, this can also be beneficial for the relationship and promote a sense of security. The current study examined whether attachment insecurities predicted changes of perceived partner responsiveness across the transition to parenthood, and whether perceived partner responsiveness predicted changes in attachment orientations across time. We investigated changes in perceived responsiveness in 120 mixed-gender couples across the transition to parenthood over four different time points (during pregnancy, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months after the birth of their first child). The results suggest that although perceived responsiveness increased during the transition to parenthood, the increase was significantly less strong in individuals who scored higher in attachment insecurities. Additionally, examination of changes in attachment orientations shows significantly less increases of attachment insecurities when individuals perceived their partner’s responsiveness across the transition to parenthood.",

A quantitative analysis of 300 Sudan Tribune and Al Jazeera articles on Darfur investigates whether JPJ can strengthen day-to-day reporting and whether its principles extend beyond Darfur. The findings reveal that, while normative frameworks often struggle to influence routine news practices, JPJ elements emerge when supported by editorial policies, sufficient resources, and receptive audiences. Building on these insights, the study proposes strategies for independent journalists and local media to elevate ethical inquiry, and it encourages further exploration of JPJ’s applicability across diverse contexts.",

Rooted in a constructionist framing analysis framework, it identifies frames as packages of framing elements, including actors (individuals and organizations) and topics, extending beyond topic-focused methods in prior unsupervised analyses. Compared with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)- and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based approaches on 1,300 U.S. gun violence news articles, this method addresses LDA’s limitations by focusing on high-level framing elements rather than keywords and is less labor-intensive than BERT-based supervised learning. Supporting both inductive and deductive analyses, it achieves comparable results to LDA while uncovering a previously unidentified gun violence frame.",

          "abstract": "Disinformation in Europe is a significant challenge to democracy. The pan-European conversation faces a landscape dominated by misleading or false information targeting the EU. In response, various public institutions have been promoting fact-checking initiatives. Our research analyzes the fact-checking initiatives developed by these institutions at national and regional levels. This study identifies and describes organizations ranging from dedicated initiatives, such as VerificaRTVE in Spain and ARD-Faktenfinder in Germany, to news media and fact-checking platforms funded by public money. Our analysis is based on nine semi-structured interviews with professionals conducting fact-checking across the EU. We explored topics such as content selection criteria, audience involvement, collaboration with stakeholders, dissemination practices, and the evolving role of AI in supporting these activities. Results highlight a growing number of fact-checking initiatives, particularly those associated with public service media, with AI increasingly integrated into their operations. However, our findings also reveal concerns related to the pace of digital transformation and limited resources. This research provides insights into the future of fact-checking in Europe, where public fact-checking efforts and media literacy initiatives remain underdeveloped. Our study contributes to ongoing discussions about the creation of a robust European Public Sphere, arguing that public institutions can play a pivotal role in mitigating disinformation within a shared space for democratic deliberation.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to dissect the normative discourse about artificial intelligence (AI) transparency using frame analysis. By employing a predominantly deductive, qualitative, and interpretative approach, the research leverages a qualitative frame analysis informed by a literature review on AI ethics and transparency. The study examines various AI ethical frameworks and regulations—China’s Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, the OECD’s Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence, the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, and the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act—to understand how transparency is framed, transparency’s objects, the defined accountability, and the responsible entities for ensuring transparency in the production of AI information. The study highlights transparency as a core ethical principle for trustworthy AI, emphasising its importance in final outputs and throughout AI development and deployment stages for fostering public trust. The findings indicate variability in language, priorities, and approaches to transparency across different frameworks, influenced by their socio-political, economic, and cultural contexts. Despite encouraging transparency as an ethical principle, the study notes a need for concrete guidance for its practical implementation across different AI applications. This gap underscores the need for critical examination and improvement in governance to enhance transparency and accountability in AI development and deployment. The innovative methodological approach, combining qualitative frame analysis with a theory-driven codebook, offers a novel template for investigating key concepts and issues in AI ethics and governance.",

          "abstract": "Policymakers and news producers have long grappled with the challenges that fake news and misinformation pose to quality journalism. This has given rise to an extensive body of literature, covering various aspects from the characteristics of fake news to strategies for addressing it. However, the preferences of news consumers regarding the future of journalism and their views on how journalistic commitment to truth can best be maintained remain relatively overlooked in scholarly research. This article utilizes primary data from a survey (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 4,521) fielded in Norway, Italy, and Poland in 2023 to show that, even in contemporary media environments, people continue to regard traditional journalistic ideals as the normative goals for future journalism.

          "abstract": "The emergence of social media companies, and the spread of disinformation as a result of their “surveillance capitalist” business model, has opened wide political and regulatory debates across the globe. The EU has often positioned itself as a normative leader and standard-setter, and has increasingly attempted to assert its sovereignty in relation to social media platforms. In the first part of this article, we argue that the EU has achieved neither sovereignty nor normative leadership: Existing regulations on disinformation in fact have missed the mark since they fail to challenge social media companies’ business models and address the underlying causes of disinformation. This has been the result of the EU increasingly “outsourcing” regulation of disinformation to corporate platforms. If disinformation is not simply a “bug” in the system, but a feature of profit-driven platforms, public–private cooperation emerges as part of the problem rather than a solution. In the second part, we outline a set of priorities to imagine alternatives to current social media monopolies and discuss what could be the EU’s role in fostering them. We argue that alternatives ought to be built decolonially and across the stack, and that the democratisation of technology cannot operate in isolation from a wider socialist political transformation of the EU and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Many who believed Covid-19 fake news eschewed vaccines, masks, and social distancing; got unnecessarily infected; and died. To detect such fake news, we follow deceptive writing theory and link French hedges and modals to validity. As hedges indicate uncertainty, fake news writers can use it to include falsehoods while shifting responsibility to the audience. Whereas &lt;em&gt;devoir&lt;/em&gt; (must) emphasizes certainty and truth, &lt;em&gt;falloir &lt;/em&gt;(should, need) implies truth but emphasizes external factors, allowing writers to shirk responsibility. &lt;em&gt;Pouvoir&lt;/em&gt; (can) indicates possibility, making it less tied to truth or falsehood. We tested this model with 50,000 French tweets about Covid-19 during March–August 2020 via mixed response analysis. Tweets with hedges or the modal &lt;em&gt;falloir&lt;/em&gt; were more likely than others to be false, those with &lt;em&gt;devoir&lt;/em&gt; were more likely to be true, and those with &lt;em&gt;pouvoir &lt;/em&gt;showed no clear link to truth. Tweets of users with verification, more followers, or fewer status updates were more likely to be true.

          "abstract": "Electoral campaigns are one of the key moments of democracy. In recent times, the circulation of disinformation has increased during these periods. This phenomenon has serious consequences for democratic health since it can alter the behaviour and decisions of voters. This research aims to analyse the features of this phenomenon during the 2024 European Parliament elections in a comparative way. The applied methodology is based on quantitative content analysis. The sample (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 278) comprises false information verified by 52 European fact-checking agencies about the campaign for the European elections in 20 EU countries. The analysis model includes variables such as time-period, country, propagator platform, topic, and the type of disinformation. The results show that the life cycle of electoral disinformation goes beyond the closing of the polls assuming a permanent nature. In addition, national environments condition the profiles of this question, which is more intense in Southern and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, although multiple channels are involved, digital platforms with weak ties are predominant in disseminating hoaxes. Finally, migration and electoral integrity are the predominant topics. This favours the circulation of an issue central to the far-right agenda and aims to discredit elections and their mechanisms to undermine democracy. These findings establish the profiles of this problem and generate knowledge to design public policies that combat electoral false content more effectively.",

However, this unprecedented growth has led to the widespread dissemination of misinformation—deliberately or inadvertently false content that can trigger dangerous societal ramifications. Visual analytics combines advanced data analytics and interactive visualizations to explore data and mine insights. This article introduces the Social Media Analytics and Reporting Tool (SMART) 2.0, detailing its application in tracking misinformation on social media. An updated version of its predecessor, SMART 2.0 enables analysts to conduct real-time surveillance of social media content along with complementary data streams, including weather patterns, traffic conditions, and emergency service reports. SMART 2.0 offers enhanced capabilities like map-based, interactive, and AI-powered features that enable researchers to visualize and understand situational changes by assessing public social posts and comments. As a misinformation classification and tracking case study, we collected public, geo-tagged tweets from multiple cities in the UK during the 2024 riots. We showcased the effectiveness of SMART 2.0’s misinformation detection and tracking capabilities. Our findings show that SMART 2.0 effectively tracks and classifies misinformation using a human-in-the-loop approach.",

          "abstract": "This study explored college students’ experiences and evaluations of using ChatGPT for class-related activities including essay writing, exam preparation, and homework. Students from two classes on the same subject were surveyed, and quantitative data on their motivations and usage of ChatGPT were collected (Class 1, &lt;em&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;= 48; Class 2, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 106; &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 154). Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that using ChatGPT as a study guide and for active interaction were significant predictors of actual usage level, while its usage for entertainment and study guide was associated with higher trust in the tool. We further collected qualitative data through open-ended surveys (Class 1, &lt;em&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;= 154; Class 2, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 106). Responses were manually coded and thematically analyzed, with comparisons drawn between the two classes. Students’ perceptions varied, with many acknowledging the affordances of ChatGPT, such as helping to organize thoughts, clarifying concepts, and structuring essays. However, some participants raised concerns about the tool’s limitations—particularly its potential to inhibit critical and creative thinking—as well as issues related to the reliability, accuracy, and quality of information provided. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the uses and gratifications theory, the technology acceptance model, and the concept of media affordances.",

          "authors": "Taru Haapala, Juan Roch",
          "abstract": "Recent research on the EU institutional response to post-truth politics has shown a gradual shift of focus from external threats to internal democratic challenges, including populist parties and elections. The case of Spain is particularly relevant as the country’s “disinformation landscape” has been assessed as exhibiting “acute political and media polarisation” originating from weak media regulation and changes in political and media environments. Furthermore, the Spanish media landscape is characterised by high levels of media ownership concentration with a lack of transparency regarding media influence on governments and politicians. In this context, this article examines how Spanish left and right radical parties discursively constructed media elites for their political purposes and the (potential) evolution of their electoral campaign discourse in 2019 and 2024. We expect that the increasingly central role of the debate on digital regulation at the EU level and the context of post-truth politics more broadly serve as a new ground for radical parties with a populist discourse to de-legitimise mainstream media. The primary sources of the study include the left-wing (Unidas Podemos/Sumar) and the right-wing (Vox) party leader campaign speeches and manifestos in national and EU elections in 2019 and 2024. Our findings show that, when it comes to European elections, the Spanish populist discourse has an increasing trend towards the inclusion of more transnational discourses on media and media elites, especially regarding disinformation and post-truth, although with significant differences between the left and the right.",

          "abstract": "This article calls for systematic analysis of the accumulation and exercise of institutional platform power in the digital economy. We examine how the relatively open mobile advertising ecosystem is nevertheless dominated by a handful of platform conglomerates, most prominently Google, Facebook, and Apple. Although extant scholarship acknowledges the concentration of corporate power in digital advertising, as well as its cultural, societal, and environmental harms, a comprehensive approach to platform power is missing. Providing a framework to develop such insights, we analyze how shifts in the advertising ecosystem are driven by four interrelated institutional platform strategies: infrastructuralization, platformization, conglomeration, and financialization. The 2021 introduction and subsequent rollout of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework serves as an example to demonstrate that even though institutional relationships of dependence are constantly evolving, control over infrastructural nodes tends to entrench the already dominant position of leading platform conglomerates.",

Our research highlights that not all apps are equal amid ubiquitous datafication, with a disproportionate number of SDK services provided by Google, Meta, and Amazon. Our three key findings include: (1) an empirical approach for auditing SDKs; (2) a means to account for modular SDK infrastructure; and (3) the central role that App Events—micro-data points that map every action we make inside of apps—play in the data-for-service economy that SDKs enable. This work is intended to open up space for more critical research on the tracking infrastructures of datafication within our apps in any domain.",

          "abstract": "This article explores how the political–economic balancing of state interests and potential state intervention influences everyday perceptions of platform companies in China. We introduce the term “flexibility imaginary” to describe the adaptability and responsiveness exhibited by our research participants in Hangzhou amid changing conditions and unforeseen transitions. Focusing on the flexibility imaginary aids in unpacking the assumptions, values, and expectations embedded in how societies deal with uncertainty and transformation. By zooming in on the notion of replaceability as a key feature of the flexibility imaginary, we explain how platform companies have become integral yet are still seen as transient elements of daily life. We demonstrate that while the flexibility imaginary shapes local interpretations and political dynamics, it does not challenge the state–corporate digital paradigm that underpins everyday existence. Understanding these limits is crucial for exploring future developments.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces a special issue exploring emerging empirical approaches to studying infrastructures for datafication and their social, political, and economic implications. The merits of empirical research on infrastructures for datafication are drawn out across seven articles offering diverse methodological entry points to develop our understanding of how datafication processes operate across everyday life settings, sectors, and institutions. The contributions span multiple levels of infrastructural analysis, from tracking ecologies to digital platforms and chatbots. They also cover a range of core questions regarding the relationship and power dynamics between private and public institutions, and between big technology companies and everyday citizenhood. In illuminating how infrastructures for datafication operate, for whom and with what ends, the special issue extends a fruitful dialogue between infrastructure studies and people-centric approaches to datafication and opens avenues for infrastructure research across disciplines to create more coherent understandings of how specific technological operations shape social life.",

          "abstract": "We outline the concept of ‘architectures of assetization’ as a way to get at the political-economic configuration of datafication in higher education through the layering of educational technology (‘edtech’) onto existing, legacy infrastructures. Edtech provides a useful empirical object of study because of the increasing deployment of new digital technologies in educational organizations; our focus is on higher education institutions (i.e. universities) in the United Kingdom. The empirical analysis is split between a discussion of digital infrastructures and architectures of (data) assetization in higher education; the tensions arising between new digital infrastructures and legacy infrastructures in UK higher education institutions; and the implications of reconfiguring legacy infrastructures for UK universities. We pay particular attention to the creation of new techno-economic objects, especially the transformation of personal and user data into an asset, as datafication transforms higher education in unexpected and not necessarily beneficial ways.",

          "abstract": "This article critically examines the social implications of data infrastructures designed to moderate contested content categories such as disinformation. It does so in the context of new online safety regulation (e.g. the EU Digital Services Act) that pushes digital platforms to improve how they tackle both illegal and ‘legal but harmful’ content. In particular, we investigate and conceptualise X’s Community Notes, a tool that uses ‘human-AI cooperation’ to add context to tweets, as a data infrastructure for ‘soft moderation’. We find that Community Notes is limited when dealing with under-acknowledged online harms, such as those derived from the intersection between disinformation and humour. While research points to the potential of content moderation solutions that combine automation with humans-in-the-loop, we show how this approach can fail when disinformation is poorly defined in policy and practice.",

          "abstract": "This article asks how our capacities to conduct critical research on digital power are influenced by depending, empirically and methodologically, on powerful market actors controlling the underlying research infrastructure. Building on discussions at the intersection between digital methods, political economy and infrastructure studies, we zoom in on three cases of widely used commercial data tools and repositories for academic studies. Mapping out their methods and applications, we ask of each case: Who owns and offers it? What is (not) measured? And, how is it mobilized in existing research? We thereby explore how they each contribute to the construction of knowledge by setting the standards for measuring, monitoring and ultimately regulating digital power. We conclude that the constructions of digital research infrastructures should be placed at the centre of our investigations – as objects of analysis and as research findings in and by themselves.",

In this article, we consider two cases of public sector chatbots, one in Estonia and one in Sweden, seeking to challenge the seemingly coherent understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector. The aim is to both question the “thingness” of AI and show AI chatbots can be very different things. The material in this article is based on in-depth interviews and observations at public sector institutions that have relatively recently implemented chatbots. We employ the notion of AI frictions as a sensitizing concept to engage with the material and the diverging character of the public sector chatbots in the two countries. In the analysis, we identify AI frictions related to expectations of AI, organizational logics, as well as values connected with the digitalization of the public sector.",

          "abstract": "Partners in romantic relationships influence each other's behaviors through various social exchange processes. One underexplored process that is assumed to be relevant for couples' behaviors is companionship. Companionship is defined as experiencing pleasurable social interactions or engaging in shared activities for the purpose of having an enjoyable time. This study investigated how companionship is associated with physical activity and behavior concordance in physical activity (i.e., similarity in partners' physical activity) in romantic couples. A total of N = 5377 couples ( M age = 66.80; SD age = 11.05) from the US‐based Health and Retirement Study completed four measurement points across 6 years. Multilevel response surface analysis was used to analyze the association between companionship and physical activity. There was a positive linear association between companionship and physical activity in mixed‐gender couples. However, this association disappeared when controlling for covariates (i.e., education, race, household wealth, body mass index, age, health status, and relationship quality). There was no evidence of an association between companionship and behavior concordance. Future research should investigate short‐term dynamics and the direction of causality for the association between companionship and behaviors of interest.",

          "abstract": "We used latent profile analysis to further understand the heterogeneity of individuals' reasons for cohabitation. Using two samples of cohabitors ( N = 563), we measured the extent to which cohabitors endorsed three reasons for cohabiting (time together, testing, and convenience). We identified six profiles: low levels of time together and testing and an average level of convenience (Profile 1; moderately convenience‐driven), high levels of time together and low levels of testing and convenience (Profile 2; time together‐driven), an average level of testing and low levels of time together and convenience (Profile 3; moderately testing‐driven), high levels of convenience and testing, and an average level of time together (Profile 4; convenience and testing‐driven), a high level of convenience and average levels of time together and testing (Profile 5; highly convenience‐driven), and high levels of all three reasons (Profile 6; all reasons‐driven). We found that profile membership was associated with commitment, satisfaction, and ambivalence but not conflict. We also explored whether demographic characteristics were associated with profile membership and found that relationship length at the start of cohabitation and income were significantly associated with profile membership. The current research provides important nuance to the literature on reasons for cohabitation and relationship quality.",

          "abstract": "Public engagement in health technologies continuously expands thanks to increased recognition and financial support. Yet, the lack of a shared definition and standards enables practitioners to conduct initiatives in ways that prioritise their self-interests over the empowerment of citizens. Experts and policymakers generally design engagement initiatives following rigid protocols to fit their agenda, limiting the influence of citizens upstream. In reaction to this and as an attempt to disambiguate public engagement from an ethical perspective, we investigate its intrinsic value. Starting from the assumption that public engagement must primarily empower citizens and not those who already have enough power to make their voices heard, we argue that the more the engagement process puts citizens at the centre, the more the engagement practice becomes valuable regardless of the methods used. To make the citizen-centred approach a reality, we suggest ethical principles that practitioners could apply across the spectrum of engagement.",

          "abstract": "This article is a critical examination of the social media platform Weverse and its associated e-commerce platform Weverse Shop, platforms developed and operated by the Korean entertainment conglomerate Hybe Corporation. Hybe, perhaps best known for being the corporation that manages the K-pop group BTS, uses Weverse to promote and control economic and affective bonds between popular performers and audiences. This article argues that Weverse represents a type of platform that negotiates other models emerging from American and Chinese contexts, advancing Korean corporate interests through the harnessing of integrated fan activities. The use of platform technologies to administer the relations between commodified musical products, stars, and fans represents the emergence of what we term platform fandom . Platform fandom, we argue, is a corporatized technical relation designed to foster affective attachments between fans and stars, negotiating global audiences in which fan communities lose geographic specificity and, consequently, an ability to cohere through the negotiation of inclusion and exclusion of members. This article uses Weverse as a case to examine the intersection of globalized cultural production and entertainment, problems of global fandoms, and the use of social media platforms to manage and mitigate against the seeming risks fans provide for both corporate idols and corporate investments in cultural products.",
