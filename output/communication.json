          "authors": "Wenqing Zhao, Yan Jin, Toni van der Meer, Michael Hameleers, Xuerong Lu",
          "abstract": "Numerous global trends related to communicative conflicts—like widespread public dissent, the increasing fragmentation of the digital media landscape, the fast-paced dissemination of mis- and disinformation, polarization of public debates, and delegitimizing populist rhetoric—form a perfect storm that significantly disrupts today’s society on multiple levels. Against this backdrop, research on content, causes, consequences, and counter-strategies of conflicts has been central to the discipline of communication science and beyond over the past decades. Although many of these societal challenges are rooted in communication problems similar in nature, current research lines appear to move forward in isolation, creating largely disconnected streams of research that could benefit from more integration. With this article, we aim to bring together disconnected strands of literature in communication that revolve around conflicts in mass and digital communication under the umbrella term “informational conflict.” This framework synthesizes existing knowledge, enabling us to better understand the root causes of increasing cleavages in society and to forward potential solutions leading to conflict resolution.",

          "title": "Political participation on social media: conceptual and empirical state of the art and research agenda",
          "authors": "Cato Waeterloos",
          "abstract": "Over the past decades, political participation in an online context has gained substantive attention. However, it is only recently that conceptual advancements have been made concerning the specific expressive and mobilizing practices that occur on social media. This article argues on the importance and implications of recognizing political participation on social media as a conceptually distinct mode of political participation, shaped by unique affordances that highlight its networked and political character. Specifically, the article provides a conceptual and normative state of the art regarding online and social media political participation. By discussing the empirical implications of prominent theoretical assumptions in the field, three key research gaps are identified and I propose a research agenda for the field of political communication.",

          "title": "Thirty years since Kunda: addressing critiques to reimagine a model of motivated reasoning",
          "authors": "Camille J Saucier, Nathan Walter, Stefanie Z Demetriades",
          "abstract": "Following Kunda’s (1990) defense of the influence of motivations on reasoning, a growing body of communication research has coalesced around the idea that specific motivations can influence decision-making. At the same time, this body of research has been subjected to criticisms highlighting alternative explanations that do not involve motivated processes. The present study contributes to this conversation by reviewing the evidence around motivated reasoning as reflected in empirical communication research over the past 30 years (k = 143), focusing on the framework’s key components: motivation, reasoning, and responses. The findings identify considerable gaps, including a limited focus on distinct motivations, an underemphasis on reasoning, and a concentration on a narrow set of responses. This article concludes by proposing the Motivation-Reasoning-Response Model, which visually summarizes the findings of this review and indicates possible opportunities for future research.",

          "authors": "Parker Bach, Carolyn E Schmitt, Shannon C McGregor",
          "abstract": "While clarity is often upheld as a core element of successful communication, we argue that a lack of clarity can also benefit a speaker, a concept called strategic ambiguity. This concept has been used across disciplines for decades, but its definitions are often overly context-specific. In this article, we follow Chaffee’s (1991) framework for explication to survey the literature and provide a unified definition of strategic ambiguity as a rhetorical tactic in which a communicator creates a: (1) polysemic message with multiple reasonable interpretations supported by the text, that is: (2) aimed at audiences from varying interpretive communities; and (3) by which polysemy the communicator stands to gain some specific advantage. We offer methodological suggestions on the study of strategic ambiguity, accompanied by two case studies of strategic ambiguity, centering Congressional newsletters and conservative political satire. We close with suggestions for scholarships that could be informed by incorporating strategic ambiguity.",

This paper explores the design of such a tailored methodology for investigating the value-driven development of online public service media platforms in Germany. While qualitative methodologies are time- and resource-consuming and digital methods leave out less context to the field, this mixed methodology emphasizes the context and invests in collecting thick data. It encompasses multiple stages of recording and mapping that employ qualitative and quantitative approaches to bring together various vignettes, unveiling complementary context and contradictory accounts with the help of visualization. In each mapping and visualization stage, the paper investigates actors and relationships heuristically and emphasizes the work-in-progress nature of mapping regarding platforms.",

          "title": "A collective interdisciplinary agenda for immersive storytelling: Editorial analysis",
          "authors": "Sarah Martindale, Jonathan Hook, Richard Carter",
          "abstract": "This article represents our editorial contribution to the exploration of immersive storytelling, broadly conceived in this Special Issue as a set of creative and design practices, audience experiences, a field of study and a toolkit of rapidly developing digital technologies. Herein we set out our motivation for collaborating as an interdisciplinary team seeking to interrogate and expand on celebratory industry-led discourses that (over-)emphasise the transformative potential of digital innovations for immersive storytelling without properly situating these as part of longer trajectories of creative and audience practice. We provide an account of this background context that purposefully shifts the focus from technologies of the moment – Virtual Reality, the Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence – to the underpinning storytelling that can give rise to, as well as make use of, these technologies to facilitate immersion. Having introduced the various perspectives on immersive storytelling presented in the articles collected in this Special Issue, we go on to draw out key themes, topics and approaches from the body of work as a whole. Our analysis encompasses definitional questions, interdisciplinary perspectives and the sharing of expertise. It highlights the role of users as the nexus of technology and narrative, including emotional and sensory interactions, which contribute to their agency within immersive experiences. The discussion of immersive storytelling moves beyond a focus on VR to consider the wider context, including the overlap between real-world locations and narrative content of experiences, and the importance of setting audience expectations. Because, taken together, the articles include multiple projects and case studies involving designing and making immersive experiences, it is apparent that this is an expanded, rather than normalised, design space in which inclusion and exclusion are important considerations. From these findings we put forward a future agenda for the field of immersive storytelling, which revolves around issues of accessibility, ethics and audience research.",

          "abstract": "This article examines two videogames to uncover their anti-imperial and decolonial qualities. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (2015) and Death Stranding (2019) created by the Japanese videogame designer Hideo Kojima express commentaries on American politics and their effects on the United States and the rest of the world. Kojima has used Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851/1999), a narrative account critiquing American imperialism, as an anchor to extend his own critique of American foreign policies as an outsider affected by US global hegemony. The similarities among the two games and Melville's Moby-Dick run much deeper than what the player sees, and the internal complexities of each narrative surpass the single layer of international politics. The political themes of each game complement and continue the political themes found in Moby-Dick. Both videogames affirm a decolonizing worldview by invalidating American imperial politics and encouraging global players to do the same.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The use of perceptual and objective measures in information systems is an ongoing discussion in IS research, primarily due to different conceptions about objective measures. This research, therefore, empirically tests truly objective measures along with perceptual measures to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the role of perceptual and objective independent variables as predictors of user satisfaction and continuance intention. Design/methodology/approach This paper developed an integrated research model that examines perceptual and objective measures as predictors of satisfaction and continuance intention. The approach was then empirically tested with survey-based perceptual variables and corresponding objective variables in the context of a mobile network operator ( n  = 998). Specifically, we used serial mediation analysis with PROCESS to test our hypotheses. Findings The results showed that the different objective variables show insignificance as predictors of satisfaction and continuance intention, contrasting with previous research calling for objective measures. Originality/value Our results contribute to IS literature by indicating that perceptual measures are superior to objective measures in predictive relevance. Hence the “silent acceptance” of potential conceptual weaknesses is indeed justified by the results of this research.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The persistence and virality of conspiracy theories online have raised significant concerns. This study revisits Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations theory to examine the spread of conspiracy theories on social media, specifically focusing on how factors influencing their diffusion evolve over time. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes over 1.18 million COVID-19-related tweets using a combination of natural language processing, social network analysis and machine learning techniques. It explores the dynamic roles of novelty, content negativity, influencers, echo chamber members and social bots in the diffusion of conspiracy theories. Findings The results indicate that novelty, influencers, echo chamber members and social bots are positively associated with the spread of conspiracy theories. The initial dissemination of conspiracy theories is primarily driven by content novelty and influencer involvement. Over time, the perpetuation of these theories becomes increasingly influenced by content negativity and the involvement of echo chamber members and social bots. Social bots serve as important connectors within echo chambers and their removal significantly reduces network cohesion. Practical implications The findings provide practical guidance for social media platforms and policymakers in monitoring diffusion patterns and applying targeted interventions. Originality/value This study introduces a time-sensitive approach to understanding the spread of conspiracy theories on social media. By identifying the key drivers at different stages of the diffusion process, this study offers valuable insights for developing effective strategies to counteract the proliferation of conspiracy theories at various points in their lifecycle.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Online games are highly popular Internet applications. Some games enable players to save game progress and accumulate experiences or changes to avatars during gameplay, whereas some other games do not, requiring players to restart from the beginning each time. That is, games differ in avatar accumulability. However, we do not know whether games should be designed to permit avatar accumulability or not and how it affects players’ gameplay experience and therefore game outcomes, indicating gaps. Research addressing these gaps can inform game makers in designing games that effectively strengthen their players’ game loyalty. Design/methodology/approach We used social identity theory (SIT) to construct a theoretical model. To test this model, three waves of survey data were gathered from the same 778 participants. Findings These findings uniquely indicate that avatar accumulability fosters avatar identification and increases players’ focused immersion, thus increasing players’ loyalty. Practical implications Game providers could include game features that enable players to accumulate their avatars’ in-game skins, levels, items (weapons and equipment) and experience points. This accumulability can help strengthen players’ game loyalty. Originality/value Overall, our study extends SIT by adding a new trigger (avatar accumulability) and two novel consequences of avatar identification (image protection and focused immersion) in avatar-related systems (games or gamified systems). The new trigger offers an actionable means to apply SIT, while the novel consequences verify the value of applying SIT to study online games.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore how CEOs’ interpersonal communication styles on social media can effectively enhance the relationship with employees and increase their engagement on social media platforms. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted with 404 full-time employees working in corporations across various industries in the US. Only employees who “follow” their company’s CEO on social media were included in the study. Findings CEOs’ use of a conversational tone on social media helps employees perceive them as approachable and interactive leaders, thereby improving the quality of the CEO-employee relationship and increasing employees’ engagement on social media. CEOs’ personal disclosures on social media were found to promote employees’ perceptions of CEO approachability only when paired with a conversational communication style. Research limitations/implications Our study offers theoretical implications for communication and media literature by highlighting the potential of CEOs as chief “engagement” officers, capable of leveraging online platforms (i.e. social media) to foster employee interactions and support. Practical implications This study provides CEOs and communication practitioners with practical guidelines for using social media for both professional and social purposes as a crucial tool for internal relationship management. Originality/value This study is one of the first empirical attempts to examine the value of CEO social media communication as a key tool for building and maintaining quality employee–CEO relationship and engagement.",

          "abstract": "Media effects research has observed significant diversity in the effects of social media on adolescent well-being, with outcomes ranging from positive to negative and, in some cases, neutral effects. In an effort to comprehend and elucidate this diversity, we have formulated The Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues, a theoretical framework that systematically categorizes potential sources contributing to these variations. This dynamic model encompasses the complex layers of social cues present within platforms, the social environment, and individual (neuro)susceptibility, collectively shaping how social media influences the well-being of adolescents. The primary goal of this model is to enhance research by concurrently considering a broader range of individual difference factors, providing a comprehensive framework for investigations into the complex interplay of social context in social media effects.",

          "abstract": "Effective doctor-patient communication has been linked to better patient outcomes and treatment adherence, whereas ineffective communication has been linked to poorer outcomes and more medical errors. Our study used Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) to investigate across four countries which communication strategies patients preferred from their doctors. Archival data from a larger online survey research study provided a sample of 1698 participants (Male = 36.4%, Female = 61.1%, Other 1.8%, Age M = 25.5 SD = 10.67), recruited from four countries (Australia, USA, Hong Kong/China, and the Philippines). Results showed participants preferred accommodative stances over non-accommodative stances (under or over accommodation), and that accommodative interpretability was the most frequently mentioned communication strategy in all four countries. Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences across countries for all strategies, with the strongest effects for discourse management. Implications for adding CAT into medical education communication training are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: This study introduces a novel VR-based approach to measure pupillary responses during media consumption. Researchers exposed participants to 30 video messages in a virtual TV viewing room, capturing pupil dilation and constriction via VR-integrated eye-tracking. By analyzing cross-receiver similarity (inter-subject correlations) of pupillometric responses, we could identify which specific video an individual was watching. This method worked best under normal viewing conditions and was sensitive to attentional manipulations. This study also found that messages with the most robust pupil response signatures were more likely to be remembered. Theoretical implications for quantifying media exposure and developing signatures of perceptual attention in individuals and audiences are discussed. Practically, this pupillary audience response measurement could be applied to various media formats, including screen-based media, social media, and VR/AR environments. In sum, the study highlights the potential of pupillometry in understanding audience engagement and response dynamics in naturalistic media consumption settings.",

          "authors": "Keith V. Osai, Travis E. Dorsch, Kay Bradford, Shawn Whiteman, Jordan A. Blazo, Haylee Downey",
          "abstract": "The influence of families on siblings’ experiences and outcomes has been well documented outside of sport, with research dedicated to topics such as socialization, relationship quality, adjustment, resource dilution, and behavioral genetics. While these associations are understood in reference to the immediate family context, sibling dynamics are less understood in the context of youth sport. This is important because sport represents the most common extracurricular activity in which siblings participate together. Guided by family systems theory, Dorsch and colleagues’ (2022) integrated model of the youth sport system, and a social constructivist epistemology, the present study was designed to understand the interactions that take place across multiple family relationships and how these relationships impact siblings’ experiences and outcomes in organized youth sport. Twelve intact families, each consisting of two parents and two siblings, who were engaged in organized youth sport in the United States, participated in individual, semi-structured interviews. More than nine hours of interviews were conducted across these 48 participants.Three researchers engaged in the coding process, which informed the creation of case narratives for each of the 12 families. Interpretation of the case narratives led to the development of nine general themes regarding sibling relationships in youth sport. Of note, a unique pathway of influence was also recognized, wherein parents expressed support for their children’s pursuit of their own niche/identity in youth sport. Future theoretically informed research should be designed to investigate specific individual, dyadic, and family processes that influence sibling experiences and outcomes in youth sport, offering further insight into the complex and dynamic interactions that occur within and across families.",

Some studies, however, have challenged this belief. Extending these studies, a secondary analysis was conducted using a four-wave longitudinal dataset that spans twenty-two years from adolescence to early midlife. Mixed effects modeling revealed that friendship involvement (i.e., being in close friendships) was associated with lower depressive symptoms. Findings regarding the association between romantic involvement (i.e., being in romantic relationships) and depressive symptoms were more nuanced. Associations were moderated by time: both involvements appeared to play more positive roles in adulthood than in adolescence, except for within-person increase in romantic involvement, which was consistently associated with increased depressive symptoms across the investigated life stages. This research confirms previous findings and extends former studies by distinguishing between- and within-person associations and extending the investigated life stages.",

We coded their stories for common narrative arcs and counter narratives that they used to describe their courtship. Our findings uncovered ten narrative arcs capturing different trajectories of relationship development. Embedded within these stories were counter narratives that participants used to challenge traditional courtship ideologies.

          "title": "21st Century Televisuality? Golden Ages and Collateral Damage in Industry Stress Research",
          "authors": "John T. Caldwell",
          "abstract": "This article examines how the innovations of, and fallout from, the post-1980s US multichannel cable era both prefigured and were transformed by the 21st-century online platform streaming era. Intense corporate competition, in which traditional networks and studios collided with disruptive new firms, triggered producers to innovate new ways of financing, making, and conceptualizing media content. Both disruptions spurred mergers, bankruptcies, hostile takeovers, and collapsing institutional distinctions. At the same time, these periods of acute market uncertainty also triggered widespread forms of innovation in production, technical imaging, narrative content, seriality, programming strategies, and aesthetics. So much so that the periods have been deemed “The 2nd Golden Age of Television,” and a “European Television Fiction Renaissance,” respectively. Yet traditional qualitative paradigms like these can also divert scholars who intend or need to unpack, document, and explain two more modest industry realities. First, acute televisual stylizing and golden age attributions gloss over television’s and streaming’s less-remarkable but essential and problematic industrial routine. Second, celebrating industrial exceptionalisms often ignore the creative media workers that disruptive innovations inevitably displace; or they caricature routine workers as a monotonous “rule” that proves the talented rise-above-the-pack “exception.” I have tried to look beyond the vanguard masterworks in the two historical disruptions. My research focuses on habitual practices in production, in order to unpack the collateral damage, the “industrial ashes” that “media peaks” and masterpieces often (necessarily) arise from. Fieldwork and human-subjects research in media industry studies make it difficult to overlook the human costs and displaced workers that have followed in the wake of aesthetic and technical innovations in both periods. Drawing on the ethnographic fieldwork for &lt;em&gt;Specworld (Caldwell, 2023), &lt;/em&gt;this article targets one problem scholars unavoidably face if they hope to account for the habitual, the losers, and the routine in worlds of production. Taking this approach makes justifying one methodological framework a precondition for scholarship: the &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt; of the evidence or data media scholars intend to “sample” in research on the immense complex production systems that characterize both periods. As an alternative to the bracketed-off masterworks, “quality television” (or “cinemas”), and auteurs favored by arts and humanities scholars, research on complex media ecosystems requires finding a system-wide logic or basis for the evidence gathered. I argue that production rifts and fractures offer scholars unintended (unplanned and uncensored) self-portraits of what complex industries “betray” as most important to the system as a whole. In proposing “rift-trace data-sampling” for evidence I argue that industrial failures (rather than masterworks) act as unintended, even subconscious disclosures of key industrial practices. Triggered disclosures of this sort may offer a more convincing way to understand the televisual complexities—and system-wide functions—of golden-age digital innovations.",

          "abstract": "This article aims to make a contribution to the study of liberal feminism, social media, and influencer culture, especially in the Italian context. The feminism of Chiara Ferragni, Italian fashion influencer with over 29 million followers, is an interesting case study that questions the relations, as well as the interaction, between activism, gender, and influencer culture. Ferragni’s body simulacrum, exhibited through numerous social media advertising images, was displayed at Sanremo, a renowned Italian song festival, watched by 12 million people in 2023. At Sanremo, that body carried on the feminist battle through the wearing of manifesto luxury designer dresses together with the reading of a letter addressed to herself, a vector of a rhetorically powerful message that was, however, directed to the single woman rather than to women as a collectivity. This neoliberal discourse is emblematic of the instrumental use of gender issues for self-promotion, which often leads to the dilution of feminist meanings and the trivialization of social movements.",

          "abstract": "This study analyses the narrative strategies employed in 11 independent narrative non-fiction podcasts from seven Ibero-American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico. The research concentrates on identifying the primary narrative trends applied within this genre of audio journalism, focusing on how the role of the narrator and the structure of the story boost credibility and listener engagement. The methodology combines semi-structured interviews with 16 podcast producers and content analysis of 73 episodes to explore how these podcasts shape their narrative approaches. The results reveal that these podcasts use various journalistic subgenres, including interviews, sound chronicles a recognised genre within narrative and radio journalism in Ibero-American, and other more artistic or experimental formats such as radio features, along with narrative structures like episodic, Aristotelian, and counterpoint, allowing for diverse forms of storytelling. In addition, the study underscores the incorporation of sound archives, personal life stories, and other audio techniques to enhance the narrative’s depth and emotional resonance. These elements contribute to producing socially relevant stories that often challenge stereotypes and address underrepresented voices in society. Ultimately, this research highlights the role of independent non-fiction podcasts in the evolution of audio journalism in Ibero-America.",

          "abstract": "There are several news podcast programs for listeners to choose from, but other genre podcasts (e.g., comedy, true crime, history) also include news in their content. This study measures listener trust in news content aired in different genres. The findings indicate most listeners trust content heard on news podcasts, which may relate to an increase in available news programs, as well as an overall increase in podcast listenership. The research also shows some listeners trust news heard on non-news podcasts. This may relate to interest in alternate sources for news and the storytelling formats used in the programs. When examining the trust of news content based on genre, news heard on comedy, news, and history podcasts are more likely to be trusted by listeners. The majority of gratifications associated with listening to podcasts based on the various genres are similar, with minimal differences seen among certain genres. Discussion of AI and its influence on trust in news heard on podcasts is also addressed.",

Our findings show that while all media types prioritize professionalism, their strategies for cultivating intimacy differ significantly. Compared to commercial and provincial media, central media achieved the best balance between intimacy and professionalism. Individual media demonstrated the highest intimacy scores, whereas central media excelled in professionalism. This study enhances our understanding of how institutional backgrounds shape strategies in audio journalism. It offers insights into balancing intimacy with professional standards in the podcast medium.",

          "abstract": "Rankings are a well-established genre for evaluating diverse phenomena, yet culturally resonant critiques of them are relatively rare. This paper examines how student vloggers on YouTube challenge and reinterpret university rankings through ‘tier list’ and ‘reaction’ videos, thereby shifting genre expectations. Through a move analysis of 30 such videos, we identify 3 rhetorical actions – making sense of ranking, audience interpellation and subverting the ranking genre – and discuss how the ranking’s remediation simultaneously rejects and reinforces hierarchy as the social form underlying it. This results in often humorous critiques where vloggers challenge ‘objective’ cardinal assumptions and posit rank as collaboratively constructed. Remediation in social media has the potential to not only make visible genre work performed by the genre’s discursive community, but in doing so also reconfigures the rhetorical premises that characterise the ranking genre in the first place.",

          "abstract": "Platforms have disintermediated the markets for books, film, television, and music, but the online art market has reproduced offline structures, leaving intermediaries intact. This study explores the limits of platforms by describing why disintermediation failed in the art market. Along with museums and other intermediaries, the most important function of galleries is to co-create artistic value. They not only sell art but also form a central part of the status system of art. We examine #artistsupportpledge (ASP) on Instagram. ASP uncovered a market for art that had no place in the existing system. ASP facilitated direct sales to consumers while allowing artists to maintain links to galleries for reputation, career development, exhibitions, and sales of large, expensive work. The art market experienced unique partial disintermediation under narrow conditions with continued allegiance to existing intermediaries and status structures. We conclude by discussing four implications for the theory of platforms.",

This study uses a quasi-experimental two-wave design to examine the relationship between BeReal use duration and well-being indicators. Results suggest that long-term BeReal use is linked to higher friendship satisfaction, positively influencing life satisfaction. In addition, long-term use is associated with reduced fear of missing out and connection overload compared to short-term use, suggesting BeReal may enhance well-being possibly by facilitating daily interactions with close ties, limiting usage time, and providing a more authentic representation of everyday life compared to other social media platforms.",

          "abstract": "This article examines emergent communities of platform-based delivery workers in Bangkok by applying Max Weber’s concept of Vergemeinschaftung or ‘doing community’. Using offline and online ethnographic methods, the authors demonstrate how delivery workers do community on the streets of Bangkok and leverage smartphones and social media to extend their communities to the online realm. These community practices are culturally constituted and share characteristics with pre-existing communities in the transportation sector in Thailand. However, while these older communities are under pressure from rationalisation, or in Weber’s terms, Vergesellschaftung, rider communities emerge from the rational conditions of delivery platforms. Through this analysis, the article demonstrates how Weber’s theory effectively captures the dialectical dynamics of doing community and rationalisation in digital economies, suggesting that scholarship on digital platforms and media could benefit from adopting a Weberian analysis of social change.",

We present eight considerations for communication scientists to study polarization.

Methodological considerations involve (e) focusing on everyday conversations, (f) linking micro- to macro-level analyses, and (g) noting pitch, facial expressions, and arousal.

I analyze these reveal videos, their comment threads, and the role of YouTube in hosting these videos, to capture the popular discourse around the relationship between DNA and racial identity. By employing critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA), I explore how Caribbean content creators discuss racial identity, and how online discourses negotiate, codify, or disrupt neoliberal notions of racial authenticity. I focus on videos made by creators who self-identify as being from the Caribbean or of the Caribbean diaspora. By bringing the Caribbean existentialist thought of Stuart Hall and Édouard Glissant into my analysis, I explore how Caribbean creators employ what C. Rhonda Cobham-Sander deems “the Creole imagination” to interrogate notions of racial authenticity while de-/re-constructing racial identity in digital spaces.",

By sharing stories about racial and linguistic discrimination in virtual spaces, participants highlight how many social inequities are being reproduced online. However, they also express optimism that social media has potential to offer new ways to connect with their communities and express multifaceted identities.

I then use the case of the Sina model, also known as the Variable Interests Entities (VIE) model, to challenge the meaning of the “Chinese” prefix. This example illustrates that, Chinese or not, capitalist platform companies engineer a composite geography to guarantee maximum flexibility and mobility for the accumulation of private wealth and, in the process, generate great power differentials. In short, this commentary is a call to study digital platforms over the course of capitalism permutations as well as its interpolation and interdependence with existing systems of power.",

          "abstract": "Emotionality is a well-established strategy for boosting audience engagement on social media. While fact-checking is positioned to provide objective information, fact-checking posts on social media often involve heightened emotionality. How much emotionality is present and how emotionality influences audience engagement and public sentiment toward fact-checked targets remain largely understudied. Informed by social psychological frameworks explicating message-level factors influencing public engagement and sentiment, the present study examines emotionality in 49,270 fact-checking posts created by 10 United States fact-checking organizations on Facebook from 2017 to 2022. Results showed that emotionality in fact-checking posts significantly increased by 13.5% over the years. Editorial fact-checkers (e.g., Washington Post) used higher levels of emotionality than independent fact-checkers (e.g., snopes.com). Emotionality positively indicated public engagement as predicted. However, in both fact-checked true and false information, emotionality was negatively associated with the public’s sentiment toward fact-checked targets, suggesting a potential spillover effect on stories verified to be true. This study reveals that emotionality in fact-checking posts boosts social media engagement yet with the potential of compromising fact-checking effectiveness.",

          "authors": "Saif Shahin, Mingyi Hou",
          "abstract": "The #StopAsianHate hashtag movement emerged as a challenge to the rising tide of racism in the United States during the coronavirus pandemic and contributed to the legislation of the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act. Our research brings together concepts from social movement studies as well as network science and celebrity-fandom studies to examine a corpus of tweets about the movement. We employ a mixed-methods design combining structural topic modeling with digital discourse analysis. Even though the movement rose up against White Supremacist structural racism, we find that right-wing provocateurs with large followings often hijacked its hashtags to amplify sporadic Black-on-Asian violence. But the active participation of Asian celebrities such as BTS, with their own huge followings online, bolstered the movement. Their posts and statements about anti-Asian violence were heavily reposted and dominated the digital discourse. Crucially, we show how their fans helped boost the movement’s anti-racist agenda by repeatedly posting similar messages in concert, which we compare with the offline fan practice of “chanting” as a form of collective identity performance. While theories like the logic of connective action view digital activism as individualized and decentralized, our research elucidates its hierarchical structure and the oversized role of provocateurs and celebrities in raising the visibility of competing claims and agendas by re-contextualizing hashtags. At the same time, culture industries and practices can create bottom-up solidarities that can have a political impact by raising particular agendas in the digital attention economy.",

          "authors": "Job Allan Wefwafwa, Bob Wekesa, Iginio Gagliardone",
          "abstract": "Social media has enhanced culturally grounded debates and ethnicity-based exclusionism during Kenya’s WhatsApp group deliberations. These practices are often more pronounced during elections when WhatsApp becomes a social media platform of choice for various groups. Exclusionism takes at least two vectors. On the one hand, tensions and confrontations emerge as electoral deliberations proceed. On the other hand, consensus on WhatsApp spaces also emerges during the electoral deliberations as in-groups forge common ground. To analyze the splits in elections-based deliberations on WhatsApp, the article starts with an interrogation of how history and culture inform the Kenyan people’s use of WhatsApp space for electoral deliberations. Among others, the people use the platform to resolve perceived and real political injustices perpetrated in the society by previous governments, resulting in tensions and confrontations. The article argues that the origin of the tensions is the fact that most African people have dual “citizenship,” whereby they simultaneously belong to their ethnic communities while being part of the broader Kenyan nation. It theoretically engages Ekeh and Langmia to argue that the people concurrently fall into the primordial publics and civic publics, leading to dialectical tensions, confrontation, and consensus between the two categorizations. These tensions, confrontations, and consensuses spill over into the WhatsApp groups, with electoral deliberations registering the peak in these splits. The case of the Bungoma County and its linkage to the broader Kenyan nation serve as the site for empirical data. The method for data collection is qualitative. The article uses participant observation and face-to-face interviews to investigate how the people’s historical and cultural values inform their use of WhatsApp space during electoral deliberations. The findings reveal how the people’s historical and cultural values shape their use of WhatsApp space. The implication of the research is to explore the African people’s cultural adaptation of technology and to invite more Afrocentric theorization on technology adaptation in African societies.",

          "title": "Beyond Neutrality: A Longitudinal Analysis of Gender, Party, and Media Visibility in the Tone of US Political Coverage",
          "authors": "Aliya Andrich",
          "abstract": "Research shows that female politicians often receive more negative news coverage than their male counterparts, which can undermine voter support and contribute to their underrepresentation in politics. Despite the increase in politically active women and heightened attention to gender issues in political discourse in the United States, the past decade has also witnessed a rise in divisive rhetoric and political polarization. These changes not only transformed the political environment but also may have impacted media coverage of political figures. Despite the evolving sociopolitical landscape, existing research on news sentiment lacks a longitudinal perspective. This study uses transformer-based classifiers for sentiment detection and state space models for time series analysis to provide new longitudinal evidence on the evolution of positive and negative coverage of 1,095 US politicians in almost 900,000 news articles during the 2010s. The results indicate that while some female politicians experienced more negative coverage than men, the pattern varied depending on the politicians’ party affiliation and media visibility. In both election and routine periods, the media portrayed female Democrats, who received moderate levels of media coverage, less negatively than male Republicans, but more critically than female Republicans and male Democrats. Notably, Democratic and Republican women received slightly more positive coverage in most election years of the 2010s. Highly visible politicians, especially women, received more negative attention overall. The study and its findings advance our understanding of how news sentiment varies across different groups of politicians and how it fluctuates between election and nonelection periods.",

          "title": "News media and citizens’ trust toward authorities in times of crisis",
          "authors": "Maud Reveilhac, Hajo Boomgaarden",
          "abstract": "Trust in public authorities can be crucial for a country to navigate through times of crisis. Such crises put news media into the spotlight as crucial information brokers between authorities and the public. It is argued that media coverage should affect trust in public institutions and that such effects are likely to be conditioned by individuals’ crisis risk perceptions. This article investigates the dynamics of public trust in the government during the COVID-19 pandemic over more than a two-year period. To do so, it draws on panel survey data from thirty-two waves combined with data on news media coverage of salient topics of crisis coverage. The analytical strategy relies on multilevel modeling and assesses the effect of media coverage on citizens’ trust, as well as the effect of risk perceptions and the interaction between them. Among others, the results revealed that risk perceptions related to the economy and exposure to media coverage of economic “costs” negatively impacted trust. Furthermore, it found evidence that when associated with media exposure to “costs,” societal risk perceptions (both health and economy related) had a significant impact on trust in government. The impact varied depending on the level of media exposure, with high exposure leading to higher trust in government. The study concludes by highlighting the practical and theoretical implications of these findings.",
