          "authors": "Katharine Dommett",
          "abstract": "Modern election campaigning is often described as “data-driven,” but there are signs that data may not always inform decision-making. This article focuses on the decision-making component of campaigns and provides a new theorisation of this previously neglected component of data-driven campaigns. Arguing that decision-making is affected by a range of contextual, agential and organizational factors, I call for qualitative analysis of campaign practice that is needed to understand how decisions are made. Applying this theoretical account, I consider the likely future of election campaigning, reflecting particularly on the potential for automation. Specifically, I identify where automation is likely to emerge and conclude that rote-like decision-making is unlikely to entirely define the practices of future campaigns. Collectively this article offers new theoretical insight into an overlooked aspect of modern campaigning - decision-making - and provides offers a foundation for more accurate predictions about the future of campaigns.",

          "authors": "Eliot Bates",
          "abstract": "Earth Modular Society (EMS) is a cross-platform community dedicated to live hardware modular synthesis, with their primary efforts going into a 24/7 modular “radio station” that livestreams on Twitch and YouTube, and a supporting Discord chat server. Although part of the broader modular synthesis gear culture (a large-scale social formation that coalesces around specific classes of fetishized technical objects), EMS represents a new development in gear cultures as it foregrounds live performance and minimizes the accrual of status via conspicuous consumption. The normative governance structures of platform-specific gear culture communities preclude all but one or a handful of users from having any meaningful input into the rules, governance, or participatory modes of the platform. In contrast, EMS is structured as a doitocracy , where all are encouraged to bring things to do to the community, and to support each other in doing. The doitocracy concept contributes to understanding the wide range of DIY (do-it-yourself) and DIT (do-it-together) community practices. This doitocracy case study also demonstrates the importance of analyzing the performance of crafted objects, and how these, alongside platform-jumping practices, can constitute primary organizational forces in online/offline community sociality.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the phenomenon and practices of making vocal home automation through an ethnographic study of the emergent relations between domestic digital voice assistants (DVAs), older users and their homes. Inspired by the concept of infrastructure in science and technology studies, and an understanding of voice from sound studies, we analyse the interrelated and emergent processes of bringing voices, users and homes into being as new DVAs are being implemented into private homes. Through this lens, we develop the empirical-analytical concept of vocal infrastructuring, which works to demystify the voice as a natural and neutral user interface. We argue that technology studies need theoretical approaches that enable joint understandings of the vocal specificities and infrastructural nature of DVA’s and propose vocal infrastructuring as a concept for tuning in on these dimensions of technology to understand the silent yet profound sonic-material, imaginary and ontological transformations that follow DVA implementation in homes and everyday domestic life.",

          "abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs), allows ordinary users to turn themselves or their loved ones into AI chatbots. Based on the analysis of media reporting on users’ experiences, the study identifies three major features that frequently appear in users’ interactions with ghostbots simulating their deceased loved ones: (1) the interactions often elicit intense emotional responses from the users; (2) the purposes of using ghostbots can be practical, including mitigating grief, seeking advices, looking for emotional support, or say a final goodbye; and (3) the interactions may generate new knowledge, ideas, and memories about the dead. The study also introduces the concept of artificial continuing communication , recognizing the interpretative asymmetry inherent in interactions with AI interlocutors, while emphasizing the continuing bonds between the living and the dead. I argue that although ghosts are reduced versions of the dead, this emerging form of communication challenges the normative hydraulic model of the psyche, which views grief as a negative emotion to be discharged and emphasizes emotional detachment from the deceased. I contend that a type of thin reciprocal love exists between the users and their ghostbots and suggest that the ghostbot use offers an alternative perspective on how we relate to love, loss, and emotional continuity, albeit its user base remains small.",

          "abstract": "This article conducts a bibliometric analysis of 816 Games and Culture publications (2006–2025) indexed in Scopus to explore how specialized journals shape the institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields. Through citation networks, keyword co-occurrence, authorship, and geographic analyses, it treats the journal as a model of scholarly infrastructure in game studies. Results reveal steady publication growth (from 20 to over 100 articles annually), increasing collaboration (2.39 authors per paper), substantial citation accumulation (2006–2008 works exceeding 3,000 citations), and diversification beyond anglophone regions. Temporal keyword trends trace thematic shifts from virtual worlds and MMOs to esports, ethics, gamification, and representation. These findings inform broader debates on how niche journals foster disciplinary legitimacy, showing that Games and Culture has been central to consolidating game studies and offers a transferable framework for examining institutionalization in other interdisciplinary domains.",

Design/methodology/approach By comparing salient explanations and norm-based explanations across different age groups, we analyzed how these explanatory strategies reduce learning costs and enhance cognitive trust in the algorithm. Findings The study finds that both salient and norm-based explanations can reduce learning costs and enhance users’ cognitive trust in algorithms; however, norm-based explanations are particularly effective for younger users. Additionally, the study finds no significant interaction between the two types of explanations. Importantly, effective explanations can enhance both cognitive trust in the algorithm and affective trust in the government. Originality/value This research suggests that “nudges” in explanations can enhance citizens’ trust in algorithmic public services, which is significant for increasing acceptance of these algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly embedded in service operations, particularly in crafting managerial responses (MRs) to online negative and positive reviews. Yet, little is known about how firms should optimally allocate responsibilities between human staff and GAI across distinct response tasks, nor how such allocations shape consumer perceptions and downstream behavioral intentions. This study investigates how customers evaluate MRs produced by different agents including humans, GAI and multiple forms of human and GAI collaboration across specific response tasks. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a randomized online experiment. Main effects were examined using ANOVA with data from 879 participants, and the underlying mechanisms were further analyzed using the PROCESS macro with a parallel mediation model. Findings Our findings show that to improve customer satisfaction and increase booking intentions, negative reviews are most effectively addressed through an augmented human approach in which GAI creates an initial draft and experienced professional staff refine it. In contrast, positive reviews are best handled solely by experienced professional staff. Originality/value This study advances knowledge on how to combine GAI with human efforts in service operations, identifies key psychological mechanisms that mediate the effects of different collaboration modes on consumer perceptions and behavioral intentions and offers actionable guidance for service operations managers. The results suggest that GAI should be deployed strategically to augment, rather than replace, human intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Cognitive absorption is critical for hedonic technology addiction, yet the mediating mechanisms by which cognitive absorption affects hedonic technology addiction remain unclear. Drawing on dual-system theory, which posits that reflexive and reflective systems are pivotal in shaping user decisions and behaviors, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of the drivers of hedonic technology addiction. We conceptualize impulsive urge as the reflexive system and self-regulation as the reflective system, aiming to uncover the mediating roles of these two distinct systems in linking cognitive absorption to hedonic technology addiction. Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal survey involving 410 online gamers was conducted, with data collected at two time points separated by a 6-week interval. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to validate the proposed research model. Findings The results indicate that cognitive absorption elicits responses from both reflexive and reflective systems. Specifically, cognitive absorption enhances the reflexive system via impulsive urge, while inhibiting the reflective system through impaired self-regulation. The joint full mediation of impulsive urge and self-regulation in the relationship between cognitive absorption and hedonic technology addiction has been proved. Our results shed lights on the underlying reflexive and reflective systems by which cognitive absorption affects hedonic technology addiction. Originality/value This study leverages dual-system theory to elucidate the mediating mechanisms through which cognitive absorption influences hedonic technology addiction. By demonstrating how cognitive absorption triggers addictive behaviors through heightened impulsive urges and impaired self-regulation, this study advances the literature on hedonic technology addiction and offers actionable strategies for intervention.

          "authors": "Gwen G.Z. Wei, Zach W.Y. Lee, Tommy K.H. Chan, White Liu, Winston T. Su",
          "abstract": "Purpose Live streaming has transformed audience–performer relations by integrating real-time mass broadcasting with varying levels of interactivity. Due to this shift, concepts regarding parasocial and trans-parasocial phenomena have gained prominence in live streaming research, particularly in the information systems (IS) literature. However, existing knowledge in this field remains fragmented, and theoretical debates regarding the applicability of parasocial concepts remain unresolved. Therefore, a systematic literature review is conducted to synthesize existing research, identify key gaps, and suggest future avenues of inquiry. Design/methodology/approach A two-stage literature search is carried out to systematically identify relevant studies for review. The authors analyze and synthesize the identified studies using the established theories, contexts, characteristics, and methodologies (TCCM) framework. The ongoing debate on the applicability of the concepts in question to live streaming is also discussed, and the existing perspectives on this issue are summarized into four key themes. Findings This systematic literature review consolidates the relevant knowledge and identifies gaps. Future research directions are also outlined, emphasizing the need for clearer conceptual boundaries, broader research contexts, explorations of potential variables, and methodological advancements to strengthen the theoretical and empirical foundations of the topic. Originality/value This study synthesizes existing research through a systematic literature review. This allows the clarification of theoretical debates, the identification of key knowledge gaps, and the outlining of a research agenda on parasocial and trans-parasocial phenomena in live streaming. By consolidating fragmented discussions into themes, it addresses theoretical ambiguities regarding the application of parasocial and trans-parasocial phenomena in live streaming.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Virtual influencers (VIs) are increasingly used for brand endorsements. While consumer interaction with VIs is growing, little is known about the motivations behind these interactions and how they influence consumer behavior. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through an online survey of 298 users who interact with VIs. The model was tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings Consumers interact with VIs to satisfy their intellectual, novelty, entertainment and social needs. These needs positively influence self-expansion, which in turn enhances brand identification and purchase intention. Research limitations/implications This study is limited by its cross-sectional design, reliance on self-reported data, and focus on predominantly individualistic respondents in the UK. Future studies should examine cross-cultural samples, employ longitudinal or experimental designs to establish causality, and explore additional psychological mechanisms that might shape consumer-VI interactions. Practical implications The findings of this study can help marketers and VI developers understand how to use VIs to enhance consumer interaction and stimulate purchase intention. Social implications: VIs are shaping new forms of consumer-brand interaction and raising important questions about identity, technology and trust in AI-driven media. Social implications VIs are shaping new forms of consumer-brand interaction and raising important questions about identity, technology and trust in AI-driven media. Originality/value This study is the first to integrate uses and gratifications (U&amp;G) theory with self-expansion theory to explain the psychological and behavioral effects of VI interaction, offering a novel framework for understanding digital consumer engagement.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Understanding the causes and the consequences of online romance scam victimization fear, a psychological stress, is crucial for online daters to achieve a positive experience and for online dating platforms to provide that experience. This research contextualized and tested a theory concerning the negative psychological factors of online romance scams and their consequences on online dating positive psychology. Design/methodology/approach This study employed a developmental mixed-method design. The first phase was a qualitative study following a positivist paradigm. The second phase was a survey-based quantitative study. After the quantitative results, this research combined the understanding from both phases to develop the meta-inferences and finalized the antecedents and consequences of online romance scam victimization fear in online dating. Findings An increase in online romance scam-related anxiety and social vulnerability is positively associated with cognitive vulnerability. An increase in online romance scam-related anxiety, cognitive vulnerability and social vulnerability is positively associated with online romance scam victimization fear. An increase in online romance scam-related anxiety, cognitive vulnerability, social vulnerability and victimization fear is negatively associated with online dating psychological capital. Practical implications Utilizing this study’s findings, dating platforms can develop strategies to reduce users’ fear of online romance scam victimization and provide them with higher psychological capital to continue online dating. Originality/value The study contributes to cybercrime and online dating literature by capturing the psychological antecedents of scam victimization fear and showing how fear stimuli can lead to responses, which in turn cause a detrimental effect on online dating psychological capital.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Existing research has provided limited insights into the dynamic mechanisms through which multiple signals are interpreted within online health communities (OHCs). This study attempts to initiate a more integrative understanding of the dynamic interaction effects between patient-generated signals (i.e. herding and word-of-mouth signals) and physician-generated signals (i.e. central effort and peripheral effort signals) on online physician consultations. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a dynamic panel modelling approach, applying longitudinal data collected from 844 physicians from June to December 2020. Specifically, the two-step system, generalised method of moments (GMM) with instrumental variables and propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to estimate the proposed research model. Findings This research provides empirical evidence that the herding signal and the word-of-mouth (WOM) signal have a positive effect on physician consultations within OHCs. Our findings also demonstrate that the peripheral effort signal complements the effect of the WOM signal on physician consultations, whereas it substitutes for the influence of the herding signal on physician consultations. In addition, this study finds that the central effort signal substitutes the effect of the WOM signal on physician consultation as it intensifies. Originality/value This study contextualises and frames a multidimensional signal framework of the herding signal, the WOM signal, the central effort signal and the peripheral effort signal in OHCs, which augments the predominant applications of signalling theory in e-commerce contexts. Furthermore, this research broadens the theoretical comprehension of signalling theory by revealing the substitutive and complementary effects among these signals, particularly in a mixed signalling environment.",

          "authors": "Yuqi Zheng, Yuhao Li",
          "abstract": "Purpose Social media platforms leverage user data to precisely deliver persuasive in-feed advertising aimed at promoting products. However, this approach may provoke heightened adverse reactions among users with elevated privacy sensitivity. This study examines the mechanisms by which privacy-sensitive users avoid persuasive narratives embedded in in-feed native advertising, with a particular focus on the processes of psychological reactance and visual avoidance. Design/methodology/approach This study employed two laboratory experiments and an eye-tracking experiment to examine how privacy-sensitive users process persuasive in-feed native advertising. The eye-tracking component was used to observe users’ visual attention biases, and gaze data were analyzed using a binning approach to segment early- and later-stage attentional processing. Findings Findings indicated that privacy-sensitive users exhibited avoidance toward persuasive advertising, mediated by psychological reactance. Users demonstrated a simultaneous presence of attentional avoidance and whole-period attention toward persuasive narratives. Specifically, results showed that privacy-sensitive users exhibited early-stage visual avoidance toward persuasive ads, while late-stage attention proved difficult to disengage, providing evidence for attentional biases and impacting ad avoidance attitudes. Originality/value This study advances advertising research by integrating psychological reactance theory and attentional bias into the context of in-feed native advertising. Using lab experiments and eye-tracking, it reveals how privacy-sensitive users engage in cognitive and visual advertising avoidance. A key contribution lies in applying time-course analysis to uncover dynamic gaze patterns, bridging attention and avoidance. Findings offer novel theoretical insights and practical strategies for advertisers, platforms and designers.",

          "authors": "Gonçalo Sá, Carlos Tam, Manuela Aparicio",
          "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to understand the determinants of e-commerce shoppers’ well-being. Well-being refers to how positively online consumers experience and are affected by their interactions with digital shopping platforms. Studying how customers perceive their well-being when interacting with artificial intelligence (AI)-powered e-commerce websites is crucial, as it highlights a paradigm shift from traditional online shopping, focused mainly on convenience and speed, toward AI-driven experiences. In this new paradigm, AI actively shapes personalized recommendations, higher usefulness perception and higher responsiveness, confirming user expectations. Design/methodology/approach This study adapts the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), analyzing the role of perceived responsiveness, perceived personalization and perceived information quality in e-commerce shoppers’ well-being. Data were collected from 591 respondents across Portugal and Brazil and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with multi-group comparison. Findings The findings suggest that perceived responsiveness and personalization significantly influence confirmation. Additionally, perceived usefulness relies primarily on confirmation mediating its relationship with well-being, while perceived information quality moderates the direct impact of confirmation on well-being. Notably, personalization’s impact in Portugal exceeds that of responsiveness, while it is the opposite in Brazil. Originality/value The value of this study lies first in its unique context. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to assess customers’ well-being in AI-powered e-commerce platforms. Second, the multi-group analysis provides new and unique insights into the differences between Portugal and Brazil. Third, the study challenges ECM’s elasticity with original model adjustments. Finally, it explores the significance of perceived responsiveness, personalization and quality on e-commerce customer well-being.",

          "abstract": "This contribution examines the role of linguistic abstraction and valence of terms in the portrayal of immigrants and Italians in national and local newspapers with different political leanings. Specifically, it investigates how linguistic abstraction and valence of terms vary between the two most popular Italian national outlets and between these and a highly read local newspaper. The sample consisted of 218 newspaper articles on immigration. Results showed that across newspapers, immigrants are generally described using negative terms at a higher level of abstraction than Italians, as well as with negative terms at a higher level of abstraction than positive terms. Furthermore, national newspaper articles used terms at a higher level of abstraction than those in the local newspaper when describing immigrants and Italians. This contribution offers novel insights into how linguistic intergroup discrimination is conveyed in newspapers of a country where immigration is increasingly becoming a debated topic.",

          "authors": "Branda Yee-Man Yu, Christian S. Chan",
          "abstract": "Political disagreements within families can undermine both individual and relational well-being. This study analyzed varying configurations of parent-child political discordance—including partisan-partisan and partisan-neutral dyads—in Hong Kong ( N = 586) following the 2019 social unrest and examined its familial and psychological consequences over two weeks ( n = 200). Findings indicate that neutral-partisan dyads, similar to their partisan-counterparts, exhibited significantly larger differences in support for government, police, and anti-government protestors compared to politically concordant dyads. Dyads in which one member supported the anti-government (“ yellow ”) camp and the other supported the pro-government (“ blue ”) camp or identified as neutral reported lower levels of positive communication and poorer family functioning than dyads sharing the same stance. Mediation analyses revealed that reduced positive communication explained the impact of political discordance on increased psychological distress across discordant dyads. However, this mediation effect on family functioning was observed only in yellow - neutral and yellow - blue dyads. By incorporating partisan-neutral disagreements into the analysis, this study offers an ecologically valid account of parent-child political discordance among partisan and neutral family members, highlighting the potential threat to both personal and family well-being when intrafamilial communication is compromised.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive jealousy, which involves thoughts and suspicions of a partner's infidelity, is linked to various negative outcomes. Yet, little is known about how it fluctuates over time or across different relationships. This longitudinal study examined 891 young, unmarried adults in romantic relationships over 5 years (11 assessment points), capturing 1507 total relationships. About 42% of participants reported being in more than one relationship during the study period. The study examined how cognitive jealousy varies within individuals, across different relationships, in relation to individual traits such as neuroticism, attachment anxiety, and gender, and in relation to experiences of extradyadic sexual involvement (either self‐ or partner‐reported). Results showed that while 28.2% of the variance in cognitive jealousy was due to differences between individuals, the largest proportion (39.8%) was due to differences between relationships. Within a particular relationship, initial levels of cognitive jealousy remained relatively stable over time. Higher levels of neuroticism, attachment anxiety, and experiences of extradyadic sexual involvement (both self‐ and partner‐reported) were associated with greater cognitive jealousy. Men reported higher initial levels of cognitive jealousy than women. These findings suggest that relationship‐specific dynamics as well as individual differences play a crucial role in the experience of cognitive jealousy.",
