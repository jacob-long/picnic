          "authors": "Jie Huang, Graham Hitchen, Safak Dogan",
          "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has drawn widespread attention, with its capabilities and transformative potential drawing significant public and academic interest. Despite the growing industry and scholarly focus, the existing literature remains fragmented, lacking a cohesive framework to understand its complexity and underlying dynamics. This study addresses this gap by presenting a conceptual framework derived from a review of 98 peer-reviewed articles and conference papers published since 2020. It provides an overview of generative AI’s role across film, television, gaming, animation, extended reality (XR), and live performance sectors, offering an initial snapshot of the state of research and laying a foundation for future studies in this evolving field. Drawing on this analysis, the comprehensive review maps the key themes of the generative AI literature and explores their conceptual relationships. It identifies areas of progress and highlights gaps in the existing knowledge, proposing directions for further research to deepen the understanding of the field. By providing an in-depth examination, this study contributes to a more nuanced and informed perspective on generative AI’s integration and impact within the screen and live performance industries.",

          "title": "Cinema without frames: How Darkening bridges virtual and real to redefine presence and narrative embodiment",
          "authors": "Özgür Çalışkan",
          "abstract": "This study examines how virtual reality (VR) cinema transforms spectatorship, embodiment, and narrative engagement through a phenomenological analysis of Darkening (Ondřej Moravec, 2022), a VR film exhibited at the Czech National Film Museum (NaFilm). VR cinema places the audience inside the film’s world, fostering narrative embodiment through interactive and spatial storytelling. In Darkening , viewers engage in actions such as reaching for objects, responding to auditory prompts, and navigating a virtual environment, creating a fluid relationship between observation and participation. The museum setting enhances this experience by introducing a paradox of asynchronous co-presence, where the solitary nature of VR engagement contrasts with the implied presence of other viewers. This study introduces a three-stage framework consisting of experiential chronology, embodied interactivity, and cognitive reflexivity to analyze how VR cinema reshapes meaning-making and viewer agency. This research combines film phenomenology and narrative theory to demonstrate how VR cinema expands the boundaries of storytelling, interactivity, and presence, offering a profoundly affective and participatory cinematic experience in museum contexts.",

          "authors": "Andy Nguyen, Shohil Kishore, Yvonne Hong, Saima Qutab, Belle Dang",
          "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to explore the initial formation of organizing visions within digital platforms regarding the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in education. It examines how these emerging visions align with official guidelines. Understanding the early development of these organizing visions and the consensus formation around official guidelines for GAI in education has significant research and practical implications. Design/methodology/approach The present study uses a multimethodological approach with qualitative content-coding and inductive thematic analysis of digital trace data from the social media platform X and deductive thematic analysis of guideline documents. It first examines organizing visions within digital platforms through 1,260 tweets, focusing on opportunities and challenges posed by GAI, particularly ChatGPT, in educational settings. The study then analyses practical guidelines from international organizations, governments, and universities. Findings The empirical findings demonstrate that, although all three Organizing Vision (OV) functions are present in the early development of OVs for GAI in education, early-stage online discourse predominantly emphasizes the legitimation function. The findings also indicate a noticeable alignment between the topics discussed in the early development of OVs for GAI in education and the official guidelines and policies issued by international organizations, governments, and universities worldwide, indicating the need for educational reform, and ethical considerations. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature on the emergence of OVs in digital platforms by examining the context of GAI in education. This study also provides insights into the collective stance and recommendations from various authoritative sources, offering a comprehensive perspective on early-stage GAI policy development in an educational context.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore the mechanism of how gig work challenges affect work withdrawal behaviors, specifically examining the chain mediation effects of gig work challenges on perceived time poverty, job satisfaction and work withdrawal behaviors as well as the moderating role of decent work. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach was employed. There was a scenario experiment involving 120 gig workers and multiple surveys with 506 employees from different organizations. Findings Gig work challenges positively impact work withdrawal behaviors. Perceived time poverty mediates between gig work challenges and job satisfaction and job satisfaction mediates between perceived time poverty and work withdrawal behaviors. Besides, there is an inverse relationship between perceived time poverty and job satisfaction, and they play a mediating role in the linkage between gig work challenges and work withdrawal behaviors. Also, decent work has a moderating role. Originality/value This study delineates the sequential mediating effects of perceived time poverty and job satisfaction on the relationship between gig work challenges and withdrawal behaviors, advancing scholarly understanding in gig economy management. The study adapts the job demands-resources model to the gig context, elucidating psychological and organizational aspects and showcasing the model’s applicability.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) companions on users' social well-being by integrating the Triangular Theory of Love and Attachment Theory. Specifically, this study explores how the three components of love (including intimacy, passion and commitment) shape users' attachment (interactive engagement, emotional attachment, emotional trust) toward AI companions and how attachment, in turn, impacts social well-being. The study also investigates the moderating role of sweet deception in these relationships. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted with 527 users of AI companion apps, recruited through a panel service provided by a marketing agency. The proposed path relationships in the conceptual framework were analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0. Findings The results show that the three components of love significantly impact users' attachment and both interactive and emotional attachment subsequently influence social well-being. Additionally, sweet deception was found to strengthen the relationships between interactive engagement and social well-being, as well as that between emotional attachment and social well-being. Originality/value This study makes a unique contribution to the literature by empirically examining how human–AI companion relationships impact users’ social well-being. Specifically, it introduces the novel concept of sweet deception – the strategic use of affectionate yet deceptive communications to foster emotional bonds – and empirically test its role in strengthening the relationship between users’ emotional attachment and social well-being. By integrating Triangular Theory of Love and Attachment Theory, this study offers a new theoretical framework for understanding the emotional dynamics of human–AI interactions. Moreover, this study provides innovative practical insights for businesses on designing emotionally engaging AI companions that promote user well-being.",

          "abstract": "Purpose In the gig economy, online ride-hailing drivers experience occupational stigma perception (OSP), which may surpass that experienced by traditional service providers and significantly affect their service performance. However, how these drivers counteract OSP in the new online labor relationship has not been well studied. To address this issue, this paper presents an analysis of the moderating roles of online ride-hailing drivers' internal locus of control over work (iLOC) and customers' positive feedback on the basis of the conservation of resources theory. Design/methodology/approach To test our hypotheses, this paper conducted a field questionnaire survey in a Chinese city, collecting data from online ride-hailing drivers across various platforms. Findings The results reveal that online ride-hailing drivers' OSP negatively impacts their service performance and that both drivers' iLOC and customers' positive feedback mitigate this adverse effect. Moreover, the moderating effect of customers' positive feedback is mediated by drivers' iLOC, confirming the presence of a mediated moderation effect. Practical implications By focusing on the roles of the public, online ride-hailing platforms, and online ride-hailing drivers themselves, this study provides actionable and comprehensive insights into how to mitigate online ride-hailing drivers' OSP in the gig economy. Originality/value Previous studies have identified online ride-hailing drivers' iLOC as a stable moderator in the relationship between OSP and service performance. However, this paper empirically demonstrates that customers' positive feedback can induce changes in the iLOC, which subsequently moderates the relationship between OSP and service performance.",

          "authors": "Lanhui Cai, Kum Fai Yuen, Diancen Xie, Mingjie Fang, Xueqin Wang",
          "abstract": "Purpose Omnichannel retailing offers consumers more channels and opportunities to engage in logistics. This study revisits the concept of consumer logistics with two objectives: establishing a comprehensive framework of consumer logistics in the context of omnichannel retailing and exploring potential consumer clusters by focusing on their involvement patterns in logistics activities. Design/methodology/approach Two exploratory studies were conducted. Study 1 involved exploratory factor analysis to identify the dimensions of consumer logistics activities. Subsequently, K-means clustering analysis was conducted to categorise “logsumers” based on their current preferences for logistics activities. Findings The findings reveal five dimensions within consumer logistics activities: pre-shopping strategic planning, pre-shopping information exploration, physical involvement in delivery, intellectual engagement in delivery and post-delivery return activities. Further, this study identifies four types of logistics activity participants: enthusiastic logistics participants, apathetic logistics participants, intellectual activity engagers and physical activity activators. Research limitations/implications This study expands the understanding of consumer logistics by offering a comprehensive segmentation framework across all logistics stages, including post-delivery returns. By integrating clustering analysis with logistics management, it reveals consumer logistics behavioural patterns. However, its findings are limited by regional and temporal contexts, suggesting that generalisations should be cautious. Originality/value This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding consumer logistics and lays the groundwork for market segmentation research in this domain. Furthermore, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of consumer engagement by examining logistics activity attributes and “logsumer” types, enabling retailers and logistics service providers to formulate differentiated strategies for diverse consumer groups.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes and tests five temporally explicit models of message evaluation derived from work on supportive communication. Although most empirical work in this area is based on a limited number of time-scales (temporal isolation of messages or temporal aggregation of conversations), theories that direct that work have the potential to make much more sophisticated predictions of how supportive messages, and the conversations within which they occur, are evaluated. Using data produced by pairs of friends who engaged in 5-min supportive conversations, we articulated a series of theoretically informed models that examined how type, accumulation, and timing of conversational moves impacted how disclosers evaluated the supportiveness of the statements made throughout the conversation (evaluated by the discloser using video-assisted recall) and how they felt after the conversation. Results confirmed that (a) evaluations made throughout a conversation are related to post-conversation reports of supportiveness and emotional improvement, (b) different types of speaking acts are generally not differentially supportive, and (c) timing of some speaking acts matters—altogether suggesting we pay more attention to how we conceptualize and measure time in studies of enacted support.",

Contributions show how infrastructures of manipulation, emotional and visual repertoires, and algorithmic logics amplify populism, disinformation, and polarization, while weakening deliberation. Analyses of youth orientations, electoral arenas, and media systems reveal how negativity and symbolic performance increasingly outweigh substantive dialogue. Comparative perspectives highlight the global scope of these dynamics.

Covering a broad spectrum of governmental bodies (e.g., ministries and officials), the research highlights the variety of influencer–government partnerships and collaborations. The study comes at a time when diverse regulatory frameworks are emerging globally to govern influencers’ activity, mandating transparency in sponsorships, protecting consumer interests, and setting boundaries on influencer involvement in governmental and political campaigns. The methodology combines two main steps: (a) a web search of news articles and blogs to identify relevant examples of government–influencer collaborations; (b) a manual annotation of government-led influencer strategies of the retrieved examples based on thematic areas, degree of autonomy in the partnership, and narrative strategy. The study focuses on France, the US, and Canada, chosen for their advanced digital environments and initiative-taking approaches in both social media regulation and public diplomacy. The main contribution of the study is to develop a typology of government–influencer collaborations to align public perception with (inter)national policy goals and reach their target audiences.",

          "authors": "Mauro Bomba",
          "abstract": "TikTok’s rapid rise in media and information consumption among young Italians has recently prompted Italian politicians to stake out this space during election campaigns to engage a younger electorate, traditionally sidelined by mainstream news and political communication. However, attempts to tailor Italian political communication to the TikTok ecosystem are still undergoing a process of adaptation and familiarization (Boccia Artieri &amp;amp; Donato, 2024). This may reflect the challenges of engaging with TikTok’s peculiarities: it is driven by youth-centered usage and language focused on entertainment and escapism (Cervi et al., 2023), and its predominantly algorithmic architecture shifts content circulation from relational networks to personalized recommendations. This configuration transforms the political experience on social media for both politicians and users, moving from relational interactivity toward a more aesthetic, performative dimension. In this context, our study examines how these TikTok characteristics affect the production, circulation, exposure, and evaluation of political content during the 2024 European Parliament election campaign. The analysis revolves around three main foci: How politicians used TikTok and leveraged the platform’s features; how users encountered and assessed political content; and how the topics addressed by politicians on TikTok compare with those young Italians deem most important. The second-order election setting of the European elections (Reif &amp;amp; Schmitt, 1980), contrasted with youth voter appeal (Consiglio Nazionale dei Giovani, 2024), adds complexity, making the alignment of political and user interests a key driver of TikTok content circulation less predictable.",

          "abstract": "In today's digitized societies, where constant connectivity is perceived as a social norm, many people voluntarily seek temporary digital disconnection to balance out benefits and harms. Given that any direct effectiveness of digital disconnection is limited, recent approaches emphasized its conditionality. Conducted in two culturally dissimilar countries (the United States and Indonesia), the present large-scale cross-sectional youth surveys ( N s = 1,922 and 2,107, respectively) explored whether different popular feature- and rules-based digital disconnection strategies (digital detox app use vs. reflective smartphone disengagement vs. digital solitude) may serve as an ambivalent moderator for relationships between habitual and compulsive smartphone checking, on one side, and digital stress experiences, on the other. For U.S. youth only, results indeed suggested that reflective smartphone disengagement might minimize detrimental side effects of firm checking habits, whereas it exacerbates links to digital stress for people who struggle with smartphone checking compulsiveness.",

Guided by fan activism and media logic theories, this study explores fan comment control in online public cultural spaces as a representative case of digital fandom in China. By investigating the digital mobilization of fan comment control and the interactions among fans, anti-fans, non-fans, and platforms, this study challenges the optimistic view in previous fan studies that regarded fan collective action as fan activism. Through participant observation and 20 in-depth interviews, this study finds fluidity in cultural identities within and outside the digital fandom and an ongoing negotiation between platforms’ efforts to regulate users and users’ strategies to adapt to algorithmic rules. Notably, under the reinforcing influence of platform dataism, fans’ diverse motivations contribute to transforming collective commenting from a potential form of activism into a struggle for discursive hegemony.",

Among cross-national participants (N = 348 from &gt; 30 countries), response patterns forward a two-factor solution: One combines SPIR elements anchored to identity items representing an egocentric orientation toward the place (55% of variance explained), and another comprises only emotion items representing idiosyncratic emotion dynamics (14%). Validation analyses found egocentricity to be strongly and positively associated with metaphorical conceptualizations of SoP, emotionality less so, differentially across place materiality and valence. Findings hold implications for digital and physical space design, especially as generative technologies increasingly afford place personalization.",

          "authors": "Laura Niebling",
          "abstract": "The article introduces the concept of “consent capital” to analyze how writing and reading romantasy, a leading book genre on contemporary bookish platforms often criticized for its young female communities and “trivial” nature, has become a site for political discourse. Drawing on feminist research on romance since the 1980s, and theories on consent culture and cultural capital, the analysis traces romantasy’s role in the post-digital storytelling of body politics, particularly after 2016. Through a comparative analysis of contemporary romantasy series, exemplified by a case study on Rebecca Yarros’s Empyrean series and a focus on “alpha male archetypes,” the article argues that notions of consent, bodily autonomy, and trauma have been transformed into a form of cultural capital, which is actively practiced, but also discussed and aesthetically reflected upon on social media platforms. In post-digital storytelling, it informs cultural value debates and commodification strategies on “sides” like BookTok, where romantasy’s fictional renegotiations of consent capital intersect with the current political, legal and cultural debates on “consent” in countries in the “Global North”.",

          "abstract": "Disability is a complex topic, despite 1 in 4 Americans having some kind of disability. Social media form a powerful tool for the social inclusion of people with disabilities, allowing them to seek and share information. Self-representation is a part of this dynamic, revolving around conscious creative choices and curated self-expression within a mediatized habitat. The current study examined disability influencers on social media to understand their self-representation strategies and the discourse they use to communicate about disability. Content from disability influencers ( N = 14) was textually and visually analyzed for self-representation strategies, and comparison of the medical and social models of disability was made. Findings revealed these models are not always in opposition. Disability was found to be a complex topic, especially in light of visible and invisible representation with influencers positioning themselves in relation to larger societal structures, social media affordances, and disability discourses.",

In this study, we combined topic modeling with qualitative textual analysis to examine discursive communicative behaviors on the memorialized accounts of two deceased Chinese vloggers on Bilibili. We identified two types of posthumous communication: life-to-death communication and death-triggered discussion. These communications are based on the remaining content and the perceived presence of living others on the accounts. Through posthumous communications, the deceased vloggers’ identities were preserved on one hand and were made symbols of related social topics on the other hand. As such, memorialized accounts serve as sites of collective memories and commemoration, which can be reactivated to facilitate ongoing posthumous communication when living people face similar situations or when related incidents resurface in society.",

          "abstract": "In this article, I examine how the use of audience feedback in film production shapes creative decision-making. While existing scholarship often views audience data as a rationalising tool that reduces risk and economic uncertainty, little research has explored how such practices function within creative processes. Drawing on an empirical case study from the Danish film production culture, where a novel audience research initiative institutionalises interfacing with proxy audiences at the early stage of script development, I analyse how filmmakers negotiate the integration of audience insights. The analysis finds that audience research does not dissolve uncertainty, as the creative uncertainty of translating feedback into concrete creative action persists. This is underlined by the negotiated nature of the process, where filmmakers selectively filter and resist audience input, often privileging their creative vision over audience sentiment. These insights nuance prevailing claims about the predictive capacity of data-driven production and demonstrate that the negotiation between creativity and audience data is a contested feature of contemporary media production.",

          "authors": "Kari Steen-Johnsen, Audun Fladmoe, Karoline Andrea Ihlebæk",
          "abstract": "The emergence of right-wing alternative media has raised concerns about the diffusion of radical ideas among citizens and growing distrust in the media and public institutions. Based on representative surveys in Denmark ( n = 1,958), Norway ( n = 2,009), and Sweden ( n = 1,991), we examine what characterises right-wing alternative media users in terms of political attitudes and political, media, and social trust. The analysis reveals that right-wing alternative media users in Scandinavia tend to affiliate with far-right parties, support far-right ideas, and express lower levels of trust in political institutions, traditional media, and unknown others. Among these, support for far-right ideas and a lack of trust in traditional media are the most important characteristics. While support for far-right ideas characterises right-wing alternative media users in all three countries, low trust in traditional media is a more important characteristic in Norway and Sweden than in Denmark. The study advances knowledge of the role of ideology vis-à-vis various forms of (dis)trust among right-wing alternative media users, showing that while alternative media use across the Scandinavian countries displays a set of similarities, such use is also formed by national context.",

          "abstract": "This research examined whether people's own and their partner's financially focused self‐concept are associated with relationship satisfaction in a sample of UK couples ( N = 388 participants). Results showed that financial harmony in a romantic relationship is influenced not only by an individual's own financial focus but also by their partner's financial focus. Contrary to expectations, however, the degree to which financial resources were integrated (i.e., pooled) between partners did not moderate this link. Exploratory analyses tested financial stress, financial harmony, and financial infidelity as possible mediators of the link between people's own and their partner's financially focused self‐concept and relationship outcomes. When perceiving the partner as overly focused on financial success, they were more likely to endorse financial infidelity and reported lower financial harmony, which in turn was associated with poorer relationship outcomes. Indeed, the perception of excessive financial focus appeared to be more detrimental to the relationship than the partner's actual financial focus. These findings highlight the importance of assessing the financial attitudes of both partners as well as their perception of each other's financial attitudes in shaping romantic relationship outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms are crucial for political and social engagement, where identity profoundly shapes public opinion. While existing research explores social media and identity, the rise of sophisticated bots complicates this relationship; bots programmed to mimic human identity groups may influence discourse and sway opinion on critical issues like elections and climate change. Addressing a gap in theoretical work, this article proposes the concept of instrumental bot identities, explaining how bots can be strategically designed to leverage and co-opt social identity processes for enhanced impact. By developing a theoretical framework, I outline the characteristics (e.g. relevance, familiarity, anonymity) and interaction patterns (e.g. influencing ingroup/outgroup dynamics) that could make specific identities instrumental for bot campaigns. Using the case of fossil fuel workers, a politically salient group in energy transition discussions, the article illustrates how bots could simulate classed and gendered characteristics to reinforce stereotypes, shape group norms, and ultimately influence public attitudes toward decarbonization policies. This framework highlights that bot effectiveness may stem from exploiting identity-motivated reasoning, offering crucial insights for understanding and mitigating online manipulation in polarized contexts.",

          "abstract": "This article argues that a profound change has occurred in the spaces of social media, centring on the region formerly occupied by Twitter. More than Twitter rebranding as X, After Twitter refers to a historical punctuation point in the timeline of social media and an emerging social media reality. After Twitter registers the slow death of a set of ideals and related practices specific to platforms like Twitter, but also to the waning of ideals in relation to the communicative potentials of the open web more generally. We make three broad claims which characterise social media After Twitter: First, by way of an overview of alternatives and competitors including Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Truth Social and more, we observe a social media fragmentation. Such fragmentation is not solely driven by economic forces or technological development and instead is understood along explicitly political lines. Second, we observe the rise of polarised platform polities. These polities reflect divergent political positions, create distinct political realities and foster different modes of interaction and belonging. Third, we observe a general shift from connective to protective forms of sociality, where users approach social media as if they are constantly in the presence of adversaries, and the ‘weak ties’ that once defined a web of opportunities are replaced by an assumed toxicity of ties. We conclude by reflecting on the nostalgia for the Twitter-that-was, suggesting the need to foster a critical and reflective relationship with the Twitter of old.",

Through textual analysis of 50 TikTok “vigilante videos” and the 244,600 comments supporting them, this research explores how women employ weaponized exposure to pursue informal justice across a spectrum of experienced harms. While prevailing scholarship highlights the risks of digital vigilantism, this project provides a critical feminist perspective, emphasizing the tension between carceral and anticarceral approaches to justice. Findings reveal “vigilante videos” serve three key functions: (1) facilitating retributive action against perpetrators, (2) transforming victims’ shame into collective empowerment, and (3) creating protective networks safeguarding potential future victims. By engaging with these videos, TikTok users foster a sense of crowd-sourced justice, amplifying the voices of women who have been failed by traditional legal avenues. These digital practices reflect a broader critique of the carceral state and demonstrate how women navigate justice outside of formal systems. This research contributes to scholarship on TikTok, cultural criminology activism, and anitcarceral feminism.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how women of color on TikTok engage with the viral “outfit transition” trend to assert ethnic pride, resist cultural assimilation, and build digital communities. Our research builds on literature exploring TikTok’s affordances and digital fashion culture, focusing on how women of color use the application to challenge aesthetic assimilation and celebrate ethnocultural identity. Using critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) and digital ethnography, we analyzed 63 TikTok videos to explore how audiovisual features (e.g., audio, hashtags, and comments) enable marginalized creators to challenge western aesthetic dominance. The findings reveal that women of color strategically use TikTok to construct a subaltern digital commons, celebrating ethnic pride while fostering solidarity across diaspora communities. These creators promote cross-cultural engagement by inviting non-ethnic viewers to learn about and respectfully engage with their cultures on their terms. This study expands on studies of digital fashion culture to show how TikTok’s outfit transition trend functions as an online space to resist Eurocentric beauty standards while centering non-white femininities and cultural aesthetics. In addition, our analysis sheds light on how these creators navigate algorithmic biases that often limit visibility for marginalized groups. Women of color creatively rework viral trends to enhance their visibility, asserting control over how they and their communities are represented online. Ultimately, the study underscores TikTok’s potential as a site for community building and intercultural exchange, where women of color challenge colonial legacies in fashion while sustaining digital spaces for ethnocultural uplift.",

          "abstract": "China is a major trading partner of the European Union (EU), and the debate over China’s economic influence has gained prominence on both the political and media agendas in EU countries. Through time-series analysis, this study investigates reciprocal relationships between the European Parliament’s (EP) political agenda and the national media agenda regarding EU–China trade relations (2001–2020). The analysis is based on a sample of 538 speeches from the EP Plenary Debates and a total of 867 newspaper articles from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK). Combined with a manual quantitative content analysis, this study also examines the salience of sub-issues in EU–China trade relations. Monthly-level vector autoregressive analyses yielded four major findings. First, a positive reciprocal relationship was observed between the EP’s political agenda and the national media agenda on EU–China trade relations, with mutual influences showing similar effect sizes. Second, it was especially the speeches by Far-Right Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from the Netherlands and the UK that elicited more national media attention, and vice versa. Third, we found positive mutual influences not only between the national media agenda and the political agenda set by MEPs but also between the national media agenda and the political agenda set by EU representatives. Fourth, the geographical and social proximity of sub-issues in EU–China trade relations appears to moderate the politics-media dynamics. The findings contribute to existing scholarship by examining the function of multilevel structures (i.e., supranational vs. national) in agenda-setting research.",

          "title": "Dissonant Public Spheres and Facebook Campaigning in Austria: A Cross-Level Study of the 2024 European and National Parliament Elections",
          "authors": "Franz Reiter, Uta Russmann",
          "abstract": "Most research studying the content of political campaigns has employed cross-sectional, cross-national, or longitudinal designs. Although this research has enhanced our understanding of campaigns, there is still a lack of cross-level studies that compare the content of campaigns at different political levels. In this study, we employ a cross-level design by comparing campaign strategies in the 2024 European Parliament (EP) election and the 2024 National Parliament (NP) election in Austria. We focus on campaign strategies related to dissonant public spheres: Populist content, negative campaigning, and the polarizing issues of immigration and environmental policy. To do so, we apply a quantitative content analysis ( N = 1,794) of the Facebook posts of political parties and candidates during both campaigns. Using binary logistic regression, we find that negative campaigning is significantly more likely and the issue of environmental policy is significantly less likely to occur in the NP campaign compared to the EP campaign. However, there are no significant differences between the EP and NP campaigns regarding populist content and the issue of immigration. Our findings demonstrate that the second-order elections theory may be less applicable to the analysis of digital campaign strategies. Instead, other frameworks—such as populist discourse as a global phenomenon, the transnationalization of issues like immigration, and the increasing salience of global concerns such as climate change—may offer more analytical traction.",

          "title": "Generative AI Generating Concerns: Citizens’ Perspectives During the 2024 European Elections",
          "authors": "Aqsa Farooq, Elske van den Hoogen, Marina Tulin, Claes de Vreese",
          "abstract": "The 2024 European Parliament (EP) elections (EP24) were regarded as a “testing ground” for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered disinformation threats. Instances of multimodal, AI-generated disinformation were found across European democracies, leading to questions about just how prevalent this threat may be in the eyes of citizens poised to vote in the EP elections, and its influence on electoral processes. Utilizing a three-wave panel approach, we surveyed a sample of citizens in the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland ( N = 2929) to track changes over the course of the election cycle. We explored the association between citizens’ concerns about and perceived encounters with AI-generated content, including disinformation. We were also interested in how these concerns and perceived encounters differ over the course of the campaign, differ by country, and ultimately, how they relate to citizens’ perceptions of the fairness of the electoral process. We found that increased reported exposure to AI-generated election content, including disinformation, is associated with heightened concern about AI’s threat to democratic integrity in the EP24. While reported exposure to AI-generated content positively influenced perceptions of electoral integrity and democratic satisfaction at the EU-level, disinformation eroded these perceptions, albeit modestly. Reported exposure to AI-generated disinformation peaked just before elections, suggesting strategic timing. Understanding citizens’ perspectives can be crucial for the development of a robust, democratic and resilient information ecosystem—particularly during elections.",

          "title": "Autonomy, Objectivity, and Transparency: The Meaning and Negotiation of Journalistic Values Across Different Journalistic Beats",
          "authors": "Phoebe Maares, Kim Löhmann, Folker Hanusch, Daniel Nölleke",
          "abstract": "As an institution, journalism relies on several key normative values to claim authority and legitimacy— autonomy, objectivity , and transparency . Although these concepts have been widely studied, most research employs quantitative approaches or focuses on specific beats, often political journalism. Drawing on fifty-five in-depth interviews with Austrian journalists, we examine the meaning of these journalistic values and their relevance in political, lifestyle, sports, and economic journalism. We find that autonomy is universally valued, though commercial influences and pressures are more frequently noted in lifestyle and sports journalism. Objectivity is emphasized in political and economic journalism but less prioritized in “softer” news beats, where subjective perspectives are more widely accepted. Transparency is important across all fields, yet differences emerge between “hard” and “soft” news regarding the necessity to disclose sources or funding agencies. Thus, universality across beats cannot be assumed, and the heterogeneity of the journalistic field, in terms of its application of different normative values, needs to be considered in future studies.",

          "authors": "Ricard Espelt, Enric Senabre Hidalgo, Rosa Cerarols",
          "abstract": "Dry stone constructions, recognized by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage, face increasing challenges due to abandonment and environmental degradation. This article explores how collaborative visual ethnography can contribute to the documentation and revitalization of endangered practices associated with dry stone construction in Catalonia. Through photographic interventions and interdisciplinary collaboration with dry stone experts and artists, this research showcases alternative ways of engaging with cultural memory and landscape transformation in the geohumanities field. The study presents visual outcomes from four photography interventions, and discusses their implications for the documentation and revitalization of heritage from a geocreativity perspective. The research contributes to shared knowledge on how visual ethnography, grounded in interdisciplinary collaboration, offers a transformative approach to rethinking and revitalizing cultural landscapes.",
