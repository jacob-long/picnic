          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of “topic territoriality,” a mechanism that governs participation in conversational spaces. When a discussion becomes prone to territorialization, individuals are more likely to claim topics (participating in discussions about topics they own as “stakeholders”) and defer (reducing participation in topics owned by others). They are also more likely to patrol topic boundaries (monitoring who is participating and confronting topic “intruders”). We document the operation of topic territoriality by analyzing 112,278 conversational turns on Weibo before and after a policy that reveals users’ broad geographic locations. We find that revealing these locations increased territorial behaviors, leading to more homogenous participation in conversations. Although the display of locations has improved the overall civility in language, the confrontations between stakeholders and intruders became more toxic. Our research emphasizes the impact of topic territoriality in online conversations and sheds light on the unintended consequences of social media policies.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: This longitudinal study examines long-term associations between the use of sexually explicit internet material (SEIM) during adolescence and engagement in unwanted sexual behaviors in emerging adulthood. Drawing on a four-wave panel study among 377 participants (aged 18–24, 44.3% male), using logistic regression analysis, we found that SEIM use during adolescence predicted a higher odds of having sexually touched a stranger and of having insisted on sex with someone who had refused by emerging adulthood, 5 years later. That said, the proportion of participants committing these unwanted sexual behaviors is relatively small. Respectively 10.3%, 8.5%, and 1.1% of emerging adults had sexually touched a stranger, insisted on sex with a partner who had refused, or had used force to try to have sex.",

          "authors": "Emily L. Jones, Michelle Rozenman",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Most Americans aged 18–49 use social media ( Atske, 2021 ). The social compensation ( McKenna &amp; Bargh, 2000 ) and social enhancement ( Kraut et al., 2002 ) hypotheses offer two frameworks for understanding online social behavior, yet the evidence for these hypotheses is mixed. Two factors that may be important to consider in the context of online social behavior are social anxiety symptoms ( Weidman et al., 2012 ) and perceived social support ( O’Day &amp; Heimberg, 2021 ). This study aimed to understand how online social behavior may be associated with social anxiety and perceived social support. Participants ( N = 303) completed self-report measures of social anxiety symptoms and perceived social support, as well as a task designed to simulate online social interactions. Participants who mentioned social activities in a mock social media profile had significantly lower social anxiety and significantly higher perceived social support than those who did not. There were no significant associations between social anxiety or perceived social support and the number of people with whom participants expressed interest in interacting. Participants with higher perceived social support indicated that they wanted to maximize their chances of interacting with another person. Overall, these findings provide some support for the social enhancement hypotheses. Further research is needed to disentangle how social anxiety and perceived social support may be relevant to online social behavior.",

In this study, participants were shown Islamist terrorism news in a quota-based 2 (news: differentiated vs. undifferentiated) × 2 (perpetrator characteristics: insider vs. outsider, that is, a threat from within vs. an alien threat) experiment ( N = 444). Exposure to differentiated news increased attitudinal differentiation of Muslims from terrorists, which in turn decreased negative stereotypes but not negative implicit attitudes. There were no differences in effects of exposure to coverage of insider versus outsider terrorists on either stereotypes or implicit attitudes.

          "abstract": "Despite the resounding alarm of a nationwide decline of local news, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Using the 2004 and 2018 U.S. local news deserts datasets alongside census and election data, I adopt spatial panel regressions to delineate causal relationships between county-level attributes and local news preservation and further demonstrate spatial heterogeneity in these relationships through geographically weighted panel regressions. I find that news media follow the money and often move away from places where they are needed most—those with more racial-ethnic diversity and growing populations. Partisan composition does not help or hinder local newspaper preservation.",

          "abstract": "With ChatGPT’s rapid adoption, concerns regarding generative artificial intelligence (AI) have shifted from theoretical to practical. Drawing upon the “algorithmic imaginary” framework from critical algorithm studies and the anthropological concept of “ordinary ethics,” we analyzed Twitter discourse during ChatGPT’s initial deployment, examining 368,359 tweets. Our analysis identified five topics reflecting functional and critical aspects of ChatGPT. We specifically point to two topics with a critical perspective: “Ethics” and “Concerns.” The first aligns with scholarly discussions in AI ethics on fairness and transparency, while the second focuses on ChatGPT’s generative capabilities. This highlights an emerging trend: While the academic discussion on AI ethics has gained popularity, especially in scrutinizing ChatGPT, the conversation is now expanding to more nuanced ethical deliberations. We analyzed the posts’ engagement and sentiment over time, demonstrating the AI ethics community’s influence in addressing the potential and harms of generative AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Can players’ network-level parameters predict gaming perpetration, victimization, and their overlap? Extending the Structural Hole Theory and the Shadow of the Future Effect, this study examines the potential advantages and accountability conferred by key network metrics (i.e., ego network size, brokerage, and closure) and their behavioral implications. Using longitudinal co-play network and complaint data from 55,760 players in an online multiplayer game over two months, the findings reveal that higher network size is associated with greater perpetration and reduced victimization. Network closure is linked to reduced involvement in both perpetration and victimization, while network brokerage is linked to increased involvement in both. The overlap of perpetration and victimization is predicted by higher network size and lower closure. Theoretically, this study complements existing research on gaming toxicity from a structural perspective. Practically, the findings underscore the importance of considering network elements, particularly network closure, in designing interventions to mitigate gaming toxicity.",

          "abstract": "The recent surge in corporate responses to social and political crises marks a pivotal shift in how brands perceive their societal roles. This study explores “brand activism,” a phenomenon whereby brands engage in social advocacy through digital platforms, reflecting a strategic integration of social issues into their core identity and marketing practices. This proactive stance not only raises awareness and mobilizes support but also raises ethical concerns about the potential for brands to exploit social causes for commercial gain. Employing qualitative content analysis with a critical phenomenological approach, this research investigates how individuals engage empathy-based representations within brand activism on digital platforms. Data from interviews with 37 young adults reveal that while brand activism can foster a sense of empowerment and moral alignment, it also risks superficial engagement and selective empathy. This study highlights the ethical considerations in brand activism and how digital media shapes moral reasoning in contemporary branding.",

          "abstract": "This research examines how exposure to different motives of scientists affects the impact of scientific consensus on public attitudes toward cultured meat. While scientific consensus on the safety of cultured meat generally increased positive attitudes toward it, this effect depended on information about scientists’ motives. Exposure to information about scientists’ financial motives weakened the positive effect of scientific consensus because it undermined trust in scientists. Information about scientists’ prosocial motives did not influence the scientific consensus effect. These findings suggest that perceived motives can shift trust in experts, thereby affecting the influence of experts on public attitudes.",

          "abstract": "While the literature on music digital platforms has focused mainly on the consequences of production and consumption, few works have looked at platformization from the perspective of companies active in the music business. Drawing on an ethnographic inquiry of Sofar Sounds—a London-based company that organizes intimate and secret concerts in unconventional spaces—I introduce platform work to explore the kinds of practices in which platforms engage. I identify three operations in Sofar Sounds’ platform work: the incorporation of Sofar Sounds concerts into digital devices; its financing by venture capital (VCs) funds; and the activation and generification of its global community. In conclusion, I argue that being a platform involves organizational practices and that studying these practices shifts our attention beyond a few limited successful companies. I propose that light-tech capitalism accounts for this mundane and unsophisticated aspect of platform work.",

          "abstract": "Through a qualitative analysis of feminist posts shared by Chinese beauty influencers, this study explores the political potential and limitations of their engagements in digital feminism on Weibo. Chinese beauty influencers show the potential to shape everyday feminist discourses and promote female solidarity on Weibo. However, beauty influencers’ feminist practices represent a form of contested activism, situated at the intersection of state governance, platform power, and entrepreneurial demands, subtly reconfiguring digital feminism in China. By converting feminist sentiments into brand assets through self-branding and promotional activities, influencers’ feminist practices feed into the platform’s profit motives and their own career advancements. Moreover, beauty influencers adopted what we call “state-aligned, soft activism,” inadvertently perpetuating the non-emancipatory gender discourses endorsed by state governance. Their engagement with digital feminism exemplifies the ambivalent feminist politics within the Chinese digital space dominated by state control and commercial logic, reflecting inherent contradictions and broader tensions in conducting meaningful feminist activism within a constrained environment.",

          "authors": "Patrick F. A. van Erkel, Peter van Aelst, Joren Van Nieuwenborgh, Claes H. de Vreese, Michael Hameleers, David N. Hopmann",
          "abstract": "Despite increasing academic attention, several questions about news literacy messages (NLM) remain unanswered. First, it remains unclear how differences in the framing of the NLMs may influence their effectiveness. Second, we still know little about how NLMs work and, in particular, whether people also adopt the recommendations they are given. To answer these questions, this study conducts an experiment in the Netherlands and Belgium, where we manipulate the frames of the NLM, comparing interventions using a “fake news” frame with those using a “reliable news” frame or a mix of the two. We also manipulate elements in the false news article that participants have to evaluate afterwards. Our findings show that all three types of NLMs are effective in making people resilient to misinformation, without resulting in a general decrease in trust in accurate news (=spill-over effect). In particular, news literacy media messages with a “mixed” frame are effective, as they make people critical toward false news articles, and also result in a higher perceived accuracy of accurate news articles. Additionally, the findings provide suggestive evidence that NLMs work, at least partly, because participants also adopt (some) of the recommendations being given.",
