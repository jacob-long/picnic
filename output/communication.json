          "abstract": "Purpose This research examines how digital communication technology can act as an intervention tool to develop online social capital and resilience when normal bonding and support reduces during crisis. Design/methodology/approach Using 21 semi-structured interviews, the experiences of women are explored to understand how they strengthened their capabilities to acquire support and achieve resilience during crisis. Findings Findings demonstrate different ways women developed their bonding and bridging social capital at personal, family and community level to seek online support and empower themselves to achieve disaster resilience. While the context of this study is pandemic, findings are applicable to other crisis scenarios. Originality/value The research enhances the importance of online social capital in developing agency, capabilities and resilience during crisis. It enables to understand how practitioners should not limit technology use to disaster preparedness and prevention, but it could also be used in responding and recovering from crisis.",

          "authors": "Abdul Hameed Pitafi, Fazeelat Masood, Sheena Pitafi",
          "abstract": "Purpose The present research aims to explore the influence of enterprise social media (ESM) features on employee agility through knowledge sharing and hiding. ESM strain was taken as a moderator in the association among knowledge sharing, knowledge hiding and employee agility. Communication visibility theory is used to underpin the hypothesized research model. Design/methodology/approach Data is collected from 374 Chinese employees working in different companies. A structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied using AMOS software 21.0. Findings Findings illustrate that ESM features namely analysis, tracking and communication are significantly connected to knowledge sharing and negatively to knowledge hiding. Knowledge sharing is significantly related to employee agility while knowledge hiding is negatively linked to employee agility. Further, ESM strain strengthens the negative connection between knowledge hiding and employee agility. However, ESM strain has an insignificant moderating effect in the connection between knowledge sharing and employee agility. Practical implications The current research has practical implications for ESM users and ESM-enabled organizations. For individuals who use ESM to promote knowledge within an organization, this study highlights the important functioning of ESM features that include analysis, tracking and communication. For managers, this study suggests the use of ESM features to promote knowledge sharing and inhibit knowledge hiding. Originality/value The current research investigates how ESM features are associated with employee agility in the workplace. This study proposes that knowledge sharing and knowledge hiding are the mediators of the effect path between ESM features and employee agility. Moreover, the present study extends to ESM literature by highlighting the moderating role of ESM strain using communication visibility theory as a theoretical lens. Lastly, this study quantifies the benefits of ESM features to help organizations train agile employees.",

          "abstract": "Purpose In the current digital transformation era, guiding employees toward realizing self-leadership has become a critical strategy for enterprises to mitigate the risks of external uncertainty. This study explores the intrinsic relationship between enterprise social media (ESM) communication visibility and self-leadership on the basis of communication visibility theory (CVT) and conservation of resources theory (COR) to support the sustainable growth of employee self-leadership. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 332 Chinese employees across three stages. Hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method were employed to test the hypotheses. Findings Network translucence and message transparency positively affect self-leadership. Relational energy and job control mediate the relationship between communication visibility and self-leadership. Moreover, response expectations weaken the positive relationship between relational energy and self-leadership as well as between job control and self-leadership. Practical implications Managers can use ESM to provide work and social support for employees’ job control and social network development to achieve long-term maintenance of employees’ self-leadership. At the same time, within the context of ESM use, moderately reducing response expectations can offer situational support for employees to achieve self-leadership. Originality/value This research sheds light on the internal mechanism by which ESM communication visibility affects self-leadership and explores the key boundary conditions that impact how self-leadership is formed. These findings expand the understanding of self-leadership development in the context of ESM use and offer new technical insights for guiding and fostering sustainable employee self-leadership.",

          "authors": "Mahdi Abouei, Nima Kordzadeh, Maryam Ghasemaghaei, Bilal Khan",
          "abstract": "Purpose Users contribute to online communities by posting and responding to discussion threads. Nonetheless, only a small fraction of threads gain popularity and shape community discourse. Prior studies have identified several factors driving thread popularity; however, despite their prevalence, the role of emotional expressions within discussion threads remains understudied. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of thread starters’ valence and embedded discrete emotions of anger, anxiety and sadness on thread popularity, drawing on the negativity bias and the emotion-as-social-information theories. Design/methodology/approach Using two samples from Reddit, this study employs negative binomial regression analysis to examine the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results demonstrate that negativity in thread starters significantly influences thread popularity; however, the expression of discrete emotions impacts popularity variously. In some contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccination subreddits, embedded anger in thread starters decreases thread popularity, whereas anxiety and sad expressions enhance it. In other contexts, such as professional discussions (e.g. r/Medicine subreddit), anger and anxiety expressions increase thread popularity, while sad expressions have no significant influence. Research limitations/implications The study is limited by its focus on specific emotions and contexts. Future research could examine a broader range of emotions, post-content modalities and the impact of cultural and linguistic differences. Originality/value This study contributes to theory by offering a new definition of thread popularity and enhancing our understanding of the impact of emotions in online discussions. It also provides practical implications for online community members and moderators seeking to promote discussion posts that help achieve community goals.",

          "authors": "Xiao Deng, Jiayu Li, Yaying Huang",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores how employees respond to social media-induced fear of missing out (FoMO) in the workplace and examines the subsequent impacts of these responses. Based on the transactional theory of stress and coping, the research focuses on how FoMO affects employees’ adoption of stress-coping behaviors: active work interruption (a problem-oriented strategy) and social network interaction (an emotion-oriented strategy). It further investigates the outcomes of these coping strategies – job burnout (resulting from the problem-oriented strategy) and workplace relationships (resulting from the emotion-oriented strategy). Additionally, the study explores how the perceived competitive climate moderates the effect of FoMO on these coping behaviors. Design/methodology/approach A two-phase survey yielded 244 responses, which were then analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling to validate the relationships among the variables. Findings The findings revealed that FoMO increases employees’ active work interruption, leading to job burnout. In addition, FoMO leads employees to engage in more social network interaction, which promotes workplace relations. The perceived competitive climate positively moderates the indirect effect of workplace FoMO through active work interruption and job burnout. Originality/value This study emphasizes that individuals are not merely passive recipients of stress but active agents in coping with it. This shift from “passive impacts” to “active responses” helps uncover the bidirectional impacts of social media-induced FoMO on employees, thereby enriching our understanding of FoMO and expanding the application of the transactional theory of stress and coping. Additionally, we explore the boundary conditions of the FoMO mechanism and advance research related to the perceived competitive climate.",

          "abstract": "This research delves into the dualistic nature of datafication, revealing its capacity to both illuminate and mask realities within media organizations. Datafication, the strategic use of data in organizations, offers insights into, and transforms, how work and individual outcomes are perceived and evaluated. This study examines how data-centric practices—embodied in metrics, rankings, and algorithms—can skew the playing field, creating scenarios where workers may feel (un)fairly (dis)advantaged or (mis)represented. The findings indicate that while data can provide valuable insights fostering cooperation and learning, it can also create competition and apprehension among journalists. Through the concept of “coopetition” we show how media professionals employ data opportunism to leverage information while also grappling with data skepticism amid potential misinterpretations and increased competition. Hence, the findings contribute to the research on datafication by demonstrating how workers utilize interpretative flexibility depending on what the data and metrics make visible.",

In the study, Polish participants ( N = 958) evaluated the profiles of three well-known Polish politicians from different parties: Bosak (right-wing), Trzaskowski (center), and Biedroń (left-wing). Participants made evaluations before and after reading hateful, kind or neutral tweets about refugees from Ukraine. We controlled for participants’ political views and demographic variables. The results confirmed changes in evaluations of the image of politicians depending on the language they used. The ‘positivity bias’ identified in the study provides encouragement to use kindness speech in public discourse, showing that this type of communication can improve a politician's ratings.",

          "abstract": "How do couples differ from other couples in how they regulate their own and their partner’s emotions? Although research on emotion regulation is blooming, insights into joint emotion regulation profiles—that is, the overlap between partners’ specific strategies to regulate themselves and their partner—remain limited. To address this gap, we identified joint intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation profiles in 120 mixed-sex couples; clustering couples together based on both partners’ reported intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation strategies. Additionally, we examined associations between profile-membership and well-being indicators. The identified joint emotion regulation profiles differed in three ways: (1) degree of regulation (e.g., no use of any vs. high use of all strategies), (2) strategies predominantly used; and (3) degree of similarity—or lack thereof—between partners. Together, these findings provide the first insights into the role of joint emotion regulation profiles in the health of couples and their relationships, highlighting the unique roles played by both partners in regulating their own and their partner’s emotions. Further research is needed to assess if these results generalize to inclusive samples and daily life.",

          "authors": "Axelle Asmar, Tim Raats, Leo Van Audenhove",
          "abstract": "This article critically explores Netflix’s use of diversity as a strategic tool within its global production culture; it focuses on how the streamer increasingly deploys various narratives about diversity and inclusion to legitimate its presence, rationalize its operations, and normalize the industrial changes it generates. Through a critical discourse analysis of Netflix’s corporate communication—press releases and diversity reports published between June 2022 and February 2024—the study identifies four central discourses that shape Netflix’s approach. These discourses reveal that while Netflix positions itself as a socially responsible actor championing diversity and inclusion, its strategy intertwines cultural values with commercial imperatives. By appealing to local talents worldwide, Netflix’s rhetoric not only opens opportunities for underrepresented voices but also risks simplifying complex local identities to fit global market demands. The article concludes that Netflix’s approach to diversity, while progressive on the surface, may in practice constrain creative autonomy, subtly reinforcing existing global power structures and shaping diversity through a commercial lens.",

          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=\"EN-US\"&gt;The social media landscape is replete with images of animals that users share, repost and like, and there are not just cats anymore; various nonhuman species have become a part of the social media “ecosystem” from cute puppies to exotic dragons. They are not simply models for different formats of content anymore, on Instagram they have their own accounts and they become influencers almost like humans. At the same time, such accounts have odd status – they create the ‘illusion’ that animals can have control over their representation thus showing their identity on social media and that they are actors independent both from human curators and from the policy and affordances of Instagram as a digital platform. The paper is aimed at answering two main research questions: what forms of identity, and whose identities, are represented in pet accounts curated by human owners? What strategies and platform tools are chosen by the owners for curation and performing animal agency in pet accounts? Thus, the paper addresses three theoretical fields: 1) human-animal relationships, 2) representation of identity and agency in social media, 3) politics and affordances of digital platforms. Based on the discussions in these fields the authors propose qualitative in-depth analysis of six pet accounts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

          "abstract": "This thematic issue examines the gendered dimensions of platform economies, focusing on the construction of gendered online selfhood. Through the affordances of social media platforms, users expand the range of topics and content accessible to the public, simultaneously exposing these subjects to increased visibility and potential debate. Platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, X, and Telegram enable anyone to create channels and publicize content on virtually any topic, fostering niche communities. In other words, platforms, driven by their pursuit of attention, time, and data, cannot be analyzed solely through a business or organizational lens. The economic dimension is intertwined with cultural formations—beliefs, values, and identity constructions—which carry an anthropological dimension. In this thematic issue, we are particularly interested in the gendered aspects of this intertwining.",

          "abstract": "Drawing from interviews with 39 online extremism and terrorism researchers, this article provides an empirical analysis of these researchers’ experiences with institutional ethics processes. Discussed are the harms that these researchers face in the course of their work, including trolling, doxing, and mental and emotional trauma arising from exposure to terrorist content, which highlight the need for an emphasis on researcher welfare. We find that researcher welfare is a neglected aspect of ethics review processes however, with most interviewees not required to gain ethics approval for their research resulting in very little attention to researcher welfare issues. Interviewees were frustrated with ethics processes, indicating that committees oftentimes lacked the requisite knowledge to make informed ethical decisions. Highlighted by interviewees too was a concern that greater emphasis on researcher welfare could result in blockages to their ‘risky’ research, creating a ‘Catch 22’: interviewees would like more emphasis on their (and colleagues’) welfare and provision of concomitant supports, but feel that increased oversight would make gaining ethics approval for their research more difficult, or even impossible. We offer suggestions for breaking the impasse, including more interactions between ethics committees and researchers; development of tailored guidelines; and more case studies reflecting on ethics processes.",

Applying algorithmic accountability as a central theme, this research (a) assesses the alignment of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot responses with timely political information, (b) investigates the factual correctness and transparency of chatbot-sourced synopses, (c) examines the adherence of chatbots to democratic norms and impartiality ideals, (d) analyzes the sourcing and attribution behaviors of the chatbots, and (e) explores the universality of chatbot gatekeeping across different languages. Using the 2024 Taiwan presidential election as a case study and prompting as a method, the study audits responses from Microsoft Copilot in five languages. The findings reveal significant discrepancies in information readiness, content accuracy, norm adherence, source usage, and attribution behavior across languages. These results underscore the contextual awareness when applying accountability assessment that looks beyond transparency in AI-mediated communication, especially during politically sensitive events.",

          "abstract": "Public discussions of controversial science fields like COVID-19 or climate science increasingly address inner-scientific structures and the norms guiding the scientific system—aspects that are normally discussed within the scientific community. However, not much is known about the endorsement of scientific norms by non-scientists and how those endorsements differ between controversial und uncontroversial science fields. We conducted a cross-sectional national survey in Germany ( N = 1007) to capture the public endorsement of scientific norms and explored the role of the science field, political ideology, and science news consumption. Results suggest that the endorsement of scientific norms is significantly higher in controversial fields than in less controversial fields. More left-leaning political ideology is connected to higher levels of norm endorsement; science news consumption is partly associated with lower scientific norm endorsement. We discuss our findings regarding their implications for the public’s image and understanding of controversial science fields.",

          "authors": "Edson C. Tandoc, Seth Seet, Vanessa Xinyi Chan, Penny Ju Onn Wong",
          "abstract": "Implementing artificial intelligence also requires examinations of public attitudes and perceptions. One approach is by examining media framing of artificial intelligence, including news coverage, which is a reflection of societal perceptions and a key influence over people’s understanding. As such, this study examines the framing of communicative artificial intelligence in Singapore, looking at how the news media frame communicative artificial intelligence and characterize it as a social actor. Through a manual content analysis of 336 news articles from three major news websites in Singapore, this study found that the news media in Singapore tend to focus on the benefits and advances of communicative artificial intelligence and portray communicative artificial intelligence as a tool rather than social actor. However, when comparing news coverage of communicative artificial intelligence after the advent of ChatGPT, the news framed communicative artificial intelligence more in terms of risks, regulations, responsibilities, and conflict.",

          "title": "Auditing the Compliance and Enforcement of Twitter’s Advertising Policy",
          "authors": "Yash Vekaria, Zubair Shafiq, Savvas Zannettou",
          "abstract": "Online platforms have enacted various policies to maintain a safe and trustworthy advertising environment. However, the extent to which these policies are adhered to and enforced remains a subject of interest and concern. In this work, we present a large-scale audit of adult advertising on Twitter (now X), specifically focusing on compliance with its adult (sexual) content advertising policy. Twitter is an interesting case study in that it—uniquely from other social media platforms—allows posting of adult content but prohibits adult content in advertising. We analyze approximately 35,000 ads on Twitter with respect to their compliance with the adult content ad policy through Perspective API and manual annotations. Among other things, we find that nearly 38% of ads violate Twitter’s adult content advertising policy—of which, the platform eventually removed only about 63% of these non-compliant adult ads. We also find inconsistencies in the moderation of such ads across languages, highlighting the need for more reliable and consistent moderation practices across different languages. Overall, our findings highlight blindspots in Twitter’s adult ad policy enforcement for certain languages and countries. Our work underscores the importance of external audits to monitor compliance and improve transparency in online advertising.",

          "abstract": "In this article, the authors engage with visual representations of smart homes, examining whether and how these media constitute emergent narratives of Western meanings of home. They do so by reporting on the findings of visual content and semiotic analysis of smart home images published in architectural media. They identify two modalities of smart home images published in these media – images in which smart home technologies are visible and those in which they are implicitly hidden. They read these images as constituting two semiotic myths of home: as familiar places of belonging for both people and smart objects, and as exceptional spaces of luxury associated with freedom from domestic labor delivered by smart technologies. They argue that these myths are central to securing social acceptance of the smart home by signifying it to be both trustworthy and aspirational.",
