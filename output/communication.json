          "authors": "Joynes J, Ashish Kumar Dwivedy",
          "abstract": "This systematic review examines the evolution of international information flows and their social, cultural, and economic implications for developing societies within contemporary digitally mediated environments. Analyzing 120 academic sources, the study uses a two-stage approach. First, it maps publications with Gephi to evaluate trends, citation patterns, and scholarly influence. Then, it conducts an inductive thematic analysis with NVivo to reveal key concepts and empirical issues. The review revisits the historical legacy of the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) and examines whether the historical imbalances in access, representation, and control still exist in the digital age. The findings reveal that, despite increased connectivity, global information flows remain shaped by Western-centric platform power, uneven digital infrastructure, and ongoing cultural and media imperialism in the Global South. Although there is evidence of resistance through localized content production and selective media growth, this agency continues to operate within lasting structural and governance limitations. By blending traditional international communication theories with current discussions on platformization and digital colonialism, this review highlights that digital transformation has altered, rather than eliminated, global communication inequalities. The study emphasizes the ongoing importance of NWICO-informed views and calls for updated theoretical frameworks and inclusive governance approaches to promote fairness in global media systems.",

          "title": "Before code, beyond screen: Media archeology and convergence friction in early VR art (1993–1995)",
          "authors": "Kaihei Hase",
          "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has often been narrated as if it emerged ex nihilo , whether through Lanier’s early proclamations of a new epoch, Rheingold’s celebration of Sensorama, or, particularly in Japan, the rhetoric of a “first year of VR” that accompanied the release of the Oculus Rift. Yet from a cultural and artistic perspective, VR was not born “out of nothing” but is situated within historical genealogies of media such as panoramas, theater, cinema, and interactive art. This essay proposes the concept of convergence friction to describe VR’s distinctiveness: when heterogeneous media traditions intersect in VR, their tensions persist rather than resolve into unified forms. Unlike cinema and television, which quickly absorbed such frictions into stable narrative and broadcast languages, VR sustains them as productive resources. Through close readings of three seminal early works, Jeffrey Shaw’s EVE (1993), Brenda Laurel and Rachel Strickland’s Placeholder (1993), and Char Davies’s Osmose (1995), this essay traces how embodiment, collectivity, and bodily rhythm became principles of immersion while colliding with earlier media legacies. Contemporary VR artworks such as Notes on Blindness (2016), Carne y Arena (2017), Chalkroom (2018), and AI History 1890–2090 (2023) extend these frictions in new directions, demonstrating that VR is continually redefined at the threshold between past and future media. By theorizing VR as a site of convergence friction, this essay argues that its incompleteness, its refusal to settle into a stable language, is not a deficiency but the very condition of its artistic and cultural significance. VR is not ex nihilo but perpetually reborn, sustained by unresolved genealogies and anticipatory futures.",

          "authors": "Catalin Brylla, Ibrahim Emara",
          "abstract": "This article investigates how blind and visually impaired (BVI) YouTubers construct and perform their social identities through strategic self-representation. Drawing on Social Identity Theory and Erving Goffman’s performance model, it analyses 60 YouTube channels to examine how disability is negotiated within broader identity constellations, including gender, profession and interest groups. The study finds that BVI identity is thematically foregrounded in most channels, yet rarely in isolation: creators who explicitly centre blindness also display a greater number of salient identity categories and produce more diverse content. Analyses further show significant associations between BVI salience and certain genres, with central-BVI channels more likely to feature lifestyle and entertainment content, thereby ‘normalising’ blindness within mainstream formats. At the same time, vloggers mobilise identity enhancement strategies, such as portraying competence in highly visual domains (beauty, cooking, filmmaking and technology), to challenge ableist expectations and reduce social distance with sighted viewers. These performances are accompanied by selective omissions, with politically charged, socio-economic and intimate topics, indicating careful management of vulnerability and audience appeal. The findings demonstrate that BVI vlogging constitutes a performative, intersectional and inherently advocacy-oriented practice, even when activism is not explicit. The article contributes a nuanced understanding of online disability (self-) representation and offers an analytical framework for future research on identity performance, stigma and digital media practice.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Collins",
          "abstract": "A new wave of websites, referred to as alternative technology (alt-tech) social media, are proliferating across the internet, characterised by far-right-centric content and the imitation of mainstream platform affordances. This study employs Netnography to examine the recruitment practices of four prominent alt-tech platforms: Gab, Parler, Truth Social, and Gettr, providing an in-depth comparative analysis of their homepages. To better understand these communicative dynamics, the article highlights the similarities and differences between the homepage content of these alt-tech platforms. The findings reveal the hate-filled paradigm collectively captivating their userbases while highlighting the distinct technocultures developed and promoted within each platform. By focusing on the technocultural interplay between the selected platforms and their communities, the study offers a compelling exploration of alt-tech social media environments, the particular needs and niches fulfilled by each space, and their place within the broader far-right ecosystem.",

          "authors": "Eduard Cuelenaere",
          "abstract": "Streamers have become central to the production, circulation, and consumption of audiovisual content, reshaping how cultural industries manage creative risk and exploit intellectual property (IP). I argue that, within this platformized environment, content recycling – including (re-)adaptations, remakes, sequels, spin-offs, and prequels – has emerged not as a residual practice, but as a core operational logic. The article interrogates how recycling practices are structurally embedded within the economic and infrastructural design of global video-on-demand (VOD) services. Building on an interdisciplinary theoretical framework, the study draws on a comparative, cross-platform dataset covering all ‘Original’ fictional feature films released by Netflix (2015–2024), Amazon Prime Video (2018–2024), and Disney+ (2019–2024). Through this dataset, the article identifies both convergence and variation in how major streamers operationalize recycled content as a form of ‘IP extractivism’ – that is, the systematic transformation of existing IP into modular, extensible, and data-optimized content assets. The analysis indicates that, while all three streamers rely heavily on recycled content, the forms this recycling takes vary in ways that align with their different corporate configurations. In the dataset, Netflix’s Original film slate is dominated by speculative, adaptation-driven recycling, Amazon Prime Video’s by a mix of acquisitions and selective franchise extensions, and Disney + by patterns consistent with an integrated, conglomerate IP portfolio. The article argues that, under conditions of platformization, recycled IP functions as a privileged asset class: its modularity, data legibility, and retention potential align closely with logics of algorithmic governance and assetization. Conceptualizing recycling as IP extractivism, the article reconsiders originality as controlled variation within pre-enclosed worlds and highlights the implications of this shift for cultural diversity, rights ownership, and the sustainability of smaller production ecosystems.",

          "authors": "Francisco W. Kerche, Tommaso Venturini",
          "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the very short and yet very rich story of a TikTok meme: the rise and fall of the dabloon fictive currency. We examine this story as an example of self-exciting trendiness: a common internet dynamic in which trendiness and cultural vibrancy become inextricably intertwined. In the case of the dabloons and of many other memetic phenomena in TikTok and other platforms, this connection creates a spiraling cycle of popularity that is as potent as it is cursory. TikTokers understood all too well that the dabloon currency was going to be a fad, but, rather than being discouraged by this ephemerality, they pushed it to its extremes. Like many online communities, they doubled down on the transience of their subculture, and did so in the most literal way, using the inflation of their currency to first escalate and then implode the trend. The rise and fall of the dabloon trend offers a cautionary tale about the accelerated cycles of online cultures and internet memes: an illustration of how online communities can create culture not despite but by means of their ephemerality.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines whether and how AI fitness instructors can foster psychological closeness and the alleviation of loneliness compared to human instructors. Design/methodology/approach The study involves 592 participants in online fitness environments and employs a quasi-experimental design. Data are subsequently analyzed using variance-based structural equation modeling. Findings Human instructors have a more pronounced positive effect on psychological closeness, resulting in the alleviation of loneliness. However, AI instructors also demonstrate potential to foster emotional connections, particularly when there is a high level of co-presence and perceived enjoyment. Co-presence and perceived enjoyment reduce the psychological gap between human and AI instructors, amplifying the positive effects of psychological closeness on alleviating loneliness. Research limitations/implications This study relies on a quasi-experimental design and short-term exposure to AI fitness instructors, which may limit causal inference and the generalizability of the findings to long-term human–AI relationships. Practical implications The findings highlight practical implications for designing AI-driven platforms in fitness, healthcare and education to enhance emotional well-being and alleviate loneliness through personalized experiences. Originality/value This study advances the literature on human–AI interaction by empirically demonstrating how AI instructors can foster psychological closeness and alleviate loneliness in digital fitness contexts. By integrating psychological closeness, co-presence and perceived enjoyment within a unified framework, the research extends social presence and Computer as Social Actor perspectives to AI-mediated well-being outcomes. The findings offer novel insights into how AI systems can be designed to narrow the psychological gap between human and artificial agents.",

          "authors": "Lingzhi Brian Fang, Liu Tang, Heng Yang",
          "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study is to address the research gap in understanding the role of AI in the workplace, particularly by investigating how AI fosters job anxiety. By introducing the transactional theory of stress and coping (TTSC), this study engages with the conventional theory of stress and anxiety to determine the dual role of AI features in both exacerbating and alleviating job anxiety. Design/methodology/approach A large-scale survey was conducted, and 675 valid responses were collected. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the entire theoretical model. A bootstrapping analysis was applied to assess the serial mediating role of AI stress in linking AI features to job anxiety. Findings The results revealed that AI explainability significantly enhances job anxiety. Conversely, algorithm transparency emerges as a mitigating factor, reducing job anxiety. These findings underscore the dual impact of AI, which acts as both a stressor and a potential alleviator depending on its design characteristics. Research implications This study highlights that algorithmic transparency can effectively mitigate AI-induced stress and job anxiety, underscoring the need for firms and managers to implement AI cautiously while strengthening governance merchanisms and prioritizing employee well-being and skill development. AI developers and policymakers should advance human-centered transparency and regulatory safeguards to reduce workplace anxiety and protect employees in AI-enabled environments. Originality/value This study pioneers a focus on the complex effects of AI in the workplace, diverging from conventional research that predominantly emphasizes the supportive role of AI. By integrating the TTSC, this study theoretically advances the understanding of AI stress mechanisms and empirically demonstrates the paradoxical effects of AI features. The dual-role framework offers novel insights for both academics and practitioners in addressing AI-related workplace challenges.",

          "abstract": "How is decision-making affected when individuals face threats to safety? Guided by the theory of dyadic morality, the limited capacity model of motivated-mediated message processing, and exemplification theory, we investigated how safety threats shaped individuals’ physiological responses and behavioral moral decision-making. Using an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment simulating a moral tradeoff, participants crossed a deep pit and made decisions between their safety and that of another person, reflecting a tradeoff between egoism and altruism. Results from an experiment with 201 participants revealed that exposure to threat increased arousal (physiologically and self-reported), which decreased the extent to which they felt their decision harmed others, leading to selfish decisions in the moral dilemma. However, this pattern only manifested when concerns of harm were not made salient before the threatening experience. Together, these findings demonstrate VR’s utility for simulating moral tradeoffs and advancing both psychophysiological and behavioral approaches to media psychology and morality research.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the mediating roles of perceived parental autonomy control and self-efficacy in the association between overparenting and emerging adults’ social media addiction. Emerging adults (ages 18–29) are particularly vulnerable to social media addiction. Theories suggest that overparenting may be a risk factor for social media addiction, but studies examining underlying mechanisms explaining the association are scarce. College students ( N = 240) from a large university in the southeastern U.S. participated in a longitudinal study, completing three surveys over 12 weeks. Path models were used to examine the proposed hypotheses. Results revealed a significant positive association between overparenting and social media addiction, with perceived parental autonomy control and self-efficacy serially mediating this association. These findings support the potential role of parental autonomy control and self-efficacy as mechanisms linking overparenting to social media addiction. The study also underscores the importance of addressing overparenting and promoting self-efficacy in emerging adults through targeted interventions by practitioners, educators, and parents to mitigate the risk of social media addiction.",

          "authors": "Beatrice Bobba, Hao Yang, Francesca Prati, Elisabetta Crocetti",
          "abstract": "Nowadays, adolescents have increasing opportunities to interact with peers of their same and other ethnic groups. Yet, little is known about the implications of having an intragroup or intergroup best friend for the development of interpersonal identity processes (i.e., commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration) and its interplay with subjective, psychological, and social well-being. The current study aims to fill this gap. A total of 984 adolescents ( M age = 14.66; 62.70% females; 24.80% ethnic minority) living in the North-East part of Italy completed questionnaires at three time points reporting on their best friend’s ethnic group, interpersonal identity, and well-being. Results of chi-square test comparisons highlighted that ethnic majority youth had more intragroup while their ethnic minority peers had more intergroup best friendship ties. Further, results of latent growth curve analyses showed that ethnic majority and minority adolescents with intragroup and intergroup best friends displayed unique developmental trajectories of interpersonal identity commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as their interplay with subjective, psychological, and social well-being. Overall, these findings provide crucial insight into the type and implications of youth friendship patterns highlighting the protective role of a consolidated sense of identity for the well-being of youth in multicultural societies.",

          "authors": "Sunjeong Gyeong, Huiyoung Shin",
          "abstract": "Marital relationships play a central role in psychological well-being across adulthood, yet prior research has rarely integrated personality, motivational, and relational factors as components of a single interpersonal system. To address this gap, this study—guided by social–cognitive and dynamic-systems perspectives—applied network analysis to examine how personality traits, approach–avoidance goals, spousal support and strain, and marital adjustment are interconnected within a dynamic interpersonal system. Flow network analysis was further used to identify how these dispositional, motivational, and relational factors were directly and indirectly linked to life satisfaction and psychological distress. Participants were 502 married South Korean adults ( M = 54.43 years; 49.4% male). The resulting network revealed a closely connected triad of approach goals, spousal support, and marital adjustment, suggesting that motivational and relational factors form a cohesive system underlying marital functioning. Marital adjustment and approach goals emerged as the most central and bridging nodes, linking dispositional, motivational, and relational domains. Flow network analysis indicated that life satisfaction was directly associated with marital adjustment, spousal support, approach goals, higher extraversion, and lower neuroticism, whereas psychological distress was directly associated with higher neuroticism, lower marital adjustment, and stronger avoidance goals. Together, these findings indicate that psychological well-being is shaped by structurally differentiated configurations of dispositional, motivational, and relational factors, rather than by additive or dominant-factor effects within any single domain.",

          "abstract": "Local rural newspapers live a precarious existence in Alberta, Canada. In a declining economic situation, rural journalists have adopted unconventional practices to continue their work. Based on fieldwork in four communities, we show how rural journalists negotiate between the dominant metropolitan-based doxa and habitus of the journalistic field and their own position within communities. The analysis reveals rural-specific reporting practices, atypical business practices, and unconventional approaches to innovation. We argue that rural journalism is not merely a deviation from dominant metropolitan norms but a subfield actively redefining the boundaries of journalistic practice in response to economic precarity and community obligations.",

          "abstract": "This article turns to cruising maps as sites in which normative conceptions of space, place, and time might be reimagined. The authors first examine a brief history of queer mapping practices, paying particular attention to how queer cruising maps challenge constructions of private and public life by charting veiled sexual publics obfuscated by subtle queer social codes. Then, paying particular attention to ephemera and affect, the authors investigate the ways these queer cruising maps are animated by economies of affective experiences and other queer ephemera—feelings, lingerings, barterings, passings, and potentialities. The authors then argue that such an affective experience reorients stabilized notions of space, place, and time. The article concludes with a meditation on the futures of cruising, reflecting on how queer social and sexual relations have been (re)shaped across time into the present moment. Through such a provocation, the authors seek to critically examine how queer sexual practices and counterpublics are mapped and remembered, and how their contours of belonging continue to be contested, opening potentials and possibilities for new queer futures.",

          "abstract": "Amid the polycrisis of Covid-19 pandemic and disinformation, rural Traditional Peoples and Communities in Brazil demonstrated remarkable resilience. This article examines the social mobilization strategies developed by 33 communities between 2020 and 2022, highlighting the community-based communication technologies used for collective action. Traditional Peoples and Communities are local groups with territorial ties and empirical knowledge who are recognized as key actors in environmental and natural resource protection. Although they play a crucial ecological role, there is a research gap on how these communities developed communicative strategies to strengthen resilience against disinformation during the pandemic. Guided by participatory and action research epistemology, the study involved 274 family representatives across nine Brazilian states from the Atlantic Coast, combining a multi-method approach. Data collection included questionnaires quantifying media access and internet usage alongside conversation circles and community mapping documenting communication practices. The results make explicit that Traditional Peoples and Communities faced two main types of disinformation: regarding Covid-19 vaccination and related to land use and speculation. In a context of limited digital connectivity, they developed communal internet practices—such as broadband sharing—that supported collective organization and information exchange. Besides, two experiences stood out: community health workers’ efforts to counter vaccine disinformation, and community leaders’ use of online meeting platforms to promote social mobilization in the face of environmental disinformation. Findings underscore how community-based communication technologies can foster political agency and strengthen resilience against disinformation.",

          "authors": "Yahia Benlarbi, Samira Belghitia",
          "abstract": "This study evaluates Algeria’s communication strategy during the Covid-19 pandemic by examining the alignment between the national Preparedness and Response Plan and the communication practices implemented throughout the crisis. Using a qualitative descriptive approach, the study relies on documentary analysis of governmental communication plans, official statements, media coverage, and scholarly literature on risk and crisis communication. The findings show that although Algeria adopted a structured communication framework consistent with international guidelines—such as transparency, rumor monitoring, and expert mobilization—its implementation encountered several institutional and communicative challenges that limited overall effectiveness. Key obstacles included fluctuations in public trust due to inconsistencies in epidemiological reporting and delays in clarifying technical errors, in addition to uneven media coordination, limited opportunities for two-way communication, and a predominantly expert-centered, one-directional messaging style. The analysis further demonstrates that access to official information was significantly more restricted among marginalised populations, including rural communities, residents of “shadow areas,” low-income households, migrants, and persons with disabilities. Digital gaps, infrastructural constraints, and linguistic or cultural barriers shaped how these groups received, interpreted, and acted upon risk messages, underscoring that the effectiveness of communication during the pandemic depended not only on message clarity but also on inclusiveness, equity, and access. The study concludes that effective crisis communication requires more than technical accuracy: It must integrate principles of social equity, community engagement, and message adaptation to the needs of marginalised groups. Strengthening transparency, improving coordination between authorities and media, expanding community-based communication channels, and ensuring equitable access to information emerge as essential components for enhancing public trust and societal resilience during future health emergencies. The Algerian experience ultimately demonstrates that structural communication gaps disproportionately affect vulnerable groups and that evaluating the success of risk communication efforts requires careful attention to how marginalised populations access, understand, and act upon public-health information.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;",

Accordingly, mobile media augment human cognitive processes by being accessible to users as they move through and act in the world. Moreover, this theory accounts for the emergence of mobile autonomous systems that can move through and act in the world, in the absence of human cognition. As an analytical tool, this theory can be applied to understand specificities of how humans and nonhumans act, move, know, and produce agential change in the world. It can inform scholarship that explores social and material impacts, moral–ethical dimensions, and the design of mobile systems that augment and supplant human decision-making processes.",

          "abstract": "As virtual reality (VR) evolves as a narrative medium, its capacity to immerse users in realistic environments has attracted scholarly interest. This study investigates how users perceive realism in VR beyond sensory fidelity. Using 27 interviews and four focus groups with experts and non-experts (n = 77), we examine how realism in VR is conceptualized and experienced. Qualitative analysis identified 12 factors contributing to perceived realism, grouped into five overarching dimensions: immersion, presence, embodiment, involvement and external realism. Our findings indicate that realism is shaped not only by technological features such as graphical quality but also by factors such as emotional involvement, narrative consistency and perceived authenticity. The study advances theorizing on perceived realism by proposing a framework that integrates technological and experiential dimensions and offers a basis for developing scales to measure realism in VR. Current findings are also relevant for the responsible use of VR in persuasive contexts.",

          "abstract": "In today’s digital landscape, platforms increasingly “feel like” social media. We observe the “social media-fication” of so-called “non-social media” platforms as expressive characteristics of traditional social media platforms are incorporated into mobile apps typically used for other purposes. We argue that this manifests through the repackaging of user behavioral data into expressive social updates, such as GPS maps capturing user movement or the personalized data visualizations of Spotify Wrapped. To examine this phenomenon, we completed platform walkthroughs for three apps: fitness tracking app Strava, payment app Venmo, and music streaming app Spotify. We theorize the concentration and intensification of datafication as a process that we term hyperdatafication. Hyperdatafication emerges through the repurposing of “backend” user data into socially mobilizable data representations, which encourage and further platform engagement within the sociotechnical landscape of affective capitalism. Ultimately, this study raises questions about self-tracking, commodification, and platformed sociality beyond social media.",

This period coincides with the 2-year anniversary of the Russian invasion and overlaps with the sixth month of the war in Gaza. The analysis finds an imbalance in the volume of coverage allocated to the two wars, as well as war-specific visual framing devices, but also similarities in their portrayals. Ultimately, in both cases, the visualization of war creates a distance between the viewers and those affected on the ground.",

          "abstract": "Dating apps employ gamified structures (e.g., swipes, likes, matches) that reshape dating scripts by blending game-like elements into social interactions. This study explores users’ conceptualization of gamification, its impact on experiences, and dating scripts. Thirty-one semi-structured interviews (17 cisgender women, 14 cisgender men) were conducted in Portugal. Participants were current and former users with different sexual orientations and a diverse age range (18–34 years old), and predominantly Portuguese. The thematic analysis presented how users likened their dating app interactions to games, identifying specific gamified features, and describing their adaptation and engagement in strategic practices to enhance appeal. Despite the uniform platform system and rules, traditional gender scripts endure and dictate a binary dynamic where men are seen as initiators and women as selectors. The findings reveal tensions between gamification’s homogenizing effect and enduring socio-cultural scripts, illustrating how platform design affordances and social norms structure dating experiences.",

          "abstract": "This article reports findings from the first study to investigate smartphone sharing in intimate relationships in Australia. Efforts to strengthen cybersecurity have been hindered by a lack of knowledge about the prevalence and dynamics of smartphone sharing, resulting in blind spots in cybersecurity design and policy. Based on a survey of 967 Australian adults who use smartphones and have been in an intimate relationship, we found that 70% share access to their mobile phones with their intimate partners. This high rate of shared access indicates that one-user, one-device threat models are inadequate for promoting cybersecurity in realistic use conditions. Such models are particularly ill-suited to intimate relationship contexts where the parties are more likely to share devices than not. Our findings provide previously unavailable baseline information about mainstream smartphone-sharing practices. This evidence can be used to improve privacy protections for telecommunications users in Australia and elsewhere.",

          "abstract": "In the digital age, philanthropy is increasingly mediated by platform microcelebrities who mobilize audiences for social good. This study examines the novel philanthropic model of YouTube creator Jimmy Donaldson as a case of outsourced activism , characterized by a dual-outsourcing structure: audiences transfer charitable intent and contributions (via attention-as-currency) to Donaldson, who acts as a central agent and then outsources execution to NGOs and collaborators. Using a mixed-methods design combining a walkthrough, multimodal discourse analysis of 101 videos, and topic modeling of 11,208 comments, we demonstrate how sentimental and digital spectacles sustain this process as tools for activism. The mechanism forms a new connective practice, creating a network of moral delegation and affective investment among audiences, creators, sponsors, and NGOs. Yet, it raises ethical concerns, including depoliticizing social issues and reinforcing unequal power relations. The study advances theories of media activism, connective action, and digital philanthropy by identifying a replicable logic that redefines agency, accountability, and civic participation in platform societies.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how former teenage hostages use TikTok to process and present their captivity and its aftermath. Through a qualitative thematic analysis of 67 TikTok videos created by adolescent survivors of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the study explores how platform-specific affordances—viral trends, POV storytelling, dark humor, and digital memorialization—shape trauma narratives. Findings reveal that TikTok enables young survivors to renegotiate their post-captivity identities through participatory storytelling, humor as a coping mechanism, and the integration of personal grief into collective digital memory. The study situates these practices within theories of trauma representation, adolescent identity development, and Goffman’s dramaturgical model, illustrating how TikTok serves as both a space for self-expression and a site of performative meaning-making. By bridging digital media studies with trauma psychology, this research highlights the evolving role of social media in shaping adolescent resilience and identity reconstruction.",

          "abstract": "Users increasingly resist algorithms through subtle practices woven into everyday life. While scholarship on user resistance is growing, insufficient studies theorise such ‘invisible’ behaviours. This article develops James C. Scott’s notion of ‘infrapolitics’ to conceptualise users’ mundane tactics of resisting algorithmic power (surveillance capitalism and political censorship). Employing a video diary–interview study of Douyin users, we analyse three interrelated dimensions of infrapolitical algorithmic resistance: reflexivity (the recognition of one’s own actions as resistance based on the parallel process of developing self-understanding and awareness of algorithms), tactical immanence (using technological features for alternative purposes while still operating within platform logics) and identity-based (resisting profiling through multi-account practices and the enactment of various selves). We show that infrapolitical resistance emerges through everyday engagement with algorithms, evolving from sidestepping mismatched recommendations to subtly, reflexively and culturally situated practice that challenges the power structures embedded in algorithmic governance.",

This research introduces the concept of “emotional transcoding,” examining how it operates in major repositories Giphy and Tenor through the conversion of paralinguistic vocal expressions – auditory reactions like “aww,” “duh,” and “wow” – into visual representations within silent GIF formats. Through multimodal analysis, this study documents the semiotic strategies involved in emotional transcoding, revealing systematic patterns for visually encoding auditory emotional expressions. Using qualitative content analysis of 1000 GIFs, this study identifies the visual techniques used in cross-modal conversion and analyzes the demographic patterns among performers who represent these expressions. The findings reveal how emotional transcoding operates through specific representational conventions and highlight questions about whose bodies become available as vehicles for emotional communication in digital platforms.",

          "abstract": "We examined whether individual differences related to a sense of choice in being single—ranging from broad psychological needs to contextualized relationship motivations—explain variability in single people's well‐being. In a sample of 445 single adults ( M age = 52.91, Msinglehood = 20.43 years) recruited from Qualtrics, we tested whether basic need satisfaction, attachment orientation, sociosexuality, and reasons for being single (low capacity for courtship, freedom, previous constraints, and personal constraints) were associated with well‐being. Results for need satisfaction and attachment replicated in a pooled sample, including 545 younger singles ( M age = 18.87, Msinglehood = 7.87 years) from a university subject pool. Satisfying basic needs was consistently linked to greater life satisfaction, singlehood satisfaction, and fewer depressive symptoms; attachment anxiety predicted more depressive symptoms and lower singlehood satisfaction (the latter in the pooled sample). Sociosexuality did not predict outcomes beyond basic need satisfaction and attachment. Valuing personal freedom predicted higher satisfaction, whereas perceiving constraints from previous relationships predicted greater depressive symptoms. These findings demonstrate that individual differences related to choice at different levels of specificity provide incremental validity: one who generally feels autonomous may still benefit from secure attachment and valuing their singlehood. Findings underscore integrating general and contextualized predictors to understand single people's well‐being.",

In an online experiment with a quasi-representative sample in Austria ( N = 1126), we investigated the effects of message (uncertainty type) and audience characteristics (science-specific attitudes/beliefs) as potential moderating factors on risk perception and policy support in the context of microplastic health effects. Uncertainty communication, specifically communicated lack of scientific consensus ( consensus uncertainty ), triggered lower risk perception (small effect), and indirectly decreased policy support through message credibility and risk perception. These negative effects were lower (and not statistically significant) when communicating the remaining knowledge gaps ( deficient uncertainty ). Beliefs about science as a debate were positively associated with risk perception, trust in scientists with policy support and preference for information about uncertain science with both. However, these audience characteristics did not moderate the effects of uncertainty communication. The results highlight the importance of considering uncertainty types in environmental and health risk communication.",

Across three experiments ( N = 679), increasing perceived scientific consensus significantly boosted public diffusion behaviors related to the initiative, with diffusion behavior response efficacy mediating this effect. These findings suggest that emphasizing scientific consensus in environmental policy communication can effectively facilitate the interpersonal transmission of pro-environmental messages.",

          "abstract": "We investigated how news articles discussing unequal impacts of climate change due to race versus class influence beliefs and support for action. We conducted two online survey experiments focusing on flooding (Study 1) and heat waves (Study 2). In Study 1, White participants and those with high levels of symbolic racism had lower levels of belief and support when exposed to the race-focused condition, although these interactions were not as consistent in Study 2. Results suggest that focusing on class-based climate disparities may be less susceptible to backfire effects than focusing on race-based disparities.",

          "abstract": "Social media has grown to be a large part of our virtual connectedness online. However, with this growth in digital connection, we have also become connected with digital entities that run them (social media). Borrowing from the concept of interpersonal responsiveness, researchers have found that users perceive their algorithm to be responsive to their needs and sensitive to their identity have a greater sense of well-being online and media enjoyment. However, the mechanisms for which these connect with one another (responsiveness predicting subjective well-being) remain to be disentangled. Guided by self-determination theory, this study examines whether autonomy, competence, and relatedness satisfaction through TikTok use mediate the associations between perceived algorithm responsiveness and insensitivity and satisfaction with life. With an online survey ( N = 385), our study found that greater responsiveness is associated with greater life satisfaction mediated through greater relatedness satisfaction. However, greater competence satisfaction was associated with lower life satisfaction. Future research and current limitations in light of our findings are discussed.",
