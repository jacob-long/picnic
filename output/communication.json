          "authors": "Jiawei Sophia Fu, Katherine R Cooper",
          "abstract": "All actors engage in hybrid organizing. Grounded in constitutive approaches, this article reorients attention to hybridity by examining how actors combine multiple, often competing, constitutive elements in social impact organizing. Building on recent developments in communication research that challenge long-standing assumptions about organizing—and increased scholarly attention to social impact—we argue that hybrid stakeholders and hybrid processes play a central role in constructing social reality. To illustrate this argument, we draw on examples from three recently published studies to showcase hybrid organizing across diverse contexts. While this article focuses on hybridity of social impact organizing situated within organizational communication, we further discuss its relevance to diverse social phenomena and various subfields of communication (e.g., health, political, intercultural). We suggest that, given the prevalence of hybridity in social and organizational reality and its significance in shaping the future of work, a hybridity lens generates meaningful theoretical advancements and practical implications.",

          "authors": "Tao Xiaoning, Nor Akmar Abdul Aziz, Syamsul Herman Mohammad Afandi, Suziana Hassan",
          "abstract": "This study explores the role of women’s empowerment in shaping perceptions of tourism impacts and its influence on participation in sustainable tourism development in Xijiang Miao Village, Guizhou Province. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected through a structured questionnaire measuring five latent constructs: Women’s Empowerment, Ecological and Natural Impacts, Social and Cultural Impacts, Economic Impacts, and Participation in Sustainable Tourism. A total of 341 valid responses from local women involved in tourism-related activities were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results revealed that women’s empowerment significantly influenced their perceptions of ecological, social, and economic impacts, which, in turn, positively affected their involvement in sustainable tourism initiatives. The structural model was significant in explaining things and R 2 values were in the range of 25.8%–41.8% among the constructs. Effect size analysis indicated large effects of women’s empowerment on the perceived impacts, and the model’s predictive relevance was confirmed by satisfactory Q 2 values. The paper has exposed the importance of female empowerment on sustainable tourism practices and this gives valuable information on the governance of participation at the ethnically and culturally sensitive destinations. The findings suggest that the greater opportunities of women in the tourism societies can be translated to the more serious involvement in sustainable development in tourism that will result in the realization of economic and environmental sustainability in the region.",

          "abstract": "Taking breaks from digital connectivity has become a common practice but we still have limited knowledge of which approaches are used and who uses them. This article explores how technological measures are used to take temporary breaks from smartphones and digital media. Technological measures include silent and airplane mode, turning off notifications, deleting and setting time limits on apps, downloading disconnection apps, and using a simpler phone. Based on two representative surveys from Norway (2018, N = 1046; 2023, N = 1142), the study shows a preference for simple measures – silencing, removing, and deleting – over complex tools like disconnection apps. Regarding socio-demographic differences, the article shows that younger, highly educated, and left-leaning people ‘use tech to beat tech’ to a higher degree. Furthermore, the study explores how the use of technological measures corresponds with how respondents assess their smartphone (over)use. The article adds to the body of nationally representative surveys in digital disconnection research and contributes to understanding how technological measures for disconnection have evolved and their popularity and use.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the causal impact of CEO digital vision within smart cities on tourism enterprises’ resilience and digital heritage preservation. Employing a Difference-in-Differences quasi-experimental design, we find that firms led by digitally visionary CEOs in smart cities experience significantly greater increases in revenue stability and faster recovery times, alongside enhanced digital heritage digitization and engagement. Heterogeneity analysis reveals these effects are more pronounced for larger firms. Furthermore, increased investment in digital infrastructure partially mediates this relationship, highlighting a key mechanism. Our findings highlight the critical role of strategic digital leadership in fostering robust and culturally engaged tourism sectors within evolving urban digital ecosystems, offering vital theoretical and practical implications for leaders and policymakers.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the types of mitigation strategies discussed in news reports about terrorist attacks (TAs) in German and Austrian newspapers, examining the differences between security- and surveillance-related (SSR) and restrictive migration-control strategies versus community-bonding and deradicalization strategies. A content analysis of N = 1514 articles on nine TAs in Western Europe since 2016 examines which characteristics of the attacks (rightwing TAs vs. Islamist TAs; death toll; and number of injured victims), the media environment, and the article (tabloid vs. broadsheet; country of reporting; article type; time frame; and article length) predicted the mitigation strategies presented in the articles. Results revealed that media coverage of TAs disproportionately emphasizes SSR and migration-control strategies, while largely neglecting deradicalization measures. This focus may contribute to shaping negative out-group perceptions, highlighting the need for increased awareness among journalists regarding the implications of their reporting.",

          "abstract": "Very large online platforms shape public discourse, raising concerns about the impact of misinformation and disinformation on democratic stability. The European Union responded with the Digital Services Act framework. However, its enforcement remains limited, partly due to conceptual ambiguities surrounding the concepts of misinformation and disinformation. This article investigates how definitional inconsistencies undermine the Digital Services Act’s (DSA) implementation. We analyzed 79 documents—including EU legislation, platform policies, fact-checking codes, and academic publications—to examine how key actors define these terms. We identified four key definitional criteria: content quality, intent, associated risk, and creation and dissemination techniques. Our findings reveal that these criteria reflect divergent institutional interests and result in fragmented definitions. This fragmentation generates critical risks, affecting freedom of expression, research, countermeasure design, intervention effectiveness, and impact assessment. We conclude by offering recommendations to support criteria-based definitions, improve risk evaluation, and reinforce the DSA's effectiveness in countering information disorders.",

          "authors": "Wang Liao, Ya-Ching Lee, Haoning Xue, Emily McKinley",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for understanding people’s relational introspections with machines. Through a social information processing lens, we argue that such introspections begin with relative perceptions of two basic traits: communion (prosocial intentionality) and agency (goal-pursuit capacities) for both machine and user. These relative perceptions are then interpreted through relational schemas in the short term and regulated by trust in the long term––jointly shaping relational behaviors toward the machine (e.g., intention to use). We surveyed three US samples of various AI-technology users (college students, N = 438; MTurk participants, N = 1,023; Prolific participants, N = 726, matched to census demographics). Results consistently showed that (a) intention to use such a machine was driven by self-agency followed by machine-communion, whereas machine-agency and self-communion had no direct impact, and (b) the relative importance of these trait perceptions was mediated by certain relational schemas and moderated by trust across respondents.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate individuals dating intentions in the metaverse. The integrative model of behavioural prediction (IMBP) and behavioural reasoning theory (BRT) are used as underpinning theories to examine proposed hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach Using a sequential mixed-methods approach, this study begins with a qualitative study in phase 1 by conducting in-depth interviews. The insights gained from phase 1, along with pertinent literature, form the basis for constructing the conceptual framework research model. This model is then empirically validated in phase 2. A total of 318 responses were collected to examine the proposed hypotheses. The obtained data were analyzed via the structural equation modelling approach. Findings The results of this study reveal that social anxiety and anonymity are significantly associated with positive anticipated emotions. Further, the results also show that avatar customization, social anxiety and anonymity are significantly associated with negative anticipated emotions. Further, anticipated emotions are also associated with attitude and perceived norms towards dating in the metaverse. Moreover, attitudes towards metaverse dating and perceived norms towards metaverse dating are positively associated with dating intention in the metaverse. Finally, results show time spent in the metaverse as a significant moderator. Originality/value This research reveals how users approach dating in metaverse environments, drawing on BRT and the IMBP. These findings offer valuable insights for dating platforms seeking to enhance metaverse dating experiences.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigated the influence of inconsistent versus consistent emotional expressions (independent variables) in social media profiles on first and final impressions in terms of interpersonal liking and trust (dependent variables). Design/methodology/approach Consistency in emotional expressions was operationalized as the same or different valences across all emotional posts. A 2 (initial positive vs negative emotional expressions) × 2 (subsequent positive vs negative emotional expressions) between-subjects online experiment (N = 254) was employed. Joy and sadness were employed to represent positive and negative emotional expressions, respectively. Findings The findings revealed that first impressions formed based on emotional expressions at Time 1 were transitory. Both positive and negative initial impressions were susceptible to modification by inconsistent emotional expressions at Time 2, indicating the dominance of the recency effect over the primacy effect. Notably, expectancy violation valence, triggered by these inconsistent emotional expressions, significantly mediated the relationship between the displayed emotional expressions and the final impressions at Time 2. Furthermore, interpersonal liking was highly sensitive to inconsistent emotional valence at both stages, whereas interpersonal trust was less affected. Research limitations/implications On a theoretical level, this study reveals the dynamic and continuous process of impression formation based on users’ emotional expressions on social media. On a practical level, the findings can guide users to effectively manage impressions via emotional expressions in social media profiles. Originality/value This study examined the effects of inconsistent emotional expressions on impression formation through competing mechanisms (primacy or recency effects, valence biases and expectancy violation theory).",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores the antecedents of viewers' support provision in the live streaming context. Design/methodology/approach An online survey with 316 valid responses was conducted to test our research model. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to assess the measurement and structural models. Findings The results show that functional congruity and self-congruity promote viewer support provision through establishing psychological contracts. Specifically, the transactional contract has a stronger effect on financial support provision, whereas the relational contract has a stronger effect on emotional support provision. Practical implications The findings encourage streamers and platforms to strategically engage with viewers who share a similar image with the streamer and to facilitate psychological contracts with them. Originality/value First, this study emphasizes the importance of both functional congruity and self-congruity in motivating viewer support provision. Second, it identifies psychological contracts as mediators to explain how dual congruity works. Third, this study examines the asymmetric effects of transactional and relational contracts on viewer financial support and emotional support provision.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Due to ChatGPT’s relative novelty, the determinants and consequences of trust in it remain largely unexplored, especially in the field of higher education. This research investigates how perceptions of AI can foster university students’ trust in ChatGPT, which in turn leads to their continuance and sharing intentions. Cross-cultural differences are also analyzed to provide culturally relevant insights. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach was employed. In the qualitative phase (Study 1), we interviewed 30 university students and used an inductive methodology to analyze the data. In the follow-up quantitative studies, the hypotheses were examined using a sample of 249 students from China (Study 2) and 204 students from the United States (Study 3). Findings Qualitative results suggest that perceived benefits (convenience, usefulness and controllability) and perceived risks (inflexibility, privacy invasion and overreliance) are identified as antecedents of learners’ trust in ChatGPT. Quantitative results reveal that factors including convenience, usefulness and overreliance on AI positively influence learners’ trust in ChatGPT. Furthermore, trust positively affects learners’ continuance intention and sharing intention. These findings are consistent across the Chinese and American samples. However, inflexibility significantly influences trust among Chinese learners but not among American learners. Additionally, invasion of privacy negatively affects trust in ChatGPT only for the US sample, suggesting cultural divergence in trust formation between these two countries. Originality/value We shed light on the antecedents and consequences of trust in ChatGPT within higher education settings, especially across different cultures. This research endeavor also promotes the integration of ChatGPT for learning activities to maximize the utility of this technology.",

          "abstract": "Purpose To promote acceptance of blockchain-based investment options and enhance confidence for new investors, the market must become more comprehensible and accessible to the broad masses. This requires transparency to build trust in web-based intermediaries, particularly given the multitude of websites that often advertise unrealistic returns in the crypto sector. Consequently, intermediaries within the decentralized finance ecosystem need to be clearly identified and categorized to facilitate mass-market adoption. Design/methodology/approach We employ a six-iteration taxonomy approach, establishing a data foundation through literature reviews, expert interviews and document analysis of 50 intermediaries. Archetypes are derived using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Finally, a survey is conducted to evaluate the taxonomy and the archetypes. Findings The taxonomy encompasses three meta-characteristics (functionality, architecture, security) and 63 characteristics. Furthermore, the research findings reveal six archetypes of blockchain-based investment intermediaries, demonstrating significant discrepancies between them, particularly in terms of financial features and governance structures. Given the complexity of crypto intermediary platforms for novice users, the findings underscore the need to implement technology-based and institutional-based trust mechanisms, improve risk assessment and enable informed decision-making. Originality/value By increasing market transparency and fostering trust, this study contributes to the acceptance and adoption of blockchain-based financial intermediaries, drawing on the diffusion of innovation theory. The proposed taxonomy, particularly its dimensions, specifically addresses the requirements of both technology-based and institution-based trust, which are critical for crypto investments. Moreover, the findings emphasize the importance of educational resources and communicated trust features in strengthening user confidence and facilitating broader market participation.",

          "abstract": "Media messages shape our knowledge about the world, but measuring individual exposure and attention remains challenging. Emerging media offer a solution to studying message reception in simulated real-world environments, which may soon become the actual media environments in which we encounter messages. Here, we utilized virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking to investigate message processing in a realistic virtual city environment populated with billboards. We introduced an inception-style manipulation where billboards initially overlooked by participants were covertly reintroduced based on real-time gaze tracking. Our findings show this algorithmic manipulation, undetected by participants, significantly boosted message memory retention for the targeted messages. This study reveals a path of media influence, demonstrating how undetected algorithmic manipulations can shape individual and collective memory. The findings carry practical and theoretical implications for diverse communication contexts, from advertising and public health to political messaging in the emerging metaverse ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "The German gender star is a form of gender inclusive language that uses an asterisk to merge masculine and feminine role noun endings (e.g., Choreograf*in, ‘ choreographer inclusive ’). It was created to counter the male bias of masculine forms intended as generic and to represent all genders more inclusively. This study examined how role nouns with the gender star are processed in written and spoken German using a semantic priming paradigm. In Experiment 1, German participants were primed with masculine 1 ( Choreograf ), feminine ( Choreografin ), and star noun forms ( Choreograf*in ) in printed form, before identifying the gender of a following pronoun as feminine ( sie, ‘ she’) or masculine ( er, ‘ he’). Experiment 2 presented the same prime forms auditorily with the star form realized as a glottal stop ( Choreografʔin ), produced by either a conventionally feminine-sounding or masculine-sounding voice. Congruency between prime and target gender for masculine noun forms ( Choreograf–er ) facilitated response times in both experiments and for feminine noun forms ( Choreografin–sie ) in Experiment 2. Response times for the masculine and feminine pronouns following the inclusive prime forms did not differ significantly in either experiment, indicating that these forms can be associated with both female and male referents in reading and listening, with the gender of the voice having no further effect on processing.",

Using both correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Study 2) methodology, we examined the degree to which relatedness needs might be satisfied in viewers via a direct route (i.e., through meaningful parasocial relationships with narrative characters) and via a vicarious route (i.e., through identification with a character who has satisfying relationships). Results indicated that each route can facilitate relatedness need satisfaction in narrative audiences. The present studies highlight how audiences experience characters both as shared selves and as distinct others and illustrate how narrative engagement can serve as a source for experiences and fulfillment outside of our day-to-day lives.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Social media are increasingly becoming platforms for moral discussions. Users communicating on a moral level can encourage us to engage with information regarding a moral debate by activating processes that shape our moral judgments. To investigate these processes, this paper studies the effect of attitude congruence and morally-framed arguments on the selection, reading time, and liking of social media content related to moral debates and whether the level of perceived moral relevance of the topic influences the effects’ strength. Further the role of identification with other users when choosing what content to interact with is examined. In a 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design experiment, participants were given an information selection task in which they were shown different posts within a mockup Facebook feed. Here, comment valence (positive vs. negative), type of argumentation within the comment (moral argument vs. no moral argument) and the opinion climate within one’s ingroup (ingroup supports attitude-consistent vs. attitude-inconsistent views) were manipulated. Results supported the confirmation bias regarding the selection and liking of content in social media. The hypothesized effects of moral arguments, relevance and group identification did not influence information selection or reading duration. Exploratory analyses revealed that content accompanied by comments with moral arguments has a higher likelihood of being liked, especially when the issue is seen as morally significant.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Human–computer interaction has advanced significantly with the emergence of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, it’s unclear whether users perceive these chatbots to have positive human qualities. Using a 2 × 2 experimental design, university students evaluated the perceived warmth and benevolence of a chatbot, whereby we altered the description of the chatbot across experimental groups. Specifically, we altered its description according to Asch’s (1946) concept of warmth, where we varied it to have traits suggesting high or low kindness, and we also varied the language used in the chatbot description (technical vs. anthropomorphic). We hypothesized that describing the chatbot using anthropomorphic (humanlike language) vs. technical language would increase its perceived warmth and benevolence and that descriptions highlighting kindness would enhance the chatbot’s perceived warmth. Results revealed that kindness-related descriptions of the chatbot significantly affected its perceived warmth and benevolence, whereas differences in anthropomorphic or technical language did not. The role of personality traits in shaping AI perceptions is discussed.",

Despite their presence in compliance-gaining, negotiation, and reconciliation literature, little is known about how ultimatums operate in serial arguments within close relationships. Thus, we engaged the serial argument process model to (1) examine the conditions that contribute to the use of ultimatums in serial arguments, (2) explore the associations between ultimatums and relationship outcomes, and (3) compare the use of ultimatums in romantic relationships and friendships. Using multi-group path analyses, we found that although ultimatums may be employed in both dating and friendship contexts, their usage and associated outcomes are related to factors such as conflict goals, perceived resolvability, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of ultimatum use. These findings have implications for conflict theory and provide guidance for conflict resolution within close relationships.",

          "authors": "Xin-Ying Zeng, Eva Yi Hung Lau",
          "abstract": "The transition to motherhood often leads to a decline in maternal well-being. However, mothers with higher social provision, may perceive greater connection and accessibility to necessary resources within social network that safeguard well-being by strengthening family cohesion. In a cohesive family environment, where family members tend to communicate and resolve conflicts constructively, mothers’ overall satisfaction will likely be promoted. This 3-wave longitudinal study is the first to examine the mediating role of family cohesion in the above relations. 127 married Hong Kong first-time mothers ( M age = 32.8 ) reported social provision, family cohesion, marital and life satisfaction during the third trimester, 4 and 9 months postpartum. Results from structural equation modeling revealed that family cohesion mediated the association between social provision and both marital satisfaction ( R 2 = 0.28 ***) and life satisfaction ( R 2 = 0.41 ***), controlling for baseline. New mothers with higher provision may be better equipped to function within the family environment by perceiving connected and available to sufficient support. This helps to enhance family cohesion during this challenging period, which, in turn, contributes to higher marital and life satisfaction. The findings have significant implications for future prevention and intervention efforts on promoting social provision and family cohesion among new mothers.",

          "authors": "Hester He Xiao, Kit S. Double, Rebecca T. Pinkus, Carolyn MacCann",
          "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) has been positively associated with relationship quality in romantic couples, but few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying this association. The current study examines the mediating role of extrinsic emotion regulation (regulating your partner’s emotions) on the associations between EI and relationship quality. Specifically, we studied the mediating effects of three extrinsic regulation strategies involving high engagement with the partner’s emotions (cognitive reframing, receptive listening, and valuing). Heterosexual couples ( N = 175) completed three waves of surveys across 14 weeks from August to October 2021. EI, extrinsic emotion regulation strategies, and relationship quality were measured at three time points. Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Models (APIMeMs) were applied to the dyadic data to predict relationship quality and changes in relationship quality (with baseline relationship quality controlled). Results showed that valuing one’s partner was the only significant mediator linking EI to relationship quality. For both men and women, individuals’ EI is associated with better relationship quality for themselves and their partners, through their use of valuing to regulate their partners. However, the mediation effect did not extend to residualized changes in relationship quality over time, indicating that EI and mutual valuing may not drive long-term growth. These findings underscore the importance of fostering EI and mutual valuing within couples, which related to healthier present relational functioning. Future research is needed to clarify their roles in sustaining long-term relationship trajectories.",

          "abstract": "The term “sexting” refers to sexually suggestive and/or explicit messages exchanged in one-to-one or one-to-many forms over Internet-enabled devices. According to the multisystem perspective, parent-adolescent communication influences sexual socialization globally and sexting locally. In the present study, a model of the relationships among the breadth of sex topics discussed between parents and adolescent children, comfort in parent-adolescent sexual communication, and adolescent sexting is evaluated. U.S. nationally representative data were gathered from 592 parents and their adolescent children. The results demonstrated that for both adolescents and parents, a wider array of sex topics discussed is associated with increased comfort in parent-adolescent sexual communication. Additionally, increased comfort in parent-adolescent sexual communication is associated with lower incidence of adolescent sexting. Equivalent alternative models that rearrange the variables of interest did not fit the data. These findings contribute to the conceptualization of parent-adolescent sexual communication by delineating between content (i.e., “what is talked about”) and process (i.e., “how it is talked about”) components. Theoretical contributions involve expanding the multisystem perspective of adolescent sexual behaviors to include technologically mediated risks and introducing communication comfort as a regulatory mechanism between message exchange and effects.",

          "authors": "Carlee Smith, Viktoria Papp, Michael Fitzgerald",
          "abstract": "Sibling abuse is one of the most common forms of maltreatment, yet it has been overlooked by researchers and clinicians alike. Sibling relationships are generally the most enduring relationships individuals have, even when there is sibling-perpetrated abuse in childhood. Supportive and strained relationships with family members may protect against or amplify negative affect resulting from sibling-perpetrated abuse in childhood, yet these propositions have yet to be tested. To address the aforementioned gap, we utilized two waves of data nine years apart from the study of Midlife Development in the United States, using retrospective measures of sibling-perpetrated abuse. A sample of dizygotic twins ( n = 221) was analyzed to address gender, age, and birth order effects, and utilized a longitudinal actor-partner independence moderation model. Results indicate a significant interaction between the male twin’s reports of higher levels of female twin perpetrated abuse in childhood and the male twin’s reports of higher levels of current family strain in adulthood (+2 SD above the mean), where the interaction term predicted higher levels of negative affect in the female twin . Models with family support included did not converge, so findings could not be evaluated. Sensitivity analyses indicate there was no mediating effect. We found evidence that a male’s experience of historical abuse and family strain in adulthood crosses over and influences the female twin’s mental health which may be a function of gender socialization and the female twin being more central to maintaining familial relationships over time.",

          "authors": "Paola Sartoretto, Luana Martins",
          "abstract": "For Indigenous populations in Brazil, maps have long been instruments of invisibility. Official maps have historically misnamed and erased Indigenous territories and communities. At the same time, cartographic representations have been a tool of resistance for Indigenous activists. Indigenous communities and organisations have created their own maps identifying territories, peoples, languages, and cultures. These dynamics of contentious visibility intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic when the spread of the virus among Indigenous populations was poorly reported or even absent from hegemonic contagion maps. State negligence, intensified by an authoritarian government hostile to Indigenous populations, threatened the survival of communities around the country who organised collectively to create their own cartographic representations of the pandemic through resistant appropriations of media and data. This article draws on interviews with Indigenous leaders and media activists to discuss processes of data appropriation and resistant cartographies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the use of data and counter mapping strategies for self-representation and political action that must be understood through a non-media-centric perspective, drawing from conceptualisations at the intersection between human geography, communication, and post-colonial theory.",

A digital version is a digital replica of an embodied human, living or dead, that convincingly mimics that person’s textual, visual and aural habits, and exists independently of that source person. By considering digital versions through the lens of (self-)objectification, this article argues that individuals simultaneously assert and relinquish power when creating their own digital versions. Following its analysis of CarynAI, this article proposes a research agenda about digital versions, suggesting avenues for future study about versions and versioning. Ultimately, this article argues for the urgent need to understand the shifting dynamics of personal agency, interpersonal intimacy and identity posted by digital human versions.",

Regression analysis revealed no significant associations between the three classes and mental health; however, adolescents in the Moderate Approach class reported lower perceived autonomy compared to those in the Enforcing &amp; Engaged Approach class. These findings highlight that (1) mediation strategies likely reflect broader parenting styles, (2) adapt to developmental needs, and (3) high parental engagement in setting boundaries coupled with active dialogue supports autonomous adolescent development.

While this intervention reduces harmful content on the platform, deplatforming high-profile figures may prompt general users to migrate to alternative domains, where they can continue to engage with inappropriate communication. Utilizing web tracking data from 12,400 US Twitter users, we showed that after Twitter deplatformed Donald Trump, users had no immediate change in Twitter usage, but their engagement with the platform decreased slightly over time. Meanwhile, they demonstrated an increase in visiting alternative domains, although this spike gradually tapered off. This pattern varied across the population: Those frequently consuming left-leaning news immediately increased Twitter usage, whereas users visiting right-leaning outlets displayed a rise in using alternative social media, especially among heavy consumers of right-leaning news. These findings highlight the importance of investigating two separate processes of platform migration, non-use and new use, for appraising the impact of content moderation.",

In study 2, participants ( N = 188) screenshotted moments ( n = 551) when they experienced social presence through media in daily life. Participants reported the degree to which they had an established relationship or a social interaction with the target, connected with the content or target absent any pre-existing relationship, and felt a shared experience. Multilevel models found all pathways were associated with social presence and perceived change in connection. Although social interactions within established relationships constitute most experiences of belongingness and social presence, a sense of identification, parasocial relationships, and online communities are other meaningful pathways.",

We discuss our findings through the lens of moral disengagement theory, positing that supporting “freedom of expression” by way of disagreeing with content moderation and cancel culture may be a contemporary mechanism of morally disengaging with the harmful effects of racially insensitive speech.",

This study contributes to the literature on normative countermeasures and is the first to emphasize epistemic norms. Although misinformation is fundamentally an epistemic issue, scholars rarely refer to the rich epistemic literature for conceptualization and theory. The article also draws on focus theory and additional social literature to ensure a holistic framework. In addition to underscoring the role of epistemic norms, we suggest temporal proximity as a new factor to consider in focus theory-based measures. Ethical, empirical, and practical implications are discussed, emphasizing the need to control for countermeasures’ effect on true information sharing, which may threaten to suppress public discourse.",

          "abstract": "Gender inequality in Dutch politics remains persistent, with men dominating parliament. This study explores whether social media campaigning can help reduce this imbalance by examining how women and men differ in their online campaign strategies and how these differences affect likability on social media and electoral success. Drawing on the concept of trait-balancing, the study analyzes communication styles, issues, and sentiments in tweets from all parliamentary candidates using topic modeling. Results show that while men and women use similar communication styles, women benefit more from social and positive messaging, as well as participation in Q&amp;A interactions—factors that predict higher preference votes. However, these advantages do not offset systemic barriers. The findings suggest that structural factors, such as male-dominated candidate lists and informal party-selection rules, continue to sustain unequal gender representation. Thus, while social media offers opportunities, institutional reform remains essential for achieving gender equality in politics.",

We argue that existing methodologies for the analysis of visual content based on the notions of the metapicture are not yet fully equipped to account for the multi-layered, dynamic, and information-rich nature of audio-visual material. To fill this gap, we propose an approach aimed at ‘enriching’ the metapicture with textual and other components, alongside visual ones, to critically and systematically analyse video collections. First, we explain how researchers can enrich the metapicture by following three main principles: metadating, disaggregation and reaggregation, and readability. To illustrate our approach, we present a case study based on data donations to explore the content and gender representations TikTok users are exposed to. The study is structured in three steps, each introducing a type of enriched metapicture: the megapicture, scene-by-scene timeline, and video stack.",

Based on netnography of a Chinese idol group INTO1’s fans, we theorize that algorithms, a technological acceleration in audience data production, trigger two changes in public visibility encountered by fans: ephemeral visibility and externally visible production. They further accelerate the pace of fans’ data work, reflected in generating more data in less time, speeding up reaction, organizing data work by time intervals, and adding additional and indirect data work. While prior algorithm studies emphasize opacity, we highlight the important yet underexplored speed aspect of algorithms and its social impact on the time dimension.",

          "abstract": "Online communities are vast, complex spaces attracting diverse users, offering support and connection, but also spreading harmful content, including misogyny and extremism. Current research on online communities explores user roles and community structures within single communities. We extend this by examining engagement across multiple communities using over 4 million Reddit posts from 20 “subreddits” in the “manosphere”—an interconnected ecosystem of anti-feminist online communities. In summary, (1) users’ membership in the “manosphere” constitutes engagement with an array of communities, (2) we develop a measure of relative engagement (MRE) to show that users post unequally across their member communities, and (3) we explore the patterns of engagement across communities in the manosphere. We discuss how users navigate multiplicitous identity expressions across communities in the “manosphere” (as measured by MRE) and highlight the value of studying online community membership from a more holistic perspective for researchers, designers, and content moderators.",

          "abstract": "This article examines trust in science in England, focusing on variation across demographic and ideological groups. Using survey data from 11,173 respondents, we compare trust in two domains, medical doctors and scientists, to explore whether predictors operate similarly across these professional groups. We find higher education is associated with greater trust, while right-wing political orientation predicts lower trust. Religious affiliation also matters, with some faith groups reporting lower trust relative to the non-religious baseline. Gender differences emerge as well, particularly in trust in medical doctors. Respondents selecting ‘Prefer not to say’ on the religion item report significantly lower trust in both doctors and scientists, consistent with a broader privacy-motivated disclosure style. Our results highlight the importance of considering not just overall levels of trust in science, but variation across education, ideology, religion and gender, and they suggest that trust in doctors and trust in scientists, while related, are not interchangeable.",

          "authors": "Hannah Little, Juliet Dunstone",
          "abstract": "Storytelling is a growing topic in science communication research, highlighting the importance of learning from existing storytelling research from other disciplines. Storytelling research in cultural evolution has identified a number of cognitive biases in how we transmit information: stories are remembered and passed on more faithfully when they contain social and survival information, negative information or counterintuitive information. In this article, we review this cultural evolution literature and present findings from a set of interviews with science communication professionals. We asked science communicators about the potential benefits and risks that may come about when using cognitive biases within science communication storytelling. Science communicators reported already using some cognitive biases in their practice. Participants also expressed concerns about some tactics that might contradict objectives of science communication, threaten the integrity of science and science communication and risk the welfare of audiences. We map the benefits and risks reported using a thematic analysis.",
