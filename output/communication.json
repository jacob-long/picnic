          "authors": "Janise Brück, Charlotte Knorr, Lars Guenther",
          "abstract": "Copy-pasting is harmless in many contexts, but in the field of journalism, it has transformed into a widely debated practice known as churnalism. Churnalism, or copy-and-paste journalism, refers to a journalistic practice in which journalists (heavily) rely on external third-party materials, leading to news stories that are (verbatim) reproductions of this material. Although the practice is accused of having become particularly widespread in digital journalism, theoretical approaches have examined the complex relationship between journalism and its sources for decades. This theoretically broad and well-established discussion is why research on churnalism not only reflects different understandings but also contains mixed findings and evaluations. Consequently, this systematic review aims to provide an overview of the research state on churnalism by qualitatively examining 46 papers from the last 25 years (1999–2024). Our findings confirm that churnalism is a multifaceted practice, understood as the recycling of both journalistic and non-journalistic material. The literature contains different indicators of churnalism and has produced mixed results on its prevalence. Influencing factors include a lack of journalistic resources and the characteristics of (non-)journalistic organizations, demonstrating that churnalism entails both benefits and risks for journalists. Further research should focus on countermeasures and the potential effects of churnalism.",

          "authors": "Yotam Ophir, Dror Walter, Ayse Lokmanoglu, Nathan Walter",
          "abstract": "We use a large-scale mixed-method analysis to examine changes in misinformation research over three decades, with a particular attention to the role of media research. We examine a corpus of more than 7,000 academic studies, published between 1993 and 2022, analyzing changes in volume, topics, and methods used. Employing computational text and network analyses, we show how the meteoric rise in misinformation research in the 2010s was driven by a paradigm shift brought about by technological innovations and changes in the media and political landscape. We discuss the growing role communication scholars played in misinformation research, and offer recommendations for areas of strength in which communication research could further extend our understanding of the prevalence, nature, and effects of misinformation moving forward.",

          "authors": "Robert B Arundale",
          "abstract": "Social constructionists maintain that human beings constitute social worlds in communicating, yet have noted a paucity of research on the processes involved. One promising conceptual approach for advancing such research frames recurrent everyday interacting in small scale social worlds, over time and space, as the essential component in constituting large scale social worlds. Drawing on a recent theoretical model, as two participants engage social practices and meanings in everyday interacting, they communicatively constitute interpretings of one another’s utterances that are emergent properties defining their dyad as a small, complex social system. In turn, as participants engage recurrently in everyday interacting with a wider range of persons, over time and space, using specific sets of social practices and meanings, the interpretings they communicatively constitute are emergent properties that define specific groups as large, complex social systems.",

          "authors": "Susanne E Baumgartner",
          "abstract": "Public concerns about media effects are oftentimes fueled by anecdotal evidence and popular press reports pointing towards strong media effects. Interestingly, however, these public concerns are in contrast to findings from empirical studies that point towards minimal media effects. In the past decades, scholars have proposed several explanations for these minimal effects. This article adds to this, by proposing that one reason is that media effects stabilize after repeated exposure. If media effects stabilize, media effects occur only during effect-sensitive periods and might therefore only be empirically observable during these periods. This article delineates how well-established psychological theories as well as communication science theories are crucial in understanding the effects of repeated media exposure and how the conceptualization of media effects as stabilizing after repeated exposure has strong consequences for our empirical endeavors. The article discusses how to move the field forward, both empirically as well as theoretically.",

          "authors": "Jacob Hedges, Robert Sazdov, Andrew Johnston",
          "abstract": "As Virtual Reality (VR) technology continues to evolve, it presents both significant opportunities and challenges for audio designers, particularly in the context of music and storytelling approaches. This study explores the experiential and perceptual dimensions of VR audio through semi-structured interviews with leading VR audio expert practitioners. Building upon a previous investigation into the production challenges and techniques of VR audio, this research analyzes a distinct segment of the interview data from the same sample of participants, focusing on immersive storytelling and music integration in VR audio practice. The aim of the research is to uncover strategies and insights to help inform a practice language for this nascent field. Key findings highlight the transformative potential of VR audio in creating intimate and emotionally engaging narratives, emphasizing the importance of spatial design considerations, interactive sound approaches, and dynamic musical composition. Furthermore, the critical role of egocentric sound in enhancing immersion, the challenges of voiceover placement within spatial environments, and the potential of treating the sonic environment as an interactive character. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on VR audio practice, offering valuable perspectives for audio professionals and researchers aiming to push the boundaries of storytelling and immersive experiences in VR.",

          "abstract": "This meta-analysis reviews the findings from 49 studies (N = 23,336) examining the association between interparental conflict and children feeling caught between parents (also referred to as parent–child triangulation). The cumulative evidence indicates a moderate, meaningful relationship between interparental conflict and children feeling caught (r = .402, 95% confidence interval: .366, .437). On average, the positive association was stronger when researchers used: (a) samples that included both intact and post-divorce family members as opposed to only intact or post-divorce families; (b) samples that included young adult children as opposed to adolescent children; (c) cross-sectional as opposed to longitudinal research designs; (d) children’s reports of interparental conflict as opposed to parents’ reports or observational ratings; and (e) individuals as the unit of analysis as opposed to triads. Implications for developing a communication theory of feeling caught are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Purpose While existing research shows that employees’ use of collaboration technologies can be influenced by their social relationships, whether and how these effects change under organizational disruptions remains unclear. This study aims to narrow this gap by examining how telework transitions affect the impacts of social networks on collaboration technology use. Design/methodology/approach To examine our research model, we utilize the massive shift to telework prompted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in China. We collect multisource data, including digital trace data on collaboration technology use, roster-based survey data on social networks and demographic profile data, from 183 employees in an international technology company’s human resource (HR) department. Findings Our findings reveal that centrality in instrumental networks (represented by influence networks) and expressive networks (represented by friendship networks) positively affects collaboration technology use across the phases of before, during and after telework. Notably, influence centrality had a stronger effect on collaboration technology use during telework than it had before telework, and this enhanced effect persisted after employees returned to the office. In contrast, the impact of friendship centrality on collaboration technology use was weaker during telework than it was before telework, and this reduced effect gradually recovered after employees returned to the office. Moreover, we identified a consistently negative interaction effect between influence centrality and friendship centrality on collaboration technology use before, during and after telework. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by adopting a dynamic perspective to investigate how the effect of social networks on collaboration technology use evolves amid organizational disruptions, particularly the shift to telework. Practically, our findings offer actionable insights for organizations to promote technology-based collaboration and optimize technology application through informal relationships among employees during times of organizational disruption.",

          "abstract": "Purpose As environmental turbulence intensifies, big data analytics (BDA) has become a cornerstone for modern firms seeking to manage uncertainty and enhance organizational resilience. Drawing on the organizational capabilities-based theory and information technology (IT)-enabled organizational capabilities perspective, this study aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms and diverse pathways through which BDA capability influences organizational resilience. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining advanced analysis for composites–structural equation modeling (ADANCO-SEM) in Phase 1 and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) in Phase 2 to analyze survey data from 239 Chinese firms. Findings The ADANCO-SEM analysis revealed that BDA capability significantly enhances organizational resilience by fostering resource flexibility and coordination flexibility. The fsQCA analysis further elucidated how firms of different sizes and BDA experience configure their BDA capability and strategic flexibility to achieve proactive and reactive resilience. These findings validate and extend the results of the ADANCO-SEM analysis. Originality/value This study makes a valuable contribution to Information systems (IS) research by theoretically and empirically uncovering the mechanism through which BDA capability influences organizational resilience.",

          "authors": "Veronika Šlapáková Losová, Marko Orel",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study proposes how to empirically measure and explain virtual reality’s (VR) impact on meeting engagement compared to traditional video conferencing through a novel methodological framework grounded in social presence theory, combining social network analysis with conversation analysis to address the lack of empirical evidence on VR’s effectiveness in authentic workplace settings. Design/methodology/approach Through a 16-week longitudinal experiment in a multinational company, we analyzed eight retrospective meetings to compare engagement patterns across platforms. The framework operationalizes engagement through group cohesion metrics and content characteristics, employing both quantitative network analysis and qualitative content analysis of interaction patterns. Findings Results suggest that VR meetings generate higher engagement levels through three key mechanisms: enhanced network density, more balanced participation patterns, and improved social presence behaviors. The most striking finding reveals VR’s capacity to enhance peripheral participant engagement, demonstrated by an increase in degree prestige for least active participants. Additionally, while VR meetings exhibited lower task-orientation, they fostered more dynamic and inclusive interactions, challenging traditional assumptions about meeting efficiency as a function of task-orientation. Originality/value The study presents empirical evidence of VR’s impact on meeting engagement in authentic workplace settings through an innovative methodological framework. The integration of social network analysis with conversation analysis establishes a non-intrusive method for evaluating meeting effectiveness, capturing both structural and qualitative aspects of engagement. These findings advance our understanding of how VR technology transforms interaction dynamics, suggesting a paradigm shift in virtual collaboration practices.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Based on flow theory, this research aims to explore how posting about different purchases (“what they did” vs “what they have”) affects the engagement of others in the consumer’s social network. Design/methodology/approach In study 1, the experimental design and survey methods are used to collect data. Study 2 analyzed UGC posted to Sina Weibo, which is a popular social media platform in China, testing the study’s proposed model with negative binomial regression analysis. Findings Study 1 indicates that posting UGC related to “what I did” (vs “what I have”) will increase the engagement of others in a consumer’s network, and the flow experience underlies this effect. The results of study 2 replicate the findings of study 1 and show that the UGC related to “what I did” is more likely to increase the shares and comments of others in a consumer’s network. Originality/value This work makes theoretical contributions to both social media and customer engagement research. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flow experience can be used to explain the role of UGC in eliciting the engagement of receivers to the posts.",

          "authors": "Dominique Kelly, Jacquelyn Burkell",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines how teens perceive and respond to privacy-undermining design strategies – or “privacy dark patterns” – on social networking sites (SNSs). Specifically, we sought to ascertain whether teens can identify privacy dark patterns on social media and to determine how teens respond to these patterns, including documenting any strategies they use to resist them. Design/methodology/approach We conducted four virtual focus groups with Canadian teens aged 13 to 17. In breakout rooms, participants guided a research assistant’s actions while the assistant set up a social networking site account. Participants were instructed to make the account as private as possible and consider how the site’s design could influence their choices. Participants then returned to the main Zoom session and discussed the privacy dark patterns they identified and their strategies for resistance. Findings Our results show that teens can identify a wide range of privacy dark patterns and strategies for resistance when instructed to set up a private social media account and look for design strategies that could influence their behavior. However, teens reported low awareness of how interface design could impact their privacy choices before participating in the study. Teens also failed to identify privacy dark patterns that operated by increasing the salience of certain visual elements. Practical implications Educators should ask teens to consider how social media design influences their privacy choices through hands-on activities. However, the effects of these exercises might not persist during teens’ everyday social media use. Originality/value Little research has specifically investigated how teens respond to dark patterns.",

Our study takes critical steps into this era by integrating theory-guided artificial neural networks with eye movements to understand how people learn science concepts from dynamic multimedia. Essential to our theory-guided machine learning approach is a cognitive conceptualization of time as the dynamic interdependence between past and new information that guides how multimedia is attended to and understood. We tracked the eye movements of 197 children as they watched an educational video. We trained two neural network architectures differing in theory guidance to predict learning outcomes using eye movements. The theory-guided architecture, which considered the temporal interdependence of information, yielded more accurate out-of-sample predictions. Our work advances the use of theory-guided machine learning and the development of systems that monitor real-time learning.",

          "authors": "W. Q. Elaine Perunovic, Emily A. Vogels, Andrew Molinsky, Clinton Holmes",
          "abstract": "This research examines the paradoxical effects of nonnative speakers’ language fluency on how they are perceived by native speakers, focusing on likability and competence. Although poor fluency has been shown to shield nonnative speakers from negative evaluations of culturally inappropriate behavior, our findings indicate that this effect is confined to likability and does not extend to competence. Specifically, our results show that Russian professionals with lower English fluency were rated as more likable (Studies 1 and 2) but less competent (Study 2). Mediation analyses (Study 2) revealed that perception of effort and felt sympathy, rather than lack of cultural knowledge or intentional rudeness, mediated likability ratings, demonstrating the “effort-sympathy heuristic,” where poor fluency enhances likability by triggering greater sympathy and perceived effort. Overall, these findings highlight the dual-edged nature of language fluency in professional and social contexts, providing insights into how perceptions of nonnative speakers shape interpersonal and professional evaluations.",

          "authors": "Kokil Jaidka",
          "abstract": "Social-media–based protests often unfold across multiple, semi-autonomous communities that cooperate, compete, and overlap, yet most research still treats “the movement” as a single unit. I introduce the 3R framework—Rhetoric, Reach, Reinforcement—to trace how collective-identity messages are produced, circulated, and amplified among these communities. The study analyzed a multilingual corpus of 800,000 Facebook posts (200,000 textual posts) spanning three months, using unsupervised topic modeling, multiple linear regression, and social-network analysis. Results show systematic heterogeneity: communal organizations react most intensely to posts criticizing the government, signaling identity-affirming outrage. Journalistic pages function as “bridge nodes,” injecting new topics into the network and diffusing them widely, thereby disrupting potential echo chambers. High-reach, high-rhetoric messages are disproportionately reinforced through repeated sharing and cross-posting, magnifying their visibility well beyond the originating community. This study maps how rhetoric, reach, and reinforcement interact across organizational boundaries, offering a unified theoretical and empirical approach to understanding how online protest movements construct, contest, and sustain collective identities.",

          "authors": "Megan A. Vendemia",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Popular online dating platforms feature self-authored profiles in which users can indicate their relational goals and interests. The ability to easily modify self-generated information raises questions about whether online daters are who they say they are offline. Informed by warranting theory, this experiment examined how online daters’ relational motivations and connections to social networks affect viewers’ authenticity judgments and interpersonal impressions. Results revealed that romantic relationship motives heightened viewers’ anticipated future interaction beliefs, which in turn, bolstered online daters’ perceived authenticity, trustworthiness, and goodwill. Results also demonstrated that connections to online daters’ broader social networks reduced relational uncertainty. Implications for warranting theory and online daters’ profile construction are discussed.",

          "abstract": "In today’s evolving world, discourse functions as a powerful tool that shapes our perceptions and attitudes towards different social groups. The discourse surrounding intersex individuals in heteronormative societies like Quetta not only reflects but also disseminates their discrimination and marginalization. In this study, the researcher intended to analyze the impacts of derogatory discourse on both the cognition and social relationships of intersex individuals. By drawing upon ‘socio-cognitive theory’ proposed by Van Dijk (2015), and employing ‘snow-ball’ sampling technique, the researcher conducted 11 interviews with intersex individuals who were the residents of Quetta, Baluchistan. Considering the cognitive impacts of derogatory discourse, the data revealed that intersex individuals suffered from ‘internalized inferiority’, ‘over-thinking’, and so forth; while, in terms of social relationships, they experienced strained relationships in workplace dynamics, and educational settings, etc. Moreover, the researcher not only emphasized the use of inclusive discourse with intersex individuals but also presented some recommendations for policy-makers in order to bring relief in their lives.",

          "abstract": "Quantitative research illustrates that people have a range of motives for engaging in online dating. Although this work has yielded important insights, the experiences of participants from marginalized backgrounds are sometimes obscured or omitted in quantitative research. Accordingly, we conducted a meta-synthesis of 21 qualitative studies that focus on people’s motives for engaging in online dating. Some of these studies focused on people who identified as sexual minorities or with other groups that are underrepresented in the quantitative literature. We used thematic analysis to synthesize the qualitative findings reported across the 21 studies. Results illustrated that people’s motives for engaging in online dating can be characterized by eight overarching themes. These motives replicate and broaden the pool of motives that have been documented in the quantitative literature. Findings also revealed sociodemographic variation in the motives participants reported. For example, sexual minority participants were more likely than heterosexual participants to report that they use online dating to access specific populations of prospective partners. We draw from these findings to make several conceptual and methodological recommendations for future research focusing on online dating motives.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the strategic use of Facebook in the 2019 European Parliament elections, challenging the traditional view of these elections as “second-order” national elections. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset, the research analyzes campaign materials from all EU member states, focusing on the thematic and visual strategies employed by political parties on Facebook. The findings reveal that digital visibility, measured by the volume of posts, is a stronger predictor of electoral success than thematic coherence or ideological messaging. The study integrates theories of hybrid media systems, symbolic politics, and cultural performance to argue that Facebook functions not merely as a communication tool but as a symbolic arena where legitimacy is performed and contested. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of how social media platforms are reshaping the dynamics of European electoral politics.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how social media users emotionally respond to Israeli politicians’ messages during crises based on political alignment and crisis type. With Israel’s frequent civic and military crises, the case study in this article aims to offer unique insights to scholars, practitioners, and the public invested in the intersection of online media, emotions, and crisis. To this end, we built a dataset of Facebook posts (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 25,000) published by all active right, left, and center members of the Israeli parliament and government over a period of one year (November 2022–November 2023). We ensured that the dataset includes both routine and crisis periods, particularly the judicial reform unrest (civic crisis) and the Hamas–Israel war following the October 7 attack (military crisis). Our statistical analysis indicated two major trends in the dataset: (a) during the military crisis, emotional markers that were previously considered to correlate and cluster (sad and angry) are not merely different, as they stand in opposition to one another; (b) crisis periods, especially military, invite use of “edge” reactions, and see a significant increase in negative emotions, whereas routine times prompt more neutral or positive reactions. Reading the findings through the combination of affordances theory, mediatization theory, and the “template for emotions” concept, we suggest that social media may amplify negative reactions beyond politicians’ influence, as the limited emotional spectrum offered on platforms might steer users to certain emotive responses, affecting risk management in crises. These insights call for decision-makers to consider the implications of emotional appeals and incentives on social media, especially during crises, to foster safer democratic public discourse.",

          "authors": "Mariek M. P. Vanden Abeele, Trine Syvertsen",
          "abstract": "Mobile connectivity fosters a 24/7 lifestyle that both benefits and burdens individuals. Digital well-being has emerged as a concept describing how persons balance these benefits and burdens. The concept of digital disconnection describes how people set limits to connectivity. Both concepts are currently studied in two fields of research, each dominated by different strands of theories. One strand is developing in mobile media studies: It uses the media-centric lens of affordances theory to explain how mobile media enable and constrain human action. The other is developing into its own field of “disconnection studies,” and draws on studies of media resistance to explain how the phenomenon of disconnection is inherently tied to the morality of what it means to lead a good (media) life in an increasingly digitized—yet unequal—society. This article offers a theoretical contribution at the intersection of both fields: Following an exploration of what “lack of theory” means in mobile communication and media studies, we argue that theoretical development fruitfully takes place through explorations of overlapping and complementary theoretical notions from adjacent fields. Mobile media and digital disconnection scholars thus benefit from extending a mutual invitation. To illustrate our argument, we formulate five axioms that compromise mobile media affordances with morality, to prepare mobile media studies for a future beyond mobile media.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the dynamics of large-scale online attacks against feminists, with a focus on the roles of surveillance and parasitic behaviour in these practices. Drawing on a broader study of online hate targeting feminists in Spain, the article focuses on cases where attacks originated from profiles with substantial social media followings. The analysis builds on ethnographic fieldwork, including 26 case studies of online violence against feminists and 10 in-depth interviews with targeted women. The article highlights the organized and persistent nature of online harassment, orchestrated through online forums or by influential anti-feminist social media profiles. These profiles attack targets to create viral content and attract followers, while monetizing the harassment. By generating continuous content, they perpetuate the abuse while avoiding direct incitement, allowing them to evade responsibility for the harm they cause. The lack of platform intervention exacerbates the issue, contributing to a sense of constant surveillance for targets.",

This study investigates the relationship between speed of commenting and incivility, using a dataset of 38 million comments from The Guardian Online. We hypothesise that quicker responses are more likely to be uncivil and that incivility propagates through a contagion effect. Our analysis reveals that blocked comments, used as a proxy for incivility, are posted significantly faster than visible comments, for both parent and child comments. In addition, we find that the presence of blocked comments increases the likelihood of subsequent blocked comments, with decreasing time intervals between them. These findings suggest that incivility is associated with impulsive, fast thinking, while civil discourse will sometimes require slower, more deliberate practices. Our results have implications for designing online platforms to foster healthier and more productive discussions by encouraging deliberative time before readers post.",

          "abstract": "Digital media profoundly shape modern life, offering benefits while also prompting concerns that lead many to seek disconnection. This study investigates r/NoSurf , a large online community paradoxically dedicated to digital disconnection. Through computational and qualitative analysis of discussions from over 26,000 active members, we study users’ complex and often ambivalent relationships with technology and their pursuit of digital well-being. The findings show that people see digital technology as both an escape and a source of distress. Motivated by desires to mitigate perceived negative impacts like distraction and diminished well-being, and faced with the difficulty of full withdrawal, members actively develop and share a sophisticated repertoire of strategies to manage their digital technology use. This research characterizes digital disconnection not as mere avoidance, but as a dynamic, skillful, and individually negotiated practice, or literacy, aimed at fostering well-being and intentionality in the face of pervasive connectivity.",

          "abstract": "Virtual and augmented reality are, alongside AI, some of the most feted technologies of the 2020s. However, unlike AI it remains unclear whether there is a distinct political economy of VR/AR. This article argues—in a speculative mode—that there is by drawing together political economy and medium theory. I contend that the economic significance of VR/AR is an operation of real-time synchronization , in which the body, the real world, and virtual space are brought into spatial-temporal coordination. I show this via an analysis of the operation of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Synchronization enables a novel form of immanentization: the rendering of the body immanent to the digital. Immanentization enables a stacking of spatialities: the layering of virtual worlds—which can be interacted with in the same way as the real world—on top of the real world, without obscuring it. This presents novel possibilities for accelerating production and circulation processes.",

Navigation apps like Google Maps do not merely facilitate wayfinding; they actively shape spatial experiences, decision-making, and social interactions. Using a mixed-methods approach, we combined real-time activity tracking via the “MapRecorder” tool with qualitative interviews to analyze how users engage with Google Maps. Our findings reveal that navigation tools function as interfaces of spatial production, social connection, and data extraction, embedding themselves in everyday media repertoires. We identify four key usage patterns—search, place, directions, and map view manipulation—demonstrating that navigation is increasingly entangled with broader digital habits. In addition, the data suggested a paradoxical relationship between user convenience and concerns over dataveillance, contributing to debates on privacy resignation and the platformization of spatial control. By foregrounding these tensions, our study extends discussions on the deep mediatization of space, the role of geomedia in shaping mobility, and the sociotechnical power of digital navigation infrastructures.",

          "abstract": "Although previous work has identified empathy as a consistent correlate of romantic relationship satisfaction, the dyadic nuances of this association remain unclear. Using data drawn from a parent project that involved a cross‐sectional online survey among US community couples with a history of alcohol‐related intimate partner aggression, the present study ( N = 67 mixed‐sex couples; M age = 39.27; 63% married) examined discrepancies between men's and women's reports of their own empathy (i.e., self‐perceptions of empathy), compared to men and women's perceptions of their partners' empathy (i.e., partner‐perceptions of empathy), and how such discrepancies may be linked with both partners' relationship satisfaction. Results of Actor‐Partner Interdependence Models confirmed the hypothesis that there would be more positive associations between partner‐perceptions of empathy, as compared to self‐perceptions of empathy, and relationship satisfaction. Moreover, men and women were more satisfied with their relationships when they rated their partners' empathy higher than what would be expected based on partners' self‐perceptions. These results underscore that partner‐perceptions of empathy, especially when positively skewed, may be more relevant to relationship satisfaction than self‐perceptions.",

          "authors": "Sanna Spišák",
          "abstract": "This article examines how Finnish young people (ages 16–19) navigate digital intimacy through voice, privacy, and platform use. Drawing on reflexive thematic analysis of asynchronous focus group discussions conducted on Discord, the study explores how participants manage exposure and vulnerability in digital spaces through selective boundary work. Voice, in particular, emerges as a key marker of intimacy and privacy: a conduit for affective connection, yet also a site of corporeal risk. The study proposes a relational framework, where privacy, intimacy, and voice are co-constitutive and introduces the concept of ‘intimacy architectures’ to describe how young people calibrate access and proximity across platforms. Findings show that youth strategically favour ephemeral, history-free communication tools, avoid sharing phone numbers, and resist voice-based interaction depending on cultural and linguistic context. These practices illustrate a nuanced negotiation of digital embodiment, identity, and control. The study contributes to emerging scholarship on sonic intimacy and offers new insights into youth digital culture in a datafied society.",

          "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis of language-specific random samples of YouTube videos, focusing on English, Spanish, Hindi, and Russian. We produce a large random sample, retrieve metadata, calibrate and deploy language-detection software, and extract four high-confidence language samples. Through an analysis of upload dates, popularity, duration, and category metadata, we highlight patterns and anomalies among our samples. For example, English YouTube has the smallest proportion of videos categorized as “News &amp; Politics,” and Spanish videos have a longer median duration. The most salient contrast, however, is between Hindi YouTube and the other three languages. Hindi videos are much shorter and much newer, with sharp growth since 2020 and more than half of the sample uploaded in 2023 alone. The Hindi sample also exhibits a different pattern of liking, with the lowest percentage of videos with just zero or one like even while it has the highest percentage of videos with just zero or one view. These findings may help to quantify the migration of India’s short-form video culture, based around TikTok, to YouTube when TikTok was banned in the country in 2020. This study underscores the necessity of multilingual and culturally specific approaches to platform research by drawing attention to the heterogeneity of YouTube. We propose this method as a starting point to understand linguistic communities on YouTube, surfacing trends and exceptions while providing cues for more content-focused study.",

          "authors": "Ziye Zang",
          "abstract": "This study conducts visual content and framing analysis to compare the images of Chinese and US leaders in China Pictorial ( N = 153). Drawing from the images that juxtaposed US and Chinese leaders, the author aims to examine how the ‘fantasy’ of US–China power dynamics is visually crafted by Chinese party-controlled media across three Chinese political eras, spanning from 1950 to 2021. In Mao’s era, China was visualized as resisting US dominance; China appeared to be making advances in global politics in Deng’s era; and under Xi, China was depicted as a courteous great power distinct from the US. These shifting fantasy themes coalesce to craft a rhetorical vision of China as a humble great power challenging and potentially eclipsing US hegemony. This article advances visual political communication by illustrating China’s constructed state power through media, challenging US-centric narratives and tracing the historical shifts in perceived Sino–US power dynamics.",
