          "authors": "Christel W van Eck, Michael Hameleers, Emma van der Goot",
          "abstract": "The concept of the “fake expert” has been used as a label to delegitimize established expertise but also refers to experts that are invoked to support misinformation claims. This study examines how “fake experts” and their expertise are constructed in misinformation. Analyzing fact-checked misinformation on climate change and COVID-19, we investigate how sources are framed as experts (RQ1), how their expertise is linked to misinformation (RQ2), and to what extent these references are misleading or inaccurate (RQ3). Our findings show that expertise in misinformation is shaped more by content and communicative context than by credentials alone. Misinformation employs rhetorical strategies such as selective quoting and epistemic trespassing to create credibility. We propose a framework for identifying “illegitimate” expertise in misinformation, integrating content- and actor-based indicators. This framework offers a structured approach for analyzing how misinformation manipulates expert credibility and provides a foundation for future empirical research.",

          "abstract": "People prefer attitude-consistent information over attitude-inconsistent information (congeniality bias). Connecting theory on the processing of stories to selective exposure theory, we assumed that the congeniality bias is reduced or even nullified when it comes to fictional messages. Across two experiments examining two different, polarizing topics (refugees, N1 = 1,326; theistic faith, N2 = 1,316) a highly consistent pattern of results could be observed: Participants were more willing to read a narrative message (exposure preference) in which the story events were in line with their attitudes rather than a message contrasting attitudes. This congeniality bias was unaffected by the fictionality of the information (i.e., whether the events were introduced as a fictional short story or a non-fictional journalistic reportage). Interestingly, the congeniality bias emerged for positive characterizations of refugees or theistic faith but not for negative characterizations. Implications regarding the role of fictionality and congeniality in selective exposure are discussed.",

          "authors": "Yang Liu, Yuan Chen, Yuchen Xu",
          "abstract": "Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally transformed workplace dynamics, compelling organizations to transition employees to work from home abruptly. Since corporate online forums played an important role as an online communication channel during the shift, this paper aimed to investigate the effect of enforced working from home (WFH) on employee engagement behaviors in such forums during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach Leveraging the Wuhan lockdown as a natural experiment, this study employed a year-to-year difference-in-differences approach to analyze a unique panel dataset from a large company. Findings We found that enforced WFH increased passive engagement but significantly reduced active contributions. We also found an interesting recovery effect: while the drop in contributions subsided within a month of adaptation, elevated login and free-riding behaviors persisted. Further heterogeneity analyses uncovered critical disparities: male employees contributed less, senior employees participated less in low-cost activities, while employees under a stricter containment policy exhibited a smaller decrease in contributions. Practical implications Our findings provide insights for organizations to design equitable engagement incentives, recalibrate forum management strategies, and prioritize mental health support in future WFH policies. Our results also inform policymakers on tailoring containment measures to mitigate unintended workforce online disengagement. Originality/value Our study advances WFH research by analyzing enforced remote work’s impact on corporate forum engagement during COVID-19. It also enriches pandemic-related literature by incorporating crisis-specific factors and highlighting recovery patterns and policy-driven heterogeneity.",

          "authors": "Forrest V. Morgeson, Yufei Zhang, Pratyush Nidhi Sharma, G. Tomas M. Hult, Sunil Mithas",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates how firms’ social media strategies, including firm-initiated owned social media (OSM) and customer-generated earned social media (ESM) content, affect customer perceptions of quality, value and satisfaction. By analyzing sentiment across millions of social media posts and linking them to customer mindset data, we aim to provide insights for optimizing social media engagement and enhancing customer outcomes. Design/methodology/approach We analyze a large multi-year sample, combining over 250,000 customer survey responses and 3.5 million social media posts from 167 US consumer goods companies. Using a novel positive valence surplus (PVS) metric, we assess the impact of social media sentiment and engagement on customer perceptions of quality, value and satisfaction across posts from both firms and consumers on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter). Findings Both PVS and engagement positively affect customer perceptions for ESM posts, influencing satisfaction. For OSM posts, PVS is negatively related to user engagement, but engagement still improves quality perceptions. Overly positive OSM content leads to a backfire effect, particularly on Facebook, where it is more detrimental than on X. Originality/value This research utilizes PVS to measure the sentiment balance of social media content, which is a novel approach for assessing firm-initiated and customer-generated posts. Our unique dataset allows us to analyze the distinct impacts of OSM and ESM content on customer perceptions across two major social media platforms (Facebook and X).

          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores the antecedents of viewers' support provision in the live streaming context. Design/methodology/approach An online survey with 316 valid responses was conducted to test our research model. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to assess the measurement and structural models. Findings The results show that functional congruity and self-congruity promote viewer support provision through establishing psychological contracts. Specifically, the transactional contract has a stronger effect on financial support provision, whereas the relational contract has a stronger effect on emotional support provision. Practical implications The findings encourage streamers and platforms to strategically engage with viewers who share a similar image with the streamer and to facilitate psychological contracts with them. Originality/value First, this study emphasizes the importance of both functional congruity and self-congruity in motivating viewer support provision. Second, it identifies psychological contracts as mediators to explain how dual congruity works. Third, this study examines the asymmetric effects of transactional and relational contracts on viewer financial support and emotional support provision.",

          "authors": "Christian Zeiß, Lisa Straub, Maximilian Greiner, Marcel Neis, Nicolas Neis, Axel Winkelmann, Ulrike Lechner",
          "abstract": "Purpose To promote acceptance of blockchain-based investment options and enhance confidence for new investors, the market must become more comprehensible and accessible to the broad masses. This requires transparency to build trust in web-based intermediaries, particularly given the multitude of websites that often advertise unrealistic returns in the crypto sector. Consequently, intermediaries within the decentralized finance ecosystem need to be clearly identified and categorized to facilitate mass-market adoption. Design/methodology/approach We employ a six-iteration taxonomy approach, establishing a data foundation through literature reviews, expert interviews and document analysis of 50 intermediaries. Archetypes are derived using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Finally, a survey is conducted to evaluate the taxonomy and the archetypes. Findings The taxonomy encompasses three meta-characteristics (functionality, architecture, security) and 63 characteristics. Furthermore, the research findings reveal six archetypes of blockchain-based investment intermediaries, demonstrating significant discrepancies between them, particularly in terms of financial features and governance structures. Given the complexity of crypto intermediary platforms for novice users, the findings underscore the need to implement technology-based and institutional-based trust mechanisms, improve risk assessment and enable informed decision-making. Originality/value By increasing market transparency and fostering trust, this study contributes to the acceptance and adoption of blockchain-based financial intermediaries, drawing on the diffusion of innovation theory. The proposed taxonomy, particularly its dimensions, specifically addresses the requirements of both technology-based and institution-based trust, which are critical for crypto investments. Moreover, the findings emphasize the importance of educational resources and communicated trust features in strengthening user confidence and facilitating broader market participation.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Due to ChatGPT’s relative novelty, the determinants and consequences of trust in it remain largely unexplored, especially in the field of higher education. This research investigates how perceptions of AI can foster university students’ trust in ChatGPT, which in turn leads to their continuance and sharing intentions. Cross-cultural differences are also analyzed to provide culturally relevant insights. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach was employed. In the qualitative phase (Study 1), we interviewed 30 university students and used an inductive methodology to analyze the data. In the follow-up quantitative studies, the hypotheses were examined using a sample of 249 students from China (Study 2) and 204 students from the United States (Study 3). Findings Qualitative results suggest that perceived benefits (convenience, usefulness and controllability) and perceived risks (inflexibility, privacy invasion and overreliance) are identified as antecedents of learners’ trust in ChatGPT. Quantitative results reveal that factors including convenience, usefulness and overreliance on AI positively influence learners’ trust in ChatGPT. Furthermore, trust positively affects learners’ continuance intention and sharing intention. These findings are consistent across the Chinese and American samples. However, inflexibility significantly influences trust among Chinese learners but not among American learners. Additionally, invasion of privacy negatively affects trust in ChatGPT only for the US sample, suggesting cultural divergence in trust formation between these two countries. Originality/value We shed light on the antecedents and consequences of trust in ChatGPT within higher education settings, especially across different cultures. This research endeavor also promotes the integration of ChatGPT for learning activities to maximize the utility of this technology.",

          "abstract": "Media messages shape our knowledge about the world, but measuring individual exposure and attention remains challenging. Emerging media offer a solution to studying message reception in simulated real-world environments, which may soon become the actual media environments in which we encounter messages. Here, we utilized virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking to investigate message processing in a realistic virtual city environment populated with billboards. We introduced an inception-style manipulation where billboards initially overlooked by participants were covertly reintroduced based on real-time gaze tracking. Our findings show this algorithmic manipulation, undetected by participants, significantly boosted message memory retention for the targeted messages. This study reveals a path of media influence, demonstrating how undetected algorithmic manipulations can shape individual and collective memory. The findings carry practical and theoretical implications for diverse communication contexts, from advertising and public health to political messaging in the emerging metaverse ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "The increasing reliance on digital technologies in health care brings unique privacy risks to individual users. Guided by the framework of contextual integrity (CI), this study examined how privacy norms compare across four mobile health technological contexts: telehealth, online patient portals, mobile health applications, and wearable devices. Analysis of 34 semi-structured interviews revealed context-specific actors, information types, and transmission principles, and identified instances that represent points of departure from entrenched privacy norms. In addition, we found that people use privacy heuristics—evoked by CI parameters—to guide their privacy evaluations. Findings theoretically contribute to CI by identifying parameters in the novel context of mobile health and by proposing privacy heuristics as the explanatory mechanism underlying the evaluation of privacy norms. Practically, findings can inform more user-centered mobile health design and communication practices.",

          "authors": "Despoina Chalyvidou, Andrea Weber",
          "abstract": "The German gender star is a form of gender inclusive language that uses an asterisk to merge masculine and feminine role noun endings (e.g., Choreograf*in, ‘ choreographer inclusive ’). It was created to counter the male bias of masculine forms intended as generic and to represent all genders more inclusively. This study examined how role nouns with the gender star are processed in written and spoken German using a semantic priming paradigm. In Experiment 1, German participants were primed with masculine 1 ( Choreograf ), feminine ( Choreografin ), and star noun forms ( Choreograf*in ) in printed form, before identifying the gender of a following pronoun as feminine ( sie, ‘ she’) or masculine ( er, ‘ he’). Experiment 2 presented the same prime forms auditorily with the star form realized as a glottal stop ( Choreografʔin ), produced by either a conventionally feminine-sounding or masculine-sounding voice. Congruency between prime and target gender for masculine noun forms ( Choreograf–er ) facilitated response times in both experiments and for feminine noun forms ( Choreografin–sie ) in Experiment 2. Response times for the masculine and feminine pronouns following the inclusive prime forms did not differ significantly in either experiment, indicating that these forms can be associated with both female and male referents in reading and listening, with the gender of the voice having no further effect on processing.",

          "abstract": "Ultimatums are a consequential yet underexamined conflict strategy. While often perceived as a distributive tactic, they can also function as pivotal moments of boundary-setting and relational transformation. Despite their presence in compliance-gaining, negotiation, and reconciliation literature, little is known about how ultimatums operate in serial arguments within close relationships. Thus, we engaged the serial argument process model to (1) examine the conditions that contribute to the use of ultimatums in serial arguments, (2) explore the associations between ultimatums and relationship outcomes, and (3) compare the use of ultimatums in romantic relationships and friendships. Using multi-group path analyses, we found that although ultimatums may be employed in both dating and friendship contexts, their usage and associated outcomes are related to factors such as conflict goals, perceived resolvability, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of ultimatum use. These findings have implications for conflict theory and provide guidance for conflict resolution within close relationships.",

Guided by the family systems theory, conflict between parents may not only impact their relationship but also influences child’s development. While previous research has established links between interparental conflict and children’s outcomes, fewer studies have examined how changes in conflict over time may affect children’s development. Using three waves of data from a national and longitudinal dataset, Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), this study investigated changes in mothers’ and fathers’ reports of interparental conflict and how these changes relate to children’s socioemotional skills at the third wave, when they are 4-year-old. Results from multilevel growth curve models indicate a significant decrease in fathers’ reports of conflict frequency, while a significant increase in mothers’ reports of conflict. Furthermore, an increase in mother-reported conflict frequency was associated with lower socioemotional skills in children at age 4. Findings highlight the importance of examining couple relationships from a dynamic perspective.",

          "authors": "Aqsa Farooq, Adam Rutland, Luke McGuire",
          "abstract": "Adolescents’ online habits may contribute to the spread of misinformation due to their preference for trusted peers as sources of information over credible sources. This propensity can also make adolescents a population more vulnerable to misinformation, particularly during crises when misinformation levels surge. In situations of uncertainty and risk, such as during public health crises, trust plays an important and influential role. This study explored whether adolescents’ trust in an individual sharing misinformation, and trust in their misinformation about Covid-19, differed based on adolescents’ perceived risk of harm from Covid-19 (risk vs reduced risk) and the age of the misinformer (peer vs adult). When shown misinformation about a hypothetical Covid-19 variant, adolescents (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 131; 14–17 years old) trusted a misinformer more when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents were also asked to provide open-ended justifications for their trust evaluations which were analysed in accordance with the elaboration likelihood model. We found that adolescents who reported to more regularly scrutinising information were more likely to consider information and source credibility when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents who reported engaging in less information-scrutinising behaviours were more likely to consider their relationship with the misinformer when the misinformer was a peer. These findings suggest how the elaboration likelihood model can play an important role in risk communication amongst adolescents and emphasise the need for educating adolescents about the importance of scrutinising information, particularly during crises.",

          "authors": "Anna Smoliarova",
          "abstract": "Effective government communication is crucial for promoting inclusive governance, especially in increasingly diverse societies. However, a significant gap remains in engaging residents with migration backgrounds, often leaving these communities underinformed and underserved in public discourse. This shortfall becomes especially critical during crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. Among transnational migrants in various countries, social networks were the main sources of information about Covid-19. Social media influencers with migration backgrounds became crucial transmitters of governmental information to their audiences. For instance, in 2020, Russian-speaking female bloggers in almost 40 countries started a global discussion about the Covid-19 outbreak on Instagram. This article presents the results of a content analysis of 113 Instagram posts by 58 Russian-speaking female influencers in 37 countries during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. It demonstrates that influencers acted as primary information sources. Instead of relying on news media, they spread information from governmental sources to audiences within their countries of residence and globally. In this article, I highlight how strategic use of social media can bridge the communication divide, ensuring that residents with migration backgrounds integrate better into the public information ecosystem while balancing public service with ethical governance",

          "abstract": "Longitudinal research on the characteristics and dynamics of parental mediation strategies and their associations with adolescents’ mental health and autonomy is scarce. Using three-wave panel data from 717 Swiss adolescents (collected between spring 2018 and autumn 2020), we applied Latent Transition Analysis to identify distinct parental mediation classes and adolescents’ transitioning patterns, resulting in the: Enforcing &amp; Engaged Approach; Hands-off Approach ; and Moderate Approach , showing fluctuation over time. Regression analysis revealed no significant associations between the three classes and mental health; however, adolescents in the Moderate Approach class reported lower perceived autonomy compared to those in the Enforcing &amp; Engaged Approach class. These findings highlight that (1) mediation strategies likely reflect broader parenting styles, (2) adapt to developmental needs, and (3) high parental engagement in setting boundaries coupled with active dialogue supports autonomous adolescent development. This insight can guide caregivers, healthcare, and policy development.",

          "abstract": "Social media has long facilitated self-presentation, but the tension between authenticity and performativity remains. BeReal, launched in 2020, promised a more ‘authentic’ experience by requiring users to share unedited, real-time images. This study examines the platform’s perceived value, its initial appeal, and subsequent decline in user engagement. Through a large-scale qualitative survey ( N = 333), we present motivations for (dis)engagement, revealing a trajectory of enthusiasm, scepticism, and eventual disinterest. Participants valued BeReal for fostering social connection and serving as a digital memory archive. However, growing cynicism about authenticity – along with increasing performative behaviours and feature creep – diminished its appeal. Applying Ng’s post-adoption model we map users’ transition from adoption to discontinuance, situating BeReal’s decline within broader trends of social media fatigue. Our findings contribute to debates on ethical social media design, performative authenticity and user disengagement, providing insight into the ephemeral nature of digital platforms.",

          "abstract": "Social media users’ preferences for various content moderation interventions have been widely studied, but the implicit beliefs that connect to these preferences are less understood. Using a nationally representative survey data set, we investigate how end-users’ attitudes toward moderating harmful speech online relate to their offline racial attitudes. We find that racially conservative beliefs are significantly positively related to participants indicating a distaste for concepts related to content moderation and cancel culture, suggesting that racial conservatism may be a crucial factor to consider in assessing these attitudes. We discuss our findings through the lens of moral disengagement theory, positing that supporting “freedom of expression” by way of disagreeing with content moderation and cancel culture may be a contemporary mechanism of morally disengaging with the harmful effects of racially insensitive speech.",

          "abstract": "This study examined people’s motives, perceived affordances, and gratifications of using BeReal, a photo-sharing mobile social media app. Through an online survey of 146 English-speaking BeReal users, the study applied the affordance framework and uses and gratifications theory to analyze user experiences and perceptions. Findings revealed the most significant gratifications obtained were expressing the authentic self, entertainment, connecting to others, and presenting the ideal self, and these perceived affordances moderated the relationships between motives and gratifications obtained. Users seeking companionship were more likely to alleviate loneliness through BeReal when they perceived stronger social presence. Those using BeReal to pass time found it more entertaining when the app was seen as less editable and ephemeral. In addition, users aiming to connect with others experienced greater satisfaction when they perceived content as less editable. This study provides insights into how affordances impact how satisfied users are with BeReal’s ability to gratify their needs.",

Extending De Certeau’s spatial framework of place, space, and subject positions to digital platforms, this article explores how ordinary Instagram users negotiate platform power by approaching resistance as spatial negotiation embedded in everyday use. Based on 15 in-depth interviews, the analysis identifies everyday tactics that transform Instagram from a structured place into a lived space : users abandon places, make the platform habitable, play with its materiality, and repurpose it for unexpected uses. The study demonstrates how users resist by how they position and move within platform structures. It categorizes users as voyeurs and walkers , based on De Certeau’s subject positions, and introduces a new category, transients , each reflecting distinct spatial relations to the platform. This article argues that spatial relations shape user agency and the conditions under which resistance becomes possible.",

The mixed-methods study includes exploratory reconstructions and survey experiments. Two intervention approaches proved efficient in reducing the sharing of misinformation, but only one significantly differentiated between true and false information. This study contributes to the literature on normative countermeasures and is the first to emphasize epistemic norms. Although misinformation is fundamentally an epistemic issue, scholars rarely refer to the rich epistemic literature for conceptualization and theory. The article also draws on focus theory and additional social literature to ensure a holistic framework. In addition to underscoring the role of epistemic norms, we suggest temporal proximity as a new factor to consider in focus theory-based measures. Ethical, empirical, and practical implications are discussed, emphasizing the need to control for countermeasures’ effect on true information sharing, which may threaten to suppress public discourse.",

          "abstract": "Constant connectedness and social media overuse have prompted disconnection practices like quitting and digital detoxing. Besides these approaches, mindfulness stands as a promising quality to benefit from social media without being overwhelmed by their drawbacks. Accordingly, this study investigates whether mindful technology use (MTU) can help manage social media use. Based on the Affordance-Use-Reflection-Automaticity Model, MTU was proposed as a means to regulate the effects of social media affordances (i.e. hedonic and utilitarian content gratification), habit, satisfaction, and system use. The research model was tested on three different social media—Facebook ( n = 220), Instagram ( n = 132), and Twitter/X ( n = 123)—using a cross-sectional survey. The results show that MTU is associated with lower habit and system use, and a stronger positive link between hedonic content gratification and habit. These findings indicate that MTU can be a disconnection strategy by supporting mindful consumption and weakening habitual use.",

We draw on empirical insights from five creative workshops to examine how university students perceive and respond to the logics of this ‘algorithmic event’ and assertion of identity through ‘wrappification’. Our analysis identifies four themes: the resonance of Wrapped, limits of the Wrapped self, ambience of music and contestations of Spotify’s governance. These themes reflect the multifaceted emotions evoked in users, ranging from celebration of personalisation to critique of data capture. They also demonstrate contradictory views of classification systems. While our participants are deeply attuned to the algorithmic and commercial forces of streaming, their engagement with music often transcends the platform’s affordances. By examining these negotiated practices during an algorithmic event, our study extends debates on the platformisation of culture, especially regarding music’s aesthetic and functional values.",

Building on social acceleration and the sociology of quantification, we take a media sociology perspective to examine how algorithmic automation accelerates public visibility and fans’ data work. Based on netnography of a Chinese idol group INTO1’s fans, we theorize that algorithms, a technological acceleration in audience data production, trigger two changes in public visibility encountered by fans: ephemeral visibility and externally visible production. They further accelerate the pace of fans’ data work, reflected in generating more data in less time, speeding up reaction, organizing data work by time intervals, and adding additional and indirect data work. While prior algorithm studies emphasize opacity, we highlight the important yet underexplored speed aspect of algorithms and its social impact on the time dimension.",

          "abstract": "Online communities are vast, complex spaces attracting diverse users, offering support and connection, but also spreading harmful content, including misogyny and extremism. Current research on online communities explores user roles and community structures within single communities. We extend this by examining engagement across multiple communities using over 4 million Reddit posts from 20 “subreddits” in the “manosphere”—an interconnected ecosystem of anti-feminist online communities. In summary, (1) users’ membership in the “manosphere” constitutes engagement with an array of communities, (2) we develop a measure of relative engagement (MRE) to show that users post unequally across their member communities, and (3) we explore the patterns of engagement across communities in the manosphere. We discuss how users navigate multiplicitous identity expressions across communities in the “manosphere” (as measured by MRE) and highlight the value of studying online community membership from a more holistic perspective for researchers, designers, and content moderators.",

The present research explores whether measures such as fear of being single (FOBS), desire for a relationship (DFR), and satisfaction with relationship status (SWRS) represent distinct perspectives associated with singlehood experiences or, conversely, a general attitude toward relationship status. In two samples of singles ( N 1A = 172, N 1B = 257), the three measures loaded onto distinct factors. Exploratory analyses revealed distinct associations with well‐being, relationship pursuit tendencies, and perceived rewards/costs of singlehood and relationships. Results suggest that unique experiences of singlehood and relationships associated with FOBS, DFR, and SWRS reflect distinct motivational underpinnings. Careful consideration of research goals and implications should be used when selecting different operational and methodological framings of attitudes toward relationship status.",

          "abstract": "Trust is fundamental to forming, maintaining, and repairing close relationships, yet no established instrument exists for assessing trust in Chinese close relationships, despite such measures being in place in Western contexts. We therefore adapted the widely used Dyadic Trust Scale (DTS) and examined its psychometric properties in two independent Chinese samples (Study 1: N = 204; Study 2: N = 377). Item analysis and EFA identified a two‐factor structure, contrasting with the DTS's usual unidimensional form in Western samples and suggesting cultural differences in trust conceptualization. Item 1 was removed for weak loading and model misfit in CFA, yielding a final seven‐item structure of Faith (five items) and Security (two items). CFA showed good fit (CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.09) alongside high internal consistency, good convergent and discriminant validity, and strong criterion validity with relationship satisfaction (total DTS: r = 0.69; Faith : r = 0.56; Security : r = 0.51; all p s &lt; 0.001). This study provides the first adaptation and validation of the DTS in China; the adapted trust scale offers a brief, psychometrically robust assessment for use in research on Chinese close relationships and in therapeutic settings.",

          "abstract": "Mounting socio-environmental crises have prompted calls for post-normal sustainability science, emphasising complexity, uncertainty, and epistemic pluralism, and framing science communication as dialogical and reflexive. However, previous research has identified a gap between these ideals and actual practices, where conventional norms of objectivity and expert authority often prevail. Drawing on Irwin’s (2021) framework of socio-technical orders of thinking, we analyse interviews with 12 leading Danish sustainability scientists. Our thematic analysis shows that scientists pragmatically navigate between first-order (expert-led), second-order (inclusive), and third-order (reflexive and power-aware) modes of thinking. While third-order thinking emerges as integral to sustainability science, traditional assumptions about authority and neutrality continue to shape scientists’ communication practices. These findings invite science communication scholars to view sustainability science as a fertile ground for developing and testing pluralistic, reflexive, and power-aware communication models, while also learning from the situated practices of scientists who already navigate these complexities in context.",

In this article, we review this cultural evolution literature and present findings from a set of interviews with science communication professionals. We asked science communicators about the potential benefits and risks that may come about when using cognitive biases within science communication storytelling. Science communicators reported already using some cognitive biases in their practice. Participants also expressed concerns about some tactics that might contradict objectives of science communication, threaten the integrity of science and science communication and risk the welfare of audiences.

Focusing on X and Weibo, we employed content and network analysis to examine how they articulated values in different venues to regulate public expression from 2007 to 2024. Our findings reveal an increasing convergence in how the two platforms communicate about values in their community guidelines, suggesting a trend of institutional isomorphism in response to shared challenges such as misinformation and online safety. However, they diverged in communicating through values in administrative posts. While X emphasized personal-level values such as self-expression, Weibo prioritized social-level values, particularly social and political security, often in the context of addressing concrete cases.",

          "abstract": "In the platformized era, digital games have become key arenas for romantic connection, yet their role in shaping intimacy between strangers remains underexplored. This study examines how such relationships are initiated, developed, and evaluated in Honor of Kings, China’s most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. Based on 25 in-depth interviews with young players, it addresses four questions: the stages of romantic intimacy formation, enabling digital affordances, reasons for choosing games over dating or social apps, and evaluations of game-based romantic relationships. Findings reveal a four-stage process—encounter, acquaintance, development, and establishment or termination. Conceptualizing games as affective infrastructures, the study shows how platform design structures and commodifies digital intimacy while enabling embodied, performative commitment. Comparative analysis with dating apps, social media, and Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) highlights the distinctiveness of fast-paced, interaction-intensive play in fostering embedded emotional commitment. It also uncovers players’ tactical workarounds to reclaim autonomy from platforms. By theorizing intimacy as both enabled and contested within socio-technical systems, this research advances an infrastructural account of how love is imagined, enacted, and negotiated in contemporary digital culture.",
