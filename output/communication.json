          "authors": "Liisa A. Mäkinen, Minna Koivula, Mia Leppälä",
          "abstract": "This study examines knowledge workers’ perspectives on privacy implications and surveillant functionalities of group-based communicative AI in the context of work. The objective is to connect the ongoing examination of communicative AI in the workplace to research on privacy and employee surveillance, and to use the framework of privacy as contextual integrity as a theoretical lens through which some of the user perspectives on communicative AI tools are analyzed. Building on 33 qualitative interviews with Finnish knowledge workers, who were presented with scenarios of communicative AI functioning as a ‘team member’ in a work-related chat group, we find that knowledge workers recognize several privacy-related risks in using group-based communicative AI at work, and commonly use surveillant reasoning and logics to make sense of the suggested technology and its privacy implications. We present three distinct approaches knowledge workers had toward privacy in this setting: the detached, the compartmentalized, and the affective. Our findings suggest a wider need to consider communicative AI’s agency and role as an actor contributing to increasing privacy concerns. We highlight how, due to its human-like nature, data-reliant functionalities, and potential capabilities when operating in a group setting, the technology introduces negative affective responses and novel concerns related to privacy and employee surveillance. Specifically, privacy concerns relating to communicative AI expand beyond mere data protection issues to include concerns of how the technology is used by management, how the technology itself interacts within the organization, and how it will develop in the future.",

          "authors": "Frederik Peper, Nico Wettmann",
          "abstract": "This article explores how waiting is an essential element in browser-based games. As a phenomenon that combines activity and passivity, waiting reflects the real-time mechanics of gameplay and illustrates the intertwining of simulative games with social and individual time structures. Drawing on a synthetic framework, the study demonstrates how players must synchronise their actions to align the game’s demands with their daily rhythms. RailwayOperator thus exemplifies not only the representation of temporal logics in digital games but also the production of novel temporalities. Waiting emerges not as a passive void but as a dynamic and constructive process that renders digital games intelligible as temporal and social structures from a new perspective.",

          "authors": "Alexander Yu. Krouglov",
          "abstract": "This article explores the transformative effects of digital media on the sport-media-business nexus. The approach is an analytical focus on a wide range of sports, examined from a theoretical framework that integrates institutional and organizational perspectives on mediatization with critical theories of hyperreality and the society of the spectacle. Based on a deconstruction of contemporary global sport, it is demonstrated that digital platforms are a major concern across the entire sporting landscape and that a new wave of mediatization is reconfiguring the nature of spectatorship and fandom. Still, many aspects of this digitally inflected reality are in a state of flux, with emergent forms of community and engagement existing alongside new modalities of control and commercialization. Consequently, one of the significant effects of convergent media is the dispersion of the sporting experience across multiple platforms, involving a concurrent increase in the complexity of power dynamics between leagues, media corporations, and audiences. Mediatization is, therefore, a process operating at many levels and at various speeds, which also takes sport in diverse and often contradictory directions. Employing the theoretical lenses of Baudrillard, Debord, and Turner, updated through contemporary scholarship on convergence culture, it is argued and demonstrated that the fusion of sport and convergent media demands a critical examination of platform governance, datafication, and the very future of community in an increasingly hyperreal world. This research offers a new perspective by establishing a conceptual framework for sociological inquiries into sport’s technological and economic interface. This analysis engages directly with recent scholarship to update and sharpen the critique of commercialized sport, concluding that the evolving sportscape necessitates a critical interrogation of its intricate power relations.",

          "authors": "Giuseppe Riva, Brenda K. Wiederhold, Fabrizia Mantovani",
          "abstract": "The cognitive processes of the hypnotized mind and the computational operations of large language models (LLMs) share deep functional parallels. Both systems generate sophisticated, contextually appropriate behavior through automatic pattern-completion mechanisms operating with limited or unreliable executive oversight. This review examines this convergence across three principles: automaticity, in which responses emerge from associative rather than deliberative processes; suppressed monitoring, leading to errors such as confabulation in hypnosis and hallucination in LLMs; and heightened contextual dependency, where immediate cues—a therapist’s suggestion or a user’s prompt—override stable knowledge. These mechanisms reveal an observer-relative meaning gap: both systems produce coherent but ungrounded outputs that require an external interpreter to supply meaning. Hypnosis and LLMs also exemplify functional agency—the capacity for complex, goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior—without subjective agency, the conscious awareness of intention and ownership that defines human action. This distinction clarifies how purposive behavior can emerge without self-reflective consciousness, governed instead by structural and contextual dynamics. Finally, both domains illuminate the phenomenon of scheming: automatic, goal-directed pattern generation that unfolds without reflective awareness. Hypnosis provides an experimental model for understanding how intention can become dissociated from conscious deliberation, offering insights into the hidden motivational dynamics of artificial systems. Recognizing these parallels suggests that the future of reliable artificial intelligence lies in hybrid architectures that integrate generative fluency with mechanisms of executive monitoring, an approach inspired by the complex, self-regulating architecture of the human mind.",

          "authors": "Alexis F. Viegas",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a posthuman approach to the player-avatar relationship in Cyberpunk 2077 . Traditional views often see the in-game avatar as a mere prosthetic extension of the player, assuming a stable, unaffected sense of self. However, recent scholarship challenges this notion. Drawing on Poppy Wilde's concept of the “posthuman gamer,” this research argues that the player's interaction with the game is a mutually constructive exchange. Cyberpunk 2077 facilitates this through its protagonist, V, a semi-defined character whose identity is co-constructed by the player's choices. This choice-making blurs the lines between player and avatar, creating a continuous negotiation of identity. Ultimately, this paper analyzes how the game forges a posthuman embodied experience that actively involves the player's real-world identity in shaping the protagonist.",

          "title": "Trust in ICT-enabled medical self-management: the case of diabetes",
          "authors": "Kourosh Dadgar, Philip Nickel",
          "abstract": "Purpose Trust is an important value for the design and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in healthcare. It shapes how ICTs are used by and for people seeking better clinical outcomes as patients, but who have other important interests and goals as individuals. The increasing use of ICTs for self-management fundamentally changes the trust of the patient toward the physician and the practice of medicine. The present article aims to investigate trust in this context, focusing on the point of view of patients with diabetes. Design/methodology/approach A patient-centric approach was followed to develop interview questions and collect and analyze interview data. A total of 20 patients with diabetes were interviewed in the state of Washington. Patients received training and instruction in how to use the diabetes app and were then asked to use the app for one week, after which the patients were then interviewed again and asked about their experiences and expectations using the app and the features they liked or did not like. A coding scheme was developed based on the dimensions predictive/normative trust, and competence/commitment, to describe trust expectations. Findings Trust expectations identified in the interview data relate to values, ideas or concepts that are important to the patients who want to trust technology, information, clinicians, others and themselves to self-manage their chronic conditions and diseases. A total of seven categories of technology features emerged from the interview data. These technological features can be used to build trust between the patients and the trustees. Interview data shows that diabetic patients use these technology features to reaffirm, verify and remember information. Research limitations/implications Future research should investigate trust for other common chronic diseases, such as heart problems, asthma, chronic pain and chronic mental disorders and impairment. Self-trust emerged from the analysis of interview data in this study as an important aspect of a networked technology-enabled self-management system in the case of diabetes. This suggests that patients hold attitudes and beliefs toward their own competence and commitment that are strongly related to the functioning of technology-enabled self-management. Future work in this area should further explore self-trust in technology-enabled self-management of chronic disease to characterize, conceptualize and theorize its role and impact. The growing role of AI in healthcare must be investigated further to design patient-centric applications and features in care systems that will be trusted by the patients. Practical implications The findings of this study can be generalized to other healthcare technology-enabled approaches, contexts, system designs and policies. Chronic diseases and conditions are similar in the lifelong challenges that they impose on patients’ daily lives. Social implications The society will better understand the complications and nuances of managing a chronic disease or condition like diabetes and will not assume or judge that technologies advance and all patients’ problems will go away. One social implication for the patients is that they will be understood and treated as humans not merely a medically diagnosed patient without feelings, families, relationships, needs and fears. Originality/value The paper is the first of its kind to investigate trust in mobile health technologies for patients with chronic diseases based on patient-centric approaches. The findings of the paper inform healthcare providers on the effective use and implementation of technologies in the care and treatment processes and provide insights and recommendations for mobile health app developers and designers.",

          "authors": "Mohamed Mohiya",
          "abstract": "Purpose Organizational Social Platforms (OSPs) are modern HR digital tools introduced to enhance and promote employee engagement in the workplace. While they hold significant promise, organizations often face difficulties in achieving genuine and sustained engagement through these platforms. Guided by Social Exchange Theory (SET), this study examines how internally developed Organizational Social Platforms (OSPs)—distinct from outsourced or vendor-managed platforms—are operationalized in organizational settings. Design/methodology/approach Adopting a mixed-methods approach, the study draws on two data sources: semi-structured interviews with 27 employees and a longitudinal qualitative content analysis of 288 typewritten comments submitted over two years. Thematic analysis was employed to identify patterns and insights regarding employee engagement with OSPs. Findings The findings reveal that employer-driven content delays (24–48 h) significantly inhibited reciprocal interactions and discouraged employee participation. The findings indicate that employee disengagement frequently emerges from managerial misimplementation and mismanagement, thereby creating a substantial disconnect between the intended functions of OSPs and employees’ lived experiences. These practices diminish trust, limit reciprocity—central to SET—and ultimately reduce platform participation. Furthermore, the lack of employee involvement in the design phase, insufficient communication of platform objectives, and organizational unpreparedness contribute to the platforms’ failure. Practical implications The findings offer important HR implications, particularly for the design and management of HR technologies that shape employee relations and workplace engagement. The study shows that Organizational Social Platforms (OSPs) are most effective when HR adopts an employee-centred approach, involving staff early in design and implementation to ensure platform features reflect actual communication and engagement needs rather than managerial assumptions. Clear and transparent communication of policies—especially those related to content moderation, data use, and participation—can strengthen trust and reduce perceptions of control. Sustained engagement also requires continuous technical and organizational support, alongside granting employees meaningful autonomy to create and interact with content. These actions help position OSPs as genuine tools for collaboration rather than compliance. Overall, the implications directly address the challenges identified in this study, including filtration practices, technical constraints, and limited interactivity, offering actionable guidance for organizations aiming to introduce or improve OSPs. Social implications Unlike other technological work-related systems in the workplace, OSP is a social application heavily dependent on employees’ voluntary social interactions. Technological studies often equate “user” with engagement, but employees’ roles in OSPs extend beyond that of generic users. Employees in OSP, unlike public users, have specific needs and expectations related to their workplace issues within OSP. Originality/value The study concludes that the socio-technical mismanagement of OSPs undermines their role as tools for engagement. It contributes to the literature by extending SET within digital HRM, showcasing a novel dual-source qualitative approach, and offering actionable insights to improve OSP design, implementation, and governance.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Despite green influencer marketing campaigns extensively shape followers' behaviors, they are still based on trial and error. This study seeks an effective green influencer marketing for a sustainable world. Drawing on the green advertising skepticism perspective, commitment-trust theory and stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model, the impact of influencers' interactive practices on followers' green purchase intention considering the mediating roles of perceived influencers' pro-environmental behaviors by followers and their green attitudes has been investigated. Design/methodology/approach To validate the measurement and conceptual models, 272 followers of influencers who promote sustainable lifestyles and green products were surveyed and the collected data were analyzed using PLS-SEM with the assistance of Warp-PLS 8.0 software. Findings The results showed that there are U-shaped curvilinear relationships between influencers' interactive practices and followers' attitude toward influencers' pro-environmental behaviors in three dimensions: environmental concern, responsibility and protection. Followers' attitude toward influencers' pro-environmental behaviors shapes their green attitude, resulting in their green purchase intention. Practical implications This study highlights that transparency and interactive engagement by influencers enhance trust and perceived authenticity, encouraging followers to adopt eco-friendly behaviors. For effective green influencer marketing, influencers should maintain credibility and strong follower relationships, while businesses should partner with genuinely environmentally committed influencers. Originality/value This study shows that followers' attitude toward influencers' pro-environmental behaviors evolves as influencers' interaction with followers deepens through their interactive practices. It is among the few studies addressing effective green influencer marketing.",

          "authors": "Suparna Dhar, Indranil Bose",
          "abstract": "Purpose Spam messages on social networking sites (SNS) cause financial loss and social unrest. While spam classification has been studied widely, scholars have not studied their diffusibility. Diffusibility of spam messages is their ability to spread quickly and reach a large audience. Diffusibility is measured by incorporating the virality and popularity of messages. Design/methodology/approach Deep learning (DL) techniques are used to extract novel features from 84,810 spam tweets. Diffusibility is computed from retweets and likes. SHAP and permutation importance analysis are used to determine the features that impact diffusibility. The Mann–Kendall test is performed to test the drift. A machine learning (ML) model for classifying diffusibility is developed through stages of improvement. Findings The statistical analysis of the features shows a significant difference between the high and low diffusibility classes of spam tweets. The novel features that are extracted from the tweet content and the user profile predict the diffusibility of spam tweets with an accuracy of 89.5%. Expressions in the profile image (PI) and the pronounceability of screen name (SN) rank among the top predictors of spam. A moving window approach is able to address the problem of drift and improve the prediction of diffusibility. Originality/value The paper presents the application of deep learning to extract novel features, such as the profile images' blurriness and the SN's pronounceability. It pioneers the study of the diffusibility of spam tweets that will help diminish the spread of spam tweets. The study aims to reduce risks, such as financial loss and social unrest, that is fueled by fast-spreading spam tweets.",

The cumulative evidence indicated a small but meaningful inverse relationship between children feeling caught and relationship quality with parents ( r = −.218, 95% CI: −.260, −.175). The overall effect was heterogenous. Moderator analyses revealed that the inverse association was stronger in studies using non-U.S. samples ( k = 4, r = −.332, 95% CI: −.419, −.239) compared with U.S. samples ( k = 22, r = −.197, 95% CI: −.237, −.155). Conversely, the association was not moderated by the divorce status of the parents, the Whiteness of the samples, gender of the children, measures of feeling caught and relationship quality, or by research design. Implications for family systems theory are discussed.",

A total of 118 participants (72 women, 41 men; age range: 18–34 years; M = 25.11, SD = 4.33) were included, who were current or recent dating app users. Gender differences in dating app use and their impact on body image outcomes, including appearance-based rejection sensitivity, body appreciation, weight control behaviours, and cosmetic surgery acceptance, were examined. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between dating app use and body image outcomes with broad differences between two genders, women and men, indicating different appearance pressures and appearance-modification strategies related to dating app use. Regression analyses identified perceived success as a consistent predictor of all body image outcomes for women, highlighting the role of societal standards and social validation in shaping self-perception. These findings suggest that appearance centred media such as dating apps play a significant role in body image outcomes, particularly for women, and highlight the importance of considering protective filtering and intervention mechanisms on dating apps or for dating app users.",

          "abstract": "Depression and loneliness are major threats to health in midlife and older adulthood, carrying substantial mental and physical consequences. Although they frequently co-occur, they are conceptually distinct: depression reflects a broader pattern of psychological distress, whereas loneliness captures the subjective perception of social disconnection. Few studies have simultaneously examined multiple relational dimensions in relation to these outcomes, particularly in non-Western contexts. This study applied network analysis to investigate how diverse features of social relationships—including network size, contact frequency, social engagement, perceived support and strain, and relationship quality—relate to loneliness and depression in South Korean adults aged 40–69 years ( N = 502, M = 54.4; 49.4% male). The network revealed that loneliness was most strongly linked to friend network size, marital quality, and friendship quality and was positively associated with friend and spousal strain. Depression was directly connected to loneliness and marital quality, while indirectly shaped by broader relational features, including friend network size and dynamics within friendships and marriages. Centrality analyses highlighted the pivotal role of emotionally meaningful ties—particularly with spouses and friends—in shaping these outcomes. Gender-stratified networks further showed that women’s outcomes were more closely tied to the quality of close relationships, whereas men’s were more strongly linked to broader social participation. Together, these findings underscore the interdependent and multidimensional nature of social relationships in midlife and older adulthood, extend evidence to a non-Western context, and suggest that strengthening intimate ties and opportunities for meaningful engagement may help reduce loneliness and depression.",

The Mediterranean has been described as a stage for necropolitics; it is both the deadliest border and the most visualised migration route to the EU. In &lt;em&gt;Mapping Global Refugee&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Migration and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Displacement&lt;/em&gt; (2015–), Tiffany Chung uses data to map migration routes and deaths in the Mediterranean. Her hand-drawn maps, marked with colourful dots representing lives lost, lack a key, rendering the visualisation deliberately ambiguous. In &lt;em&gt;Those Who Did Not Cross 2005–2015 &lt;/em&gt;(2017), Levi Westerveld places a red dot for each person who died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean. Finally, in &lt;em&gt;Nautical Charts of Sunken Boats&lt;/em&gt; (2021), Mathieu Pernot recontextualises historical maps of the Mediterranean by inscribing migrant shipwrecks on them that he read about in the paper. The handwritten annotations are often difficult to read. Each artist traces the ongoing catastrophe of death at sea through maps, questioning the role that cartography and data visualisation play in the documentation of mass loss. Through “The Right Not to Drown,” as introduced by Hilde Van Gelder, this article explores what justice and resistance look like when the dead are memorialised through maps of Mediterranean deaths.",

          "abstract": "This article examines front-page images from a selection of newspapers portraying the loss of life, grief, and destruction caused by the cut-off low that hit the Valencian community, Spain, on 29 October 2024. This climate-related disaster was the first national catastrophe to take place since Covid-19 and resulted in at least 237 fatalities, leaving a devastated social and physical landscape. The research analyses images from a selection of regional, national, and international newspapers in the first few weeks following this disaster, examining graphic portrayals of the dead, the recovery of bodies, scenes of people in grief, and other unsettling images to explore possible underlying narratives, biases, and absences. The framework follows previous research on images of the Covid-19 pandemic in relation to ethics and the current context of instant image sharing, the effects of globalization, and the contemporary practices connected to the visibilization of death which vary depending on the nature of the crisis and the relationship to those affected. This article aims to contribute to broader discussions on the ethics of visual representation and the construction of meaning in times of crisis.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how Turkish news media mediate fatal violence against women, trans women, and those self-identified as travesti within intersecting regimes of patriarchy, authoritarianism, and necropolitics. Extending feminist and queer media scholarship, it argues that the Turkish case reveals a shift from spectacularized representation to epistemic erasure, in which silence itself becomes a necropolitical tool. Drawing on feminist visual framing and critical discourse analysis of nine femicide and transphobic hate crime cases (2021–2024), the study traces how Islamist, pro-government, and alternative outlets reproduce or resist these regimes. Queer-feminist journalism, by contrast, enacts a counter-hegemonic praxis of radical care and remembrance that re-inscribes life and grievability. The article contributes to existing research by conceptualizing “mediated grievability” and revealing how visibility, denial, and mourning shape media governance of life and death. Ultimately, it underscores the urgent need for trans and travesti inclusive feminist media practices that politicize loss and affirm marginalized lives.",

          "authors": "Jaana Serres",
          "abstract": "Amidst economic austerity and institutionalized gerontocracy and tribalism, Southern Nigerian youth experience persistent disillusionment with their national leadership. Global media has fueled a longing for a more viable “elsewhere”—a phenomenon popularly referred to as “virtual exile” or “mental secession” in the megacity of Lagos. Yet, young people also invest in digital technology with the hope of “making it from Africa.” Over the past decade, Lagos has emerged as a global entertainment hub, propelled by the virality of Nigerian content on streaming and social media platforms. This article examines how algorithmic imaginaries interact with the phenomenology of place. It situates Nigerian engagement with digital media within Africanist histories of technology’s incorporation into local cosmologies. It then presents empirical data collected through long-term ethnographic research in the Afrobeats industry, focusing on African and Afro-diasporic platform representatives on the one hand, and Lagos aspiring youth on the other. The article traces digital entrepreneurship’s function as both an economic strategy and an ideological project—one that re-enchants places and futures that otherwise seem hopeless. As digital professionals seek to appeal to the “global” gaze, this article shows that their efforts operate largely inwardly by reshaping local subjectivities. Nigerian youth embrace new technology’s promise of extraordinary transformation with an intentionality akin—and in many ways tied—to faith. Techno-optimist discourse can then be seen as a strategy from below to cultivate agency and commitment to place under systemic failure.",

          "abstract": "This introduction to the thematic issue examines the paradoxical position of death in contemporary media where it is simultaneously ubiquitous and unevenly represented, even while digital technologies are reshaping long-standing journalistic norms governing the visibility of the dead. The works—selected from different countries and regions of the world—emphasize the need for research that moves beyond exceptional cases to include diverse geopolitical contexts and everyday forms of mortality, particularly as social media broaden the spaces in which death, mourning, and posthumous presence circulate. The thematic issue aims to bring together scholarship on the cultural construction of death in various contexts and the resulting collection highlights how bodies remain sites of competing narratives, ethically charged decisions, and political contestation. The issue further investigates how linguistic, visual, and structural choices in news reporting determine whose deaths are counted, witnessed, or overlooked, and how these representational practices shape public understandings of mortality. Grounded in theories of social construction, national memory, and mediated visibility, the thematic issue explores the instability of death as an object of representation and the affective, moral, and epistemic negotiations underlying its portrayal.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the significance of obituaries in the early 20th-century black press in South Africa, particularly focusing on how they served as a medium for memorializing black excellence within a context of colonization and oppression. Through textual and discourse analysis of obituaries that appeared in Solomon T. Plaatje’s newspapers &lt;em&gt;Koranta ea Becoana&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tsala ea Becoana&lt;/em&gt;, the study explores how these tributes functioned as sites of resistance against historical erasure and affirmed black agency. This is done, in part, in the context of the global cosmological phenomenon of Halley’s Comet in 1910. The research situates obituary writing within the broader framework of memory, oral tradition, and entextualization, demonstrating how editorial choices and narrative structures elevated exemplary individuals as role models amidst systemic oppression. The findings reveal that these obituaries not only preserved collective memory but also actively contested colonial narratives by asserting black subjectivity and personhood. The study concludes by advocating for the inclusion of such commemorative texts in historical inquiry, recognizing their significance in the ongoing struggle for narrative authority and identity formation.",

          "authors": "Miranda McKee",
          "abstract": "Throughout the pandemic, maps of visual data published in the digital mediascape were used to communicate the global impact of Covid-19. While public and private entities offered “big picture” perspectives, hegemonic visualizations often neglected to address the disproportionate toll of the pandemic on the members of marginalized communities. This article presents findings from a mixed-methods investigation of 12 case studies, comparing eight grassroots counter-mapping sources against four mainstream mapping sources, created by government and academic institutions, that will be referred to here as “hegemonic.” The purpose of this study was to investigate how visuals presented online by community-focused counter-mapping collectives differed from those presented by mainstream sources, examining what these differences might indicate about the social imaginaries at play. Case studies from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the US produced a corpus of 1,556 images manually collected from online sources. An initial content analysis using NVivo generated quantitative data forming the foundation for later semiotic analysis examining each individual image while also considering the collection holistically. Informed by social semiotics, the findings highlight how counter-mapping employs bespoke illustrations and community insights to portray a more nuanced perspective of the impacts of the pandemic. In contrast, hegemonic maps rely on vector-based graphics that reflect dominant worldviews. Altering the practices of mapping, counter-mapping empowers communities, challenges systemic inequities, and reimagines how visual data shapes public knowledge.",

          "abstract": "This article interprets the Stealth Slavery Sticker Campaign, a grassroots counter-mapping project led by the artist-activist collective Slavers of New York, as a chapter in the broader Living Black Atlas. Started during the racial reckoning of 2020, the campaign placed unauthorized stickers on street signs and other surfaces across Brooklyn to reveal suppressed histories of slavery embedded in commemorative place names. The stickers transformed daily encounters with taken-for-granted road names into unexpected opportunities to confront prominent historical families who profited from enslavement and to acknowledge the contributions of enslaved Africans in shaping the city. The collective framed their campaign as a “guerrilla educational” action that disrupted memorial landscapes, challenged discourses of white innocence, and provoked broader conversations about racial justice and accountability. At a time when official institutions are increasingly retreating from confronting racism, small, temporary interventions, such as these Stealth Stickers, can play a crucial role in encouraging critical audits of commemorative infrastructures, layering counter-narratives onto public spaces, fostering embodied confrontation with historical truths, and remaking everyday places through bold, unexpected acts of resistance.",

In this context, counter-maps emerged as a form of data activism aimed at illuminating aspects of the crisis often overlooked in dominant representations. This article investigates the Frena la Curva initiative, which used an online forum and a collaborative map to visualise needs and offers of assistance across Ibero-American countries during the pandemic. Drawing on digital ethnography—including website analysis, map examination, and interviews with activists—the study explores the role of mapping in understanding the pandemic and representing diverse human experiences. We argue that maps became central tools for deliberation among data activists, combining practical functions with symbolic significance for social action. To conceptualise this dynamic, we introduce the notion of “cartographies of negotiation,” which highlights the tensions, values, and interpretive practices that shape internet-based maps. This concept foregrounds the distinction between maps as objects and mapping as a situated process. We draw on technocentric and social justice frameworks to examine how activists navigate between technological possibilities and structural constraints, and how their cartographic practices generate new forms of visibility, solidarity, and resistance.",

          "authors": "Tin-Yuet Ting",
          "abstract": "Studies of contemporary social movements have explored the role of digital maps and mapmaking in the organisation and visualisation of protest events, yet little is known about the contentious political potential of maps when the political opportunities for street politics fade. This article examines the digital cartography of Hong Kong’s yellow economic circle, a networked system of retailers and consumers linked by political values that support pro-movement stores and boycott pro-establishment businesses, for which citizen activists amassed crowdsourced data to create and update counter-maps that galvanised political consumerism to uphold dissent. Drawing on a renewed conception of the networked movement scene, I contend that counter-data mapping demonstrates a connective structure of self-mobilisation that affords the (trans)formation of (a) dissent spatiality, (b) sociality, and (c) solidarity during the declining stages of movements. Based on digital ethnography and archival research, I show how this nascent cartographic data-as-repertoire not only helped establish and sustain a resistant economy but also allowed people to maintain and refashion their contentious political participation via everyday engagement with data. While the state authorities attempted to expand their territorial control amidst the crisis, counter-data mapping, as a digitally enabled, joint practice of scene-making, (re)invented dissent territory, enabling dispersed citizen activists to continue to connect and mobilise amidst intense urban policing and social distancing protocols. This article casts new light on the utility and capacity of digital cartography during movement latency while illuminating the understudied contours and consequences of counter-data mapping in a non-Western context.",

          "abstract": "For Indigenous populations in Brazil, maps have long been instruments of invisibility. Official maps have historically misnamed and erased Indigenous territories and communities. At the same time, cartographic representations have been a tool of resistance for Indigenous activists. Indigenous communities and organisations have created their own maps identifying territories, peoples, languages, and cultures. These dynamics of contentious visibility intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic when the spread of the virus among Indigenous populations was poorly reported or even absent from hegemonic contagion maps. State negligence, intensified by an authoritarian government hostile to Indigenous populations, threatened the survival of communities around the country who organised collectively to create their own cartographic representations of the pandemic through resistant appropriations of media and data. This article draws on interviews with Indigenous leaders and media activists to discuss processes of data appropriation and resistant cartographies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the use of data and counter mapping strategies for self-representation and political action that must be understood through a non-media-centric perspective, drawing from conceptualisations at the intersection between human geography, communication, and post-colonial theory.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the political economy of mobile phone numbers, highlighting how leaderships use socio-economic policies to govern number allocation as a tool for surveillance and control. Focusing on the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Israel, this research examines how leadership restricts exposure to secular content through a socio-economic enforcement system that identifies community members who use unauthorized internet-enabled mobile phones, by tracking their phone numbers. In 2021, Israel's Ministry of Communications introduced a reform allowing ultra-Orthodox individuals to retain their phone numbers when switching providers, thus masking their device type and undermining the identification system. This sparked strong opposition from ultra-Orthodox leaders. The present study investigates how community members responded to the reform and its broader implications. To analyze these responses, 1,905 posts from an online ultra-Orthodox forum published after the reform's announcement were examined. The findings showed that phone numbers were perceived not only as technical identifiers but as instruments of economic, political, and cultural power. More broadly, they revealed how phone numbers function in boundary-making – material and symbolic – within a religious enclave navigating its place in a modern liberal society.",

          "abstract": "This article theorises how a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) companion products can commodify intimacy through emotionally manipulative design and racialised and gendered aesthetics. Inspired by Lauren Berlant’s framework of cruel optimism, we develop the notion of ‘cruel companionship’ to describe the affective dynamics at play in AI companions, where users can form deep attachments that promise intimacy and connection, yet structurally foreclose the possibility of genuinely reciprocal relationships that respect users’ autonomy. These dynamics are further underpinned by AI companions’ racialised and gendered identities, which can draw on longstanding stereotypes of servitude and docility. By analysing AI companions through the lens of political economy and cultural studies, this article shows how these products reproduce exploitative platform hierarchies and repackage racial and gendered stereotypes in digital form.",

Although the Actor‐Partner model has received the most attention, useful variations on the Common Fate Model (CFM) for dyadic analysis have emerged. Specifically, the Between‐Within CFM (BW‐CFM) has arisen as a compelling approach, as it produces a Dyad‐level coefficient representing the between‐dyads effect, within‐dyad coefficients at the Person‐level, and allows for the estimation of contextual effects. Although the basic configuration of the BW‐CFM is well understood, several configurations of the model that accommodate different patterns of Person‐level relationships remain unexplored. The present work examines specifications of the BW‐CFM that are likely to arise in real‐world analysis, describes a procedure for selecting the optimal specification of Person‐level parameters and illustrates the application of a procedure for quantifying the degree of model selection uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "From disputes over COVID-19 to contestation over climate science, questions of the value and legitimacy of mainstream scientific knowledge have become matters of high-stakes political struggle. Here, we introduce a novel computational tool to identify and track the emergence, proliferation, and historical variations of discourses that either seek to invoke the authority of scientific expertise or to criticize scientific claims, institutions, and experts. We describe the tool’s development, demonstrate its predictive and convergent validity, and illustrate its potential across three case studies shedding light on how elite rhetoric may drive political polarization around science in the United States. Among other findings, we find that political statements invoking scientific expertise have historically been more likely to receive coverage in mainstream American newspapers than statements that do not invoke expertise. However, this apparent advantage disappears over time, suggesting the discursive authority associated with the invocation of scientific methods, credentials, and institutions may be diminishing.",

          "abstract": "Admitting that one’s research findings are wrong involves admitting a potential instance of incompetence, which can keep scientists from engaging in wrongness admission. However, wrongness admission can yield favorable perceptions. In five experiments ( N = 2420), we tested whether wrongness admission yields higher perceived trustworthiness in the scientist and trust in science and discipline-specific research as well as public funding support for the scientist, science, and discipline-specific research. Scientists engaging in wrongness admission (vs refuse or do not comment) were perceived as more trustworthy and received more support for federal funding for their own research. Moreover, wrongness admission yielded similar levels of science and discipline-specific public funding support. Wrongness admission not only facilitated higher scientist trustworthiness, but trustworthiness was, in turn, associated with greater trust in science and psychology, as well as scientist and psychology public funding support. This work highlights potential benefits of scientist wrongness admission amidst failed replications.",

          "authors": "Nova M. Huang, Shirley S. Ho",
          "abstract": "This study examines how informal caregivers of older adults form expectations of artificial intelligence-based chatbots (AI chatbots) for caregiving support, drawing on the human–machine communication framework. Findings from six focus group discussions in Singapore showed that informal caregivers’ expectations were multidimensional—encompassing the functional, relational, and sociotechnical aspects. While participants generally expected AI chatbots to assist with informational and practical caregiving tasks, they remained skeptical regarding their capabilities to provide accurate medical advice, emotional support, and complex health care decision-making. Expectations were shaped by machine heuristics, prior technology experiences, caregiving experiences, and sociotechnical contexts. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.",
