          "authors": "Andreas Hepp",
          "abstract": "This article aims to foster the systematic integration of “digital futures” into media and communication research. The concept of “digital futures” encompasses all imaginations of possible futures that envision a social world in which, first, digital media and their infrastructures play a constitutive role in constructing sociality, and second, these media are seen as primary drivers of societal transformation. A scientific engagement with digital futures should be integral to a media and communication research approach focused on “emergence.” This requires broadening our perspective on media-related transformations, which have predominantly been characterized through a focus on “consequences.” To date, research has largely focused on the effects and impacts of established media and their infrastructures. However, by expanding our view to include emergence, we inevitably confront questions about the future—an essential dimension of human agency, inherently tied to our capacity to project possible futures.",

          "authors": "Kateryna Kasianenko",
          "abstract": "Studies of public communication in digitally networked spaces have increasingly adopted the notion of practice to make sense of patterned doings in such spaces. They have identified and theorized about practices ranging from highly mundane and intimate doings to more collective and organized instances of grassroots platform governance to doings likely to result in harm. Despite this, it remains unclear how doings in networked publics must look, what properties they must have, who needs to engage in them, and for how long, to be considered practices. By synthesizing insights from practice theory and interdisciplinary Internet studies, I develop a model of practices in digital publics and outline interrelated elements of such sustained doings—action, language, materiality, collectivity, knowledge, and normativity. This model can enable future empirical studies to define, identify, and differentiate practices more systematically within and across digitally networked spaces and consider their broader impact on digital citizenship.",

          "authors": "André Jansson, Stina Bengtsson, Karin Fast, Johan Lindell",
          "abstract": "Whereas media reliance is one of the classical concepts in media and communication studies, this article argues that deep mediatization imposes a renewed relevance of the term, as well as a need to develop a more nuanced framework for studying its social implications. Traditionally, media reliance was used to explain how people develop a citizen identity. Today, while connective media, datafication and AI have transformed what it means to be reliant on media, the very concept is marginalized and theoretically under-developed. Against this backdrop, the article starts out from an overview of how media reliance, and related terms, have been utilized in media research and then develops an analytical framework that accounts for different social modes and realms of media reliance. The matrix is implemented to crystallize blind spots in the research field and to highlight new types of questions that different research strands could address in times of pervasive connectivity.",

          "authors": "Jakob Ohme, Anna-Theresa Mayer, Timothy Charlton-Czaplicki, Felix Gaisbauer, Lion Wedel, Yangliu Fan, Christoph Neuberger",
          "abstract": "This study introduces the Dynamic Intermediary Model (D[X]IM) to address how knowledge processes have evolved with digital platforms by shifting from a dyadic to a triadic communication model of content flow with a potential intermediary. This intermediary, which can be a journalist, influencer, artificial agent, or another platform actor, provides services to the source and recipient of a message, thereby transforming traditional direct communication. It aims to better understand information diffusion in the networked public sphere by recognizing the intermediary’s role in altering source-recipient dynamics. The D[X]IM applies across different communication levels (macro, meso, and micro) and is designed for empirical research using diverse methodologies. It focuses on single instances of platform communication to explore the impact of intermediated communication. The article concludes with a research agenda and examples of how D[X]IM can be applied in empirical research.",

          "authors": "Sungyong Ahn",
          "abstract": "This paper re-examines the concept of affordance within the context of generative AI, challenging the recent embodiment framework of human-computer interaction. Drawing on Gibson’s ecological psychology and Actor-Network Theory, it proposes a ‘fold diagram’ to illustrate how generative AI fundamentally alters the relationship between users and digital environments. Unlike previous tools requiring user skill for specific outcomes, generative AIs, exemplified by Compton’s generative art toy Idle Hands, procedural content generation, and LLM-based AI chatbots, respond meaningfully even to unintentional actions or underdeveloped queries, facilitating a new trade-off where control is ceded for increased power. The paper argues that affordances are no longer opportunities for action discovered by the user, but rather the machine’s capacity to flesh out predicted user interests. This shift is viewed through the lens of a radical symmetry between human and AI agency, where both actively fold the digital web to create intra-active niches. Ultimately, the paper presents a critical theory of HCI, asserting that software capitalism leverages generative AI to continuously re-world the web, preserving and exploiting pre-individuated user interests for profit.",

          "abstract": "This contribution introduces the comprehensive framework of epistemic welfare to discuss how public service media (PSM) can engage with algorithmic recommender systems in a manner in keeping with PSM's foundational principles. We contextualize PSM algorithmic recommenders in their tradition of content curation and discuss the challenges PSM face in implementing these systems. We introduce epistemic welfare, a framework based in social epistemology and welfare studies, defined as concerned with creating and maintaining conditions and capabilities for epistemic agency of citizens in the public sphere. We discuss the epistemic standards of reliability, power, fecundity, speed, and efficiency and illustrate the framework's operationalization for the design and implementation of recommenders and its relevance for governance by and of PSM's algorithms. Ensuring that algorithmic recommender systems fit epistemic welfare, we argue, allows PSM to help tackle the epistemic disruptions in the digitalized public sphere.",

          "abstract": "Social media activities do not occur in isolation, and it is possible that the well-being effects of an initial activity modify the effects of a subsequent one. This article examines this possibility by focusing on a specific, theoretically grounded sequence of social media activities: engaging with one’s own profile self-presentation (i.e., a self-affirmational activity) followed by browsing a superior peer’s profile (i.e., an activity eliciting upward social comparison). Two pre-registered experiments were conducted. Study 1 confirmed that both reviewing and crafting one’s own Instagram self-presentation provided self-affirmational benefits, reducing participants’ defensiveness and inducing positive affect. Study 2 showed that becoming self-affirmed by engaging with one’s own Instagram self-presentation diminished feelings of envy resulting from browsing a superior peer’s self-presentation. By conceptualizing and empirically testing the interdependence of social media activities, this research offers a framework for examining how sequences of social media activities jointly shape users’ psychological experiences.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Gamification is a valuable educational tool. However, research indicates that while gamified learning systems cater to users' gaming motivations, they may induce maladaptive usage. Integrating the gamification affordances-psychological outcomes-behavioral outcomes paradigm and goal orientation theory, this study examines maladaptive goal orientation processes and their unintended psychological and behavioral impacts. Design/methodology/approach We tested the model through a scenario-based approach in the context of Duolingo, which is a leading and highly influential mobile language learning application. Data from 100 forum users who discussed score-boosting strategies were collected via online questionnaires and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings Gamification affordances include instruction design (i.e. instant individualistic feedback and instant competitive feedback) and interface design (i.e. multisensory interaction). Results reveal that, compared to instant individualistic feedback, instant competitive feedback is more likely to foster maladaptive psychological outcomes, namely, competence feeling and focused attention on game goals. Multisensory interaction shows no significant effect on competence feeling, whereas it exerts a significant impact on focused attention on game goals. Competence feeling, rather than focused attention on game goals, contributes to maladaptive behaviors within the gamified system. Originality/value This study is among the first to highlight maladaptive goal orientation in gamified learning.

          "authors": "Xining Liao",
          "abstract": "Abstract: The present study explores how moral and threat language in news media influences public opinion within the context of the US–China relationship. Drawing on Moral Foundations Theory and Intergroup Threat Theory, I employed a computational approach combining the dictionary method with Large Language Models to identify moral and threat language in coverage of China by six major US news outlets from 2005 to 2022. I then analyzed the relationship between distinct types of moral and threat language and longitudinal polling data on Americans’ attitudes toward China. The results reveal a unified pattern: both liberal- and conservative-leaning outlets employed more binding than individualizing moral language, and emphasized realistic threats over symbolic threats when covering China. However, it is symbolic threat language that more strongly correlates with negative attitudes toward China. Furthermore, realistic threat language only predicted negative attitudes when accompanied by sufficient levels of moral language, with this relationship intensifying as moral language increased. The findings offer insights into the moral and threat dimensions of foreign news and public opinion towards foreign countries, highlighting a critical and complex interplay between these elements in a global context.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has become commonplace. One way AI is being used is to create stories; however, the moral values they highlight are unclear. The current study examines the types of moral intuition exemplars most commonly found in AI-generated narratives. Using randomized prompts that specified different types of narratives (quality-level, genre, medium, target audience, and intended response), ChatGPT-4o was instructed to create ten thousand stories, which were coded for the presence of the five moral intuitions from Moral Foundations Theory. Results show that higher-quality stories were more likely to include moral intuitions that were upheld rather than vioated. Likewise, the upholdings/violations of each moral intuition varied when prompted to create stories for different genres, mediums, and target audiences. The degree to which AI-generated stories reflect the intuition exemplars prominent in the media landscape in general and for audiences across moral subcultures is discussed.",

          "authors": "Thomas H. Zhang, Xiaohui Cao, Yidi Wang, Jiaying Liu, Shiwen Wu, Sijia Yang",
          "abstract": "Abstract: The care/harm moral foundation is a key antecedent of health behavior change, and care-based moral appeals, persuasive messages that integrate the care/harm foundation with specific health behaviors, have demonstrated effectiveness in health promotion campaigns. However, the role of care-based moral appeals within pictorial warnings (PWs), a widely implemented tobacco control strategy, remains understudied. Moreover, little is known about how smokers from diverse sociocultural backgrounds respond to the same type of care-based moral appeals, particularly in countries that have yet to adopt PWs on cigarette packaging. To address these gaps, this study reports secondary analyses of two randomized multi-message experiments using real-world tobacco control campaign messages ( K US  = 319, K China  = 510) among American and Chinese smokers ( N US  = 1,392, N China  = 2,306). Each participant viewed six PWs randomly selected from a large stimulus pool and rated their perceived message effectiveness, yielding 22,188 total observations. Cross-classified multilevel regression analyses revealed that smokers in both countries perceived shocking care appeals as more effective than non-shocking care appeals and other PWs that did not employ care-based moral appeals. Non-shocking care appeals were also rated more effective than the control category. Significant cross-level two-way interactions emerged between message features (shocking care appeals) and respondents’ care/harm foundation endorsement, as well as between country and care/harm foundation. The three-way interaction was non-significant. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of care-based moral appeals in tobacco control campaigns and contribute to theoretical inquiries in message effects research from global and comparative perspectives",

          "authors": "Miriam Gieselmann, Josephine Hagedorn, Kai Sassenberg",
          "abstract": "Abstract: People regularly receive algorithm-based recommendations (e.g., in social media and online shopping). Today, such algorithmic recommendations cover a wider range of applications, such as finding recipes that match an individual’s needs and food preferences. To give better-fitting recommendations, algorithms incorporate large amounts of personal information about the individual, which raises the issue of privacy concerns. When are people willing to share such information that can then be considered by algorithms? While previous research has indicated that perceived benefits of platform use and provider trustworthiness influence whether people are willing to disclose personal information, these studies often have two major limitations: they are either survey-based – thus, not allowing causal conclusions – or lack realistic usage (i.e., rely on vignettes). Thus, in the present experimental study ( N = 329), we manipulated provider trustworthiness and asked participants about their willingness to disclose information directly after interacting with an algorithm-based system for recipe recommendations. Results indicate that higher perceived benefits and provider trustworthiness are related to more willingness to disclose information. However, these effects are independent of each other. Thus, the present research suggests that provider trustworthiness causally leads to a higher willingness to share information and high benefits do not compensate for low provider trustworthiness.",

          "authors": "Magdalena Wischnewski, Nicole Krämer",
          "abstract": "Abstract: In this study, we examine how readers perceive the credibility of polarizing news purportedly written by a machine. In particular, we study whether a machine attribution can decrease the polarization inflicted by the self-confirmation bias. To that end, we expect that attitude-confirming polarizing news is perceived as less credible when attributed to a machine than when attributed to a human author. We assume this is due to the lower source credibility of machines and less emotional involvement. In a preregistered online experiment, we presented N = 508 participants with a polarizing news article attributed either to a human author or a machine. The article also either confirmed or disconfirmed participants’ attitudes towards the polarizing issue. Our results show that participants did not differentiate between human and machine-attributed news. Moreover, we found no evidence that machine-attributed news affected the self-confirmation bias. However, we found that, while machine authors were perceived equally competent as human authors, they were perceived as less trustworthy. In addition, we found that the machine attribution induced less emotional involvement in terms of experienced enthusiasm but not experienced anger.",

          "abstract": "Marriage is a fundamental right and personal choice for all people. However, societal attitudes present significant challenges for women with disabilities when contemplating marriage. This paper explores the experiences of Northern Vietnamese women with physical disabilities who faced opposition from their partners’ families regarding marriage. It draws on a qualitative study that explored the lived experiences of women with physical disabilities regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and maternal healthcare conducted in 2018. A two-staged in-depth interview was utilised. Initially, 29 women were interviewed, with 27 follow-up interviews conducted. Data was thematically analysed using Braun and Clarke’s approach (2013, 2019). Two key themes, with five subthemes, emerged: “marriage denied: gendered and ableist exclusion” and “marriage opposition: stigma and discrimination”. Findings underscore the pervasive influence of Vietnamese socio-cultural norms on the marital prospects of women with physical disabilities. Gender roles ascribed to wives, daughters-in-law, and mothers, coupled with ableist assumption and social stigma surrounding disability pose significant barriers to their marriages. These findings enhance understanding of the intersection of gender and disability, with implications for developing policies and programs that go beyond focusing solely on these factors, prioritise dismantling ableist and gender norms, and challenge negative perceptions of women with disabilities as “unworthy” of marriage.",

          "abstract": "The use of profile photos is central to most dating apps, yet some apps deliberately delay the display of photos. This study examines user experiences on pictureless dating apps, with a focus on Heymandi. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 Gen Z (i.e., 18–25 years old) users in Hong Kong to address three research questions: (1) what affordances motivate users to adopt pictureless dating apps, (2) how users self-present in a text-only environment, and (3) how relationships develop on this kind of apps. Findings highlight three key affordances: anonymity, which enables users to avoid stigmatization and prioritize personality over appearance; immediacy, which facilitates instant matching and real-time conversations; and specificity, which encourages users to initiate and respond to targeted discussions. Users employed three self-presentation strategies—self-promoting, effortless, and interest-based—to create appealing text-only profiles. Relationship development followed a three-phase process: matching, switching between social media platforms (e.g., transitioning from Heymandi to Telegram and/or Instagram), and, for most users, photo exchanges via other platforms prior to in-person meetings. While pictureless apps aim to reduce emphasis on physical appearance, photo exchanges reintroduced appearance-based considerations. This study sheds light on emerging dating platforms, revealing how they both challenge and reinforce traditional appearance-driven dating norms.",

However, existing literature has not adequately explored the relationship between these two factors and their influencing mechanisms on individual development. To address this gap, we conducted a survey involving 3,840 college students from ten higher educational institutions in Henan Province and employed structural equation modeling to analyze this dynamic. The findings reveal that (1) Social-emotional competence significantly and positively predicts the level of social support received by college students; (2) Interaction culture and conflictual relationships exert significant effects on the connection between social-emotional competence and students’ social support; (3) our analysis indicates that compared to gender and educational stage as moderating factors, institution type has a more pronounced moderating effect on the relationship between students’ social-emotional competence and the social support they receive.",

          "abstract": "An increasing number of people are engaging with artificial intelligence–based conversation agents such as social chatbots. The aim of this study was to investigate individual characteristics and well-being factors associated with the use of social chatbots as a form of friendship. We collected cross-national surveys from adults in Finland ( N = 1,095), France ( N = 1,014), Germany ( N = 900), Ireland ( N = 588), Italy ( N = 1,099), and Poland ( N = 967) in autumn 2023. Measures included social chatbot usage, general positive attitudes toward new technologies, frequency of face-to-face social contact, psychological distress, loneliness, self-esteem, and sociodemographic factors. We analyzed the data using logistic and linear regression analyses. The results showed that of the participants, 12.24% (Finland), 14.69% (France), 9.67% (Germany), 8.67% (Ireland), 17.93% (Italy), and 12.72% (Poland) were social chatbot users. Users of social chatbots were younger than nonusers in all country samples. In the regression models, social chatbot usage was positively associated with psychological distress across the six countries, with loneliness in France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, and with higher self-esteem in France. The results indicate that social chatbot usage is most consistently linked with younger age and psychological distress, suggesting that these tools may serve as an additional social resource for younger individuals. However, the usage does not necessarily contribute to improved well-being in the way social chatbot tools are intended to. Although social chatbot use was associated with higher self-esteem in France, their use may highlight more negative than positive outcomes overall.",

          "authors": "Eran Katz, Eran Bar-Kalifa, Paula Pietromonaco, Hodaya Wolf, Robert Klempfner, Hanoch Hod, Noa Vilchinsky",
          "abstract": "Caregiving for cardiac patients is often accompanied by significant emotional and physical strain. While prior research has emphasized the contribution of support to mitigate caregivers’ burden, limited attention has been paid to the support they may receive from the patients themselves. Attachment theory provides a crucial lens for understanding individual differences in how this specific kind of partner’s support is perceived and utilized. Drawing on dyadic coping models and attachment theory, this study examines how support dynamics within the couple influence caregivers’ burden, and whether these effects depend on caregivers’ attachment orientations. Specifically, the study investigates whether caregivers’ attachment anxiety and avoidance moderate the associations between (a) patient-reported support provided to the caregiver (b) caregiver perceived received support from the patient, and (c) levels of caregiver burden during cardiac rehabilitation. Eighty-eight heterosexual couples, in which the male partner had experienced a recent cardiac event, were assessed at the beginning and end of a three-month rehabilitation program. Measures included self-reported support (provided and received), attachment orientations, and multidimensional caregivers’ burden. Overall support was not directly associated with reduced general burden. Caregivers high in avoidant attachment reported lower emotional burden when they perceived receiving greater support from their ill partner. No such effect was found among caregivers low in avoidance or those high in anxious attachment. These findings highlight the importance of considering both interpersonal and intrapersonal factors in understanding caregiver burden. Recognizing and addressing attachment-related patterns in caregiving dyads could inform targeted interventions aimed at reducing emotional distress and enhancing resilience in couples coping with cardiac illness.",

Participants were 3,021 mothers and their children (49% female) involved in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that interparental conflict, maternal hostility, consistency, as well as child reactivity, behavioural difficulties, and neurodevelopmental condition at age 4–5 years were positively associated with hostile child-parent conflict at age 16–17 years. These early childhood conditions may act as important initial inputs into the development of coercive child-parent cycles and conflict into late adolescence.",

          "authors": "Chuanlin Ning",
          "abstract": "On May 5, 2022, a food blogger named Yishiji (一食纪) with over 700,000 followers on the Chinese social media platform Bilibili, posted a farewell video expressing his struggles as a gay man and his lack of attachment to the world. Shortly thereafter, it was confirmed that he had died by suicide, sparking widespread discussion across social media. Over three years later, his self-obituary continues to foster significant engagement, leading to a unique digital mourning space. Drawing on theories of obituary and digital mourning, this study analyzes the digital mourning spaces generated by self-obituaries on social media platforms through a case study of Yishiji. Employing multimodal discourse analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation thematic analysis, the research identifies four key features characterizing this emergent digital mourning space: sustained spatial content production; precise spatio-temporal dialogue, notably through the danmu feature; functional zoning of semi-open spaces; and its profound capacity to facilitate self-communication and connection among mourners. The study argues that such digital mourning spaces formed by self-obituaries are not merely extensions of traditional physical mourning rituals; rather, they constitute a novel democratic memorial institution co-constructed by the deceased’s obituary, user-generated content, and the platform’s algorithmic logic. This research enhances our understanding of how digital platforms transform mourning practices.

          "abstract": "This article interprets the Stealth Slavery Sticker Campaign, a grassroots counter-mapping project led by the artist-activist collective Slavers of New York, as a chapter in the broader Living Black Atlas. Started during the racial reckoning of 2020, the campaign placed unauthorized stickers on street signs and other surfaces across Brooklyn to reveal suppressed histories of slavery embedded in commemorative place names. The stickers transformed daily encounters with taken-for-granted road names into unexpected opportunities to confront prominent historical families who profited from enslavement and to acknowledge the contributions of enslaved Africans in shaping the city. The collective framed their campaign as a “guerrilla educational” action that disrupted memorial landscapes, challenged discourses of white innocence, and provoked broader conversations about racial justice and accountability. At a time when official institutions are increasingly retreating from confronting racism, small, temporary interventions, such as these Stealth Stickers, can play a crucial role in encouraging critical audits of commemorative infrastructures, layering counter-narratives onto public spaces, fostering embodied confrontation with historical truths, and remaking everyday places through bold, unexpected acts of resistance.",

          "authors": "Tin-Yuet Ting",
          "abstract": "Studies of contemporary social movements have explored the role of digital maps and mapmaking in the organisation and visualisation of protest events, yet little is known about the contentious political potential of maps when the political opportunities for street politics fade. This article examines the digital cartography of Hong Kong’s yellow economic circle, a networked system of retailers and consumers linked by political values that support pro-movement stores and boycott pro-establishment businesses, for which citizen activists amassed crowdsourced data to create and update counter-maps that galvanised political consumerism to uphold dissent. Drawing on a renewed conception of the networked movement scene, I contend that counter-data mapping demonstrates a connective structure of self-mobilisation that affords the (trans)formation of (a) dissent spatiality, (b) sociality, and (c) solidarity during the declining stages of movements. Based on digital ethnography and archival research, I show how this nascent cartographic data-as-repertoire not only helped establish and sustain a resistant economy but also allowed people to maintain and refashion their contentious political participation via everyday engagement with data. While the state authorities attempted to expand their territorial control amidst the crisis, counter-data mapping, as a digitally enabled, joint practice of scene-making, (re)invented dissent territory, enabling dispersed citizen activists to continue to connect and mobilise amidst intense urban policing and social distancing protocols. This article casts new light on the utility and capacity of digital cartography during movement latency while illuminating the understudied contours and consequences of counter-data mapping in a non-Western context.",

          "abstract": "Co-present smartphone use—the use of smartphones in the presence of others—is a prevalent behavior in social contexts. However, the situational mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. While previous research has primarily conceptualized co-present smartphone use as a stable individual disposition and focused on person-level determinants, the role of specific situational characteristics has remained largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, the present study investigates co-present smartphone use from a situational perspective, aiming to gain insights into the situational predictors of co-present smartphone use. We conducted an experience sampling study with 87 participants, reporting on 829 social interactions to examine how co-present use is linked to different types of connection cues (technical, spatial, and mental). The findings show that a person's smartphone use during an interaction is related to the smartphone use of others present and the number of notifications received.",

          "abstract": "This critical conceptual analysis explores the key challenges associated with warm experts, such as family members and friends, in providing informal digital support in later life. We examine the challenges that stem from the dyadic relationship between warm experts and older adults, as well as the individual, social and societal characteristics of being a warm expert with limited resources to provide digital support to older adults. In conclusion, while the contribution of warm experts to digital support in later life is evident, they may lack the necessary resources to meet the heterogeneous needs of older adults from an individual standpoint. From a social perspective, the primary limitation of warm experts as providers of informal support lies in the unequal distribution of the informal digital support they offer. In societal terms, we argue that warm experts should not be seen as the sole solution to the challenges posed by digital inclusion and digital inequalities related to ageing.",

          "abstract": "Cultural heritage institutions have recently experimented with the customization of generative AI and specifically large language models (LLMs) to create chatbots that impersonate historical characters. While this application has the potential to enhance user engagement, challenges remain, especially considering the need to ensure authenticity and historical accuracy and LLMs’ tendency to hallucinate. Through the analysis of the case study of a chatbot developed to impersonate the historical figure of Luigi Einaudi, the first elected president of the Italian Republic, the article interrogates opportunities, problems and risks raised by the customization of generative AI, in a moment when decisions about applying or not applying LLMs are being considered by many cultural heritage institutions around the world. The article, moreover, introduces a variant of the walkthrough method aimed to study AI conversational agents, called ‘talkthrough’, which represents an important addition to the methodological toolbox that can be activated to study generative AI.",

          "authors": "Tom Divon, Tobias Ebbrecht-Hartmann",
          "abstract": "TikTok has become a space where playfulness is the dominant lingo for engaging with serious subjects. On the platform, the Holocaust is mediated through meme-based performances like the #POVHolocaustChallenge, a trend that invited users to re-enact fictionalized memories of Holocaust victims. Our analysis of 250 videos identifies 3 types of Holocaust-related memetic narratives—mem(e)ories: (1) Testimonial Mem(e)ory, where “victims” testify from “heaven” as confessional storytelling; (2) Punitive Mem(e)ory, where “victims” choose to be sent back to the Holocaust as punishment; and (3) Escapist Mem(e)ory, where “victims” time travel from the 1940s to the present for a brief escape. Drawing on interviews with 15 creators and 7 Holocaust institution representatives, we argue that #POV challenges re-mediate past events, transform into education, and serve as a means for forging personal connections to the Holocaust. We introduce TikTok’s affordance of playability as a structural condition that governs participation, with users merging performative storytelling with remix culture and inscribing Holocaust (post)memory into their platformed experiences.",

          "abstract": "This study explores how digital humor functions as a form of critique in contexts where overt dissent is constrained. Focusing on memes shared by members of a Facebook support group for Israeli reservist soldiers’ wives during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the study analyzes how humor helps negotiate personal and collective tensions. Using thematic and critical discourse analysis, we identify four spheres of critique—targeting spouses, social circles, institutions, and broader expectations. These memes convey frustration and resistance not through direct confrontation, but via irony and satire, allowing women to express grievances while remaining aligned with hegemonic national narratives. We conceptualize this as quasi-political expression, where personal complaints, framed humorously, subtly challenge and reinforce dominant discourses. By introducing this concept, the study highlights how individuals in ideologically constrained settings use digital culture not only to resist or reproduce power, but to navigate the blurred boundaries between personal and political life.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how digital affinity groups construct collective identity in the context of the TikTok ban in the United States, which led to a large-scale migration of American users to the Chinese social media platform REDNOTE (Little Red Book). Using Collins’ Interaction Ritual Chains theory as a framework, we conducted participant observation, content analysis, and computational textual analysis of over 1000 high-engagement posts and 9000 comments under the #TikTokRefugee hashtag on REDNOTE. Our findings show that platform algorithms facilitate virtual co-presence and help form symbolic boundaries between American and Chinese users. Through shared experiences, emotional exchanges, and multimodal interactions (such as bilingual memes and cultural symbols), users developed a sense of group belonging and constructed a new “TikTok Refugee” identity. The study reveals a dynamic process of confrontation and integration: while users express resistance to the ban and reinforce group solidarity, they also engage in cross-cultural dialogue and adapt their identities. These results highlight the dual role of platform algorithms and emotional energy in shaping digital communities, offering new insights into how online platforms mediate identity formation in transnational contexts.",

By looking at TikTok’s user experience, I demonstrate that while predictive models are crucial for user engagement, elements of surprise and unpredictability are equally essential for maintaining user interest. The study draws on theories of perception, emotion processing, and affect to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cognitive and embodied dimensions of digital social media experiences. I argue that TikTok’s success lies in its unique integration of both predictive accuracy and serendipitous discovery, creating an “indeterminacy center” that keeps users engaged. This research contributes to the broader understanding of social media dynamics, offering insights into the balance between prediction and serendipity in digital platforms.",

          "abstract": "This study analyzes how short-video platforms, with Douyin as a case, depend on cultural intermediaries (e.g. multi-channel networks and digital marketing agencies) to sustain operations and expand platform power. Unlike existing studies that exaggerate or underestimate cultural intermediaries’ agency, this study offers a middle-ground perspective and conceptualizes it as “infrastructural intermediation,” in which cultural intermediaries act as external dispositifs of platform power in cultural production. Using participant observation and interviews with intermediaries and creators, we identify three primary infrastructural functions: (1) visualizing: converting data into actionable guidance for platform strategy implementation; (2) reinforcing: optimizing creators’ practices to advance monetization; and (3) repairing: remedying deficiencies in technical and institutional mechanisms. As an indispensable component of the platform, they reinforce platformization structures, complete the “last mile” of platform power implementation. This study also reveals how China’s distinctive state-platform relationship shapes the role and strategies of cultural intermediaries.",

          "abstract": "In China, the practice known as suifenzi involves giving money as a gesture of goodwill by guests at celebrations. This tradition has become burdensome, but it remains a social norm. This study examines the psychological processes experienced by Chinese workplace newcomers on suifenzi, seeking to understand how the younger generation is shaped by cultural customs and how these customs evolve through intergenerational transmission. We employed constructivist grounded theory and conducted semi‐structured interviews with ten participants, found that a psychological process model of single‐instance suifenzi, which shows that workplace newcomers: (1) consider four factors: customary consensus, interpersonal interaction, psychological distance, and financial pressure; (2) are dominated by negative or positive state, depending on psychological distance; and (3) attain aftereffects, including increased psychological burden, provision of social support, and promotion of interpersonal adaptation. The model for the development of attitudes and behaviors in recurring suifenzi scenarios outlines a three‐stage process: from enlightenment and learning to exploration and adaptation, culminating in internalization and solidification. The discussion centers on the interdependent self's role in young people through suifenzi, noting that this custom is significantly shaped by the independent self and social mobility during intergenerational transmission, and the great significance of the interdependent self in contemporary society.",

          "authors": "Yuvamathi Gandhi, Ashley K. Randall, Mateo Cruz, Stephanie Pfirman",
          "abstract": "Women in historically male‐dominated careers such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contend with masculine contest cultures (MCCs). MCCs are work environments that encourage competition to achieve dominance, promotions, and other rewards. Such workplaces induce stress, particularly for those in the numerical minority, who experience pressure to adhere to masculine norms. Although support from one's romantic partner can buffer negative experiences of workplace stress, limited research exists about the role of partner (positive) dyadic coping when faced with hostile work environments. Grounded in the systemic transactional model of dyadic coping, we conducted a two‐phase sequential mixed‐method study. Phase 1 included a cross‐sectional study that examined whether women faculty's perceptions of MCC in STEM departments at research‐focused universities were associated with turnover intentions, and if partner positive dyadic coping buffered this association. Phase 2 included a qualitative study, applying a thematic analysis to explore how women STEM faculty experience their partner's supportive behaviors during times of workplace stress. Findings highlight how romantic partner support can buffer negative experiences of workplace stress. This research calls attention to university administrators to think beyond the workplace when identifying support resources for faculty in promoting well‐being.",

Through a series of focus groups and interviews ( n = 25) and a community-wide survey ( n = 155) among members of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe (Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA), we document the connection between local fish/shellfish consumption and Tribal cultural identity, how PFAS contamination may threaten this identity, and explore how to more effectively communicate health risks to Tribal communities.",

A total of 1,392 participants in China completed a survey for this study. Results indicate that science belief significantly predicts both perceived threat and efficacy, which subsequently elicit the four correction behaviors. Multigroup analysis further revealed that the proposed science belief model varies by levels of interdependent self-construal. Among individuals with high interdependence, science belief exerted a stronger influence on perceived threat and efficacy, and efficacy more strongly predicted public correction and refutation behaviors.",

          "authors": "Jennifer Ihm, Eun-mee Kim",
          "abstract": "What news spreads on social media equally depends on what news users do and do not share. However, prior research has predominantly focused on successful news sharing , overlooking the equally consequential behavior of deliberate news withholding. This study addresses that gap by proposing a self-presentation model of deliberate news withholding on social media, integrating three dominant approaches previously used to examine successful news sharing: (1) the informational approach focusing on the virality of news content, (2) the structural approach emphasizing social media network characteristics, and (3) the relational approach centered on users’ self-presentation and management of relationships with their audience. Specifically, this study combines two types of data: (1) survey data from 408 users and (2) a text analysis of news content they withheld in their three most active chatrooms. We examine how users selectively withhold news with varying levels of emotionality, argumentativeness, and hard or soft news value, depending on the characteristics of their audience networks – particularly network size and tie strength – and in relation to three self-presentational goals: self-construction, privacy protection, and audience-pleasing. Findings show that users strategically withhold varied types of news content across different user-audience networks to meet distinct self-presentational goals, thereby managing audience expectations and curating their online image. By shifting attention from news sharing to news withholding, this study offers a more complete account of how everyday users shape news flows and social discourse on social media.",

          "authors": "Waqas Ejaz, Mary Sanford, Richard Fletcher",
          "abstract": "Despite the importance of climate news in shaping public engagement, little is known about how different types of media – mainstream and non-mainstream – relate to pro-climate behaviour, and what psychological processes condition these effects, particularly in cross-national contexts. This study addresses that gap by examining the emotional and evaluative mechanisms linking climate news use to pro-climate behavioural intentions (e.g., using less energy at home, flying less often, and repairing rather than replacing), and how these relationships vary across countries. Drawing on online survey data from 8,541 respondents across eight countries – Brazil, France, Germany, India, Japan, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, and the United States – we test a multi-group structural equation model with climate anxiety as a mediator and media trust as a moderator. Results show that mainstream news use is consistently associated with stronger behavioural intent across all countries. Non-mainstream media use has positive but more context-dependent effects, especially in settings where digital platforms dominate climate information. Climate anxiety emerges as a robust and universal predictor of behavioural intention, though it is not consistently shaped by media use – indicating that emotional responses may stem from sources beyond the news. Media trust amplifies the direct effects of mainstream news use but does not moderate the indirect pathway via anxiety. Overall, the findings reveal a surprising degree of cross-national consistency in how news use, media trust, and emotional responses shape climate engagement.",

Altay et al. found that news use increases surveillance knowledge and awareness of true and false news, while decreasing belief in false news. We conducted a two-wave panel survey ( N = 3,395) to replicate these findings in two new countries: France and Germany. The replication reinforces the conclusions of the original study: we found that higher news consumption predicted greater surveillance knowledge acquisition across the waves, as well as greater awareness of and belief in true news stories. News consumption also increased awareness of false news stories without increasing belief in false news stories. These findings strengthen the idea that news helps people become more informed and better at discerning truth from falsehoods.",
