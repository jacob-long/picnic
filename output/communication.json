          "authors": "Alexander Vandewalle, Richard Cole",
          "abstract": "The various ways that players actually play historical games, and how history – or players’ conceptualization thereof – impacts play processes, remains understudied in the field of historical game studies. This study investigates how players make decisions in historical games, and assesses to what extent such choices are directed by historical considerations or ideas of history. Specifically, we examined this through the perspective of ergodic characterization, or players’ nontrivial involvement in the characterization of their in-game character. We conducted an active play experiment where Classics students from Belgium and the United Kingdom ( n = 10) played Assassin’s Creed Odyssey ( Ubisoft Quebec, 2018 ) for eight weeks and reported on their experiences through questionnaires, note-taking, and focus group interviews. We found that players’ characterization decisions in historical games were driven by four play interests: ludic (i.e., characterization based on the gameplay advantages that choices might bring, or to test out specific affordances of the game system), prosthetic (characterization as an extension of the player’s own personality), narrative (characterization based on the character’s narrative and background), and referential (characterization in reference to other characters, including historical ones). We also report other findings related to characterization and the role of history in historical game experiences. This article offers new insights into player experiences of historical games, contributes empirical data to existing research on characterization in games, and advocates for active play as a research method in historical game studies.",

          "abstract": "Smart TVs, which enable unprecedented viewing data to be collected at device level, are reconfiguring business practices in television advertising and audience measurement. Using a video fingerprinting technology known as automated content recognition (ACR), most smart TVs can now recognize virtually all content displayed on the TV screen, allowing precise targeting and re-targeting of ads to users based on their viewing behaviour and prior ad exposure. This article examines how TV manufacturers including Samsung, LG and Vizio integrated ACR technology into their businesses between 2012 and 2022. Drawing on infrastructural theories of connected TV and digital advertising, I show how ACR has contributed to TV manufacturers’ wider goal of becoming digital ad platforms, shifting the underlying power structures of both the consumer electronics and television advertising industries.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the paradigm shift in the film and animation industry driven by the advent of real-time rendering technology. Through an approach combining qualitative interviews with industry practitioners and quantitative analysis of survey data, the study delves into the multifaceted impact of this technology. The research highlights the technology’s potential to enhance creativity, speed, and efficiency in production, while also emphasizing the challenges it poses, including technical complexities and the need for specialized knowledge. A notable theme of democratization emerges, with participants indicating that real-time rendering can help make high-quality production tools more accessible and enable a broader range of creators to participate in the industry. This study also reflects on the complexities of technological democratization, emphasizing that access to real-time tools remains uneven and shaped by broader structural factors.",

          "abstract": "This study conducts a conceptual replication and extension of prior research on overconfidence in discerning political misinformation, shifting focus to health. Using data from a national survey of American adults linked to web-browsing records (N=593), we investigated the prevalence and correlates of overconfidence in this domain. Consistent with earlier findings, overconfidence was most pronounced among low-performing individuals, replicating the “Dunning–Kruger Effect.” However, decomposition analyses revealed that the associations between overconfidence and behavioral correlates—exposure to low-credibility health websites and belief in cancer-related misinformation—are primarily accounted for by deficits in actual discernment ability rather than a lack of metacognitive insight. This replication highlights the robustness of the link between poor discernment and behavioral outcomes across domains. These results highlight the need for interventions that improve evaluation skills or address underlying dispositional factors, such as distrust in science and conspiracist worldviews.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes how streaming users in Latin America experience time in relation to platforms. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach that employed daily reports of platform usage, focus groups, and “rich picture” analysis, we examine the cases of two countries with some of the highest digital media usage statistics in Latin America: Brazil and Costa Rica. We conceptualize platform users in these countries as “temporal publics,” defined by their varied experiences of time and the complexity of their “time work” practices. The article discusses how individuals engage in recalibration practices to navigate the temporal ambivalences of everyday life and what they perceive as the power of streaming platforms to control their time. By doing so, we demonstrate how users simultaneously reproduce and subvert specific temporal orders through their everyday interactions with streaming services, reflecting a sustained and intentional ambivalence toward the platforms’ power.",

          "abstract": "Despite a rise in identity-centric communication scholarship, there is a lack of theory and evidence regarding how media use relates to the on-going alignment between political and social identities (i.e., identity alignment). We offer a framework for theorizing this dynamic and apply it to examine the relationship between Americans’ media diets and on-going psychological alignment between political and social identities in the United States (i.e., partisan social sorting). We use data from 33,690 American respondents from three national surveys: one longitudinal (1972–2020) and two fielded in 2020. There is evidence that identity alignment (i.e., sorting) has grown over time, but only among those who are most interested and attentive to politics and media. In 2020 surveys, we find no evidence that the frequency of media use was a significant predictor of social sorting. Instead, the composition of individuals’ media diets predicted the alignment between their social and political identities.",

This article seeks to address this gap. Rather than just a synonym for shift or change, I define trend as a temporally bounded, dynamic pattern of observable change and argue that such a concept deserves greater prominence within the study of media and communication. In addition to this definition, I theorize trends by characterizing the trend’s key features, exploring its relationship to media, and mapping its connection to questions that animate media and communication research. The case of “brat summer” of 2024 is offered as an exemplary case from which trend’s core features may be discerned. The article’s primary contribution is to advance the trend as a central concept through which communication and media studies researchers may think more comprehensively and critically about change.",

          "abstract": "The rapid dissemination of misinformation has raised concerns about its persistence despite corrective efforts, as the influence of fact-checking often diminishes quickly. This study explores “time” as a central theoretical and methodological construct in understanding the effects of fact-checking interventions. Across two large-scale, pre-registered panel experiments (N = 6,983), we examine the temporal dynamics of both the persuasive and unintended consequences of factual corrections. Results show that while fact-checks yield immediate belief updating, their effects largely fade within two weeks and do not produce durable belief echoes. In Study 2, we introduce a novel design treating time lag as an experimental treatment and show that simple interventions aimed at increasing the temporal accessibility of corrections—termed “accuracy reminders”—significantly extend the durability of their effects. These findings reconceptualize correction effects as inherently temporal processes, advancing communication theory and offering scalable, time-sensitive strategies for sustaining the influence of fact-checking in dynamic information environments.",

          "abstract": "Disabled people are overrepresented as victims of sexual violence and family violence, but are often excluded from research and the development of communication campaigns, laws, and interventions. Grounded in the culture-centered approach, we undertook 77 qualitative interviews with predominantly Māori (Indigenous) and low-income disabled individuals to identify primary prevention needs for reducing family and sexual violence. Participants articulated disability as being structural, intersectional, and layered with erasure, contributing to conditions that perpetuate violence. Erasure and the resulting loss of agency were pervasive across diverse disabilities and participant groups, with Māori bearing a disproportionate burden. Emergent in the participants’ narratives were strategies around addressing communication inequalities and grounding prevention resources within local community contexts, set against structural determinants of violence perpetuated by the settler colonial State. This study challenges the hegemonic approach to addressing sexual violence and family violence, revealing a relationship between communicative and material forms of violence.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the paradoxical relationship between prosocial content on social media and the self-promotional nature of many social media platforms. Specifically, our study examines how differences in two perceived affordances—persistence and visibility—affect how women viewers evaluate the authenticity of men who post allyship messages on Instagram. Additionally, we examine how viewer perceptions of comment deletion and comment restriction impact source evaluations. Results indicate that greater perceived persistence and visibility led women viewers to rate ostensible allies as more authentic and less self-interested. Moreover, comment deletion and restriction were found to partially affect how viewers evaluated ally authenticity and motive, providing additional support to warranting theory. Implications for promoting prosocial messaging and digital allyship online are discussed.",

          "authors": "Jieni Zhou, Taylor N. West, Catherine J. Berman, Barbara L. Fredrickson",
          "abstract": "The affective quality of social interaction is linked to the well-being of individuals, relationships, and communities. This construct has been measured in multiple ways, albeit rarely concurrently. The current study tests for convergent validity across three methodologically distinct measures of the affective quality of social interaction. In a video-recorded laboratory session, a sample of university students ( N = 274) got acquainted with an unknown peer in a 10-min semi-structured conversation that used the fast friends procedure with escalating self-disclosure. After the conversation, participants privately completed the Perceived Positivity Resonance Scale to indicate the degree to which they experienced mutual, kind-hearted positive affect. Later, trained observers coded videos (with audio) to identify wide-ranging dyad-level behavioral indicators of positivity resonance. In addition, audio recordings were submitted to an automated voice-to-text transcription service that provided high-resolution time stamps for turn-taking to compute participants’ conversational response time. A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated good fit with all three indicators loading significantly on a single latent factor. In addition, relative to single indicators, the resulting factor score (i.e., affective quality of social interaction) showed the most consistent associations with prosocial tendencies and positive mental health. These findings (1) are the first to show the convergence of self-reported and observer-coded positivity resonance, (2) extend the evidence that these indices of positivity resonance align with conversational response time in the context of strangers getting acquainted, and (3) replicate past evidence of benefits linked to the positive affective quality of social interaction. Discussion centers on theoretical and methodological implications for studies of social connectedness.",

          "abstract": "With ghosting emerging as a prominent trend in interpersonal relationships, questions have arisen about how individuals perceive both ghosting and those who engage in it within cross-sex close relationships. This study employed a between-subjects experimental design with a 2 (Relationship Context: Friendship vs. Romantic Relationship) × 2 (Participant Gender: Female vs. Male) × 2 (Ghoster Gender: Female vs. Male) framework. Participants ( N = 224; M = 23.76, SD = 4.61 , range = 18–50; 50% female) evaluated one of four hypothetical scenarios regarding the appropriateness of ghosting and the likability of the ghoster. The findings revealed that ghosting was perceived as equally inappropriate in both heterosexual romantic and cross-sex friendship contexts. Male participants rated ghosters as more likable in romantic scenarios, while female participants showed no significant differences across contexts. Both genders viewed ghosting as more acceptable when performed by their own gender, reflecting an in-group bias. However, while male participants rated ghosters of both genders equally likable, female participants rated female ghosters as more likable than male ghosters. Furthermore, prior engagement in ghosting was associated with more favorable attitudes toward both ghosting and ghosters, whereas having been ghosted did not significantly alter perceptions. These findings highlight the nuanced interplay of gender, relational context, and personal experiences in shaping perceptions of ghosting, offering valuable insights into the social and interpersonal mechanisms that drive evaluations of relationship behaviors, particularly within a non-Western cultural context. Future research should explore a broader range of gender identities and relationship dynamics to better capture diverse experiences and deepen our understanding of this common relational behavior.",

          "abstract": "Despite rising economic inequality in the United States, lower-class Americans have yet to demand economic redistribution in overwhelming numbers. Analysis of the 2020 American National Election Study finds that right-partisan media use is associated with lower support for redistributive policies, and this relationship is strongest among individuals who identify as lower-class or Independent. We also found the relationship between right-partisan media use and taxing the rich was strongest among lower-class Republicans and upper-class Democrats. We discuss the potential for right-partisan media to breed system-justifying beliefs and shape opposition to economic redistribution among those who might benefit most from such policies.",

In a preregistered between-subjects survey experiment on U.K. WhatsApp users ( N = 2,580), we showed participants WhatsApp messages containing true or false news attributed to either British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News or no source. Attribution to BBC News significantly increased message credibility. Importantly, however, participants’ responses to false messages attributed to BBC News were statistically indistinguishable from their responses to true messages. On personal messaging, source credibility can boost the spread of accurate news but can also be used deceptively to propagate falsehoods.",

Using a population demography and audio clips from the introductions of 25 established esports podcasts, this study examines how processes of isomorphism and assemblage have been used by esports podcasters to build normative, cognitive, and sociopolitical legitimacy both for their shows and the genre. We found that esports podcasts introductions borrow elements of traditional sports journalism and talk radio, as well as “talkier” styles and elements of “podcastness” from newer media. At the same time, esports podcasters seem to move away from professional radio broadcast styles as their shows mature, signaling the development of unique professional norms in the podcast space.",

          "abstract": "Our study examines how external factors, including media exposure, personal values, and media framing (i.e. national security vs free speech), influence non-users’ support for a national TikTok ban in the United States via an online experiment-embedded survey ( N = 498). Results show that while perceived national security threats predicted ban support only in the national security condition, concerns about free speech violations consistently decreased support across all conditions. An analysis of open-ended responses further demonstrated that participants adopted the framing language consistent with their experimental condition. Findings suggest that personal value framing in the media, especially those related to free speech values, plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on social media regulation policies. We thus contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how media framing influences policy preferences for emerging digital governance issues such as social media regulations. Other implications were also discussed.",

          "abstract": "Messaging groups are emerging as “meso-spaces”—digital environments that enable sustained dialogue and collective action through their distinct affordances. We examine how such spaces facilitate civic self-organization through their hybrid online/offline, public/private, and local/global dynamics and how they function as local civic infrastructure during times of crisis. Using a mixed-methods analytical approach, we examined 47 public Telegram groups from Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified a fundamental tension between political discussion and practical help in these spaces, resolvable through active horizontal participation (including norm negotiation and self-moderation), or strict vertical moderation. Additional challenges included a lack of access to vulnerable groups and limited outreach to local civil society actors, both of which hindered group activity and structural connections within local civic infrastructure. Despite these challenges, our study highlights the potential of local chat groups for self-organization, albeit primarily among privileged urban individuals. We discuss the implications for democratic theory and practice.",

Our findings reveal significant alignment between professional guidelines and industry practices, which is especially pronounced for Twitch and YouTube. However, industry standards only partially address the policies of adult camming platforms and AfreecaTV, a Korean-based livestreaming service, revealing notable absences in how Trust and Safety imagines the boundaries of the industry.

Combining a codebook-guided quantitative analysis with a qualitative interpretation of representative images, we demonstrate the merits of studying incel imagery to enhance more frequent methods such as textual analysis. Specifically, our study documents three major roles played by images in the incelosphere. First, they consolidate incel misogynist and lookist narratives by exhibiting archetypal group categories. Second, they structure the community’s collective affective expression, intensifying shared emotions and shaping members’ perceptions of self and others. Third, images reflect divisions within the incelosphere, demonstrating the ideological and platform-specific heterogeneity of this ecosystem and evidencing influence from far-right digital milieux.",

However, these systems are subject to concerns regarding inherent biases, as their training on vast text corpora may encode and amplify societal biases. This study investigates overestimation bias in LLM-generated climate assessments, wherein the impacts of climate change are exaggerated relative to expert consensus. Through non-parametric statistical methods, the study compares expert ratings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2023 Synthesis Report with responses from GPT-family LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs systematically overestimate climate change impacts, and that this bias is more pronounced when the models are prompted in the role of a climate scientist. These findings underscore the critical need to align LLM-generated climate assessments with expert consensus to prevent misperception and foster informed public discourse.",

          "abstract": "Democratic citizenship is continuously evolving, shaped by changing political, social, and media contexts. Digital natives—those who have come of age in environments where digital technologies are embedded in everyday life—have experienced citizenship in markedly different ways than previous generations. While the internet has broadened the repertoire of participatory behaviors, existing research has struggled to capture the complexity of contemporary citizenship. Drawing on deliberative systems theory and a triadic framework of citizenship—examining normative expectations, behaviors, and attitudes—this study develops a nuanced exploration of citizenship orientations. Using an innovative questionnaire and latent profile analysis of survey data from Norwegian digital natives (aged 18–40), we identify seven distinct citizenship types that reveal the multidimensional nature of contemporary citizenship. Our research moves beyond binary distinctions between active and passive citizenship, emphasizing the importance of both expressive and receptive behaviors across online and offline contexts. By highlighting the diverse roles citizens play in sustaining democratic processes, we offer new insights into citizenship in the digital age, demonstrating how different citizens contribute to the democratic system through varied and interdependent forms of engagement.",

The FIE framework centers on three interrelated concepts: persona capital (algorithmically optimized self-performance), staged class (the commodification of social status as symbolic spectacle), and platform capitalism (the cultural and ideological shaping of profitable identity performances). Through a case study of Chinese influencer Sister Yu, the article illustrates how identity under the FIE is engineered rather than expressed, shaped by state-platform synergies that reward particular narratives of gender, labor, and class. By doing so, this study critiques the neoliberal assumptions embedded in Western influencer discourse and offers an alternative lens to understand the complex interplay of identity, governance, and platform logics. The research contributes to ongoing debates on platform labor, attention economies, and the global contours of influencer culture.",

          "authors": "Stephen A. Rains, Kevin Coe, Kate Kenski, Yotam Shmargad",
          "abstract": "Drawing from dynamic systems theory, we examine how incivility is collectively constructed in an online discussion community. Using secondary data consisting of comments shared over a 3-week period to an online news community, we identified three sequences that reflect collective incivility practices. Whereas the persistent incivility sequence included a large proportion of uncivil comments, incivility occurred infrequently in the sporadic incivility sequence and not at all in the no incivility sequence. Once the persistent incivility or sporadic incivility sequences appeared, discussions were more likely to return to these sequences than the no incivility sequence. Contrary to our predictions, sequences containing incivility shaped discussion processes by depressing explicit expressions of agreement and disagreement. The results of this study demonstrate how the collective behavior of online community members contributes to the production and effects of incivility.",

          "authors": "Camille Alloing, Elsa Fortant, Julien Pierre, Fabien Richert, Rémi Palisser",
          "abstract": "Since their inception, social media platforms have continuously developed innovations and discourses centered on affective and emotional dimensions. Platform owners invest heavily in research and development to both identify and elicit feelings and emotions. However, the research conducted by these companies on this topic remains understudied. In this study, we present a systematic and critical analysis of the scientific literature published by the research teams of Meta (Facebook, Instagram) and Google (YouTube) regarding the analysis and processing of their users’ emotions. We first demonstrate that this literature relies on schematic definitions of emotions, thereby simplifying the complexity of affective phenomena for facilitating their automated detection. We then highlight the objectives pursued by these research efforts, the majority of which aim to promote users’ well-being through the instrumentalization of what affects them. Finally, we examine the various methods employed to identify emotions, which primarily serve to feed these platforms’ machine learning algorithms with data labeled as emotional. Beyond their scientific contributions, we consider these studies as narratives targeted at the scientific community and investors, serving to legitimize and support the development of specific innovations. Analyzing these works enables us to examine how the techniques, methods, and applications developed by these two companies commodify emotions and actively shape users’ online behaviors.",
