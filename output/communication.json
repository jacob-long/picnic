          "authors": "Wei Wei, Zhonghao Qu, Pengfei Jia",
          "abstract": "Digital learning has become increasingly important in recent years, providing students with flexible and convenient possibilities to advance their knowledge and skills. However, making the most of distant learning presents several challenging conditions, such as student involvement, instructional effects, personalization, and virtual environment collaboration. This project investigates the application of the Louvain algorithm, a community detection set of rules, in web-based academic frameworks to address these issues and enhance the efficacy of online education. In this study, we examine the advantages, problems, and applicability of using the Louvain method to enhance virtual learning. The algorithm’s performance in various network sizes and densities is examined with three amazing datasets, including the Karate membership, the Bottlenose dolphin network, and books on US politics. The findings demonstrate how well the Louvain method captures the structural characteristics and connection patterns of various networks. It performs admirably in terms of information flow, community density patterns, and enhancing online training frameworks. The study also includes large-scale datasets from social networking sites like Facebook, Google, and Pokec. In these bigger networks, the algorithm can adapt to different levels of network density and interconnectivity. The results suggest that the Louvain set of principles may be used to improve the effectiveness of online training, assisting in aid distribution, content distribution, and student engagement. This approach can lead to higher academic outcomes and increased accessibility for novices worldwide by optimizing the design and execution of web-based learning platforms. While this study provides insightful information on the Louvain algorithm’s suitability for online learning, further research is necessary to identify additional datasets and encompass a much larger range of evaluation criteria. Overall, the results point to a bright future for the application of network analysis and optimization approaches in the context of online learning, encouraging better learning outcomes.",

          "authors": "Simon Hewitt",
          "abstract": "This article explores an important moment in late 1990s US film and videogame industrial convergence. It does so through a Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) of the contemporaneous industrial paratexts surrounding three film-to-subscription-based online videogame adaptations, Aliens Online (1998), Godzilla Online (1998), and Independence Day Online (2000). It asks why these adaptations failed critically and commercially despite the critical praise and evident consumer demand at the time for videogame adaptations of major films like GoldenEye 007 (1997), and subscription-based online games like Ultima Online (1997). Moreover, it asks what these failures tell us about US videogame and cinematic convergence in the late 1990s. In seeking answers to these questions, this article intervenes into Thomas Leitch’s discussions of ‘adaptation strategies’, as well as Jason Mittell’s ideas around ‘unbalanced’ transmedia. It uses these interventions to demonstrate why it is vital to consider the industrial contexts necessitating each adaptation. The RTA reveals that these include the impact of new videogame distribution models, the threat posed by competitors, and the massive profit potential of subscription-based online gaming. This article ultimately demonstrates that in productions of transmedia products like these games, multiple stakeholders can operate in hierarchical corporate structures with differing levels of power to impact their production, which I refer to as their ‘authorial agency’. It is therefore vital also to consider the ‘primary’ strategy driving each adaptation. This article’s central argument is that to fully understand the failure of these adaptations, we should recognise how ‘promotion’ was the primary adaptation strategy that most impacted each game’s production and therefore undermined their quality. This has substantial implications for how we think about our contemporary media ecology in which the US videogame industry is now more profitable and potentially exerts greater authorial agency than its conglomerate partner, US cinema.",

          "title": "Beyond age marginalization: Understanding the success of older influencers on Douyin",
          "authors": "Yingwen Wang, Hui Lin",
          "abstract": "Older content creators gain popularity on Douyin and become a significant part of the platform economy. However, much existing research concentrates on young, beauty content creators with limited attention paid to older content creators. Drawing on the theoretical framework of digital labour and ageing studies, this article examines the reasons why and how older adults become influencers on Douyin, how these creators gain a follower base on such a youth-led platform as a marginalized group, and how they navigate precarity and challenges to achieve visibility on Douyin. Based on in-depth interviews and participant observation with older Chinese Wanghong creators, we identify four key motivations driving their participation in short-video production: personal fulfilment and expression, social engagement and community contribution, economic empowerment, and strategic account development. We argue that these late-life influencers strategically negotiate platform labour for both self-realization and social value, challenging stereotypes of older adults as digitally disengaged. The findings reveal that digital platforms enable ‘active ageing’ through cultural production while simultaneously introducing new forms of precarity and algorithmic work. By foregrounding older Wanghong’s experiences in China’s platform economy, the paper extends theories of digital labour to a new demographic, showing how cultural values and generational context inflect the influencer phenomenon. This study contributes to ongoing debates surrounding the digital economy, self-representation, and ageing by illuminating specific mechanisms through which older Wanghong creators strategically blend entrepreneurial aspirations with communal goals in their online engagements. We conclude with implications for platform inclusivity and a call to recognize the diverse actors shaping influencer culture in the global digital era.",

          "title": "A minor history of interactive movies: Brilliant Digital Entertainment and the dot-com bubble",
          "authors": "Cassandra Barkman",
          "abstract": "This article conducts a genealogical analysis of Brilliant Digital Entertainment’s multipath movies as a minor history of videogames. Brilliant Digital Entertainment was a company that, from its formation in 1996 until the dot-com bust of 2001, released what they dubbed ‘multipath movies’. These were 3D animated interactive movies based on popular IP like Superman, Xena: Warrior Princess and more that allowed players to make decisions at key moments. These multipath movies emerged at a time of increasing synergy between Hollywood cinema and videogames in the 1990s. Through an analysis of Brilliant Digital Entertainment’s brief venture, this article examines the wider cultural, technological and economic forces that shaped the company’s trajectory. This article argues that Brilliant Digital Entertainment, through its adoption and integration of rhetoric and operating models from the dot-com bubble at the time, treated the media convergence exemplified by interactive movies as a ‘new economic space’ defined by its ‘novel’ combination of media forms, imagined audience and association with the internet.",

          "authors": "Danny Yihan Jia, Yunwen Wang",
          "abstract": "Unhealthy social media habits may foster procrastination, leading to negative psychological and behavioral outcomes. The rising prevalence of procrastinatory short-form video (SFV) use (e.g., on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) highlights the need to better understand how established predictors of problematic media use operate in this emerging media environment. To address this gap, this study investigated the motivational factors underlying procrastinatory SFV use and its relationship with user well-being. Using an online survey of college students ( N = 549) from two U.S. universities, structural equation modeling revealed that individuals with lower self-control, stronger habitual SFV use, and greater involvement (enjoyment, escapism, and social connectedness) were more prone to procrastinatory SFV use, which in turn was associated with higher stress levels, poorer overall sleep quality, longer sleep latency, more sleep disturbances, and greater daytime dysfunction, but not with academic performance. This study contributes to the understanding of motivational factors underlying procrastinatory SFV use and its associations with user well-being. Theoretical contributions to the study of irrational media use, practical recommendations for mitigating procrastinatory SFV engagement, and directions for longitudinal and context-sensitive future research are discussed.",

          "authors": "Xiyuan Yang, Kexin Ba, Jiushu Xie, Yan Wang, Li Kong, Yikang Liu",
          "abstract": "Social media plays a powerful role in accelerating the spread of misinformation, especially in the mental health domain, where misleading content may even cause disasters. Given the extensive coverage and complexity of social media data, manually moderating online misinformation is infeasible. Therefore, the present study proposes an integrated framework that combines qualitative analysis and deep learning to automatically detect and evaluate mental health misinformation. Guided by expert interviews and grounded theory, in the present study, a 21-level, fine-grained credibility assessment framework covering seven dimensions was developed. Using the framework, in this study, 814 Chinese social media posts were manually annotated, and a high-quality dataset was constructed. On this dataset, we trained and evaluated three deep learning models, that is, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), to automatically assess the credibility of mental health content. The results show that BERT, GRU, and RoBERTa models are effective at leveraging a range of clear sentiment-related cues and surface-level patterns to evaluate mental health misinformation on social media, particularly on dimensions such as Inflammatory Expression and One-sidedness of Expression. However, all three models face challenges in evaluating evidence quality and detecting context-dependent misinformation. When dealing with these challenges, BERT and GRU outperform RoBERTa, particularly in dimensions such as Logical Rigor. This study provides a robust, scalable, and expert-informed approach to improve the credibility of mental health information online.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how European media portrayed Syrian refugees in 2015 and Ukrainian refugees in 2022, across seven national contexts. Drawing on the GDELT database of news articles and its automated sentiment analysis, the study compares the tone and salience of coverage surrounding two highly symbolic mediatic events: the death of Syrian child Alan Kurdi in 2015 and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2022. Results reveal stark disparities: Ukrainian refugees were consistently represented more positively than Syrian refugees and non-Syrian/non-Ukrainian refugees. These findings provide quantitative evidence of how cultural, racial, and geopolitical proximity shape refugee representations in European media, thereby confirming previous literature. While some prior scholarship has demonstrated these dynamics, this article contributes to existent literature by offering a large-scale, cross-national, and event-based comparative analysis.",

          "authors": "Mohammad Olfat, Martina Topic-Rutherford, Marzieh Mohammad Beig, Fatemeh Barkhi",
          "abstract": "Purpose Despite green influencer marketing campaigns extensively shape followers' behaviors, they are still based on trial and error. This study seeks an effective green influencer marketing for a sustainable world. Drawing on the green advertising skepticism perspective, commitment-trust theory and stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model, the impact of influencers' interactive practices on followers' green purchase intention considering the mediating roles of perceived influencers' pro-environmental behaviors by followers and their green attitudes has been investigated. Design/methodology/approach To validate the measurement and conceptual models, 272 followers of influencers who promote sustainable lifestyles and green products were surveyed and the collected data were analyzed using PLS-SEM with the assistance of Warp-PLS 8.0 software. Findings The results showed that there are U-shaped curvilinear relationships between influencers' interactive practices and followers' attitude toward influencers' pro-environmental behaviors in three dimensions: environmental concern, responsibility and protection. Followers' attitude toward influencers' pro-environmental behaviors shapes their green attitude, resulting in their green purchase intention. Practical implications This study highlights that transparency and interactive engagement by influencers enhance trust and perceived authenticity, encouraging followers to adopt eco-friendly behaviors. For effective green influencer marketing, influencers should maintain credibility and strong follower relationships, while businesses should partner with genuinely environmentally committed influencers. Originality/value This study shows that followers' attitude toward influencers' pro-environmental behaviors evolves as influencers' interaction with followers deepens through their interactive practices. It is among the few studies addressing effective green influencer marketing.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the impact of social media usage on the career outcomes of senior executives at S&amp;P 1500 firms. Design/methodology/approach This study integrates signaling, social capital and human capital theories, and adopts a difference-in-differences analysis, enhanced by a novel deep learning-based method. It examines how senior executives' impression management (IM) activities on social media influence their career outcomes. Findings Empirical results reveal that senior executives' IM in the form of establishing a Twitter account and engaging in visibility-enhancing activities (i.e. frequent work-related tweeting, hashtagging, mentioning and receiving a high number of likes and retweets) can significantly improve their career outcomes. In addition, as a type of visual IM, the strategic use of visual IM through profile photos also plays a critical role in attracting employers' attention. Practical implications Senior executives, especially those with low public visibility, can leverage social media to build a personal brand and use IM strategies to boost career prospects. Employers and executive recruiters may incorporate social media content into candidate evaluations. Originality/value This work contributes to the literature by systematically examining how senior executives utilize both textual and visual IM strategies on social media to influence career prospects.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Social media (SM) provides a hotbed for online deviance and researchers have conducted a series of studies on this behavior. This study presents the current state of research on online deviance in social media (ODSM) with strong interpersonal attributes and develops comprehensive frameworks to better understand the interactive behaviors of different user roles. Through the above analysis, we aim to identify meaningful directions for future research in this area. Design/methodology/approach This study systematically analyzes 44 articles on ODSM published in the leading information systems journals between January 2014 and March 2024. Additionally, it discusses 31 empirical studies focusing on two forms of user behavior in SM (i.e. generative and reactive) and proposes two integrative frameworks based on social cognitive theory and the transactional theory of stress and coping. Findings This study distinguishes different forms of ODSM and examines the time trend, foci, theoretical frameworks, methodologies, contexts and samples of current research. Additionally, it explains the key constructs and relationships of users’ generative and reactive behaviors in ODSM events. Originality/value This study provides a systematic and comprehensive review of existing research on ODSM. Recognizing the diversity of ODSM forms and the differences and connections among them, we propose two theoretical frameworks and five research questions for future research. It contributes to the literature on users’ deviant behavior in SM and provides insights into the understanding and management of such behavior.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Knowledge contribution in community-driven knowledge-sharing platforms is crucial for fostering innovation and collaboration. However, designing an effective framework to ensure both contribution quality and quantity remains a challenge. To address this, our study explores the impact of a holistic portfolio of gamification features and user motivation on knowledge contribution, focusing on the widely used knowledge-sharing platform Stack Overflow. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a cross-sectional survey informed by a preparatory analysis identifying Stack Overflow's gamification features through literature review and expert validation. The survey was then distributed to Stack Overflow users (n = 236) to test the relationships between the motivational dimensions of gamification features, the motivational state of inspiration, and knowledge contribution using a structural equation model. Findings The results of our study show that the two motivational dimensions achievement-related features and social-related features showed a significant influence on “inspired by”; “inspired by” is a positive predictor of “inspired to”; “inspired to” is a positive predictor of quality and quantity of contribution; and quantity and quality of contributions show a significant relationship. Originality/value The study highlights the potential of inspiration as a motivational state to explain user behavior in Information Systems research. Therefore, the study illuminates the crucial context of knowledge-sharing platforms. In this regard, the study extends existing gamification theories by identifying motivational dimensions of gamification that evoke inspiration and knowledge contributions.",

          "authors": "Suparna Dhar, Indranil Bose",
          "abstract": "Purpose Spam messages on social networking sites (SNS) cause financial loss and social unrest. While spam classification has been studied widely, scholars have not studied their diffusibility. Diffusibility of spam messages is their ability to spread quickly and reach a large audience. Diffusibility is measured by incorporating the virality and popularity of messages. Design/methodology/approach Deep learning (DL) techniques are used to extract novel features from 84,810 spam tweets. Diffusibility is computed from retweets and likes. SHAP and permutation importance analysis are used to determine the features that impact diffusibility. The Mann–Kendall test is performed to test the drift. A machine learning (ML) model for classifying diffusibility is developed through stages of improvement. Findings The statistical analysis of the features shows a significant difference between the high and low diffusibility classes of spam tweets. The novel features that are extracted from the tweet content and the user profile predict the diffusibility of spam tweets with an accuracy of 89.5%. Expressions in the profile image (PI) and the pronounceability of screen name (SN) rank among the top predictors of spam. A moving window approach is able to address the problem of drift and improve the prediction of diffusibility. Originality/value The paper presents the application of deep learning to extract novel features, such as the profile images' blurriness and the SN's pronounceability. It pioneers the study of the diffusibility of spam tweets that will help diminish the spread of spam tweets. The study aims to reduce risks, such as financial loss and social unrest, that is fueled by fast-spreading spam tweets.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study tries to unravel the autonomy paradox by shedding light on the joint effects of ICT-induced invasion and ICT-induced autonomy through a moderated mediation analysis. Design/methodology/approach The research model is empirically tested by a survey of 230 employees who use mobile ICTs after working hours for work purposes. Partial Least Squares (PLS) and PROCESS tools were used to validate the proposed hypotheses. Findings This research showed that ICT-induced overload mediated the relationship between ICT-induced invasion and strain. Besides, ICT-induced autonomy was found to strengthen the relationship between ICT-induced invasion and ICT-induced overload, as well as the mediating effect of ICT-induced overload. On the other hand, ICT-induced autonomy was found to have a positive effect on ICT-induced overload when ICT-induced invasion was high, while it had a negative effect when ICT-induced invasion was low. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional design of this study hinders the detection of causal relationships and the snowball sampling may raise concerns regarding generalizability. Practical implications Organizations should pay attention to the trade-off between ICT-induced invasion and autonomy to prevent employees from feeling strained. Originality/value Unlike prior studies, which address a demand-centric perspective, this study draws the demand-ability (D-A) imbalance perspective by explicitly considering the ability construct related to ICT-induced autonomy and the D-A imbalance construct captured by ICT-induced overload. Based on the person-environment (P-E) fit theory of stress, this study proposes a moderated mediation model that postulates the mediating effect of ICT-induced overload and the moderating effect of ICT-induced autonomy.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The current study proposes and empirically tests a novel marketing tactic for the metaverse: designing virtual stores differentially to convey different personalities of the same brand. We also examine how these brand personalities, as perceived from virtual store designs, influence customers’ identification with the brand and intention to purchase its products. Design/methodology/approach We conducted three experiments testing two sets of design tactics, which are theoretically feasible but empirically uncertain: tidy (vs stylish messy) and maximalist (vs minimalist) virtual stores. Findings First, we showed that the brand was perceived to be high in competence and sophistication as personality traits when presented in a tidy-style virtual store. Second, the brand was perceived to be high in the active brand personality when presented in a maximalist-style virtual store. The opposite was also observed: the same brand was perceived to be low in the active brand personality when presented in a minimalist-style virtual store. Third, consumers whose personalities are matched with the different store designs more strongly favor the brand and are more likely to buy the products of the brand. This effect was explained by the customers’ personality-based identification with the brand. Research limitations/implications The current study would benefit from testing the models across different categories and brand personalities to enhance generalizability. Practical implications Our findings reveal metaverse marketing tactics utilizing distinct designs of virtual stores that can express the same brand’s differential personalities, which can be tailored to consumer personalities in the metaverse, thereby increasing conversion rates. Originality/value The current studies present novel insights into how store designs influence perceptions of brand personality and shape consumer behavior.",

          "abstract": "Online support communities play an important role in providing access to quality social support. Additionally, those who experience health concerns that face social stigma, such as depression, are more likely to seek support online. To identify effective strategies that help individuals seeking support for depression receive high-quality social support online, we explore the role of two linguistic features in encouraging polite responses to their posts. This study employed a 2 (agency: human vs. depression) × 2 (causality: biological vs. nonbiological) factorial design. The politeness package for R was used to identify linguistic indicators of negative politeness and our results demonstrated that attributions of agency and causality did not have a significant direct effect on the prevalence of negative politeness in support responses. This suggests that support seekers’ understanding of the etiology of depression, and how they present it to support providers, has little impact on the quality of support provided in terms of negative politeness.",

It has received little scholarly attention, and most explanations of it are speculative or anecdotal. Drawing on the mere exposure effect, this preregistered laboratory experiment provides new evidence of framerate sensitivity and cinemagoing as explanatory factors of the soap opera effect. Undergraduate students ( N = 270) reported their cinemagoing and completed a novel task to measure their framerate sensitivity. They also completed a task indicating their framerate preferences. Those with a higher framerate sensitivity and more regular cinemagoing preferred the standard framerate in one scene and the high framerate in another scene. These divergent findings may be due to differences in camera movement and luminance between the scenes.",

          "authors": "Shiyu Jiang, Rebecca Y. M. Cheung, Jun Gao",
          "abstract": "Interpersonal sexual objectification is a pervasive phenomenon among women and has been increasingly recognized in men. Research suggests sexual objectification is associated with two contrasting psychological outcomes: self-objectification and enjoyment of sexualization. Yet, little is known about how these outcomes vary by interpersonal context and gender, particularly in Asian contexts. To this end, two studies were conducted in the Chinese cultural context. In Study 1, a two-stage process was used to collect and screen objectifying comments towards women and men. In the first stage, 67 women and 41 men were recruited to generate a pool of comments. In the second stage, another 75 women and 50 men were recruited to evaluate these comments, resulting in eight representative comments for each gender. In Study 2, 239 women and 194 men participated in a 4 × 2 experiment examining how the perpetrator’s role (stranger, colleague, friend, or intimate partner) and the comment valence (positive or negative) affected self-objectification and enjoyment of sexualization. Results revealed distinct response patterns between genders. For women, positive objectifying comments led to lower self-objectification compared to negative comments in acquaintance contexts (i.e., colleagues, friends, and partners). However, no differences were found in the context with strangers. In contrast, men’s self-objectification remained stable across perpetrators and comment valences. Women’s enjoyment of sexualization was highest from intimate partners than from strangers, colleagues, and friends, whereas men’s enjoyment of sexualization was relatively high across perpetrators but lowest with colleagues. These findings extend objectification theory to the Chinese setting, highlighting gender-specific patterns in how interpersonal contexts shape psychological responses to sexual objectification.",

          "authors": "Anita Xiaolei Tang, Wang Ivy Wong",
          "abstract": "Empathic accuracy (EA), the ability to accurately infer others’ thoughts and feelings, is critical for fruitful empathic exchanges in intimate relationships. Most EA research was limited in their real-life validity and actor-partner considerations. Since reduced mental resources have been linked to decreased judgment accuracy and reduced emotional expressions, we predicted that both actor’s and partner’s mental depletion would be associated with lower EA towards partners’ relationship appraisals and moods. We also investigated moderation by valence of mood and by gender. Additional analyses tested the presence of anchoring and how it related to mental depletion and EA. Eighty-seven heterosexual couples in Hong Kong ( N = 174, M age = 28.81) contributed baseline data and diary data over two weeks (totaling 2416 diary data points). Data were analyzed with the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. Self and partner’s mental depletion was associated with decreased EA. The associations were stronger in EA for negative moods and in men’s EA for partner’s positive moods. Anchoring was present in the sample and correlated with higher EA but less mental depletion. Results offer insights into daily variations in EA and the dual process model of social cognition, and have implications for optimal communication timing.",

          "abstract": "In 1979, National Public Radio (NPR) established its Department of Specialized Audience Programs, a dedicated unit responsible for the acquisition, development, and production of minority programming. For over a decade, the Department of Specialized Audience Programs operated as a semi-autonomous unit until it was absorbed into NPR’s general news division and later dissolved. Previous scholarship has suggested that NPR has been subject to economic and political pressures, which have limited its ability to fulfill its diversity mission; however, I found that NPR has been resistant to efforts to diversify its programming, despite receiving outside pressure from legislators, funders, and advocacy organizations.",

          "authors": "Anna Sejbæk Torp-Pedersen",
          "abstract": "Counter-mapping and counter-data visualisation are employed by artists to reframe migration narratives, often focusing on retracing the journeys of migrants. However, the maps of those who never made it have not received the same attention. This article examines three artistic visualisations that address infographics of people who have died or disappeared in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean has been described as a stage for necropolitics; it is both the deadliest border and the most visualised migration route to the EU. In &lt;em&gt;Mapping Global Refugee&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Migration and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Displacement&lt;/em&gt; (2015–), Tiffany Chung uses data to map migration routes and deaths in the Mediterranean. Her hand-drawn maps, marked with colourful dots representing lives lost, lack a key, rendering the visualisation deliberately ambiguous. In &lt;em&gt;Those Who Did Not Cross 2005–2015 &lt;/em&gt;(2017), Levi Westerveld places a red dot for each person who died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean. Finally, in &lt;em&gt;Nautical Charts of Sunken Boats&lt;/em&gt; (2021), Mathieu Pernot recontextualises historical maps of the Mediterranean by inscribing migrant shipwrecks on them that he read about in the paper. The handwritten annotations are often difficult to read. Each artist traces the ongoing catastrophe of death at sea through maps, questioning the role that cartography and data visualisation play in the documentation of mass loss. Through “The Right Not to Drown,” as introduced by Hilde Van Gelder, this article explores what justice and resistance look like when the dead are memorialised through maps of Mediterranean deaths.",

          "authors": "André Jansson, Karin Fast, Magnus Andersson",
          "abstract": "Society and culture are increasingly marked by post-digital developments where the normalization of digital connectivity is challenged both through critical resistance, e.g., digital disconnection practices, and in commercial discourses on, e.g., “digital wellbeing” and “digital detox.” This article seeks to understand such post-digital trends in working life through the lens of romantic ideals. In modern history, the Romantic ethic implied an escape into the beautiful, the genuine, and the sublime. While constituting a counter-force to functionalism, it also shaped the evolution of modern consumerism through the embracing of novelty and imagination. Here, the analytical focus is on coworking spaces (CWS), a form of digitally reliant workspaces where mobile workers can rent a desk or an office for a limited period of time and where disconnection and non-digital features are promoted as ingredients of “good work.” Previous research shows that many CWS, while promoted as consumable destinations, function as anchoring places and environments for gaining a sense of presence and peace under digitally networked conditions. The current analysis extends these arguments through a case study of a CWS in an early-gentrifying part of Oslo, Norway. Based on ethnographic observations and interviews, the article shows how four romantic tropes—novelty, authenticity, creativity, and harmony—saturate spatial production as well as the mindsets of coworkers. It is concluded that CWS form part of a neo-romantic movement that includes a plethora of related post-digital phenomena, together constituting a counter-culture within capitalist consumer society.",

          "authors": "Jaana Serres",
          "abstract": "Amidst economic austerity and institutionalized gerontocracy and tribalism, Southern Nigerian youth experience persistent disillusionment with their national leadership. Global media has fueled a longing for a more viable “elsewhere”—a phenomenon popularly referred to as “virtual exile” or “mental secession” in the megacity of Lagos. Yet, young people also invest in digital technology with the hope of “making it from Africa.” Over the past decade, Lagos has emerged as a global entertainment hub, propelled by the virality of Nigerian content on streaming and social media platforms. This article examines how algorithmic imaginaries interact with the phenomenology of place. It situates Nigerian engagement with digital media within Africanist histories of technology’s incorporation into local cosmologies. It then presents empirical data collected through long-term ethnographic research in the Afrobeats industry, focusing on African and Afro-diasporic platform representatives on the one hand, and Lagos aspiring youth on the other. The article traces digital entrepreneurship’s function as both an economic strategy and an ideological project—one that re-enchants places and futures that otherwise seem hopeless. As digital professionals seek to appeal to the “global” gaze, this article shows that their efforts operate largely inwardly by reshaping local subjectivities. Nigerian youth embrace new technology’s promise of extraordinary transformation with an intentionality akin—and in many ways tied—to faith. Techno-optimist discourse can then be seen as a strategy from below to cultivate agency and commitment to place under systemic failure.",

          "authors": "Di Xu, Yanyu Chen",
          "abstract": "As digital platforms increasingly structure how cities are navigated, seen, and valued, urban walking practices have become sites of both algorithmic capture and tactical improvisation. This study examines the emergence of City Walk (城市漫步) in China as a form of platform-native counter-mapping. This user-led spatial practice utilizes digital tools to document, reframe, and disseminate alternative urban narratives. Drawing on digital ethnography, platform content analysis, and interviews in four Chinese cities, the study examines how participants engage in entangled resistance—tactically negotiating visibility algorithms while remaining embedded within platform infrastructures. Rather than rejecting platforms, City Walk participants leverage them to perform affective spatial storytelling, explore non-recommended routes, and archive marginal spaces. These practices are conceptually situated within the literature on algorithmic resistance, everyday spatial tactics, and critical cartography. While some City Walk content is commodified through lifestyle aesthetics and platform branding, others sustain oppositional potential through semantic drift and infrastructural appropriation. By reframing City Walk as a counter-cartographic practice situated within the logics of platform urbanism, this article contributes to broader debates on digital spatial agency, mediated urban practices, and the politics of algorithmically curated visibility.",

          "authors": "Miranda McKee",
          "abstract": "Throughout the pandemic, maps of visual data published in the digital mediascape were used to communicate the global impact of Covid-19. While public and private entities offered “big picture” perspectives, hegemonic visualizations often neglected to address the disproportionate toll of the pandemic on the members of marginalized communities. This article presents findings from a mixed-methods investigation of 12 case studies, comparing eight grassroots counter-mapping sources against four mainstream mapping sources, created by government and academic institutions, that will be referred to here as “hegemonic.” The purpose of this study was to investigate how visuals presented online by community-focused counter-mapping collectives differed from those presented by mainstream sources, examining what these differences might indicate about the social imaginaries at play. Case studies from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the US produced a corpus of 1,556 images manually collected from online sources. An initial content analysis using NVivo generated quantitative data forming the foundation for later semiotic analysis examining each individual image while also considering the collection holistically. Informed by social semiotics, the findings highlight how counter-mapping employs bespoke illustrations and community insights to portray a more nuanced perspective of the impacts of the pandemic. In contrast, hegemonic maps rely on vector-based graphics that reflect dominant worldviews. Altering the practices of mapping, counter-mapping empowers communities, challenges systemic inequities, and reimagines how visual data shapes public knowledge.",

          "abstract": "This article interprets the Stealth Slavery Sticker Campaign, a grassroots counter-mapping project led by the artist-activist collective Slavers of New York, as a chapter in the broader Living Black Atlas. Started during the racial reckoning of 2020, the campaign placed unauthorized stickers on street signs and other surfaces across Brooklyn to reveal suppressed histories of slavery embedded in commemorative place names. The stickers transformed daily encounters with taken-for-granted road names into unexpected opportunities to confront prominent historical families who profited from enslavement and to acknowledge the contributions of enslaved Africans in shaping the city. The collective framed their campaign as a “guerrilla educational” action that disrupted memorial landscapes, challenged discourses of white innocence, and provoked broader conversations about racial justice and accountability. At a time when official institutions are increasingly retreating from confronting racism, small, temporary interventions, such as these Stealth Stickers, can play a crucial role in encouraging critical audits of commemorative infrastructures, layering counter-narratives onto public spaces, fostering embodied confrontation with historical truths, and remaking everyday places through bold, unexpected acts of resistance.",

In this context, counter-maps emerged as a form of data activism aimed at illuminating aspects of the crisis often overlooked in dominant representations. This article investigates the Frena la Curva initiative, which used an online forum and a collaborative map to visualise needs and offers of assistance across Ibero-American countries during the pandemic. Drawing on digital ethnography—including website analysis, map examination, and interviews with activists—the study explores the role of mapping in understanding the pandemic and representing diverse human experiences. We argue that maps became central tools for deliberation among data activists, combining practical functions with symbolic significance for social action. To conceptualise this dynamic, we introduce the notion of “cartographies of negotiation,” which highlights the tensions, values, and interpretive practices that shape internet-based maps. This concept foregrounds the distinction between maps as objects and mapping as a situated process. We draw on technocentric and social justice frameworks to examine how activists navigate between technological possibilities and structural constraints, and how their cartographic practices generate new forms of visibility, solidarity, and resistance.",

          "authors": "Tin-Yuet Ting",
          "abstract": "Studies of contemporary social movements have explored the role of digital maps and mapmaking in the organisation and visualisation of protest events, yet little is known about the contentious political potential of maps when the political opportunities for street politics fade. This article examines the digital cartography of Hong Kong’s yellow economic circle, a networked system of retailers and consumers linked by political values that support pro-movement stores and boycott pro-establishment businesses, for which citizen activists amassed crowdsourced data to create and update counter-maps that galvanised political consumerism to uphold dissent. Drawing on a renewed conception of the networked movement scene, I contend that counter-data mapping demonstrates a connective structure of self-mobilisation that affords the (trans)formation of (a) dissent spatiality, (b) sociality, and (c) solidarity during the declining stages of movements. Based on digital ethnography and archival research, I show how this nascent cartographic data-as-repertoire not only helped establish and sustain a resistant economy but also allowed people to maintain and refashion their contentious political participation via everyday engagement with data. While the state authorities attempted to expand their territorial control amidst the crisis, counter-data mapping, as a digitally enabled, joint practice of scene-making, (re)invented dissent territory, enabling dispersed citizen activists to continue to connect and mobilise amidst intense urban policing and social distancing protocols. This article casts new light on the utility and capacity of digital cartography during movement latency while illuminating the understudied contours and consequences of counter-data mapping in a non-Western context.",

          "authors": "Paola Sartoretto, Luana Martins",
          "abstract": "For Indigenous populations in Brazil, maps have long been instruments of invisibility. Official maps have historically misnamed and erased Indigenous territories and communities. At the same time, cartographic representations have been a tool of resistance for Indigenous activists. Indigenous communities and organisations have created their own maps identifying territories, peoples, languages, and cultures. These dynamics of contentious visibility intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic when the spread of the virus among Indigenous populations was poorly reported or even absent from hegemonic contagion maps. State negligence, intensified by an authoritarian government hostile to Indigenous populations, threatened the survival of communities around the country who organised collectively to create their own cartographic representations of the pandemic through resistant appropriations of media and data. This article draws on interviews with Indigenous leaders and media activists to discuss processes of data appropriation and resistant cartographies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the use of data and counter mapping strategies for self-representation and political action that must be understood through a non-media-centric perspective, drawing from conceptualisations at the intersection between human geography, communication, and post-colonial theory.",

          "abstract": "This study presents an exploratory approach to the analysis of social differences in smartphone use. Previous research has predominantly focused on problematic smartphone use and addiction. By contrast, this study turns to the research program of Pierre Bourdieu to forward a sociological study on social differences in how people use their smartphones. Using multiple correspondence analysis of Swedish survey data ( n = 2,401), the study explores the structure of the “space of smartphone use.” This space is characterized by two main oppositions: high vs. low volumes of smartphone use on the one hand, and degree of investment in legitimized uses on the other. While age and gender remain key factors in explaining how people position themselves in this space, we show that cultural capital, economic capital, and habitus shape these differences. Privileged social positions tend to “push” social agents toward more frequent and legitimized smartphone uses. Social inequalities shape smartphone uses, particularly among older generations.",

          "abstract": "With the increasing use of generative AI tools to enhance engagement on social media platforms, we are beginning to see AI-generated content contributing to digital harms, including particularly online abuse. Drawing on digital ethnography case studies, this article investigates the emergence of AI-generated ‘rage bait’ content, a severe form of trolling attempting to invoke users into adversity and outrage. AI-generated rage bait differs from other rage baiting because no human actor is involved in its creation or initial distribution. Case study examples of rage bait posts generated by AI tools are analysed. The article theorises the cultural causality of AI-generated rage bait and other digital harms, discussing how AI tools draw on extant datasets, practices and norms to further embed rage in the digital ecology. The article discusses some of the cultural and policy implications of digital harms originating from AI generators and provides a roadmap for further study.",

          "authors": "Stephanie Bührer, Kevin Koban, Jörg Matthes",
          "abstract": "Online hostility has become increasingly common in digital public spaces, often to the detriment of marginalized groups. While prior research distinguishes between incivility and intolerance, little is known about whether users can recognize these forms as conceptually distinct. Moreover, the roles of prior digital hate perpetration and national context in shaping such perceptions remain unclear. This cross-national survey ( N = 4041; Austria, France, Hungary, and Sweden) addresses these gaps. Participants rated uncivil anti-immigration content not only as more uncivil but also as more intolerant than explicitly intolerant content, indicating an alarming misreading of exclusionary messages. Recent perpetration was associated with weaker recognition of incivility and intolerance, as well as reduced differentiation between content types, suggesting desensitization and blurred perceptual boundaries. The findings were consistent across countries, indicating that these mechanisms transcend national contexts. Strengthening users’ ability to recognize subtle exclusionary rhetoric is essential to counter its normalization in public spheres.",

          "abstract": "The electronics Right-to-Repair movement, which challenges tech companies’ repair restrictions and advocates for more sustainable digital devices, is drawing increasing scholarly attention. While existing discussions focus on formalized activism modalities, this study analyzes an alternative form of repair activism in China through the lens of everyday resistance. We illustrate how independent technicians leverage self-made tools, improvised fixes, and unconventional solutions to extend handset lifespans and resist planned obsolescence. Moreover, we account for how such resistance is embedded in Shenzhen’s supply chains and global electronics trade flows, the very systems of power and capital that technicians seek to challenge. Drawing on Michel Serres’ framework of “the parasite,” we propose the concept of “parasitic activism” to theorize such embedded resistance, whose leverage comes precisely from appropriating and repurposing the host structures. This study thereby contributes to media scholarship on electronics repair cultures and invites a broader rethinking of activism in more pluralistic, context-sensitive terms.",

Ten years later in 2024, discussions continued in The Future of the Nordic Media Model: A Digital Media Welfare State? edited by Peter Jakobsson, Johan Lindell, and Fredrik Stiernstedt. A key concern across these debates has been whether and to what extent the media systems in the Nordic countries actually do form a common “Nordic media system”, and whether this media system is somehow better than other media systems at equipping Nordic citizens with democratic prerequisites. My article outlines the key positions in these debates about the continued role and relevance of the Nordic media welfare state, mainly in the area of news provision, based in part on recent research that explores this issue from an audience perspective (Schrøder et al., 2020, 2024). In the article, I tentatively explore how Nordic news media are presenting climate challenges and thereby equipping us as Nordic citizens for imagining livable futures.",

          "abstract": "From disputes over COVID-19 to contestation over climate science, questions of the value and legitimacy of mainstream scientific knowledge have become matters of high-stakes political struggle. Here, we introduce a novel computational tool to identify and track the emergence, proliferation, and historical variations of discourses that either seek to invoke the authority of scientific expertise or to criticize scientific claims, institutions, and experts. We describe the tool’s development, demonstrate its predictive and convergent validity, and illustrate its potential across three case studies shedding light on how elite rhetoric may drive political polarization around science in the United States. Among other findings, we find that political statements invoking scientific expertise have historically been more likely to receive coverage in mainstream American newspapers than statements that do not invoke expertise. However, this apparent advantage disappears over time, suggesting the discursive authority associated with the invocation of scientific methods, credentials, and institutions may be diminishing.",

This study examines the role of media use and sociodemographic factors in shaping public attitudes toward science in Switzerland using panel data from three surveys over 6 years ( N 2016 = 1,051; N 2019 = 339; N 2022 = 122). Results show that media usage and sociodemographics influenced attitudes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower education and stronger religiosity correlated with reduced interest in or trust in science. Use of online legacy media showed rally-around-the-flag effects, but we found no clear differences between public and private broadcasters regarding their impact on science attitudes. These findings highlight the relationship of media use, sociodemographics, and public attitudes during societal uncertainty and over time, offering insights for targeted, context-sensitive science communication.",

However, wrongness admission can yield favorable perceptions. In five experiments ( N = 2420), we tested whether wrongness admission yields higher perceived trustworthiness in the scientist and trust in science and discipline-specific research as well as public funding support for the scientist, science, and discipline-specific research. Scientists engaging in wrongness admission (vs refuse or do not comment) were perceived as more trustworthy and received more support for federal funding for their own research. Moreover, wrongness admission yielded similar levels of science and discipline-specific public funding support. Wrongness admission not only facilitated higher scientist trustworthiness, but trustworthiness was, in turn, associated with greater trust in science and psychology, as well as scientist and psychology public funding support. This work highlights potential benefits of scientist wrongness admission amidst failed replications.",

However, verbal-only messages also generated similar outcomes for reduced-allergen peanuts, whereas for reduced-gluten wheat, the overlap alone was effective. Visual-verbal messages without overlap had no effect in both studies. Findings offer boundary conditions for visual-verbal overlap effects.",

          "abstract": "At the growing intersections of social media and critical disability studies, limited empirical research exists on the role of digital platforms in expressing and constructing neurodivergent identity among subpopulations that additionally belong to other minoritized groups. This study critically intervenes by mapping how what we term “marginalized neurodivergence” is digitally constructed, using the case of young neurodivergent members of the global South Asian (SA) diaspora on TikTok (SANT). We conducted a thematic analysis of 100 TikTok videos posted by SANT from 2020 to 2024 about their lived experiences of autism and/or ADHD, employing dual theoretical and conceptual lenses: the psychosocialcultural framework from counseling psychology and platform affordances from digital studies. Findings indicate that TikTok serves as a forum for SANT to explore overlapping psychological, social, and cultural concerns that may otherwise not be discussed within SA or neurodivergent communities. Although these issues exist outside of TikTok for SANT, the platform’s affordances allow for social, communicative, and expressive possibilities that in turn shape the creation, consumption, and circulation of such content. This study has direct implications for informing clinical support around mental health and disability among marginalized communities, as well as understandings of how digital platforms potentially serve as a mediating factor.",

          "abstract": "Focusing on how five top-ranked Pakistani universities construct their branding narratives on X, this research presents a multisemiotic analysis of the logos displayed on their official X profile pages. The study adopts a composite analytical framework that combines the Corporate Visual Identity (CVI) which emphasizes design elements, with principles of compositional meaning that examine the arrangement, salience and typographic semiotics as well as graphical elements within the logos. Given that these logos appear by default against profile banners on X, the visual environment of the banners is also referred to, as the contextual design choices can influence logo interpretation and brand perception. Findings reveal that the semiotic choices embedded in these visual identities reflect each university’s ethos, cultural heritage and global ambitions, often highlighting nationalistic and religious connotations. There is also a strategic use of English typography and culturally resonant imagery to project modernity and international appeal. These findings suggest a conscious glocalization strategy, where universities position themselves as globally oriented institutions while maintaining a strong affiliation with local cultural, nationalistic and religious values.",
