          "abstract": "This article aims to approach the problem of avant-garde digital games by analyzing them as proof of avant-gardes’ vitality and/or their demise. First, it seeks to investigate the presence of avant-garde as a term within contemporary digital game discourses. Second, it focuses on the digital games somewhat inspired by works and practices of avant-gardes and tries to investigate how the presence of avant-gardes within contemporary games may also indicate its demise. To deal with that ambiguous position, the concept of arrière-garde is proposed, as prescribed to contemporary works of art inspired by avant-garde movements and continuing their actions. The article concludes with two case studies, focusing on intertextual references to the Surrealism found in titles by Bedtime Digital Game and of cozy games which, despite not offering direct continuity, utilize art and mood as a means of political protest in a similar way to Czech Poetism.",

          "authors": "Nikolas Matovinovic",
          "abstract": "The 2021 Netflix series Squid Game's themes of economic critique are often framed as contradicting the exploitative nature of its ancillary texts like Squid Game: The Challenge (Netflix 2023), a reality series that materially reproduces many of the same hardships that the narrative series ostensibly condemns. This paper argues that this is a product of the series’ emphasis on interactive screen media as a marketing and production tool without accounting for how this modal difference would alter the themes of the series’ narrative. The Nintendo multiplayer shooter Splatoon 3 (2022) serves as a useful example of how these challenges can be overcome within the context of a popular multimedia franchise. This is done through the game's emphasis on an ecological coziness whereby principles of cozy gaming and a cephalopod-like tentacular approach to screen media create a text whose themes and inclusive community standards do not exhibit the contradictions seen in Squid Game.",

          "authors": "Kristine Ask, Tanja Sihvonen",
          "abstract": "After the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in November 2022, a new, and rather unexpected, following of women and queer fans on TikTok emerged. Centering on the character Simon “Ghost” Riley, they latched onto the tall, muscular, and masked soldier with soulful eyes. Through fannish creations on TikTok, the game's characters and world was de- and re-constructed as a playful space for romantic and sexual imaginings that challenge the cis-het military masculinity of the series. Based on a 6-month netnography, the article explores the fan remediation of Call of Duty in negotiation with TikTok's affordances. We analyze how new fans positioned themselves against traditional fans through weaponization of fangirl practices, how game mechanics were used in unusual ways to generate audiovisual material, and how some of the complex fan-industry relationships manifested as a response to this unexpected fandom.",

          "authors": "Neda Azizi, Omid Haass, Piera Centobelli, Roberto Cerchione",
          "abstract": "Purpose The objectives of this research are two-fold. The first is to explore, describe and explain the relevance of the concept of Information Technology risk management (ITRM) implementation processes. In this regard, we were required to understand the interaction between contextual issues, the ITRM framework itself, IT individual interpretations toward them and their effect on implementation. The second objective is to develop a theoretical model for use in guiding the design and analysis of the proposed empirical work. The study introduces a fresh perspective to an established research area. It is argued that without more emphasis on the dynamic nature of the implementation process, an incomplete understanding of the problem will result. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts an interpretive methodology to a multiple case study design gathering and analysing qualitative evidence. A series of three case studies was designed around 22 semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted to investigate IT individuals’ role in facilitating a successful ITRM implementation. Findings The findings provide new insights in relation to ITRM implementation by considering IT individual culture. The research develops a substantive theory involving a schematic model involving a set of theoretical propositions. These findings suggest a dynamic approach to implementing IT risk management framework — one that considers the interaction over time of intentions, context, process and action around risk management frameworks. Research limitations/implications This study makes important theoretical contributions to the understanding of organizational implementations by taking a dynamic view of implementation, identifying different individual IT culture archetypes, emphasizing the role of social aspects and developing a set of key factors and contextual conditions. Practical implications This model offers managers an understanding of how IT individual culture and the factors and contextual conditional work together over time to ensure a successful ITRM implementation. Meanwhile, it sheds some light on how managers treat IT individuals with different levels of experience differently. Originality/value We theorize IT individual culture and the factors and contextual conditional and show their effects on ITRM implementation success, thus making an essential contribution to the information systems and implementation research and practice. Moreover, we provide a novel methodology to conceptualize ITRM implementation as a cultural process through which IT people socially construct the meanings and purposes of their work activities. This research answers scholars’ call to construct more accurate explanations of innovation outcomes in an increasingly IS implementation world.",

          "authors": "Changyu Wang, Kexin Chen, Jiaojiao Feng, Jianyu Chen",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the digital age, enterprise social media (ESM) has been broadly used to break the barrier of space and time for knowledge sharing involving two activities—knowledge donating and knowledge collecting. Yet, hardly any study has thus far explored how and when knowledge donating and knowledge collecting through ESM impact employees’ innovative work behavior (IWB). Therefore, drawing on the social exchange theory, this study aims to introduce relational social capital as a mediator and performance climate as a moderator to examine differential impact mechanisms of knowledge donating and knowledge collecting through ESM on employee IWB. Design/methodology/approach First, we collected 225 survey data from employees who used ESM at work. Then, according to the two-stage procedure of the partial least square structural equation modeling method, we established and analyzed a moderated mediation model based on the context of ESM. Findings Results demonstrate that knowledge donating through ESM has a positive relationship with IWB, but knowledge collecting through ESM has no such relationship. Through the mediation of relational social capital, both knowledge donating and knowledge collecting through ESM have indirect positive relationships with IWB, but knowledge collecting through ESM has a greater one. Moreover, when employees perceived a relatively high-performance climate, the positive relationships of knowledge donating and knowledge collecting through ESM with IWB via relational social capital would be stronger. Practical implications On the one hand, organizational managers should not only focus on different innovation benefits caused by knowledge donating and knowledge collecting through ESM but also should realize differences in the direct/indirect effect of knowledge donating and knowledge collecting through ESM on IWB. On the other hand, employees need to proactively enhance their innovative ability by considering knowledge donating/collecting channels (e.g. ESM), gaining successful competitiveness. Moreover, both managers and employees should realize that different innovation benefits of knowledge sharing activities through ESM can be further strengthened when establishing a high-performance climate. Originality/value Different from prior literature on knowledge sharing or ESM, this study contributes to analyzing the differential effects of two dimensions (i.e. knowledge donating and knowledge collecting) of knowledge sharing on employees' IWB in the context of ESM.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This research focuses on analyzing the impact of digital transformation (DT) on the green innovation performance of Spanish wineries, as well as the mediating effect of green knowledge sharing (GKS) on this main relationship, as well as the moderating role of top management environmental awareness (TMEA) on the GKS-green innovation performance linkage. In addition, age, size and protected designation of origin (PDO) membership are used to increase the precision of the cause–effect relationships examined. Design/methodology/approach The study proposes a conceptual model based on previous studies, which is tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling, with data collected from 196 Spanish wineries between September 2022 and January 2023. Findings The results of the research reveal the existence of a positive and significant relationship between the development of DT and green innovation performance of Spanish wineries, as well as the partial mediation of GKS in this link and a positive moderation of TMEA in the GKS-green innovation performance bond. Practical implications Winery executives should prioritize aligning DT with TMEA to drive green innovation performance. Additionally, it is recommended that they actively promote GKS within their wineries to enhance sustainability performance and strengthen their competitive positioning in an eco-conscious market. Originality/value The originality of the study derives from its pioneering character, as the research enters unexplored terrain by investigating the role of the GKS as a mediator in the relationship between DT and green innovation performance, as no previous research has ventured in this direction.",

          "abstract": "Purpose While cyberloafing has emerged as a prevalent issue in numerous workplaces, research on its consequences is still underdeveloped, highlighting a need for further exploration and analysis. Drawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, this study investigates the influence of coworkers' cyberloafing on employees' workplace incivility, mediated by negative emotions and moderated by task interdependence. Design/methodology/approach In Study 1, the hypothesized research model was tested utilizing three-wave time-lagged survey data collected from 333 employees and their coworkers. In Study 2, an additional sample of 274 employees was surveyed. Data were analyzed using hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method. Findings The results indicated that coworkers' cyberloafing positively influenced employees' workplace incivility, with this relationship mediated by negative emotions. Additionally, task interdependence was found to positively moderate both the direct relationship between coworkers' cyberloafing and negative emotions and the indirect path from coworkers' cyberloafing to employees' workplace incivility through negative emotions. Practical implications This study helps managers gain a deeper understanding of cyberloafing's effects, enabling them to manage and curb it more effectively. Originality/value Prior research has predominantly explored the effects of cyberloafing on its implementers. However, this study innovatively shifts focus to the observer perspective, empirically demonstrating whether and how coworkers' cyberloafing affects employees' workplace incivility, enriching and expanding the existing literature.",

          "authors": "Pedro Nascimento, Tiago Oliveira, Joana Neves",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the 21st century, excessive use of hedonic information systems (HIS) has become commonplace, making HIS use reduction a more viable option for many users than complete discontinuation. Even so, there is no systematic revision on this matter. This systematic literature review aims to examine previous studies on HIS use reduction, identify their limitations and point out future research directions. Design/methodology/approach We adhered to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, ultimately analyzing 52 papers published between 2010 and 2024, with the majority disseminated after 2021. Findings The primary findings indicate a gradual shift from focusing on internet research to exploring social networking sites, with consistent attention on gaming and mobile device usage. Moreover, there is notable diversity in the theoretical foundations of scholarly research in this area as well as in the antecedents, consequences and control factors. Additionally, factors such as awareness, social norms, fatigue, privacy concerns and self-efficacy play the most significant roles in reducing the use of HIS. Finally, this article identifies gaps and opportunities in the field and employs science mapping to uncover the four predominant themes that form the basis of this research domain. Originality/value As far as we know, this article marks the inaugural comprehensive systematic review of current research on reducing HIS use, intending to make a dual impact. Initially, the authors meticulously outline HIS use reduction systematically and thoroughly, offering theoretical insights. Second, they delve into potential research areas and contributions concerning this phenomenon to address the gap in understanding the effects of reducing HIS usage on individuals.",

          "authors": "Patricia E.G. Bestelmeyer",
          "abstract": "Accents provide information about a speaker's geographical, socio-economic, and ethnic background. An additional important variable in the social evaluation of accented speech is the listener's own accent. Just as with any in-group marker, there is a preference for accented speakers that sound like us. Here we employed an auditory version of the implicit association test to quantify own-accent bias. At a Welsh university, we recruited two groups of participants born and raised in distinct regions within the UK, Wales and England. These regions have a long-standing history of national rivalry. In Experiments 1 and 2 we show that the magnitude of the implicitly measured own-accent bias in both groups was comparable to biases based on visible group membership (e.g., race). In addition, Experiment 2 shows that this implicitly measured bias was large compared to the explicitly reported preference. The effect sizes of the in-group preference reported here may have societal impact.",

          "abstract": "An important mechanism for language maintenance is transmission from parents to their children. This mechanism is stronger for the regional language Frisian than it is for Low Saxon in the northern Netherlands. In this study, we assessed many variables potentially associated with parental language transmission for these regional languages. We analyzed questionnaire responses from around 25,000 Frisian and Low Saxon speakers participating in the Lifelines cohort study. Transmission was strongly associated with whether their children's other parent speaks the same language, and with the frequency of language use in different social contexts. Other important factors included language attitudes and the degree of urbanization of the respondent's neighborhood. Taken together, these findings suggest that language maintenance for Frisian and Low Saxon could potentially be bolstered by adequately stimulating positive language attitudes and the use of the language in different social contexts by both the government and smaller societal organizations.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: This study employs an affordances and multiple goals approach to explore channel choices in the initiation of dyadic relationship dissolution processes. In an experiment, participants imagined breaking up with an abusive romantic partner, breaking up with a nonabusive partner, or not breaking up. Then they indicated their likelihood of using various channels (i.e., face-to-face conversation, texting, social media, voice call, and video call) to communicate with their partner, responded to perceived social affordances measures for each channel, and provided insights in an open-ended prompt. Both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed. Results reveal that face-to-face communication is often preferred for dyadic relational dissolution processes, as bandwidth, social presence, and a lack of accessibility can convey a sense of seriousness and respect for the non-initiator while preventing miscommunication. However, mediated channels offer protection from emotional manipulation (for abusive relationships), physical violence (for abusive relationships), and awkward situations (for nonabusive relationships) thanks to their unique combinations of affordances.",

          "abstract": "The current study assessed the social process linking neighborhood social fragmentation with individual psychological distress. Social fragmentation was operationalized as a perception of limited social cohesion within a neighborhood. Data were collected from two waves in the United Kingdom (T1 N = 705; T2 N = 534). Participants completed an online survey with measures of perceived social cohesion, social support, perceived social isolation at Time 1 and completed a follow up survey six months later with measures of psychological distress. Structural equation modeling was used to test a serial mediation model. The results support the hypothesis that social support and isolation mediate the relationship between limited social cohesion (i.e., social fragmentation) and psychological distress. Living in neighborhoods marked by social fragmentation is predictive of decreased social support that in turn predicts greater perceptions of social isolation, and ultimately predicts high psychological distress.",

Less is known, however, regarding the mutual effects of caregivers on children in intergenerational coparenting families. This study aimed to examine how mothers’ and grandmothers’ self-control, mother-grandmother coparenting relationships, and caregiver-child attachment were associated and to investigate whether the pathways were different in mother-child and grandmother-child dyads. Participants were mothers and grandmothers from 501 intergenerational coparenting households. The results from Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Modeling (APIMeM) indicated that mothers’ and grandmothers’ self-control were indirectly related to their own caregiver-child attachment through their self-report coparenting relationships. Additionally, the effect of mothers’ self-control spilled over to the grandmother-child attachment through grandmothers’ self-report coparenting relationships. Overall, the findings indicated that mothers’ and grandmothers’ self-control, mother-grandmother coparenting relationships, and their attachment to the child significantly differed between mother-child dyads and grandmother-child dyads. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of women caregiver-child attachment processes and highlight the implications of using the dyadic approach in understanding and improving family functioning in intergenerational coparenting families, which provide implications for family interventions.",

However, studies on the processes underlying this association are relatively scarce. In this longitudinal study, we investigated the mediating role of emotion dysregulation between mindfulness and attachment insecurity. A total of 333 Chinese university students were recruited for three time points, with a 6-month lag between time points, to complete self-report questionnaires of mindfulness, emotion dysregulation, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Cross-lagged mediation analysis showed that greater mindfulness was indirectly associated with lower attachment anxiety via lower emotion dysregulation, after controlling for age, gender, and autoregressive control variables, indicating emotion dysregulation as a mediator. However, emotion dysregulation did not mediate the longitudinal association between mindfulness and attachment avoidance. The present findings inform researchers of the importance of cultivating mindfulness and emotion regulation to enhance attachment security in romantic relationships.",

          "authors": "Jade Jiewen Deng, Jason Pridmore",
          "abstract": "While digital media can be seen to keep alive social connections among migrants across borders, the impact of how digital disconnection has redrawn migrants’ boundaries has not been adequately researched. Migrants subjected to the dual border-and-boundary work of Western host countries and their non-Western home countries make for complicated self–other boundary narratives. This study explores the everyday boundary work of migrants originating from Hong Kong, a former British colony, who have chosen to relocate to the UK through the British National (Overseas) (BN[O]) visa scheme. The scheme was catalysed by the 2019 political upheaval in Chinese Hong Kong and the UK–Hong Kong colonial affiliation. Through the lens of dis/connection assemblage, we conceptualise digital dis/connections as a form of boundary work and conduct in-depth interviews and thematic analysis of 14 BN(O)s. We demonstrate that digital disconnection can be seen as a socio-political practice related to identity regulation by situating BN(O)s’ digital media practices within the political projects of belonging in the UK, Hong Kong, and China. Through a matrix of disconnected approaches, BN(O)s shape boundaries around identity politics in terms of social positions, a sense of belonging, and social relations. The political meaning of digital disconnection is highlighted through its fracture of connected space-time and resilient management of social relationships&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how prior experiences (personal or a close other’s) influence individuals’ engagement with virtual reality (VR) stories designed to promote understanding and foster prosocial behavior. Integrating self-determination theory and self–other overlap, we conducted an experimental mixed-method study with 35 participants who experienced three VR stories focused on inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA): living with Alzheimer’s, blindness, and in a refugee camp. Findings indicate that while participants felt some autonomy with the VR headset, they experienced a lack of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the storytelling. Participants engaged in perspective-taking but often thought about those close to them who had similar experiences rather than themselves. Thus, a close other’s experience affected whether people engaged in perspective-taking. However, prior experience with IDEA topics did not predict cognitive effort, indicating that individuals with such experience do not exert more cognitive effort than those without it. Additionally, cognitive effort did not predict prosocial attitudes or behaviors. This study highlights the complexities of how previous experiences affect engagement with IDEA-centered VR, perspective-taking, and cognitive effort and suggests directions for future research.",

Using a case study approach and selecting nine cases across five countries (Russia, Brazil, India, China, and Singapore), we identify the most common distinguishable attributes and tactics associated with this ambiguous collection of actors. In addition to identifying how fringe fact-checkers weaponize fact-checking practices and exploit or mimic the social standing of accredited fact-checkers, we critique examples where state-supported fact-checkers associated with authoritarian governance structures fact-check for national interests. We propose a spectrum of fact-checkers including those where public or general interest fact-checkers follow journalistic ideals and align with accredited communities of practice or non-accredited peer recognition, and a collection of fringe fact-checkers ranging from “special interest” actors promoting specific political agendas to hostile actors with disruptive, destructive, and openly propagandistic interests and aims to destabilize the global public sphere.

          "abstract": "This article presents for the first time a classification of, and lexicon for, features for dissolving interpersonal ties in digital environments: blocking, unfriending, unfollowing, muting, withholding, and ejecting. There are two main motivations and two main contributions. The first motivation is that analyses of social media features have not included treatment of features for interpersonal disconnectivity; the second is that analyses of interpersonal disconnectivity have not included reference to the features that enable it. The two main contributions are the disambiguation of a confusing terminological field, thus making it possible to analytically distinguish between types of feature, and an intervention in the question of whether the features described in the article concern filtering &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt; or avoiding &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;. Data were collected from 37 social media platforms and other services that enable digitally-mediated communication. Features for interpersonal disconnectivity were documented and then the features were grouped based on five questions about their use, where A is the person using the feature, and B is the target of A’s use of the feature: (a) Does it affect A’s feed?; (b) does it affect B’s feed?; (c) is A still connected to B?; (d) is B still connected to A?; (e) can A and B see each other’s profile?",

          "abstract": "The move from political fact-checking to a “public health” or debunking model of fact-checking, sustained by policies and funding from platforms, highlights important tensions in the case of Covid-19. Building on findings from studies focused on journalistic role performance, we investigated how professional fact-checkers in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa conceived of and performed their professional roles when addressing Covid-19 vaccination topics. Interviews with fact-checkers from six well-established, Meta-affiliated, International Fact-Checking Network-accredited organizations operating in these regions indicated that fact-checkers recognized the diversification of tasks and new roles associated with addressing problematic content from social media users. However, fact-checkers expressed unanimous commitment to prioritizing political and media watchdog activities in response to problematic Covid-19 vaccine information spreading from elite sources. To compare these role conceptions with role performance, we conducted a content analysis of Covid-19 vaccine content posted in 2021 to these fact-checkers’ Facebook accounts. We found that content was mostly associated with explainers or debunking content (addressing hoaxes or rumors about Covid-19 vaccines from non-elite social media users). In particular, the abundance of explainers, compared with other genres of fact-checking content, aligns fact-checkers with professional roles as civic service providers, educators, and “interpreters” of health information. Only a small proportion of the Covid-19 vaccine-related posts from each fact-checker contained verifications of claims from authoritative (elite “top-down”) sources (i.e., politicians, media, and health/science professionals). This study offers insights into a particularly tumultuous time of political activity in these regions and considers implications for practice innovation.",

It examines how this change affects social media herding behavior—the tendency of users to align with the majority opinion. We adopted a mixed-method approach, incorporating an online experiment that simulates the YouTube interface and an Interrupted Time Series analysis of real-world user reactions, to assess how the policy affects user engagement. Specifically, we looked at how the absence of one-sided digital cues, combined with content characteristics and individual user predispositions, influences user behavior. Our findings suggest that YouTube’s initiative to boost platform positivity had limited success: user responses were more influenced by their ideological leanings than by visible digital cues; Hiding dislikes reduced commenting frequencies and inadvertently increased negative expression. These results highlight the stronger role of ideological beliefs over social cues in shaping engagement, challenging the presumed impact of audience conformity and the negativity bias on social media dynamics.",

Utilizing a large dataset of 849 Facebook posts, 47,291 comments, and 14,466 replies, our artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational analysis provides evidence for narrative contagion among individual users in organization-hosted cancer communities on Facebook. It also reveals different organizational message characteristics, such as emotional arousal, post topic, and request for storytelling, that affect user storytelling and emotional support in comments and replies.

While previous research has recognized the existence of gender stereotypes and discrimination in online spaces, little attention has been given to how technological affordances impact—or are perceived to impact—incidents of CSH. By employing a theoretical framework of technological affordances, this study reveals that users often perceive affordances differently from how they utilize them, indicating a misalignment between perception and behavior. Our analysis of interviews with 30 remote knowledge workers extends affordances theory by showing that affordances are not always applied in the ways they are perceived, and that power dynamics and structural inequalities outweigh technological affordances in shaping reporting behaviors. Addressing this perception–reality gap is crucial for developing interventions and policies that accurately reflect the realities of CSH experiences and promote a safe online work environment.",

          "authors": "Alice Binder, Anja Stevic, Jörg Matthes, Marina F Thomas",
          "abstract": "Dating apps have changed the way people establish contact with potential romantic partners. However, more and more dating apps use algorithms to keep their users’ engagement high. Studies suggest that trust in algorithms can shape offline dating experiences. We theorize that excessive swiping, driven by fear of missing out, predicts trust. We also explore the role of decision fatigue. Findings from a two-wave panel study with N Time2 = 521 young dating app users suggest that the fear of missing out on potential romantic partners was positively related to decision fatigue on dating apps. Moreover, excessive swiping and decision fatigue were positively related to trust in algorithms. No reciprocal effects of trust in algorithms on excessive swiping or decision fatigue were observed. It seems that trust in algorithms might present some kind of relief strategy for compulsive behaviors such as excessively swiping, or for negative feelings such as decision fatigue.",

          "authors": "Sameer Hinduja, Justin W Patchin",
          "abstract": "Research indicates that participation in metaverse environments and with virtual reality (VR) is increasing among younger populations, and that youth may be the primary drivers of widespread adoption of these technologies. This will more readily happen if their experiences are safe, secure, and positive. We analyze data from a nationally representative sample of 5005, 13- to 17-year-olds in the United States to measure their experiences of 12 specific harms on VR platforms, and which protective strategies they employed to prevent or respond to them. Girls were more likely to be sexually harassed and to experience grooming/predatory behavior, and were more likely to have been targeted specifically because of their gender. Finally, girls were more likely to engage in some specific protective measures online, but overall both boys and girls use platform safety mechanisms infrequently. We discuss enhancements in policy, content moderation, and feature sets that can serve to better safeguard youth in the metaverse.",

          "authors": "Zijian Lew, Andrew ZH Yee",
          "abstract": "The research comparing hedonic and eudaimonic media experiences has often conceptualized the two categories as monolithic wholes. Although thematic differences within each category have been identified, these differences are usually theoretically inconsequential: They are merely variations in hedonic or eudaimonic content. Adopting a conditional effects approach, this research shows that transience-themed posts and motivation-themed posts on social media—which are both considered eudaimonic—are appreciated by different groups of people. Study 1 found a moderating influence of impermanence acceptance: People who had greater impermanence acceptance were more likely to have eudaimonic responses after viewing transience-themed posts than after viewing motivation-themed posts. The Japanese concept of mono no aware, or beauty in pathos, was used to motivate study 2. Study 2 found that people who viewed transience-themed posts experienced greater impermanence appreciation than people who viewed motivation-themed posts, but media theme did not influence impermanence awareness or impermanence acceptance.",

          "abstract": "Affection plays a crucial role in romantic relationships, as individuals exchange affection with each other to build and maintain relationships. This study applied affection exchange theory (AET) to examine affection exchange patterns within marital dyads, employing couple‐centered approaches. The aim was to identify different types of couple affection exchange profiles based on both partners' affection given and received. The sample consisted of 668 Chinese heterosexual couples. Additionally, this study explored the association between couple affection exchange profiles and marital quality. Through latent profile analysis, three distinct profiles were identified: reserved (47.1%), invisible (10.5%), and highly affectionate (42.4%). Further between‐profile comparisons regarding marital quality indicated that couples in the highly affectionate profile report the most satisfying marriages, whereas the invisible profile represents the least desirable outcome. The findings highlight the diverse nature of couple affection exchange and offer valuable insights for couple therapy interventions focused on affection.",

          "authors": "Emily R. O'Brien, Amanda L. Forest",
          "abstract": "Perceiving a romantic partner as instrumental to one's goals predicts myriad desirable relationship outcomes. However, little is known about the origins of perceived partner instrumentality (PPI)—particularly about factors that may bias PPI. In two studies, we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that relationship quality predicts biased PPI. In a dyadic correlational study (Study 1) and an imagined scenario study in which we experimentally manipulated partner instrumentality levels (Study 2), participants reporting higher relationship quality perceived their partners as more instrumental to their goals—even when controlling for depressive symptoms, and when controlling for partner‐reported (Study 1) or enacted partner (Study 2) instrumentality. Additionally, in Study 1 (but not Study 2), relationship quality attenuated a negative association between depressive symptoms and PPI. Study 2 also revealed that perceiving a partner as more instrumental predicted greater intentions to provide instrumental support to that partner in the future. These findings fill important gaps in the instrumentality and relationships literature, identifying antecedents of PPI and offering insights into how PPI may predict relationship functioning.",

          "abstract": "News reporting of preprints became commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet the extent to which the public understands what preprints are is unclear. We sought to fill this gap by conducting a content analysis of 1702 definitions of the term “preprint” that were generated by the US general population and college students. We found that only about two in five people were able to define preprints in ways that align with scholarly conceptualizations of the term, although participants provided a wide array of “other” definitions of preprints that suggest at least a partial understanding of the term. Providing participants with a definition of preprints in a news article helped improve preprint understanding for the student sample, but not for the general population. Our findings shed light on misperceptions that the public has about preprints, underscoring the importance of better education about the nature of preprint research.",

          "abstract": "A latent class analysis on a nationally representative Australian sample ( N = 1000) identified four subgroups (i.e. classes), ranging from high to low concern about, and willingness to donate to, a national genomic repository under different forms of public and commercial management and access. The distribution of concerns and governance preferences across these classes was investigated. This added to previous research by indicating the degree to which extant concerns (e.g. corporate profiteering, discrimination by insurers) are held by different segments of the community. Based on the governance mechanisms that had widespread support across segments, the following recommendations are made to develop a trusted Australian genomic repository: the repository cannot be solely profit-driven; can utilise an access committee; protections (e.g. ensuring confidentiality of donors) may not require new legislation; data users cannot retain data for future research; the public should remain informed about the intended and/or actual benefits of research.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of preprints, aiding rapid research dissemination but also facilitating the spread of misinformation. This study analyzes media coverage of preprints from 2014 to 2023, revealing a significant postpandemic decline. Our findings suggest that heightened awareness of the risks associated with preprints has led to more cautious media practices. While the decline in preprint coverage may mitigate concerns about premature media exposure, it also raises questions about the future role of preprints in science communication, especially during emergencies. Balanced policies based on up-to-date evidence are needed to address this shift.",
