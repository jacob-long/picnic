          "authors": "Florian Sprenger",
          "abstract": "By reconstructing a basic temperature sensor and its chains of translation, the text presents a new approach to experimental media archeology, critical making and speculative design. Based on this experiment, the text proposes to investigate how sensoric mediation transforms data into operational signals, challenging the myth of ‘raw data’ as unfiltered representations of the environment and the clear distinction between analog and digital. In a micro-analysis, the text reconstructs the translations between the analog and the digital as processes of virtualization, through which what is processed by the computer shares an efficiency with what it refers to, without being of its nature or substance. In order to better understand how autonomous machines adapt to their environment by means of such translation chains, without assuming an isomorphic representation of the world or direct access to the environment, the text follows the first steps of such chains of translation in detail. Experiments with a simple temperature sensor and an Arduino microcontroller show how often unreflected and black-boxed pre-decisions flow into the necessary sensory mediations. This in turn sheds light on new forms of co-existence between humans and autonomous, sensor-based machines such as autonomous vehicles or robots.",

          "authors": "J. Patrick Williams, Mark R. Johnson, Vinay Kumar",
          "abstract": "Esports-relevant expertise extends beyond gameplay to encompass the cultivation of knowledge, skills, networks, and resources that support competitive success. Using a grounded theory approach and insights from 33 interviews with esports players in an emerging ecosystem, this study develops a sociocultural model that identifies four interrelated dimensions shaping expertise development, while paying special attention to the challenges players face. C ultures represent the layered structures of meanings, values, and norms that influence practices within and around esports. Social relations highlight families, schools, peers, and other social actors that support and/or inhibit gaming pursuits. Minds address social-psychological dispositions, mindsets, and the interpersonal dynamics that impact expertise. Finally, resources foreground how finances, space, time, and emotions enable or constrain players’ growth. Together, these dimensions reveal the multifaceted and interconnected ecology surrounding esports-relevant expertise development. The article highlights the value of an inductive approach for generating new and novel insights, and offers a valuable framework for understanding the sociocultural factors influencing esports-relevant expertise.",

          "abstract": "Purpose In the current digital business landscape, businesses heavily rely on their information technology (IT) departments to drive digital transformation initiatives. However, firms often face challenges in obtaining sufficient backing from their IT departments for such initiatives. This research explores the influence of IT departments’ intellectual capital, referred to as IT intellectual capital, on digital transformation under varying degrees of market turbulence. Design/methodology/approach A survey was employed to collect data from 296 IT managers and business managers from 148 firms in China. We used the seemingly unrelated regression to test hypotheses. Findings This study indicates that each category of IT intellectual capital – namely, IT human capital, structural capital and social capital – contributes positively to digital transformation. IT social capital mediates the effects of IT human and structural capital on digital transformation. Besides, market turbulence amplifies the effect of IT human capital on digital transformation, whereas it diminishes the influence of IT social capital on digital transformation. Practical implications Practitioners need to recognize the strategic role of IT intellectual capital in advancing digital transformation and develop appropriate IT intellectual capital according to the market environments in which the firm operates. Originality/value The study introduces novel perspectives on the antecedents of digital transformation and enhances the intellectual capital literature by revealing the influence of different types of IT intellectual capital on digital transformation under various levels of market turbulence.",

          "abstract": "We investigated how Australians and Hong Kong Chinese respondents describe individuals with lung cancer, examining the impact of culture and language on public discourse and stigma expression. A total of 303 participants ( N Aus = 176; N HK = 127) were recruited from a commercial panel provider to complete an online survey. Participants were presented with a vignette describing a hypothetical lung cancer patient and asked to provide their impressions through open-ended written responses. Content coding revealed seven main themes: Warmth, Competence, Morality, Bad luck, Poor health behaviors, Ordinary, and No judgments, with both similarities and differences in participants’ written expressions across cultures. The language Hong Kongers used to respond influenced response patterns, with English responses resembling Western norms of Australians. These findings demonstrate how both culture and the language a person uses influence how people express stigma. By understanding these cultural nuances public health strategies can better support people from diverse backgrounds.",

          "abstract": "Detecting deception in interpersonal communication is a pivotal issue in social psychology, with significant implications for court and criminal proceedings. In this study, four experiments were designed to compare the performance of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and human judges in detecting deception from linguistic cues in a dataset of 62 transcriptions of video-taped interviews (32 genuine and 30 deceptive). The results showed that machine-learning algorithms significantly outperform naïve (accuracy = 54.7%) and expert judges (accuracy = 59.4%) when trained on features from the reality monitoring (RM) and cognitive load frameworks (accuracy = 69.4%) or on features automatically extracted through NLP techniques (accuracy = 77.3%) but not when trained on the RM criteria alone. This evidence suggests that NLP algorithms, due to their ability to handle complex patterns of linguistic data, might be useful for better disentangling truthful from deceptive narratives, outperforming traditional theoretical models.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates whether attitudinal measures can predict usage in two bilingual communities with radically different language policies. We compare 163 participants’ (ages 24–36) rates of spontaneous language usage to two attitudinal measures among Welsh—English and Lombard—Italian bilinguals. Usage rates are found to correlate with Matched Guise Technique status scores for Lombard and to predict solidarity scores for Welsh. A different picture emerges from the Implicit Association Test, with scores correlating with usage for Welsh but not for Lombard. We link these findings to the radically different levels of sociopolitical support associated with the regional/minority languages and the nature of the two attitudinal measures. Our findings suggest that the utility of different attitudinal measures depends partly on sociopolitical circumstances and on the type of association intrinsically addressed in each measure. These have important implications for both the study of language attitudes and research on language vitality.",

          "authors": "Carly Wolfer, Cheryl L Carmichael",
          "abstract": "Interdependence theory reveals the robust influence romantic partners have on each other’s outcomes. However, research on “the orgasm gap”—that men orgasm significantly more often than women in partnered (hetero) sex—relies largely on women-only samples and ignores gendered interpersonal influences. We apply interdependence theory and investigate how gendered interpersonal orgasm goal pursuit (OGP) underlies orgasm inequity in relationships. With a 21-day diary study of heterosexually partnered individuals ( N = 127, 18–40 yrs), we tested a novel experience sampling assessment of interdependent OGP that measures event-level personal OGP, partner OGP, and perceived partner OGP. Results from multi-level models on 566 sex events revealed that men were 15x more likely to orgasm, and were more satisfied, than women. Men reported higher personal and perceived partner OGP, and lower partner OGP than women during sex. Higher levels of personal and perceived partner OGP during sex were associated with greater orgasm likelihood and satisfaction. Moreover, perceived partner OGP moderated the link between personal OGP and satisfaction, such that personal OGP was associated with greater satisfaction at high, but not low, levels of perceived partner OGP. Personal OGP is thus unlikely to yield satisfying orgasms and sex without (perceived) collaboration from a partner. This research exposes an orgasm pursuit gap, in favor of men’s orgasm, that contributes to inequity in partnered sex between men and women. We discuss how sexual pleasure equity requires symmetric pursuit of orgasm goals and interdependent strategies, rather than dwelling on women’s individual level barriers to orgasm.",

          "authors": "Christine Linke, Lisa Brune",
          "abstract": "True crime is a highly controversial yet successful entertainment genre that is widely available on streaming, video, and podcast platforms. The content often includes visual depictions of victims and survivors of gender-based violence, as well as depictions of the acts of violence themselves, such as surveillance footage, police or court videos, or photographs. Additionally, producers and account holders on social media platforms frequently use stereotypical, clichéd, and even eroticized representations of violence. True crime formats rarely address neither the structural causes and backgrounds which lead to crimes, nor the impact on victims, survivors, and their relatives. To address these issues, we apply audio-visual content analysis, focusing on the YouTube channel of Bailey Sarian and her content combination of narrating true crime stories while doing her makeup. Drawing on communication and media studies, we explore the dual tenor of subversive-empowering versus voyeuristic-exploitative representations in the context of narratives of gender-based violence. Our analysis highlights that the unreflective and voyeuristic tone of commercialized true crime narratives can lead to the unethical exploitation of real events and the people affected. The Murder, Mystery &amp;amp; Makeup Monday series exemplifies a dual approach, blending affective storytelling, which fosters viewer intimacy, with sensationalistic portrayals that often simplify and stigmatize those involved in criminal cases. Although some empowering and informative voices regarding gender-based violence exist online, they are frequently overshadowed by the sensationalism typical of commercial true crime. The series underscores a tension between intimate engagement and ethical responsibility, shaped by platform-driven pressures that prioritize engagement over quality. Our findings emphasize the need for platforms to actively enable nuanced, balanced portrayals that foster a more informed and empathetic media environment.",

Our findings show that while all media types prioritize professionalism, their strategies for cultivating intimacy differ significantly. Compared to commercial and provincial media, central media achieved the best balance between intimacy and professionalism. Individual media demonstrated the highest intimacy scores, whereas central media excelled in professionalism. This study enhances our understanding of how institutional backgrounds shape strategies in audio journalism. It offers insights into balancing intimacy with professional standards in the podcast medium.",

          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Building on the idea that digital games are more than trivial pastimes and can have deeper meaning, this article collection brings together emerging findings from the field of game studies. The foundation for this special issue was laid at the 2023 symposium of the Digital Games Research Section of the European Communication Research and Education Association (ECREA) held in Madrid. The articles in this collection examine the rich content of games as cultural artifacts and how they encourage reflection, the role of games as social environments and learning tools, the dynamics of identity negotiation and socialization in gaming contexts, the societal perceptions of games, and the increasingly important roles of games and game studies in mediatized societies.&lt;/p&gt;",

          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The WHO’s decision to include addictive game use (‘gaming disorder’) in the ICD-11 was the subject of controversial scientific debates (e.g., Aarseth et al., 2017; Rumpf et al., 2018). However, knowledge is scarce on how addictive game use is perceived outside of academic circles. The current study aimed to fill this research gap by interviewing a stratified German sample (N=1,077) on their attitudes towards the topic. We found that critical views about games and their addiction potential are rather common among the German general population. Further, we found evidence that many participants overestimated the number of players affected by gaming disorder. Regression analyses showed that age, gender, and gaming experience play a role in how individuals think about risks associated with game use. Interestingly, having heard about the topic in the media was associated with more critical attitudes and higher presumed prevalence rates. More exchange between scholars and the wider public is needed to increase the knowledge on the topic and to prevent moral panics. Further, the media should report about gaming disorder in a balanced way that considers latest research findings and the opposing views of scientists. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

          "authors": "Laura Cañete Sanz, Sjors Martens, Teresa De la Hera",
          "abstract": "Studies on city-building games as educational tools show positive results in addressing different learning objectives, but also identify a missing link to reality, as they are mostly computer-based. Given the differences between existing games and their capabilities, the exact function of these games in an urban planning curriculum is unclear. The city-building game Cities: Skylines currently has three different versions (Digital, Tabletop, VR). Through an affordance analysis of the game’s three versions, this study analyses how the versions afford four primary knowledge dimensions, and in doing so identifies different educational applications for each version of Cities: Skylines in different planning disciplines. The results show that: (a) the board game is strong in fostering player participation and critical thinking more suited for the social and health studies, public policy, and citizen participation domains of urban planning; (b) the digital version functions as moddable simulator, ensuring familiarity with existing systems and monitoring their effects, useful in logistics and transportation planning; (c) the VR form viscerally involves players in the simulated processes, applicable in design-focused segments of urban planning, such as sustainable design theory, housing, and land-use management. The results of this study can help urban planning educators identify possible uses for different versions of Cities: Skylines.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates – based on semi-structured interviews and conversations on cryptoart forums – how digital artists experience the blockchain-enabled assetization of their work through non-fungible tokens, including the transformation of digital artworks (which previously had negligible if any economic value) into assets capable of increasing in price value over time and generating future income from resale provisions. We show how this assetization of digital artworks has kindled artists’ financialized imagination and incentivized them to perform speculative labour – that is, to speculate on the potential capture of future financial proceeds from present-day underpaid or uncompensated activities, while mobilizing fictional expectations of imagined rentiership futures. We suggest that the commodification thesis, which has traditionally explained the future orientation of creative work as tied to commodity exchange, may be insufficient to account for artists’ speculative, asset-based imaginations of the future under financialized capitalism. Therefore, it may be beneficial to complement it with an assetization lens.",

          "abstract": "Domestic workers have long been marginalized, even as they are made hypervisible to their employers. This is a process increasingly augmented by digital technologies. These technologies include care platforms, which have increasingly mediated the process of finding employment. This article reports on interviews with in-home childcare workers or “nannies” who shared experiences of scrutiny and surveillance across the labor process, both on and off the platform. This includes background checks, in-person monitoring, hidden cameras, and more. Although these practices might be legitimized as an extension of parental care or benign monitoring, workers’ negative afffects—fear, worry, anger—disrupt this normalization. Their stories make visible harm and hidden burdens from this hybridization of care and control. Through their accounts, a surveillant assemblage comes into view that intensifies uneven visibility regimes and reinstates the racialized and gendered power dynamics that have long defined domestic labor.",

          "abstract": "Prior reviews suggest that premarital pregnancies are deleterious to couples' relationship quality and stability. However, outcomes of premarital pregnancy may be confounded with socioeconomic factors. Study 1 (1) compared demographically matched premaritally pregnant and nonpregnant couples on partners' recalled courtship trajectories of commitment to marriage and milestone occurrence (e.g., first sex, feeling love) and marital outcomes (satisfaction and disillusionment); (2) examined how partners' commitment‐trajectory similarity was linked to their milestone attainment and marital outcomes; and (3) investigated how familism relates to premarital pregnancy and relationship progression. Using a predominantly Hispanic local sample, we compared 47 premaritally pregnant and 47 demographically matched nonpregnant newlywed couples on mean levels of key variables and on correlations among them. Pregnant and nonpregnant couples exhibited similar timing and correlates of milestone attainment. Partners' commitment‐trajectory similarity was more important for reaching milestones than was premarital pregnancy. Study 2 addressed Study 1's potential selection bias for highly stable couples (because all eventually married) by including only cohabiting couples from a national dataset. Findings likewise showed little difference in relationship quality between cohabiters with and without young children. Hence, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers should consider premaritally pregnant couples' full context of their romantic relationship rather than the pregnancy alone.",

This suggests that communicators could create more durable persuasion by adding explicit moral claims (i.e., stating that the issue is a matter of right vs. wrong) to persuasive messages. Here, using animated videos about the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, we conducted a three-stage longitudinal experiment ( N = 4,488) to test whether messages with explicit moral claims have more durable persuasive effects than similar messages without. We replicated this test across two distinct moral dimensions: harm to innocent people and contamination of nature’s purity. Our findings show that all message versions had strong immediate persuasive effects relative to a control condition, and much of those effects remained after a 3-week period. However, there were no clear advantages—in immediate effects or in durability—from adding explicit moral claims to the messages.",

          "authors": "Nathalie Van Raemdonck, Ike Picone, Jo Pierson",
          "abstract": "Social norms are flexible regulating forces of human behavior. They are shaped by humans, whose actions in turn are shaped by their environment, including the online social spaces they venture into. The objective of this research is to create an understanding of how the affordances of social media platforms shape social norm dynamics in online publics, particularly in climate change publics. For this purpose, we make a comparative analysis of the practices of users on Instagram and Twitter that engage with climate change content. We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with a purposively selected sample of worldwide Twitter and Instagram users. We investigated how each platform’s specific affordances shape the participants’ sense of community and how they participate in social norm enforcement and contestation, also called “callouts.” This “affordances-in-practice” perspective brings observations on the differences in how users can actualize the novel affordances of “interventionability” and “external visibility” on both platforms. This research provides a deeper insight into the socio-technical processes underlying the (self-)organization of social movements and provides a pathway to investigating discursive practices of online publics on other platforms. The study avoids debating which norms should prevail over others in the online climate discussion, but does reflect on the negative impact that certain outcomes of norm enforcement and contestation might have on democratic deliberation on climate change. The main findings are that actualizing these affordances on Twitter anno 2023 makes climate discourse sensitive to group-loyalties, whereas on Instagram it makes it dependent on norm leaders in the form of content creators.",

          "authors": "Anne-Britt Gran",
          "abstract": "Erving Goffman’s dramaturgical model in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959) is frequently used to analyze online self-presentations in social media (SoMe) and other social network sites (SNS). The term “self-presentation” seems to be here to stay. We argue that Goffman’s dramaturgical model belongs to another era, and that online self-presentation needs new theoretical approaches and new content. Compared to its predominant usage in SoMe research, our approach involves a perspective shift from what do SoMe users present (e.g., social role, identity/identities, idealized self, authentic self, brand) to how they perform it, concerning the style of acting and dressing, the use of props, makeup, symbols and signs, emotions, and expressions. Since participation on SoMe platforms is largely about how SoMe users present themselves and how they want to be received, theatricality and performing arts theories can inform this how with a new and nuanced conceptual apparatus. Therefore, we create a theory-based typology on the concepts of theatricality, simple and complex acting, not-acting, not-not-me, imagined audience awareness, and absorption. We present six types of theatrical self-presentations and conditions, types suitable for analysis of SoMe performances.",

          "authors": "Nuurrianti Jalli",
          "abstract": "This study examines the use of TikTok as a platform for youth activism in Southeast Asia, focusing on Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Through a mixed-methods approach that includes qualitative content analysis, semi-structured interviews, systematic fact-checking, and digital trace data, the research explores how activists leverage TikTok’s unique features to promote social justice and mobilize political participation amid democratic backslidings. The findings reveal that activists skillfully adapt to TikTok’s attention economy, using strategies like trend-jacking and meme creation to reach broad audiences. However, they also face significant challenges, including rampant harassment and the precarious nature of algorithmic visibility. The study highlights the complexities of digital activism, where the pursuit of virality can sometimes undermine the depth of political movements. While the research counters the prevalent narrative that digital activism is rife with misinformation, it underscores the importance of maintaining accuracy to protect credibility. The study concludes by calling for further research on integrating online activism with offline organizing and exploring how platform governance can be reformed to better support activists. The insights from this study contribute to a deeper understanding of TikTok’s role in contemporary social movements and the challenges faced by youth activists in the digital age.",

          "abstract": "Critically engaging with the prevalent theses of “platformization” and “infrastructuralization” in the mainstream platform studies literature, this empirical study identifies socio-economic actors and examines their relations in digital governance mediated by data-driven platforms in the Chinese context. Through a case study of “the digital reform” in Zhejiang Province, and the affiliated smart city project—City Brain—in Hangzhou, the municipal capital, this study draws on data from participatory observations and interviews to (1) provide a historical context, in which “platformization” in urban governance is aimed to serve market-oriented socio-economic reforms; (2) argue that such “platformization” is shaped by the long-standing structural tension between centralization and localism, which has been renewed by digital data flows; and (3) understand the shifting public–private demarcation in social interactions and arrangements to deflect continual frictions between the state, local agents, and platforms in the domain of digital governance.",

          "authors": "Viorela Dan",
          "abstract": "Concerns have been raised over AI-generated deepfakes and their impact on democracy. Unlike earlier forms of disinformation relying on text or traditional video-editing techniques (cheapfakes), deepfakes employ artificial intelligence, provoking speculations that they may be even more persuasive and harder to debunk. Using an experiment with a multiple-message design ( N = 2,085), we found that fake videos suggesting a sex, corruption, or prejudice scandal—but not text-only fakes—elicited substantial reputational damage for an innocent politician, regardless of whether the underlying technique was “cheap” or “deep.” This was visible in altered attitudes, emotions, and voting intentions. However, exposure to a journalistic fact-check substantially reduced and even eliminated the detrimental effects. These findings have important implications for our theoretical understanding related to the effects of and mitigation strategies for deepfakes. While clearly highlighting the significant persuasive potential of deepfakes (and visual disinformation in general), the present study paints a more nuanced picture than was previously possible.",

          "authors": "Yufan Guo, Yuzhe Lei",
          "abstract": "Despite the increasing reliance on online media for news consumption, people generally exhibit lower levels of trust in online news relative to traditional media. To explain the preference disparities in media trust and their potential cross-national variations, this article examines individuals’ trust gap between newspapers and Internet news across 14 countries and regions in East, South, and Southeast Asia. Drawing on nationally representative data and other country-level data (2018–2021), we test two underlying mechanisms, political trust transfer and alternative information orientation, that account for the media trust gap, as well as their boundary conditions. Multilevel analysis reveals that political trust positively correlates with people’s relative trust in newspapers, which is pronounced in societies with lower levels of polarization and limited press freedom. Besides, using the Internet and social media as the main channels of political information seeking may increase people’s relative trust in Internet news, especially in societies with higher levels of press freedom and political polarization. Our findings offer systematic explanations for news trust preferences by combining political characteristics and their contextual conditions, which have implications for understanding today’s media trust crisis.",
