          "authors": "Jonathan Collins",
          "abstract": "A new wave of websites, referred to as alternative technology (alt-tech) social media, are proliferating across the internet, characterised by far-right-centric content and the imitation of mainstream platform affordances. This study employs Netnography to examine the recruitment practices of four prominent alt-tech platforms: Gab, Parler, Truth Social, and Gettr, providing an in-depth comparative analysis of their homepages. To better understand these communicative dynamics, the article highlights the similarities and differences between the homepage content of these alt-tech platforms. The findings reveal the hate-filled paradigm collectively captivating their userbases while highlighting the distinct technocultures developed and promoted within each platform. By focusing on the technocultural interplay between the selected platforms and their communities, the study offers a compelling exploration of alt-tech social media environments, the particular needs and niches fulfilled by each space, and their place within the broader far-right ecosystem.",

          "authors": "Eduard Cuelenaere",
          "abstract": "Streamers have become central to the production, circulation, and consumption of audiovisual content, reshaping how cultural industries manage creative risk and exploit intellectual property (IP). I argue that, within this platformized environment, content recycling – including (re-)adaptations, remakes, sequels, spin-offs, and prequels – has emerged not as a residual practice, but as a core operational logic. The article interrogates how recycling practices are structurally embedded within the economic and infrastructural design of global video-on-demand (VOD) services. Building on an interdisciplinary theoretical framework, the study draws on a comparative, cross-platform dataset covering all ‘Original’ fictional feature films released by Netflix (2015–2024), Amazon Prime Video (2018–2024), and Disney+ (2019–2024). Through this dataset, the article identifies both convergence and variation in how major streamers operationalize recycled content as a form of ‘IP extractivism’ – that is, the systematic transformation of existing IP into modular, extensible, and data-optimized content assets. The analysis indicates that, while all three streamers rely heavily on recycled content, the forms this recycling takes vary in ways that align with their different corporate configurations. In the dataset, Netflix’s Original film slate is dominated by speculative, adaptation-driven recycling, Amazon Prime Video’s by a mix of acquisitions and selective franchise extensions, and Disney + by patterns consistent with an integrated, conglomerate IP portfolio. The article argues that, under conditions of platformization, recycled IP functions as a privileged asset class: its modularity, data legibility, and retention potential align closely with logics of algorithmic governance and assetization. Conceptualizing recycling as IP extractivism, the article reconsiders originality as controlled variation within pre-enclosed worlds and highlights the implications of this shift for cultural diversity, rights ownership, and the sustainability of smaller production ecosystems.",

          "authors": "Katrine Bønneland Tølbøll, Jennifer Stead, Anke C. Plagnol",
          "abstract": "This preregistered study aimed to design and validate a questionnaire which measures passive and active Instagram use (iPAUM), and to explore its connection to users’ self-esteem levels. While Instagram, as an image-based social media platform, shares common features with other social networking sites (SNS) in enabling sharing of information and social interaction, its emphasis on visual content and specific digital features, such as algorithmic exposure to strangers’ content and public and one-directional interaction, may influence user experiences differently compared to other SNSs. Individual users interact with Instagram in a variety of ways. Consequently, studies that rely on general use measures, such as the time spent on Instagram, often yield mixed results in regard to psychological outcomes, as these measures do not account for variability in use. To address these nuances, a new scale for Instagram behaviours was created in two phases. In Study 1 (N = 289, Mage = 30.4, SD = 10.21), an 18-item questionnaire was developed, reflecting four categories of Instagram use: Active reacting, Active direct social, Active creating, and Passive use. The four-factor structure was established through exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and good internal reliability and validity were demonstrated. In Study 2 (N = 297, Mage = 29.6, SD = 9.8), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on an independent sample to validate the factor structure, confirming the reliability and discriminant validity of the measure. In the second part of Study 2, the iPAUM was employed to investigate associations between the four types of Instagram use and self-esteem, and whether following strangers on Instagram moderates this relationship. Self-esteem was not significantly associated with most types of Instagram use, except for a negative association between self-esteem and active direct social use, which was moderated by the percentage of strangers followed. The findings confirm the importance of differentiating between various types of Instagram use. The iPAUM is a validated tool which provides a more nuanced view of Instagram use for future research.",

          "authors": "Jing Niu, Bilal Mazhar, Yilin Ren, Inam Ul Haq",
          "abstract": "As generative artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent, understanding the factors that influence users' willingness to disclose personal information to these platforms is crucial. This study explores how Perceived Autonomy and Perceived Empathy in generative AI platforms influence users’ Behavioral Intent to Disclose personal information. Using a sample of 1,034 generative AI users in China, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the relationships between autonomy, empathy, trust, privacy concerns, and disclosure intentions. The results show that both Perceived Autonomy and Perceived Empathy positively influence Behavioral Intent to Disclose personal information on generative AI platforms. These relationships are positively mediated by Trust in Generative AI and negatively mediated by Privacy Concerns, highlighting the role of trust in enhancing disclosure and privacy concerns in reducing it. These findings align with the Extended Technology Acceptance Model, which emphasizes the role of trust and privacy as external factors in shaping user behavior. This study provides valuable insights into how AI system attributes influence disclosure decisions, offering guidance for the design of more trustworthy and privacy-sensitive generative AI platforms.",

          "abstract": "Parasocial bonds with Social Media Influencers (SMIs) can significantly influence followers’ behaviors, attitudes, and well-being, especially during adolescence and young adulthood. This study examined how diverse dimensions of connectedness with SMIs (i.e., escape, imitation, modeling, and aspiration) relate to perceived social connectedness in offline, combined offline-online social connectedness and online contexts, as well as to social self-efficacy and problematic social media use, age and sex. A total of 554 respondents (346 from Italy and 308 from the Netherlands) aged 18 to 35 years (Mage = 23.85; SDage = 3.63; 67.6% female) completed an online survey. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypothesized associations, followed by multigroup analysis to assess cross-cultural differences. Findings revealed that offline social connectedness was negatively associated with the escape dimension, while offline-online connectedness showed negative associations with escape and imitation. In contrast, online connectedness was positively associated with these same dimensions. Thus, the form in which social connectedness is experienced seems to relate to more immediate and superficial forms of parasocial engagement. Social self-efficacy was positively associated only with aspiration, highlighting a selective, identity-driven engagement with SMIs. Problematic social media use was positively linked to all connectedness dimensions, suggesting its broad influence. Younger respondents were more inclined to imitation, modeling and aspiration compared to older respondents, while male respondents reported higher scores than females across all dimensions. Finally, multigroup analysis revealed significant differences between Italian and Dutch respondents, emphasizing the role of cultural context in shaping parasocial dynamics with SMs.",

          "authors": "Zhiwei Yang, Qian Nie, Xiaoqin Wang, Halley M. Pontes, Zhaojun Teng",
          "abstract": "The rapid growth of short video platforms has raised concerns about their potential impact on young people’s mental health and well-being. However, the dynamic relationship between short video use and daily anxiety symptoms remains poorly understood. To address this gap, this study employed the experience sampling method (ESM) and dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM) to examine their bidirectional relationship in a representative sample of Chinese young adults (N = 389; Mage = 20.38 years, SD = 1.44 years; 51.1% male). The results indicated that at the within-person level, there were no significant bidirectional effects between short video use (i.e., active use, passive use, or total use time) and daily anxiety symptoms. However, upward social comparison tendency moderated the within-person effect of passive short video use on subsequent anxiety symptoms. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of upward social comparison experienced greater anxiety during periods of increased passive short video use. In contrast, those with lower levels of upward social comparison experienced less anxiety under similar conditions. These findings suggest that while short video use may not directly contribute to daily anxiety, its psychological impact is contingent upon individual differences in social comparison. In particular, those prone to upward comparison may be more vulnerable to anxiety during passive consumption of short video content.",

          "authors": "Cheng-Hong Liu, Fa-Chung Chiu, Po-Sheng Huang, Ting-Huan Lin, Chia-Lin Chang",
          "abstract": "Empathy is a key predictor of bystanders’ helping behaviors, yet its role in cyberbullying contexts has yielded inconsistent findings. This study investigated whether accuracy motivation, the drive to form correct and well-reasoned judgments, moderates the relationship between dispositional empathy and helping tendencies among cyberbullying bystanders. In Study 1, 164 Taiwanese undergraduates (61 males, 100 females, 3 unknown; Mage = 22.96, SD = 14.25) read a cyberbullying scenario and completed measures of empathy, helping tendencies, and need for cognition (NFC), a personality trait reflecting enjoyment of cognitively effortful tasks, widely used as a proxy for accuracy motivation. Results showed that the positive association between empathy and helping tendencies was weaker among participants with higher NFC scores (i.e., higher accuracy motivation). In Study 2, 180 undergraduates (67 males, 113 females; Mage = 20.96, SD = 5.44) were randomly assigned to either control or high accuracy motivation group. Findings revealed that, for participants in the control group, empathy predicted helping through increased feelings of responsibility. This mediational pathway was not observed in the high accuracy motivation condition. These findings suggest that accuracy motivation may attenuate the influence of empathy on helping behavior in cyberbullying contexts. Theoretically, this provides a possible explanation for the mixed results observed in prior research. Practically, it highlights the importance of encouraging individuals to prioritize providing timely support in cyberbullying incidents, rather than becoming overly focused on verifying the authenticity of online messages.",

          "abstract": "Although features of social media such as visibility and quantifiability might intensify processes of peer influence, there still is little systematic research on these mechanisms in the online context, especially when it comes to prosocial behavior. This study systematically investigated normative influences on adolescents’ antisocial and prosocial online behavior. We applied an extesnded version of the Theory of Normative Social Behavior to analyze how and under which conditions descriptive and injunctive norms influence social online behavior. We conducted an online survey among 420 Singaporean adolescents aged 14–17 years (M = 15.84, SD = 1.10) and applied structural equation modeling. For antisocial online behavior, we found that stronger perceived antisocial behavior of friends (descriptive norms) was related to more online antisocial behavior for those adolescents who also perceived a higher social approval of such behavior (injunctive norms). This relationship was further strengthened for adolescents who had more positive outcome expectations towards antisocial actions, both for descriptive and injunctive norms. For prosocial online behavior, we found that a stronger perception of friends behaving accordingly (descriptive norms) was directly related to more online prosocial behavior. Stronger positive outcome expectations towards prosocial online behavior were also directly related to more prosocial actions. The study underscores a complex interplay of norms and outcome expectations particularly for understanding antisocial online behavior, while suggesting other theoretical mechanisms might be more relevant for prosocial online behavior.",

          "authors": "Xue-Qin Yin, Jin-Liang Wang, Xiang Niu, Sebastian Scherr, James Gaskin, Dean McDonnell",
          "abstract": "Contributing to the active debate about how the use of social networking site (SNS) affects mental health, this study uses a person-centered approach to examine the relationship between SNS use and components of subjective well-being. Unlike previous research that primarily employed variable-centered approaches and focused on the active-passive use dichotomy, this study considered a range of SNS activities across different communication contexts (private vs. public) and audiences (e.g., friends vs. strangers) to identify distinct user profiles. A latent profile analysis among Chinese young adults (N = 1,075, Mage = 20.43) revealed five latent profiles: Minimal users (9.1%), Moderate users (22.2%), High explorers (19%), Private communicators (36.5%), and Advanced engagers (13.2%). These profiles were significantly associated with well-being. Advanced engagers reported the highest life satisfaction and positive affect, along with low negative affect. In contrast, Private communicators showed lowest life satisfaction and relatively low positive affect, though they also experienced less negative affect. Moderate users and High explorers experienced more negative affect, whereas Minimal users reported the lowest positive affect. These findings reveal heterogeneous user styles among Chinese SNS users and further suggest that active use may contribute to well-being, but only when it combines both public and private communication within existing social networks.",

From the perspective of expression styles and individual differences of trolls, the purpose of this study is to explore the potential mediating role of aggressive humor in the link between sadism and Internet trolling, as well as the moderating role of self-concept clarity. A total of 530 Chinese online users' data were collected on the Credamo platform and analyzed using PROCESS for SPSS. Sadistic traits were found to be positively correlated with Internet trolling. Moderated mediation analyses showed that aggressive humor played a mediating role between sadism and Internet trolling. Specifically, sadistic individuals were more likely to have aggressive humor, which further triggered Internet trolling. In addition, self-concept clarity moderated the direct relationship between sadism and Internet trolling. Specifically, higher self-concept clarity increased the association between sadism and Internet trolling. This study enriches our understanding of the mediating and moderating mechanisms linking sadistic traits to Internet trolling, allowing us a glimpse into the minds of Internet trolls and the sadistic motivations behind their behavior.",

          "authors": "Jinghan Ma, Yungeng Li",
          "abstract": "Smartphones are integral to adolescents’ lives, yet excessive use raises concerns about psychological impacts like procrastination. Although frameworks such as addiction, internet use disorder, and problematic internet use offer valuable insights into mechanisms and outcomes, they are less applicable to analyzing specific digital behaviors that do not reach pathological levels but still result in negative consequences. To address this gap, this study adopts a habit-centered perspective to investigate the interplay between mobile checking habits, procrastination, and parental mediation among rural Chinese adolescents. Through a purposive survey of 810 participants, we examine how social digital pressure and deficient self-regulation contribute to the formation of mobile checking habits, and whether different parental mediation strategies moderate the link between such habits and procrastination. Results indicate that social digital pressure and deficient self-regulation are positively associated with the formation of mobile checking habits and reveal a positive correlation between frequent mobile checking and procrastination. Neither restrictive nor active mediation altered the positive association between mobile checking habits and procrastination. Moreover, restrictive mediation—implemented through strict rules—further intensified the positive link between phone checking and procrastination. These findings challenge one-size-fits-all approaches to digital parenting and highlight the unintended consequences of overly rigid controls. This study contributes to debates on technology habits by reframing the role of parental mediation and advocating for context-sensitive approaches to digital well-being.",

          "abstract": "This study presents findings from a quantitative content analysis of 975 German momfluencer Instagram accounts, exploring how motherhood is portrayed in the context of the platform economy. Grounded in a social constructivist perspective the analysis investigates how increasing self-professionalization—measured by follower count—affects self-presentation and thematic focus. Social media platforms reward visibility and engagement, prompting influencers to align with prevailing platform logics. The results show that with greater reach, momfluencers increasingly adopt more conforming and marketable representations of motherhood, suggesting a shift toward stereotypical portrayals. The study highlights how platform dynamics shape digital self-representation and reinforce exclusion in maternal representations. By examining how influencer practices both reflect and reproduce traditional gender roles, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of gendered labor in digital environments and its economic dimensions.",

          "abstract": "Through an examination of Epic v. Apple , this article defines and traces the project of metaverse engineering: a long-term, large-scale reorganization of the games industry at technical, organizational, and governmental scales. Metaverse engineering as a games industry project seeks to redefine regulatory and market landscapes to redefine what counts as a platform, as data ownership, and as games themselves. Epic Games′ goal of the platformization of gaming production software like Fortnite and the Unreal Engine will require more than just using game engines to develop financialized 3D worlds. It will require the production of enticing legal and monetization models to encourage content creation, and competing for influence in regulatory and governmental regimes. Gaming platformization is not only technical, it is ontopolitical: the material realities of platforms shape and are shaped by rhetorical, social, cultural, and institutional forces. Epic's court successes have already moved us into a post-metaverse world.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have worried that messages about racial equity can produce backlash from White respondents. Drawing upon psychological reactance theory, we compared cognitive and affective responses to a message emphasizing how a redistributive policy would benefit everyone (universalist message) to a message that also emphasized how the policy would especially benefit minoritized racial groups (targeted universalist message) among a sample of 871 White Americans. Participants in the targeted universalist condition experienced more anger, endorsed more harmful stereotypes about racial outgroups, and saw the government as less responsible for addressing poverty than participants in the universalist condition. Mediation analyses suggest that anger, stereotyping, and perceived government responsibility have a negative, indirect effect on policy support. Our findings underscore the need for future work to identify strategies for communicating about racial equity that avoid activating harmful stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "A large body of experimental evidence has contributed to our understanding of Mood Management Theory (MMT) in the context of music. Extant research, however, lacks insights into everyday mood regulation through music listening, especially on music streaming services, where users’ choices are shaped by both self-selection and algorithmically personalized recommendations. Hence, we tested MMT using a novel in situ approach and investigated whether variations in self- versus algorithmically personalized music choices would moderate MMT’s proposed relationships between mood and music use. In a preregistered, two-week study, we combined experience sampling surveys with logged music streaming and audio feature metadata obtained via the Spotify API, utilizing 6,864 surveys from 144 listeners. Results largely indicated no support for MMT’s predictions. In addition, higher algorithmic personalization did not reinforce or distort MMT-related patterns. Our findings suggest re-specifying classic entertainment theories, such as MMT, for novel technological and methodological conditions.",

          "abstract": "This daily diary study examined dynamic processes of relational turbulence theory. Dating partners (N = 202) completed measures of pretest relationship uncertainty, followed by 30 days of daily rumination and relational turbulence, and then posttest collaborative planning. Using dynamic structural equation modeling with random effects, we found that for the typical partner: (a) on days when they ruminated more about their relationship than usual, they experienced greater than usual relational turbulence; and (b) when partners experienced more than typical turbulence on a day, the next day they ruminated more than usual. We found that partners who had higher (c) month-long averages in rumination, (d) ruminative inertia, and (e) ruminative volatility had higher averages in month-long relational turbulence. We also found that individual differences in partners’ relationship uncertainty predicted person-specific daily rumination (means, volatility) and relational turbulence (means, inertia, volatility), but only relational turbulence averages, in turn, predicted future collaborative planning.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines whether and how AI fitness instructors can foster psychological closeness and the alleviation of loneliness compared to human instructors. Design/methodology/approach The study involves 592 participants in online fitness environments and employs a quasi-experimental design. Data are subsequently analyzed using variance-based structural equation modeling. Findings Human instructors have a more pronounced positive effect on psychological closeness, resulting in the alleviation of loneliness. However, AI instructors also demonstrate potential to foster emotional connections, particularly when there is a high level of co-presence and perceived enjoyment. Co-presence and perceived enjoyment reduce the psychological gap between human and AI instructors, amplifying the positive effects of psychological closeness on alleviating loneliness. Research limitations/implications This study relies on a quasi-experimental design and short-term exposure to AI fitness instructors, which may limit causal inference and the generalizability of the findings to long-term human–AI relationships. Practical implications The findings highlight practical implications for designing AI-driven platforms in fitness, healthcare and education to enhance emotional well-being and alleviate loneliness through personalized experiences. Originality/value This study advances the literature on human–AI interaction by empirically demonstrating how AI instructors can foster psychological closeness and alleviate loneliness in digital fitness contexts. By integrating psychological closeness, co-presence and perceived enjoyment within a unified framework, the research extends social presence and Computer as Social Actor perspectives to AI-mediated well-being outcomes. The findings offer novel insights into how AI systems can be designed to narrow the psychological gap between human and artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "Purpose We investigate the effect of solvers’ adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) on their popularity in a supply-driven crowdsourcing platform. We also examine the impact of price signals as well as their heterogeneous impact based on the solvers’ membership duration on the platform. Design/methodology/approach Our analysis focuses on solvers who adopt GenAI for design-related gigs on the supply-driven crowdsourcing platform. By combining propensity score matching (PSM) with multi-period difference-in-differences (DID), we examine how GenAI adoption impacts solvers’ popularity and how price signals affect this main effect. Findings Our findings reveal that solvers who adopt GenAI tend to experience a surge in popularity on the platform. However, the price difference between GenAI-assisted and non-GenAI-assisted gigs results in divergent impacts of price signals manifested as boomerang or boosting effects. Practical implications To optimize GenAI integration, platforms should democratize access through training and embedded tools to empower a broader solver base. Solvers should proactively disclose GenAI use and align pricing with value perception to maximize market attractiveness. Finally, policymakers should establish regulations and incentives to ensure ethical GenAI deployment in digital labor markets. Originality/value We examine how GenAI affects creative service solvers’ popularity on a supply-driven crowdsourcing platform, making our work one of the first to establish a connection between GenAI adoption and solver-related outcomes. More importantly, we extend signaling theory by demonstrating the dual role of signaling.",

          "authors": "Vivian P. Ta-Johnson, Isabella M. Swafford",
          "abstract": "Conversations about politically contentious issues often break down due to a lack of shared understanding, with language playing a central role in this failure—particularly in discussions of abortion, one of the most polarizing topics in U.S. public life. Mutual understanding requires that speakers achieve high latent semantic similarity (LSS) by using words in similar ways. While extraversion has been linked to higher LSS, likely due to its association with social engagement and attentional focus, semantic alignment also depends on speakers’ capacity for empathic attunement, suggesting that empathy may serve as a key mechanism linking extraversion to LSS. This study examined whether empathy mediates the relationship between extraversion and LSS in computer-mediated conversations between unacquainted dyads ( N = 170) discussing the politically contentious topic of abortion. Results showed that empathy fully mediated this relationship, indicating that empathic attunement—not sociability alone—drives LSS. Findings inform communication theories by underscoring empathy's central role in fostering common ground understanding and highlight LSS as an observable linguistic marker of empathic engagement.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the mediating roles of perceived parental autonomy control and self-efficacy in the association between overparenting and emerging adults’ social media addiction. Emerging adults (ages 18–29) are particularly vulnerable to social media addiction. Theories suggest that overparenting may be a risk factor for social media addiction, but studies examining underlying mechanisms explaining the association are scarce. College students ( N = 240) from a large university in the southeastern U.S. participated in a longitudinal study, completing three surveys over 12 weeks. Path models were used to examine the proposed hypotheses. Results revealed a significant positive association between overparenting and social media addiction, with perceived parental autonomy control and self-efficacy serially mediating this association. These findings support the potential role of parental autonomy control and self-efficacy as mechanisms linking overparenting to social media addiction. The study also underscores the importance of addressing overparenting and promoting self-efficacy in emerging adults through targeted interventions by practitioners, educators, and parents to mitigate the risk of social media addiction.",

          "abstract": "Negative spousal interaction (e.g., criticism, arguments) can undermine psychosocial and relational well-being. The present research examined whether sense of purpose buffers these effects using two national longitudinal datasets (MIDUS and HRS). In MIDUS, associations between negative spousal interaction and same-wave life satisfaction, depression, relationship satisfaction, and marital strain were weaker among people reporting higher (versus lower) sense of purpose. Using HRS data, we disaggregated between- and within-person effects and found that sense of purpose similarly attenuated two between-person associations (linking average negative spousal interaction with depression and anxiety) and one within-person association (linking wave-to-wave fluctuations in negative spousal interaction with depression). Unexpectedly, between-person and within-person links between negative spousal interaction and relational well-being (enjoyment and closeness) were also moderated by purpose but in the opposite direction. This pattern of results appeared to be driven by purpose enhancing relational well-being among people who report low strain and during low-strain waves. Together, these findings indicate that sense of purpose may protect individuals from corrosive effects of negative partner interaction and enhance relationships during harmonious periods.",

          "abstract": "Digital technologies are now firmly ingrained in our daily lives and have become inevitable tools for interacting with a romantic partner. Beyond helping partners feel connected when apart, technology-mediated communication (TMC) is also widely used to discuss conflictual issues within romantic relationships. Given that managing conflicts efficiently is central to relationship maintenance, couple satisfaction, and intimacy, it is important to understand whether TMC facilitates this process, or whether it introduces additional challenges. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize empirical research that statistically compared TMC and face-to-face (FtF) conflict management with respect to conflict-level outcomes (e.g., emotions, perceived conflict resolution) and broader relationship-level outcomes (e.g., satisfaction). More specifically, it sought to determine whether managing couple conflicts through TMC leads to better, worse, or similar outcomes compared to traditional FtF conflict management. A systematic literature search across various databases identified 15 quantitative studies that met the inclusion criteria. Overall, findings suggested that using TMC to discuss conflicts is linked to similar outcomes as FtF interactions. However, some studies highlighted potential moderators such as attachment style, self-esteem, and relationship satisfaction, indicating that the effect of TMC in conflict management is not universal and depends on individual and relational factors. The review also addresses methodological considerations as well as directions for future research.",

          "authors": "Beatrice Bobba, Hao Yang, Francesca Prati, Elisabetta Crocetti",
          "abstract": "Nowadays, adolescents have increasing opportunities to interact with peers of their same and other ethnic groups. Yet, little is known about the implications of having an intragroup or intergroup best friend for the development of interpersonal identity processes (i.e., commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration) and its interplay with subjective, psychological, and social well-being. The current study aims to fill this gap. A total of 984 adolescents ( M age = 14.66; 62.70% females; 24.80% ethnic minority) living in the North-East part of Italy completed questionnaires at three time points reporting on their best friend’s ethnic group, interpersonal identity, and well-being. Results of chi-square test comparisons highlighted that ethnic majority youth had more intragroup while their ethnic minority peers had more intergroup best friendship ties. Further, results of latent growth curve analyses showed that ethnic majority and minority adolescents with intragroup and intergroup best friends displayed unique developmental trajectories of interpersonal identity commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as their interplay with subjective, psychological, and social well-being. Overall, these findings provide crucial insight into the type and implications of youth friendship patterns highlighting the protective role of a consolidated sense of identity for the well-being of youth in multicultural societies.",

          "abstract": "Local rural newspapers live a precarious existence in Alberta, Canada. In a declining economic situation, rural journalists have adopted unconventional practices to continue their work. Based on fieldwork in four communities, we show how rural journalists negotiate between the dominant metropolitan-based doxa and habitus of the journalistic field and their own position within communities. The analysis reveals rural-specific reporting practices, atypical business practices, and unconventional approaches to innovation. We argue that rural journalism is not merely a deviation from dominant metropolitan norms but a subfield actively redefining the boundaries of journalistic practice in response to economic precarity and community obligations.",

          "authors": "William Hollingshead, Anatoliy Gruzd, Philip Mai",
          "abstract": "In an era defined by overlapping global crises, immigration has become a key fault line in what scholars term a “polycrisis.” Within this context, social media platforms serve as digital battlegrounds for competing narratives about immigration, with TikTok occupying a distinct and understudied niche. This article examines how immigration-related content in Canada is framed on TikTok and how the platform’s logic of mimesis and interactivity, grounded in its affordances, shape immigration discourse. From a dataset of 5,305 public TikTok videos containing immigration-related terms and hashtags, we selected a sample of 344 English-language videos posted in 2025, each with over 100,000 plays and likely shown to Canadian users. Through a mixed-methods content analysis, we found that, contrary to expectations, the content leaned toward positive portrayals of immigration, accounting for 41% of the sample. Furthermore, despite expressing differing perspectives on immigration, users used TikTok’s affordances in comparable ways. That is, the same affordances that can support immigrants’ information seeking and sense of belonging through practical guidance and relatable storytelling, respectively, can be weaponized to amplify xenophobia by way of manipulated statistics and racist humour performed in skits and AI-generated videos. This highlights how TikTok’s affordances can simultaneously support digital inclusion and community building while also enabling exclusion and hostility. The findings, although rooted in Canada, hold broader relevance for understanding how short-video platforms mediate contentious issues across digitally connected societies.",

          "authors": "Zuzana Ľudviková, Rashid Gabdulhakov",
          "abstract": "As daily life, social relations, and labour increasingly unfold through digital media, users seek to regulate their digital engagement by adopting dumbphones, uninstalling applications, or participating in “digital detox.” In high-connectivity contexts such as the Netherlands, digital disengagement has gained traction among middle-class citizens and expatriate professionals. This article examines how digital disconnection is commodified, socially valorised, and collectively experienced through a case study of The Offline Club (TOC), a Netherlands-based initiative offering curated digital detox events. Drawing on a netnographic approach, we analysed 35 posts on TOC’s Instagram page, conducted participant observation at two events, and carried out nine semi-structured interviews with attendees. We argue that TOC constructs digital disconnection as a curated, temporary practice that unfolds within urban contexts where the role of digital technologies becomes increasingly ambiguous. While TOC markets disconnection as resistance to digital saturation, its own reliance on social media and platform infrastructure for outreach and legitimacy reveals a paradox of disconnection-through-connection. Our findings demonstrate how such initiatives both respond to and reproduce platform logics, simultaneously cultivating community while inadvertently reinforcing cycles of commodified digital non-use. From a digital humanist perspective, we critique the limitations of initiatives like TOC that offer symptomatic relief without addressing the structural conditions of digital dependency. While participants may temporarily reclaim attention and presence, the broader socio-technical systems that underpin digital overload remain unchallenged, raising critical questions about the efficacy and politics of commercialised digital detox movements.",

          "authors": "Lotta Braunerhielm, Pernille K. Andersson, Laila Gibson",
          "abstract": "This article critically explores the intersection of digital geographies, community building, tourism development, and bottom-up processes that shape resilient rural futures. While rural development initiatives often adopt urban-centric norms and technology-driven solutions, such approaches risk overlooking the lived realities and social fabric of rural communities. Digital representations of rural places frequently reinforce stereotypes, leaving these regions underrepresented and mischaracterised in media narratives. In the Smart Villages in Sweden project, we sought to counter this trend by integrating tourism and place design through participatory, place-based methods. Rather than assuming technology as a panacea, our approach foregrounded local knowledge, everyday practices, and grassroots engagement to co-create digital solutions that resonate with rural life. This participatory action research process enabled the identification of concepts that address local challenges and aspirations, fostering hope and vitality within communities. Our findings demonstrate that sensible digital development—anchored in sociality and local agency—can bridge spatial, social, and digital divides. By combining geomedia studies with tailored, community-driven design, digital tools become more than technical artefacts: They serve as catalysts for storytelling, value creation, and connection. Ultimately, technology must be embedded in the rhythms of rural life to strengthen social bonds, cohesion, and solidarity. We argue that sustainable rural futures depend not only on innovation but on approaches that respect and amplify the voices and practices of those who inhabit these places.",

          "abstract": "This article builds on the “geographies of hope” (Hazlewood et al., 2023) to better understand and address the gendered challenges posed by AI technologies in the Global South. AI-powered surveillance and technology-facilitated gender-based violence have reshaped digital geographies, leading to the rise of non-consensual synthetic intimate images—often called “deepfakes” or “deepfake pornography”—that disproportionately target women, LGBTQI+ communities, and racialized groups. These harms reveal the urgent need for inclusive AI safety and AI regulation frameworks that reflect the diversity of material and cultural geographies across the Global South. Through a cross-regional analysis of emerging AI safety policies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, this article critiques the limitations of top-down, risk-based governance models and introduces a cross-cultural Gen(der) AI Safety framework rooted in decolonial and feminist praxis. Using critical discourse analysis, it identifies three systemic challenges—exclusionary legal-technical architectures, overreliance on individual responsibility, and entrenched power asymmetries. In response, the article proposes “geographies of hope” that emphasize localized, community-driven, and pleasure-positive interventions to counter digital harms. By centering intersectional and decolonial approaches, it calls for an AI safety agenda that affirms gender agency, collective joy, and justice.",

          "abstract": "Amid the polycrisis of Covid-19 pandemic and disinformation, rural Traditional Peoples and Communities in Brazil demonstrated remarkable resilience. This article examines the social mobilization strategies developed by 33 communities between 2020 and 2022, highlighting the community-based communication technologies used for collective action. Traditional Peoples and Communities are local groups with territorial ties and empirical knowledge who are recognized as key actors in environmental and natural resource protection. Although they play a crucial ecological role, there is a research gap on how these communities developed communicative strategies to strengthen resilience against disinformation during the pandemic. Guided by participatory and action research epistemology, the study involved 274 family representatives across nine Brazilian states from the Atlantic Coast, combining a multi-method approach. Data collection included questionnaires quantifying media access and internet usage alongside conversation circles and community mapping documenting communication practices. The results make explicit that Traditional Peoples and Communities faced two main types of disinformation: regarding Covid-19 vaccination and related to land use and speculation. In a context of limited digital connectivity, they developed communal internet practices—such as broadband sharing—that supported collective organization and information exchange. Besides, two experiences stood out: community health workers’ efforts to counter vaccine disinformation, and community leaders’ use of online meeting platforms to promote social mobilization in the face of environmental disinformation. Findings underscore how community-based communication technologies can foster political agency and strengthen resilience against disinformation.",

          "authors": "Yahia Benlarbi, Samira Belghitia",
          "abstract": "This study evaluates Algeria’s communication strategy during the Covid-19 pandemic by examining the alignment between the national Preparedness and Response Plan and the communication practices implemented throughout the crisis. Using a qualitative descriptive approach, the study relies on documentary analysis of governmental communication plans, official statements, media coverage, and scholarly literature on risk and crisis communication. The findings show that although Algeria adopted a structured communication framework consistent with international guidelines—such as transparency, rumor monitoring, and expert mobilization—its implementation encountered several institutional and communicative challenges that limited overall effectiveness. Key obstacles included fluctuations in public trust due to inconsistencies in epidemiological reporting and delays in clarifying technical errors, in addition to uneven media coordination, limited opportunities for two-way communication, and a predominantly expert-centered, one-directional messaging style. The analysis further demonstrates that access to official information was significantly more restricted among marginalised populations, including rural communities, residents of “shadow areas,” low-income households, migrants, and persons with disabilities. Digital gaps, infrastructural constraints, and linguistic or cultural barriers shaped how these groups received, interpreted, and acted upon risk messages, underscoring that the effectiveness of communication during the pandemic depended not only on message clarity but also on inclusiveness, equity, and access. The study concludes that effective crisis communication requires more than technical accuracy: It must integrate principles of social equity, community engagement, and message adaptation to the needs of marginalised groups. Strengthening transparency, improving coordination between authorities and media, expanding community-based communication channels, and ensuring equitable access to information emerge as essential components for enhancing public trust and societal resilience during future health emergencies. The Algerian experience ultimately demonstrates that structural communication gaps disproportionately affect vulnerable groups and that evaluating the success of risk communication efforts requires careful attention to how marginalised populations access, understand, and act upon public-health information.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;",

Accordingly, mobile media augment human cognitive processes by being accessible to users as they move through and act in the world. Moreover, this theory accounts for the emergence of mobile autonomous systems that can move through and act in the world, in the absence of human cognition. As an analytical tool, this theory can be applied to understand specificities of how humans and nonhumans act, move, know, and produce agential change in the world. It can inform scholarship that explores social and material impacts, moral–ethical dimensions, and the design of mobile systems that augment and supplant human decision-making processes.",

A comparative content analysis of 2053 debunking articles by 16 Meta partners across 8 European and Latin American countries reveals that most false content was labeled or remained online, with deletion occurring in approximately 30% of cases—though it remains unclear whether the removal was carried out by Facebook or by the original spreaders. In addition to 30 expert interviews, the study finds that fact-checkers prioritize counter-speech and transparency, rejecting a permissive “anything goes” stance. Some support removals in cases involving incitement to violence, illegality, or harmful health misinformation. Most agree that freedom of expression should not guarantee algorithmic amplification. Concerns were also raised about the politicization and potential manipulation of Community Notes.",

          "abstract": "In today’s digital landscape, platforms increasingly “feel like” social media. We observe the “social media-fication” of so-called “non-social media” platforms as expressive characteristics of traditional social media platforms are incorporated into mobile apps typically used for other purposes. We argue that this manifests through the repackaging of user behavioral data into expressive social updates, such as GPS maps capturing user movement or the personalized data visualizations of Spotify Wrapped. To examine this phenomenon, we completed platform walkthroughs for three apps: fitness tracking app Strava, payment app Venmo, and music streaming app Spotify. We theorize the concentration and intensification of datafication as a process that we term hyperdatafication. Hyperdatafication emerges through the repurposing of “backend” user data into socially mobilizable data representations, which encourage and further platform engagement within the sociotechnical landscape of affective capitalism. Ultimately, this study raises questions about self-tracking, commodification, and platformed sociality beyond social media.",

          "abstract": "To explore the strengthening role of influencer marketing agencies, this study turns its focus away from creators to the ‘backstage’ of feminised social media work. Using an algorithmic ethnographic approach informed by critical feminist inquiry, this study investigates how influencer marketing agencies’ data practices shape content creation. Through observation and content analysis of creator events, staff meetings, briefings, webinars and other educational material, as well as interviews with staff members, three distinct categories connected with data practices were recognised: anticipation, adaptation and negotiation. It is argued that while influencer agencies negotiate between creation and platform control, they only rarely resist the algorithmic logics of platforms or negotiate practices to fit their ideals instead of adapting to platforms and their business models. Situating agencies’ daily work within the larger historical tradition of advertising, commodification of audiences and feminised labour, this study offers pathways for understanding how influencer marketing shapes social media today.",

This study examines how youth groups, known as coletivos , from low-income communities in Brazil used social media platforms during the pandemic to organize themselves. Our analysis focuses on the intersectionality of place and digital activism. Using in-depth interviews and online observation, the findings are analyzed through three lenses: the groups’ understanding of place, how the pandemic affected their place functioning and sense-making (agenda-focused, local-focused, and agenda-local groups), and how this process strengthens the different types of places (ranging from online to physical communities, encompassing local neighborhoods to national level groups). We show a significant variation across groups in the relationship between Internet dependency and place of action. Findings also demonstrate how the groups adapted their collective action toolkit to suit the digital platforms and developed new ones.

          "abstract": "Social media is where most people report experiencing toxicity. While existing research has documented the prevalence and predictors of toxic behaviors, less is known about how individuals who engage in toxicity perceive and justify their actions, especially on mainstream platforms. This study addresses this gap by conducting 25 in-depth interviews with individuals who were toxic in political discussions on Facebook and Twitter. The findings reveal that many view their toxicity as a form of political participation. Three distinct justifications for toxicity were identified: venting political frustrations, pursuing truth through blunt deliberation, and seeking to persuade or mobilize others. These findings suggest that toxic speech can function as a deliberate, albeit hostile, form of political engagement, and they highlight the diverse functions social media serves for politically motivated users. The study calls for targeted interventions to address the distinct motivations underlying toxicity.",

Through a qualitative thematic analysis of 67 TikTok videos created by adolescent survivors of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the study explores how platform-specific affordances—viral trends, POV storytelling, dark humor, and digital memorialization—shape trauma narratives. Findings reveal that TikTok enables young survivors to renegotiate their post-captivity identities through participatory storytelling, humor as a coping mechanism, and the integration of personal grief into collective digital memory. The study situates these practices within theories of trauma representation, adolescent identity development, and Goffman’s dramaturgical model, illustrating how TikTok serves as both a space for self-expression and a site of performative meaning-making. By bridging digital media studies with trauma psychology, this research highlights the evolving role of social media in shaping adolescent resilience and identity reconstruction.",

US participants ( N = 262) assigned to avatars displaying a stranger’s face, rather than their own, showed greater acceptance of outgroup virtual humans. Perceived identifiability mediated the influence of avatar face on self-other overlap. Social dominance orientation moderated this effect, as mediation was strongest among individuals with average and high scores. Positive contact enhanced self-other overlap with virtual humans, whereas negative contact unexpectedly increased empathy for outgroup members. Ingroup negative contact boosted positive ingroup feelings among participants using avatars that mirrored their own face. Consistent with positive ingroup biases, individuals reported greater positive feelings and empathy toward ingroup members following ingroup (vs outgroup) interactions. The results provided evidence regarding the theoretical mechanisms through which VR contact reduces and boosts prejudice.",

While scholarship on user resistance is growing, insufficient studies theorise such ‘invisible’ behaviours. This article develops James C. Scott’s notion of ‘infrapolitics’ to conceptualise users’ mundane tactics of resisting algorithmic power (surveillance capitalism and political censorship). Employing a video diary–interview study of Douyin users, we analyse three interrelated dimensions of infrapolitical algorithmic resistance: reflexivity (the recognition of one’s own actions as resistance based on the parallel process of developing self-understanding and awareness of algorithms), tactical immanence (using technological features for alternative purposes while still operating within platform logics) and identity-based (resisting profiling through multi-account practices and the enactment of various selves). We show that infrapolitical resistance emerges through everyday engagement with algorithms, evolving from sidestepping mismatched recommendations to subtly, reflexively and culturally situated practice that challenges the power structures embedded in algorithmic governance.",

An online questionnaire was administered to 595 Italian and Dutch PNAs users to detect their PNAs community-related use, frequency of face-to-face encounters with other users, local social capital, active involvement, and SoC. A multiple mediation model was run using structural equation modeling. PNAs use associates to face-to-face encounters among local community members and community social capital, but not to community involvement. Through social capital, PNAs use indirectly enhances SoC. These results show that PNAs community-related use may enhance local community experiences through prompting face-to-face encounters among community fellows and making users feel more embedded into local social networks. This confirms PNAs community-related use potential to improve users’ neighborhood social and community experiences.",

In order to fill this gap, we present in this article a case study of the 250 most active commenters on RT German’s Facebook page in a 6-month period at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. Using a mixed-methods approach combining large-scale data scraping with quantitative and qualitative content analysis, we find that the majority of these highly active commenters constituted an anti-democratic counterpublic. However, we also observed a smaller collective of commenters, whom we theorize as “disruptive public” as they vigorously sought to challenge the activities of the anti-democratic counterpublic. We discuss the benefits and risks of various strategies of disrupting anti-democratic counterpublics and consequences for democratic debate.",

          "authors": "Barbara Heinisch, Florian Heigl, Daniel Dörler",
          "abstract": "Despite the growing interest in citizen science, many projects continue to operate in isolation. This study explores the current state and potential for cooperation among citizen science projects in Austria by analyzing the extent, reasons and obstacles for cooperation. Through a questionnaire distributed to 121 projects listed on the Austrian citizen science platform Österreich forscht , 50 projects were examined. The analysis found that interactions between these projects are limited, with most cooperation focusing on sharing experiences. The primary motivation for (future) cooperation is achieving common goals, while the main obstacle to cooperating with other citizen science projects is a lack of capacity and resources. The role of the citizen science platform for increasing cooperation ranges from networking (events) to highlighting long-term projects that have the necessary infrastructure for cooperation. Future research could expand to projects outside the platform and examine the characteristics of collaborators.",

          "authors": "Yi Liao",
          "abstract": "This scoping review examines how uncertainty has been measured in science communication research, analyzing 58 studies published between 1976 and 2024. The review identified 68 uncertainty measures, categorized into three main types: (1) trait uncertainty, (2) state uncertainty, and (3) uncertainty discrepancy. While most measures demonstrated good internal reliability, evidence for the validity of scales was limited, particularly for newly developed scales. The analysis reveals significant fragmentation in measurement approaches and a concerning reliance on single-item and unidimensional measures given the complexity of the construct. Science communication research would benefit from more rigorous scale development, standardized measurement approaches, and cross-cultural validation of uncertainty scales.",

          "authors": "P. Sol Hart, Lauren Feldman, Soobin Choi, Annie Li Zhang",
          "abstract": "We investigated how news articles discussing unequal impacts of climate change due to race versus class influence beliefs and support for action. We conducted two online survey experiments focusing on flooding (Study 1) and heat waves (Study 2). In Study 1, White participants and those with high levels of symbolic racism had lower levels of belief and support when exposed to the race-focused condition, although these interactions were not as consistent in Study 2. Results suggest that focusing on class-based climate disparities may be less susceptible to backfire effects than focusing on race-based disparities.",

          "authors": "Oliver Mel Allen, Yi Zu, Milo Z. Trujillo, Brooke Foucault Welles",
          "abstract": "In this work, we collected and analyzed social media posts to investigate an aesthetic-based pipeline where users searching for Cottagecore content may find Tradwife content co-opted by white supremacists. Through quantitative analysis of over 200,000 Tumblr posts and qualitative coding of about 2350 Tumblr posts, we did not find evidence of an explicit radicalization. We found that problematic Tradwife posts found in the literature may be confined to Tradwife-only spaces, while content in the Cottagecore tag generally did not warrant extra moderation. However, we did find evidence of a mainstreaming effect in the overlap between the Tradwife and Cottagecore communities. In our qualitative analysis, there was more interaction between queer and Tradwife identities than expected based on the literature, and some Tradwives even explicitly included queer people and disavowed racism in the Tradwife community on Tumblr. This could be genuine, but we propose that this is an example of mainstreaming, where white supremacists re-brand their content and follow platform norms to spread ideologies that would otherwise be rejected. In addition, through temporal analysis, we observed a change in the central tags used by Tradwives in the Cottagecore tag pre- and post-2021. Initially, these posts focused on aesthetics and hobbies like baking and gardening, but post-2021, the central tags focused more on religion, traditional gender roles, and homemaking—all of which align with white supremacist rhetoric about womanhood.",

          "authors": "Matthew J. A. Craig, Mina Choi, Ying Zhu, Toqa Hassan, Samuel Mensah Noi, David E. Silva",
          "abstract": "Social media has grown to be a large part of our virtual connectedness online. However, with this growth in digital connection, we have also become connected with digital entities that run them (social media). Borrowing from the concept of interpersonal responsiveness, researchers have found that users perceive their algorithm to be responsive to their needs and sensitive to their identity have a greater sense of well-being online and media enjoyment. However, the mechanisms for which these connect with one another (responsiveness predicting subjective well-being) remain to be disentangled. Guided by self-determination theory, this study examines whether autonomy, competence, and relatedness satisfaction through TikTok use mediate the associations between perceived algorithm responsiveness and insensitivity and satisfaction with life. With an online survey ( N = 385), our study found that greater responsiveness is associated with greater life satisfaction mediated through greater relatedness satisfaction. However, greater competence satisfaction was associated with lower life satisfaction. Future research and current limitations in light of our findings are discussed.",
