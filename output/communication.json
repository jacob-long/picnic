          "authors": "Cong Lin, Chenxu Liu",
          "abstract": "Creativity is widely understood as a distinct human characteristic, yet the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping creative ecosystems, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Despite these advancements, comprehensive insights into how social groups, especially stakeholders, perceive and experience AI-generated art remain inadequate. Through semi-structured interviews with 23 artistic practitioners in China across visual art domains such as painting, design, and filmmaking, this study identifies themes related to practitioners’ perceptions of the creative process (mechanism and time), created works (aesthetic and quality), and creating actors (role and ownership) from a human-AI comparative view. Contextualized perceptions shaped by variations across art domains are also revealed. As human-AI collaboration in artistic creation gains prominence, this study also illustrates how artistic practitioners negotiate their agency with machine agency through dual routes: the affective route and the action route. The findings contribute to the ongoing discourse of artificial creativity, enrich the socio-technical understandings of AI-generated visual art and shed light on the agency dynamics between human and AI within the context of artistic creation.",

          "authors": "Eliot Bates",
          "abstract": "Earth Modular Society (EMS) is a cross-platform community dedicated to live hardware modular synthesis, with their primary efforts going into a 24/7 modular “radio station” that livestreams on Twitch and YouTube, and a supporting Discord chat server. Although part of the broader modular synthesis gear culture (a large-scale social formation that coalesces around specific classes of fetishized technical objects), EMS represents a new development in gear cultures as it foregrounds live performance and minimizes the accrual of status via conspicuous consumption. The normative governance structures of platform-specific gear culture communities preclude all but one or a handful of users from having any meaningful input into the rules, governance, or participatory modes of the platform. In contrast, EMS is structured as a doitocracy , where all are encouraged to bring things to do to the community, and to support each other in doing. The doitocracy concept contributes to understanding the wide range of DIY (do-it-yourself) and DIT (do-it-together) community practices. This doitocracy case study also demonstrates the importance of analyzing the performance of crafted objects, and how these, alongside platform-jumping practices, can constitute primary organizational forces in online/offline community sociality.",

          "abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs), allows ordinary users to turn themselves or their loved ones into AI chatbots. Based on the analysis of media reporting on users’ experiences, the study identifies three major features that frequently appear in users’ interactions with ghostbots simulating their deceased loved ones: (1) the interactions often elicit intense emotional responses from the users; (2) the purposes of using ghostbots can be practical, including mitigating grief, seeking advices, looking for emotional support, or say a final goodbye; and (3) the interactions may generate new knowledge, ideas, and memories about the dead. The study also introduces the concept of artificial continuing communication , recognizing the interpretative asymmetry inherent in interactions with AI interlocutors, while emphasizing the continuing bonds between the living and the dead. I argue that although ghosts are reduced versions of the dead, this emerging form of communication challenges the normative hydraulic model of the psyche, which views grief as a negative emotion to be discharged and emphasizes emotional detachment from the deceased. I contend that a type of thin reciprocal love exists between the users and their ghostbots and suggest that the ghostbot use offers an alternative perspective on how we relate to love, loss, and emotional continuity, albeit its user base remains small.",

          "authors": "Juan Martín Prada",
          "abstract": "This article examines the relationships between contemporary art and crypto culture, analysing a series of artistic practices that question the technocultural values and dynamics that have emerged with blockchain technology. These practices form a specific path in the development of contemporary art which, through neo-conceptual strategies, is oriented towards the critical thematisation of crypto culture in its multiple dimensions (creative, economic, social). In these works, blockchain, far from being considered merely a cryptographic recording system or a means for commercialising digital goods, becomes a space in which to poetically explore the multiple contradictions and paradoxes of the digital economy. The text places special emphasis on the main thematic nuclei of these artistic practices: The NFT business model based on the creation of verifiable ‘digital scarcity’, the problematisation of the concept of authenticity in the field of digital objects, the emancipatory potential (and its limits) of the decentralised nature of blockchains, and the ecological impact of crypto economies.",

This cross-sectional online survey of 1,764 participants aged 16–28 (75.7 percent women) identified four addiction subtypes using specific scales. Network analysis revealed significant comorbidity (95.35 percent) among subtypes, with smartphone addiction playing a dominant role, leading to social media, Internet, and potentially game addiction. High comorbidity suggests a shared vulnerability, with smartphone use as a catalyst. Smartphone addiction is a key precursor to other digital addictions.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how participatory publics persist in depopulated rural areas during periods of low visibility and mobilization. Drawing on pragmatism and mediatization theory, we analyse communicative figurations in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) using survey data ( N = 529) and develop a Participatory Public Connection Index. Regression models reveal that public connection is driven more by communicative and territorial factors – such as local radio use, civic motivations and municipality size – than by sociodemographics. Our findings suggest that local media help sustain symbolic bonds and latent publics, contributing to democratic engagement and territorial cohesion despite the absence of visible collective action. We conceptualize latency as the communicative and symbolic potential through which publics persist beyond visible mobilization; operationally, the Participatory Public Connection Index captures this latent connection sustained by everyday local media practices.",

          "authors": "Lin Jia, Xin Liu, Tong Dora Chen, Yichuan Wang, Kenichi Takahashi, Yuan Wang",
          "abstract": "Purpose Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly embedded in service operations, particularly in crafting managerial responses (MRs) to online negative and positive reviews. Yet, little is known about how firms should optimally allocate responsibilities between human staff and GAI across distinct response tasks, nor how such allocations shape consumer perceptions and downstream behavioral intentions. This study investigates how customers evaluate MRs produced by different agents including humans, GAI and multiple forms of human and GAI collaboration across specific response tasks. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a randomized online experiment. Main effects were examined using ANOVA with data from 879 participants, and the underlying mechanisms were further analyzed using the PROCESS macro with a parallel mediation model. Findings Our findings show that to improve customer satisfaction and increase booking intentions, negative reviews are most effectively addressed through an augmented human approach in which GAI creates an initial draft and experienced professional staff refine it. In contrast, positive reviews are best handled solely by experienced professional staff. Originality/value This study advances knowledge on how to combine GAI with human efforts in service operations, identifies key psychological mechanisms that mediate the effects of different collaboration modes on consumer perceptions and behavioral intentions and offers actionable guidance for service operations managers. The results suggest that GAI should be deployed strategically to augment, rather than replace, human intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Cognitive absorption is critical for hedonic technology addiction, yet the mediating mechanisms by which cognitive absorption affects hedonic technology addiction remain unclear. Drawing on dual-system theory, which posits that reflexive and reflective systems are pivotal in shaping user decisions and behaviors, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of the drivers of hedonic technology addiction. We conceptualize impulsive urge as the reflexive system and self-regulation as the reflective system, aiming to uncover the mediating roles of these two distinct systems in linking cognitive absorption to hedonic technology addiction. Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal survey involving 410 online gamers was conducted, with data collected at two time points separated by a 6-week interval. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to validate the proposed research model. Findings The results indicate that cognitive absorption elicits responses from both reflexive and reflective systems. Specifically, cognitive absorption enhances the reflexive system via impulsive urge, while inhibiting the reflective system through impaired self-regulation. The joint full mediation of impulsive urge and self-regulation in the relationship between cognitive absorption and hedonic technology addiction has been proved. Our results shed lights on the underlying reflexive and reflective systems by which cognitive absorption affects hedonic technology addiction. Originality/value This study leverages dual-system theory to elucidate the mediating mechanisms through which cognitive absorption influences hedonic technology addiction. By demonstrating how cognitive absorption triggers addictive behaviors through heightened impulsive urges and impaired self-regulation, this study advances the literature on hedonic technology addiction and offers actionable strategies for intervention.

          "authors": "Samuel N. Kirshner, Jessica Lawson",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores how competitive pressure and organizational goals influence responsible AI (RAI) decisions when introducing AI-based digital services. We examine how two types of unethical competition, horizontal (numerous competitors using similar unethical AI tactics) and vertical (a competitor using highly unethical AI), interact with regulatory-focus-driven objectives to shape RAI deployment. Design/methodology/approach We design three experimental studies featuring scenarios involving the launch of an unethical AI service to assess how competitive pressures and organizational goals affect RAI decisions. Each experiment manipulates horizontal and vertical unethical competition. Participants’ regulatory focus is measured in Study 1 (N = 249) and is manipulated through organizational goals in Study 2 (N = 304) to assess their interactions with competitive pressure. Study 3 (N = 159) tests moral disengagement theory as the underlying mechanisms. Findings The results show that horizontal unethical competition increases the launch of unethical AI, regardless of regulatory focus. We uncover a novel interaction effect between vertical unethical competition and firm objectives. While the severity of a competitor’s unethical behavior reduces RAI deployment directly, prevention-focused goals can counteract this effect under vertical unethical competition, promoting more responsible decisions. Originality/value This research advances RAI scholarship by introducing two unethical competitive contexts to analyze how competitive pressure and organizational goals shape decisions to launch unethical AI services. By isolating horizontal and vertical competition, we provide new insights into how external competition drives UPB. The findings provide a behavioral framework for understanding ethical trade-offs in AI deployment, linking high-level ethics to practical governance in competitive settings.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines the impact of gamified work on knowledge hiding among gig workers from the perspective of regulatory focus theory. Design/methodology/approach To validate the proposed theoretical model, we conducted three studies. Study 1 was an experiment with a 2 (gamified work: absence vs presence) between-subjects design. Studies 2 and 3 were surveys. Findings The main results revealed several key findings. First, gamified work increased self-efficacy. Second, gamified work inhibited knowledge hiding through self-efficacy. Third, gamified work increased affective rumination. Fourth, gamified work facilitated knowledge hiding through affective rumination. Finally, task-technology fit served as a moderating factor in these relationships. Practical implications Organizations are encouraged to design dynamic and personalized gamified work systems. Additionally, psychological development initiatives should be implemented to enhance workers' self-efficacy. A psychological support mechanism could also be established to alleviate affective rumination. Furthermore, ensuring an optimal task-technology fit remains crucial. These strategies are expected to effectively mitigate knowledge hiding behaviors. Originality/value Most studies on knowledge hiding have focused on formal employees within traditional firm settings, often overlooking those working outside the conventional economic framework, such as gig workers.

          "authors": "Xiao-Liang Shen, You Wu, Yongqiang Sun",
          "abstract": "Purpose Social media rumors have increasingly become a prevalent and serious issue. Despite substantial efforts by governments and authoritative institutions, the effectiveness of combating rumors has not always been satisfactory due to the insufficient engagement of social media users. This study underscores the critical role of user participation in combating rumors and explores this issue from the perspective of ethical decision-making. Design/methodology/approach Employing a multi-method approach, Study 1 surveyed 508 respondents in the USA to investigate the ethical decision-making process in rumor combating participation (RCP). Study 2 replicated the main findings in the Chinese context through an experiment, while further exploring how social norms moderate the ethical decision-making process. Findings Study 1 not only reveals key ethical factors influencing RCP but also identifies two fully mediated chain effects. Study 2 first validates the findings reported in Study 1, and then highlights that injunctive norms exert a stronger influence on the decision-making process when normative appeals are framed using prescriptive rules. Conversely, when framed using proscriptive rules, the opposite effect is observed. Practical implications The findings suggest that social media platforms and policymakers can leverage normative appeals and tailored framing strategies to enhance user participation, thereby mitigating the negative impact of social media rumors. Originality/value This study represents one of the initial attempts to investigate RCP on social media from an ethical decision-making perspective. The integrated model provides empirical validation in both the USA and China, and the findings help resolve the contradictory results observed in prior research regarding the effects of social norms.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Understanding the causes and the consequences of online romance scam victimization fear, a psychological stress, is crucial for online daters to achieve a positive experience and for online dating platforms to provide that experience. This research contextualized and tested a theory concerning the negative psychological factors of online romance scams and their consequences on online dating positive psychology. Design/methodology/approach This study employed a developmental mixed-method design. The first phase was a qualitative study following a positivist paradigm. The second phase was a survey-based quantitative study. After the quantitative results, this research combined the understanding from both phases to develop the meta-inferences and finalized the antecedents and consequences of online romance scam victimization fear in online dating. Findings An increase in online romance scam-related anxiety and social vulnerability is positively associated with cognitive vulnerability. An increase in online romance scam-related anxiety, cognitive vulnerability and social vulnerability is positively associated with online romance scam victimization fear. An increase in online romance scam-related anxiety, cognitive vulnerability, social vulnerability and victimization fear is negatively associated with online dating psychological capital. Practical implications Utilizing this study’s findings, dating platforms can develop strategies to reduce users’ fear of online romance scam victimization and provide them with higher psychological capital to continue online dating. Originality/value The study contributes to cybercrime and online dating literature by capturing the psychological antecedents of scam victimization fear and showing how fear stimuli can lead to responses, which in turn cause a detrimental effect on online dating psychological capital.",

          "authors": "Yajie Hu, Kuanchin Chen, Shasha Zhou, Qinjian Yuan",
          "abstract": "Purpose Existing research has provided limited insights into the dynamic mechanisms through which multiple signals are interpreted within online health communities (OHCs). This study attempts to initiate a more integrative understanding of the dynamic interaction effects between patient-generated signals (i.e. herding and word-of-mouth signals) and physician-generated signals (i.e. central effort and peripheral effort signals) on online physician consultations. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a dynamic panel modelling approach, applying longitudinal data collected from 844 physicians from June to December 2020. Specifically, the two-step system, generalised method of moments (GMM) with instrumental variables and propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to estimate the proposed research model. Findings This research provides empirical evidence that the herding signal and the word-of-mouth (WOM) signal have a positive effect on physician consultations within OHCs. Our findings also demonstrate that the peripheral effort signal complements the effect of the WOM signal on physician consultations, whereas it substitutes for the influence of the herding signal on physician consultations. In addition, this study finds that the central effort signal substitutes the effect of the WOM signal on physician consultation as it intensifies. Originality/value This study contextualises and frames a multidimensional signal framework of the herding signal, the WOM signal, the central effort signal and the peripheral effort signal in OHCs, which augments the predominant applications of signalling theory in e-commerce contexts. Furthermore, this research broadens the theoretical comprehension of signalling theory by revealing the substitutive and complementary effects among these signals, particularly in a mixed signalling environment.",

          "authors": "Gonçalo Sá, Carlos Tam, Manuela Aparicio",
          "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to understand the determinants of e-commerce shoppers’ well-being. Well-being refers to how positively online consumers experience and are affected by their interactions with digital shopping platforms. Studying how customers perceive their well-being when interacting with artificial intelligence (AI)-powered e-commerce websites is crucial, as it highlights a paradigm shift from traditional online shopping, focused mainly on convenience and speed, toward AI-driven experiences. In this new paradigm, AI actively shapes personalized recommendations, higher usefulness perception and higher responsiveness, confirming user expectations. Design/methodology/approach This study adapts the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), analyzing the role of perceived responsiveness, perceived personalization and perceived information quality in e-commerce shoppers’ well-being. Data were collected from 591 respondents across Portugal and Brazil and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with multi-group comparison. Findings The findings suggest that perceived responsiveness and personalization significantly influence confirmation. Additionally, perceived usefulness relies primarily on confirmation mediating its relationship with well-being, while perceived information quality moderates the direct impact of confirmation on well-being. Notably, personalization’s impact in Portugal exceeds that of responsiveness, while it is the opposite in Brazil. Originality/value The value of this study lies first in its unique context. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to assess customers’ well-being in AI-powered e-commerce platforms. Second, the multi-group analysis provides new and unique insights into the differences between Portugal and Brazil. Third, the study challenges ECM’s elasticity with original model adjustments. Finally, it explores the significance of perceived responsiveness, personalization and quality on e-commerce customer well-being.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the persistence and transformation of Andrew Tate’s presence on YouTube following the removal of his official channels in August 2022. Combining two empirical approaches—a small-scale analysis of top-ranked videos from YouTube search results in 2022 and 2024, and a large-scale data set of over 112k videos—we examine how Tate-related content continues to circulate and how the platform moderates such material. Our findings show that Tate remains highly visible through a diffuse and decentralized network of actors who repackage his messaging into interviews, remixes, and YouTube-native formats. This configuration produces what we term the “Tate-space”: an ambient ideological environment where motivational rhetoric, aspirational masculinity, and far-right talking points converge. We find that YouTube’s substantial moderation efforts are outpaced by the speed and scale of recommendation-driven circulation and that deplatforming, while symbolically significant, fails to disrupt the cultural and logistical dynamics that sustain Tate’s influence.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the visual securitising discourse of Sweden Democrats (SD) through a qualitatively centred analysis of the party’s 2024 European Union (EU) election campaign and its official election slogan ‘My Europe Builds Walls: Against Immigration, Against Criminal Gangs, Against Islamists’. Through a comparative, cross-platform multimodal critical discourse analysis (MCDA) of SD’s posts on Facebook, X and TikTok, this article explores the differences in campaign content across platforms, and analyses how these differences provide insights into the party’s understanding of its audiences and the platforms’ respective functionalities. The analysis shows how SD leveraged platform functionalities to balance textual and visual features, repost content, and incorporate hyperlinks on Facebook and X. Using these features, the party posted text-laden, argumentative and seemingly informative posts, which are likely to appeal not only to the customary format of content on the platforms but also to its respective audiences. Yet, although SD had larger followings and much more well-established accounts on both Facebook and X, the party posted the majority of its campaign material on TikTok, primarily in the form of memes. These memes tended to include securitising clips of non-white men engaging in violent protests, vandalism and violence directed towards the local community and law enforcement. We discuss the role these memes play in the SD election campaign and the potential implications such content might have.",

This study investigates how Norwegian news media actors utilised the policy window. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 elite informants in Norway and the EU, the analysis shows how the Norwegian actors strategised to protect editorial independence and autonomy by lobbying to exempt editorial content from platform moderation. Unable to build a broad coalition and facing substantial resistance from an alliance of platforms, fact-checkers, and civil society groups, the attempt failed. The study contributes with insight into how news actors from a small, non-EU member state lobbied to gain influence in a policy process at the EU level. It also illustrates how the blurring boundaries of journalism and the multifaceted European media landscape make supranational news media lobbying particularly demanding for small, outsider actors.",

Using in‐depth interviews and flexible coding, we analyzed how daughters ( n = 42) attribute locus, responsibility, specificity, and stability. Daughters often located control internally within their mothers, citing enduring traits as sources of conflict while noting external influences such as trauma or substance abuse. Responsibility was frequently self‐assumed despite blaming mothers, positioning attribution as a means of asserting agency. Many saw their relationships as uniquely difficult and consistent, reinforcing perceptions of stability and specificity. Our study extends attribution theory to long‐term family bonds, portraying adult daughters as active agents in meaning‐making across the life course.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive jealousy, which involves thoughts and suspicions of a partner's infidelity, is linked to various negative outcomes. Yet, little is known about how it fluctuates over time or across different relationships. This longitudinal study examined 891 young, unmarried adults in romantic relationships over 5 years (11 assessment points), capturing 1507 total relationships. About 42% of participants reported being in more than one relationship during the study period. The study examined how cognitive jealousy varies within individuals, across different relationships, in relation to individual traits such as neuroticism, attachment anxiety, and gender, and in relation to experiences of extradyadic sexual involvement (either self‐ or partner‐reported). Results showed that while 28.2% of the variance in cognitive jealousy was due to differences between individuals, the largest proportion (39.8%) was due to differences between relationships. Within a particular relationship, initial levels of cognitive jealousy remained relatively stable over time. Higher levels of neuroticism, attachment anxiety, and experiences of extradyadic sexual involvement (both self‐ and partner‐reported) were associated with greater cognitive jealousy. Men reported higher initial levels of cognitive jealousy than women. These findings suggest that relationship‐specific dynamics as well as individual differences play a crucial role in the experience of cognitive jealousy.",
