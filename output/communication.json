          "authors": "Cong Lin, Chenxu Liu",
          "abstract": "Creativity is widely understood as a distinct human characteristic, yet the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping creative ecosystems, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Despite these advancements, comprehensive insights into how social groups, especially stakeholders, perceive and experience AI-generated art remain inadequate. Through semi-structured interviews with 23 artistic practitioners in China across visual art domains such as painting, design, and filmmaking, this study identifies themes related to practitioners’ perceptions of the creative process (mechanism and time), created works (aesthetic and quality), and creating actors (role and ownership) from a human-AI comparative view. Contextualized perceptions shaped by variations across art domains are also revealed. As human-AI collaboration in artistic creation gains prominence, this study also illustrates how artistic practitioners negotiate their agency with machine agency through dual routes: the affective route and the action route. The findings contribute to the ongoing discourse of artificial creativity, enrich the socio-technical understandings of AI-generated visual art and shed light on the agency dynamics between human and AI within the context of artistic creation.",

          "authors": "Eliot Bates",
          "abstract": "Earth Modular Society (EMS) is a cross-platform community dedicated to live hardware modular synthesis, with their primary efforts going into a 24/7 modular “radio station” that livestreams on Twitch and YouTube, and a supporting Discord chat server. Although part of the broader modular synthesis gear culture (a large-scale social formation that coalesces around specific classes of fetishized technical objects), EMS represents a new development in gear cultures as it foregrounds live performance and minimizes the accrual of status via conspicuous consumption. The normative governance structures of platform-specific gear culture communities preclude all but one or a handful of users from having any meaningful input into the rules, governance, or participatory modes of the platform. In contrast, EMS is structured as a doitocracy , where all are encouraged to bring things to do to the community, and to support each other in doing. The doitocracy concept contributes to understanding the wide range of DIY (do-it-yourself) and DIT (do-it-together) community practices. This doitocracy case study also demonstrates the importance of analyzing the performance of crafted objects, and how these, alongside platform-jumping practices, can constitute primary organizational forces in online/offline community sociality.",

          "abstract": "Grounded in the theory of intersectionality, this study proposes an approach to unpack the nuances of aging in the era of misinformation. Instead of focusing solely on individual aging factors and the digitally relevant divide, this approach enables an in-depth analysis of how older adults’ experiences with misinformation can be constrained by structural factors and the broader digital landscape, alongside information policies in local contexts as the broader background. Meanwhile, this approach allows for a contextualized comprehension of the agency of older adults, illuminating their prioritization of news values which might not always lie in the authenticity. Guided by this approach, our study gives voice to the low-income older female adults in China, revealing their ongoing engagement with misinformation during the COVID-19 infodemic where exacerbated digitalized information inequalities were likely to be accompanied by their evolving definition of misinformation and information sharing behaviors.",

          "authors": "Pedro Gallo, Catalina Iordache",
          "abstract": "This research investigates the intricate process of localising subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services on a transnational scale, with a specific focus on the translation of Spanish ‘original’ and ‘exclusive’ works of Netflix and Prime Video. As SVOD companies expand their services internationally, the necessity of adapting to diverse national markets becomes paramount. Language emerges as a pivotal factor in this process: audiovisual works must provide adequate subtitling and dubbing options to address the diverse linguistic nuances of international audiences. The research aims to analyse the language localisation strategies for Spanish works in transnational SVOD services, by examining the dubbing and subtitling options offered. The article provides a mapping of the strategies and partners adopted by these companies focussing on a sample of local works. Additionally, by collecting data from the two SVOD services and through interviews with dubbing studios, the research analyses mergers, acquisitions and power relations between dubbing companies, as well as the impact on competition generated by transnational streaming services. Both Netflix and Amazon have increasingly added more language options for content offerings as part of their internationalisation, which has favoured the proliferation of a specific type of company and business model in the dubbing sector. This consists of transnational corporations that have provided localisation services in the wake of the internationalisation of streamers, and that have managed to keep up with the demands through mergers and acquisitions with studios in foreign countries.",

          "authors": "Juan Martín Prada",
          "abstract": "This article examines the relationships between contemporary art and crypto culture, analysing a series of artistic practices that question the technocultural values and dynamics that have emerged with blockchain technology. These practices form a specific path in the development of contemporary art which, through neo-conceptual strategies, is oriented towards the critical thematisation of crypto culture in its multiple dimensions (creative, economic, social). In these works, blockchain, far from being considered merely a cryptographic recording system or a means for commercialising digital goods, becomes a space in which to poetically explore the multiple contradictions and paradoxes of the digital economy. The text places special emphasis on the main thematic nuclei of these artistic practices: The NFT business model based on the creation of verifiable ‘digital scarcity’, the problematisation of the concept of authenticity in the field of digital objects, the emancipatory potential (and its limits) of the decentralised nature of blockchains, and the ecological impact of crypto economies.",

This cross-sectional online survey of 1,764 participants aged 16–28 (75.7 percent women) identified four addiction subtypes using specific scales. Network analysis revealed significant comorbidity (95.35 percent) among subtypes, with smartphone addiction playing a dominant role, leading to social media, Internet, and potentially game addiction. High comorbidity suggests a shared vulnerability, with smartphone use as a catalyst. Smartphone addiction is a key precursor to other digital addictions.",

          "abstract": "Extending previous research on creative AI to the context of AI advertising, the present study examined whether creativity in AI advertising could evoke perceptions of uncanniness and consequently have a negative impact on ad outcomes. Based on a two (ad creativity: low vs. high) by two (creator label: human vs. AI) between-subjects experimental design, the present study showed that ad creativity in general had a positive direct impact on attitude toward the ad (A ad ), attitude toward the brand (A b ), and purchase intentions. In addition, there were significant mediation effects of perceived creativity on A ad and A b via perceived uncanniness, which was moderated by creator label. For the AI-creator-labeled condition, perceived creativity had negative indirect effects on A ad and A b via perceived uncanniness, such that greater perceived creativity led to greater perceived uncanniness, which in turn induced less favorable A ad and A b . However, the mediation effect was not found for the human-creator-labeled condition. Thus, the positive effect of ad creativity was smaller for the AI-creator-labeled ad.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how participatory publics persist in depopulated rural areas during periods of low visibility and mobilization. Drawing on pragmatism and mediatization theory, we analyse communicative figurations in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) using survey data ( N = 529) and develop a Participatory Public Connection Index. Regression models reveal that public connection is driven more by communicative and territorial factors – such as local radio use, civic motivations and municipality size – than by sociodemographics. Our findings suggest that local media help sustain symbolic bonds and latent publics, contributing to democratic engagement and territorial cohesion despite the absence of visible collective action. We conceptualize latency as the communicative and symbolic potential through which publics persist beyond visible mobilization; operationally, the Participatory Public Connection Index captures this latent connection sustained by everyday local media practices.",

          "authors": "Lin Jia, Xin Liu, Tong Dora Chen, Yichuan Wang, Kenichi Takahashi, Yuan Wang",
          "abstract": "Purpose Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly embedded in service operations, particularly in crafting managerial responses (MRs) to online negative and positive reviews. Yet, little is known about how firms should optimally allocate responsibilities between human staff and GAI across distinct response tasks, nor how such allocations shape consumer perceptions and downstream behavioral intentions. This study investigates how customers evaluate MRs produced by different agents including humans, GAI and multiple forms of human and GAI collaboration across specific response tasks. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a randomized online experiment. Main effects were examined using ANOVA with data from 879 participants, and the underlying mechanisms were further analyzed using the PROCESS macro with a parallel mediation model. Findings Our findings show that to improve customer satisfaction and increase booking intentions, negative reviews are most effectively addressed through an augmented human approach in which GAI creates an initial draft and experienced professional staff refine it. In contrast, positive reviews are best handled solely by experienced professional staff. Originality/value This study advances knowledge on how to combine GAI with human efforts in service operations, identifies key psychological mechanisms that mediate the effects of different collaboration modes on consumer perceptions and behavioral intentions and offers actionable guidance for service operations managers. The results suggest that GAI should be deployed strategically to augment, rather than replace, human intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Cognitive absorption is critical for hedonic technology addiction, yet the mediating mechanisms by which cognitive absorption affects hedonic technology addiction remain unclear. Drawing on dual-system theory, which posits that reflexive and reflective systems are pivotal in shaping user decisions and behaviors, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of the drivers of hedonic technology addiction. We conceptualize impulsive urge as the reflexive system and self-regulation as the reflective system, aiming to uncover the mediating roles of these two distinct systems in linking cognitive absorption to hedonic technology addiction. Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal survey involving 410 online gamers was conducted, with data collected at two time points separated by a 6-week interval. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to validate the proposed research model. Findings The results indicate that cognitive absorption elicits responses from both reflexive and reflective systems. Specifically, cognitive absorption enhances the reflexive system via impulsive urge, while inhibiting the reflective system through impaired self-regulation. The joint full mediation of impulsive urge and self-regulation in the relationship between cognitive absorption and hedonic technology addiction has been proved. Our results shed lights on the underlying reflexive and reflective systems by which cognitive absorption affects hedonic technology addiction. Originality/value This study leverages dual-system theory to elucidate the mediating mechanisms through which cognitive absorption influences hedonic technology addiction. By demonstrating how cognitive absorption triggers addictive behaviors through heightened impulsive urges and impaired self-regulation, this study advances the literature on hedonic technology addiction and offers actionable strategies for intervention.

          "authors": "Samuel N. Kirshner, Jessica Lawson",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores how competitive pressure and organizational goals influence responsible AI (RAI) decisions when introducing AI-based digital services. We examine how two types of unethical competition, horizontal (numerous competitors using similar unethical AI tactics) and vertical (a competitor using highly unethical AI), interact with regulatory-focus-driven objectives to shape RAI deployment. Design/methodology/approach We design three experimental studies featuring scenarios involving the launch of an unethical AI service to assess how competitive pressures and organizational goals affect RAI decisions. Each experiment manipulates horizontal and vertical unethical competition. Participants’ regulatory focus is measured in Study 1 (N = 249) and is manipulated through organizational goals in Study 2 (N = 304) to assess their interactions with competitive pressure. Study 3 (N = 159) tests moral disengagement theory as the underlying mechanisms. Findings The results show that horizontal unethical competition increases the launch of unethical AI, regardless of regulatory focus. We uncover a novel interaction effect between vertical unethical competition and firm objectives. While the severity of a competitor’s unethical behavior reduces RAI deployment directly, prevention-focused goals can counteract this effect under vertical unethical competition, promoting more responsible decisions. Originality/value This research advances RAI scholarship by introducing two unethical competitive contexts to analyze how competitive pressure and organizational goals shape decisions to launch unethical AI services. By isolating horizontal and vertical competition, we provide new insights into how external competition drives UPB. The findings provide a behavioral framework for understanding ethical trade-offs in AI deployment, linking high-level ethics to practical governance in competitive settings.",

          "authors": "Weiwei Liu, Lingyan Hu",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines the impact of gamified work on knowledge hiding among gig workers from the perspective of regulatory focus theory. Design/methodology/approach To validate the proposed theoretical model, we conducted three studies. Study 1 was an experiment with a 2 (gamified work: absence vs presence) between-subjects design. Studies 2 and 3 were surveys. Findings The main results revealed several key findings. First, gamified work increased self-efficacy. Second, gamified work inhibited knowledge hiding through self-efficacy. Third, gamified work increased affective rumination. Fourth, gamified work facilitated knowledge hiding through affective rumination. Finally, task-technology fit served as a moderating factor in these relationships. Practical implications Organizations are encouraged to design dynamic and personalized gamified work systems. Additionally, psychological development initiatives should be implemented to enhance workers' self-efficacy. A psychological support mechanism could also be established to alleviate affective rumination. Furthermore, ensuring an optimal task-technology fit remains crucial. These strategies are expected to effectively mitigate knowledge hiding behaviors. Originality/value Most studies on knowledge hiding have focused on formal employees within traditional firm settings, often overlooking those working outside the conventional economic framework, such as gig workers. This study focuses on gig workers, uncovering the mechanisms through which gamified work influences knowledge hiding and offering practical insights for knowledge management in platform-based enterprises.",

          "authors": "Xiao-Liang Shen, You Wu, Yongqiang Sun",
          "abstract": "Purpose Social media rumors have increasingly become a prevalent and serious issue. Despite substantial efforts by governments and authoritative institutions, the effectiveness of combating rumors has not always been satisfactory due to the insufficient engagement of social media users. This study underscores the critical role of user participation in combating rumors and explores this issue from the perspective of ethical decision-making. Design/methodology/approach Employing a multi-method approach, Study 1 surveyed 508 respondents in the USA to investigate the ethical decision-making process in rumor combating participation (RCP). Study 2 replicated the main findings in the Chinese context through an experiment, while further exploring how social norms moderate the ethical decision-making process. Findings Study 1 not only reveals key ethical factors influencing RCP but also identifies two fully mediated chain effects. Study 2 first validates the findings reported in Study 1, and then highlights that injunctive norms exert a stronger influence on the decision-making process when normative appeals are framed using prescriptive rules. Conversely, when framed using proscriptive rules, the opposite effect is observed. Practical implications The findings suggest that social media platforms and policymakers can leverage normative appeals and tailored framing strategies to enhance user participation, thereby mitigating the negative impact of social media rumors. Originality/value This study represents one of the initial attempts to investigate RCP on social media from an ethical decision-making perspective. The integrated model provides empirical validation in both the USA and China, and the findings help resolve the contradictory results observed in prior research regarding the effects of social norms.",

          "authors": "Gonçalo Sá, Carlos Tam, Manuela Aparicio",
          "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to understand the determinants of e-commerce shoppers’ well-being. Well-being refers to how positively online consumers experience and are affected by their interactions with digital shopping platforms. Studying how customers perceive their well-being when interacting with artificial intelligence (AI)-powered e-commerce websites is crucial, as it highlights a paradigm shift from traditional online shopping, focused mainly on convenience and speed, toward AI-driven experiences. In this new paradigm, AI actively shapes personalized recommendations, higher usefulness perception and higher responsiveness, confirming user expectations. Design/methodology/approach This study adapts the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), analyzing the role of perceived responsiveness, perceived personalization and perceived information quality in e-commerce shoppers’ well-being. Data were collected from 591 respondents across Portugal and Brazil and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with multi-group comparison. Findings The findings suggest that perceived responsiveness and personalization significantly influence confirmation. Additionally, perceived usefulness relies primarily on confirmation mediating its relationship with well-being, while perceived information quality moderates the direct impact of confirmation on well-being. Notably, personalization’s impact in Portugal exceeds that of responsiveness, while it is the opposite in Brazil. Originality/value The value of this study lies first in its unique context. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to assess customers’ well-being in AI-powered e-commerce platforms. Second, the multi-group analysis provides new and unique insights into the differences between Portugal and Brazil. Third, the study challenges ECM’s elasticity with original model adjustments. Finally, it explores the significance of perceived responsiveness, personalization and quality on e-commerce customer well-being.",

          "authors": "Honghong Huo, Qingfei Min, Dezhi Wu, Zilong Liu",
          "abstract": "Purpose Driven by advances in social technologies, various social cues–including friend approval, peer favorability and marketer endorsement–have been integrated into social media advertising (SMA) to counter the growing trend of user avoidance. However, the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions through which these cues reduce SMA avoidance remain unclear. Drawing on construal level theory, this study investigates how social cues of varying relational distances mitigate SMA avoidance depending on product preference. Design/methodology/approach Two between-subjects factorial experiments (N = 243 and 244) were designed and conducted on a self-developed platform to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results reveal that social cues reduce user avoidance through two distinct mediating mechanisms: enhancing perceived attractiveness and mitigating perceived intrusiveness. Moreover, these indirect effects are moderated by product preference: remote cues (e.g. marketer endorsement) are more effective for low-preference products, whereas proximal cues (e.g. friend approval) are more effective for high-preference products. Practical implications The findings offer actionable implications for marketers and platforms, highlighting strategies for optimizing social cues to balance attractiveness and intrusiveness across different product preferences, thereby supporting more user-friendly SMA experiences. Originality/value This study identifies two mechanisms–attractiveness and intrusiveness–underlying SMA avoidance, systematically compares different types of social cues through the lens of social distance, and demonstrates how the match between social cues and product preference operates from a construal level theory perspective. Thus, it advances understanding of SMA avoidance and social cue effects while extending construal level theory to the context of SMA.",

          "authors": "Shwadhin Sharma, Anita Khadka",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how students perceive mobile, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT as regulating cognitive load and emotional demands during learning. The research examines how AI-mediated mobile communication affects intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load, and how these perceptions influence mental effort, cognitive engagement, learning anxiety, and perceived academic performance. The study is situated in Nepal, where mobile learning and smartphone-based educational practices often substitute for limited institutional support. Guided by Cognitive Load Theory, a structural equation model was developed to examine relationships between perceived AI-mediated load types and student outcomes. The model was tested using survey data from 314 higher education students who had experience using ChatGPT through mobile devices. Results show that students who perceived ChatGPT as reducing extraneous load and enhancing germane load reported lower anxiety and higher cognitive engagement. These perceptions were also associated with higher perceived academic performance and more efficient mental effort. Intrinsic load remained a significant constraint but was mitigated when ChatGPT was used as a mobile scaffold in complex learning tasks. This is one of the first theory-driven studies to empirically test how students perceive generative AI's influence on multiple dimensions of cognitive load in mobile learning environments. The research contributes theoretical and empirical insights to information systems and educational technology by reframing mobile AI not merely as a usability tool but as a mechanism for cognitive load management and emotional regulation in under-resourced educational systems. The findings offer practical guidance for educators and instructional designers seeking to integrate generative AI into mobile learning strategies. ChatGPT can serve as a portable cognitive and emotional support system that clarifies complex concepts, reduces learning anxiety, and enhances engagement. Incorporating guided mobile AI use into coursework can improve learning efficiency and emotional well-being without increasing instructional workload, particularly in resource-constrained higher education settings.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the persistence and transformation of Andrew Tate’s presence on YouTube following the removal of his official channels in August 2022. Combining two empirical approaches—a small-scale analysis of top-ranked videos from YouTube search results in 2022 and 2024, and a large-scale data set of over 112k videos—we examine how Tate-related content continues to circulate and how the platform moderates such material. Our findings show that Tate remains highly visible through a diffuse and decentralized network of actors who repackage his messaging into interviews, remixes, and YouTube-native formats. This configuration produces what we term the “Tate-space”: an ambient ideological environment where motivational rhetoric, aspirational masculinity, and far-right talking points converge. We find that YouTube’s substantial moderation efforts are outpaced by the speed and scale of recommendation-driven circulation and that deplatforming, while symbolically significant, fails to disrupt the cultural and logistical dynamics that sustain Tate’s influence.",

Through a comparative, cross-platform multimodal critical discourse analysis (MCDA) of SD’s posts on Facebook, X and TikTok, this article explores the differences in campaign content across platforms, and analyses how these differences provide insights into the party’s understanding of its audiences and the platforms’ respective functionalities. The analysis shows how SD leveraged platform functionalities to balance textual and visual features, repost content, and incorporate hyperlinks on Facebook and X. Using these features, the party posted text-laden, argumentative and seemingly informative posts, which are likely to appeal not only to the customary format of content on the platforms but also to its respective audiences. Yet, although SD had larger followings and much more well-established accounts on both Facebook and X, the party posted the majority of its campaign material on TikTok, primarily in the form of memes. These memes tended to include securitising clips of non-white men engaging in violent protests, vandalism and violence directed towards the local community and law enforcement. We discuss the role these memes play in the SD election campaign and the potential implications such content might have.",

          "abstract": "The formation of the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union (EU), aiming to regulate platform power, provided a unique policy window to secure media-specific interests vis-à-vis platforms. This study investigates how Norwegian news media actors utilised the policy window. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 elite informants in Norway and the EU, the analysis shows how the Norwegian actors strategised to protect editorial independence and autonomy by lobbying to exempt editorial content from platform moderation. Unable to build a broad coalition and facing substantial resistance from an alliance of platforms, fact-checkers, and civil society groups, the attempt failed. The study contributes with insight into how news actors from a small, non-EU member state lobbied to gain influence in a policy process at the EU level. It also illustrates how the blurring boundaries of journalism and the multifaceted European media landscape make supranational news media lobbying particularly demanding for small, outsider actors.",

          "abstract": "This study employs attribution theory to examine how adult daughters from low‐income backgrounds perceive and manage low‐quality daughter‐mother relationships. Using in‐depth interviews and flexible coding, we analyzed how daughters ( n = 42) attribute locus, responsibility, specificity, and stability. Daughters often located control internally within their mothers, citing enduring traits as sources of conflict while noting external influences such as trauma or substance abuse. Responsibility was frequently self‐assumed despite blaming mothers, positioning attribution as a means of asserting agency. Many saw their relationships as uniquely difficult and consistent, reinforcing perceptions of stability and specificity. Our study extends attribution theory to long‐term family bonds, portraying adult daughters as active agents in meaning‐making across the life course.",
