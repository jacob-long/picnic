          "authors": "Simon Hewitt",
          "abstract": "This article explores an important moment in late 1990s US film and videogame industrial convergence. It does so through a Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) of the contemporaneous industrial paratexts surrounding three film-to-subscription-based online videogame adaptations, Aliens Online (1998), Godzilla Online (1998), and Independence Day Online (2000). It asks why these adaptations failed critically and commercially despite the critical praise and evident consumer demand at the time for videogame adaptations of major films like GoldenEye 007 (1997), and subscription-based online games like Ultima Online (1997). Moreover, it asks what these failures tell us about US videogame and cinematic convergence in the late 1990s. In seeking answers to these questions, this article intervenes into Thomas Leitch’s discussions of ‘adaptation strategies’, as well as Jason Mittell’s ideas around ‘unbalanced’ transmedia. It uses these interventions to demonstrate why it is vital to consider the industrial contexts necessitating each adaptation. The RTA reveals that these include the impact of new videogame distribution models, the threat posed by competitors, and the massive profit potential of subscription-based online gaming. This article ultimately demonstrates that in productions of transmedia products like these games, multiple stakeholders can operate in hierarchical corporate structures with differing levels of power to impact their production, which I refer to as their ‘authorial agency’. It is therefore vital also to consider the ‘primary’ strategy driving each adaptation. This article’s central argument is that to fully understand the failure of these adaptations, we should recognise how ‘promotion’ was the primary adaptation strategy that most impacted each game’s production and therefore undermined their quality. This has substantial implications for how we think about our contemporary media ecology in which the US videogame industry is now more profitable and potentially exerts greater authorial agency than its conglomerate partner, US cinema.",

          "title": "Premiers to pixels: The discourse of cinema envy in 1990s videogame magazines",
          "authors": "Andrea Andiloro",
          "abstract": "This article explores the concept of cinema envy within the context of 1990s videogame magazines, identifying it as an understanding within gaming culture that videogames are not ‘serious’, ‘worthy’, or ‘artistic’ as film. The research aims to understand how cinema envy, as a discourse, has been discussed and used to justify the existence and value of videogames relative to film. Through an analysis of key videogame magazines published between 1990 and 1999, the study identifies three periods in the discourse, defined respectively by an initial enthusiasm for convergence with film (1990–1992), a reactionary phase prioritizing medium specificity and interactivity (1992–1996), and a more balanced perspective combining convergence with a critical reflection on interactivity (1996–1999). The findings indicate that attitudes towards the convergence of film and videogames fluctuated, reflecting broader technological and cultural shifts. The study concludes that cinema envy is not a monolithic formation, but an evolving discourse shaped by the interplay of technological advancements, media convergence, and the desire for cultural legitimacy in the videogame industry. This work highlights the role of videogame magazines in shaping gaming culture and establishing norms and standards for what constitutes a ‘good game’, considering cinematic influences and interactivity.",

          "authors": "Ed Vollans",
          "abstract": "This paper uses ProQuest’s Entertainment Industry Magazine Archive (EIMA) to explore the use of the term ‘cinematic’ in games promotion in the decade 1990–1999. It offers a clear platform for linguistically aligned archival studies and charts the use of terminology as it emerged and changed within the period of study. Adding nuance to claims that the 1990s saw promotional convergence between games and film, this paper uses a language-oriented archival methodology to highlight how the notions of industrial convergence may be seen as incremental developments rather than sudden shifts in promotional discourse. In exploring how game promotion used terms associated with and emerging from the cinema, the paper maps the ways in which games promotion solicited and distinguished itself from a competing industry, drawing attention to the complexities of mediatised convergence and public versus industrial discourse. In highlighting and extrapolating key moments within the corpus, this paper identifies several areas of future study and serves as a call for further study into games promotion.",

          "authors": "Yingwen Wang, Hui Lin",
          "abstract": "Older content creators gain popularity on Douyin and become a significant part of the platform economy. However, much existing research concentrates on young, beauty content creators with limited attention paid to older content creators. Drawing on the theoretical framework of digital labour and ageing studies, this article examines the reasons why and how older adults become influencers on Douyin, how these creators gain a follower base on such a youth-led platform as a marginalized group, and how they navigate precarity and challenges to achieve visibility on Douyin. Based on in-depth interviews and participant observation with older Chinese Wanghong creators, we identify four key motivations driving their participation in short-video production: personal fulfilment and expression, social engagement and community contribution, economic empowerment, and strategic account development. We argue that these late-life influencers strategically negotiate platform labour for both self-realization and social value, challenging stereotypes of older adults as digitally disengaged. The findings reveal that digital platforms enable ‘active ageing’ through cultural production while simultaneously introducing new forms of precarity and algorithmic work. By foregrounding older Wanghong’s experiences in China’s platform economy, the paper extends theories of digital labour to a new demographic, showing how cultural values and generational context inflect the influencer phenomenon. This study contributes to ongoing debates surrounding the digital economy, self-representation, and ageing by illuminating specific mechanisms through which older Wanghong creators strategically blend entrepreneurial aspirations with communal goals in their online engagements. We conclude with implications for platform inclusivity and a call to recognize the diverse actors shaping influencer culture in the global digital era.",

          "authors": "Jakub Majewski, Scott Knight",
          "abstract": "The widespread appearance of Full Motion Video (FMV) games of the 1990s represents a significant development in the history of videogames. This study explores the FMV games of the 1990s, aiming to identify and examine common narratological traits borrowed from film production found across the variety of FMV game types of the 1990s. The overall aim of this exploration is to address the question of how the narrative form of the FMV game was influenced by film form and technique, and whether this influence was more prominent than in other games in this critical period in videogame history. However, how does one measure the impact of a particular technology, when it is impossible to compare against the counterfactual situation where the technology in question is absent? To stress the importance of a technology like FMV in games is always, to some extent, an exercise in alternative history, as one must effectively imagine the outcomes for an entire industry had the technology been absent. This is largely impossible, but there are several ways that such impact can be approximated. In the present paper, three such ways will be used. The first, is to illustrate the context in which FMV technology was applied within pre-existing game series, to see how FMV changed the form and style of the given series. Secondly, by examining the key traits of FMV games in their 1990s heyday, the divergence between FMV games and non-FMV games can be observed. Finally, the lasting impact of FMV can be observed by examining what FMV game features stayed behind after this game genre effectively (though never completely) disappeared at the end of the 1990s.",

          "abstract": "This article conducts a genealogical analysis of Brilliant Digital Entertainment’s multipath movies as a minor history of videogames. Brilliant Digital Entertainment was a company that, from its formation in 1996 until the dot-com bust of 2001, released what they dubbed ‘multipath movies’. These were 3D animated interactive movies based on popular IP like Superman, Xena: Warrior Princess and more that allowed players to make decisions at key moments. These multipath movies emerged at a time of increasing synergy between Hollywood cinema and videogames in the 1990s. Through an analysis of Brilliant Digital Entertainment’s brief venture, this article examines the wider cultural, technological and economic forces that shaped the company’s trajectory. This article argues that Brilliant Digital Entertainment, through its adoption and integration of rhetoric and operating models from the dot-com bubble at the time, treated the media convergence exemplified by interactive movies as a ‘new economic space’ defined by its ‘novel’ combination of media forms, imagined audience and association with the internet.",

          "authors": "Can Zhu",
          "abstract": "This research project examines the contribution of artificial intelligence (AI) to international communication, specifically focusing on cross-cultural interaction through automated translation and content curation. Global forms of interaction are increasing and, consequently, AI systems are becoming more prevalent in facilitating interlocution; however, issues surrounding accuracy, cultural relevancy, inclusion, representation, and bias, remain. To investigate the above concerns, surveys were distributed to 300 participants in South China, and data was analyzed using SPSS to demonstrate reliability and validity. The results suggested that participants perceived translation quality to be average, and their trust in communication mediated by AI was mid-level. Users’ trust was further analyzed and evaluated using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) based on their perceptions of translation accuracy, fluency, and cultural fit; however, user satisfaction and inclusivity were also affirmatively related to their trust. In addition, open-ended responses were thematically coded to demonstrate higher-order issues related to cultural bias, representation, and fairness in conversational exchanges mediated by AI, thus concerning value economies. As AI systems continue to mediate various forms of cross-cultural exchanges, these findings offer insight into both the potential and limitations of AI, while also providing direction for future work and development that adheres to inclusivity, fairness, and cultural responsiveness in AI-mediated global communication.",

          "authors": "Heidi Keinonen",
          "abstract": "Since the early 2010s, the emergence of global streaming platforms has introduced new strategies and practices in the production of drama series. The new paradigm, here titled as streaming production culture, has penetrated even the so-called legacy television companies, such as Nordic public service broadcasters. This article seeks to establish streaming production culture as an analytical concept that brings together two recent transformations in the television industry: platformisation and transnationalisation. The conceptualisation is legitimated by examining the adoption and impact of streaming production culture at Yle, the Finnish public service broadcaster. An analysis of thematic interviews with producers and managers, complemented by additional data sources provides detailed examples of how streaming has transformed the publishing, budgeting and financing, co-producing, development, and marketing of Yle’s drama series. In this process, Yle’s producers have shifted from being creators of in-house drama to facilitators of content produced by independent production companies.",

          "authors": "Danny Yihan Jia, Yunwen Wang",
          "abstract": "Unhealthy social media habits may foster procrastination, leading to negative psychological and behavioral outcomes. The rising prevalence of procrastinatory short-form video (SFV) use (e.g., on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) highlights the need to better understand how established predictors of problematic media use operate in this emerging media environment. To address this gap, this study investigated the motivational factors underlying procrastinatory SFV use and its relationship with user well-being. Using an online survey of college students ( N = 549) from two U.S. universities, structural equation modeling revealed that individuals with lower self-control, stronger habitual SFV use, and greater involvement (enjoyment, escapism, and social connectedness) were more prone to procrastinatory SFV use, which in turn was associated with higher stress levels, poorer overall sleep quality, longer sleep latency, more sleep disturbances, and greater daytime dysfunction, but not with academic performance. This study contributes to the understanding of motivational factors underlying procrastinatory SFV use and its associations with user well-being. Theoretical contributions to the study of irrational media use, practical recommendations for mitigating procrastinatory SFV engagement, and directions for longitudinal and context-sensitive future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how European media portrayed Syrian refugees in 2015 and Ukrainian refugees in 2022, across seven national contexts. Drawing on the GDELT database of news articles and its automated sentiment analysis, the study compares the tone and salience of coverage surrounding two highly symbolic mediatic events: the death of Syrian child Alan Kurdi in 2015 and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2022. Results reveal stark disparities: Ukrainian refugees were consistently represented more positively than Syrian refugees and non-Syrian/non-Ukrainian refugees. These findings provide quantitative evidence of how cultural, racial, and geopolitical proximity shape refugee representations in European media, thereby confirming previous literature. While some prior scholarship has demonstrated these dynamics, this article contributes to existent literature by offering a large-scale, cross-national, and event-based comparative analysis.",

Based on analysis of paratextual materials, this article examines the ways that Bethesda used history to stake a claim for their vision for Fallout, utilising the studio's considerable marketing power to (re)write the history of Fallout over the last two decades . It charts how Bethesda's company history, the history of the Fallout brand, and American mid-century imaginaries were interwoven into a promotional discourse underscoring Bethesda's position as gatekeeper: a trusted pair of hands to both curate the history of Fallout and guide the development of the franchise in the present and future.",

          "authors": "Chao Zhang, Jinlian Luo, Wenshun Li, Xianglu Wang",
          "abstract": "Purpose Drawing on the conservation of resources (COR) theory and the cognitive–affective personality system (CAPS) theory, the present study examines the impact of work-related use of information and communication technologies after hours (W_ICTs) on knowledge hiding. In addition, the mediating roles of role overload and moral disengagement are investigated, together with the moderating effect of organizational segmentation supplies (OSS). Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 336 employees through a three-wave survey, were analyzed using structural equation modeling and additional statistical techniques to test the hypotheses. Findings It was found that W_ICTs significantly increase employees' engagement in knowledge hiding. Within this relationship, role overload and moral disengagement function as mediators, both independently and sequentially in a chain mediation pathway. Moreover, OSS was found to mitigate the impact of W_ICTs on role overload, thereby moderating the overall chain mediation pathway. Research limitations/implications This research challenges the prevailing assumption that ICTs necessarily facilitate knowledge sharing, and it systematically examines both working and non-working context to investigate the influence of W_ICTs on employees’ knowledge-hiding behavior. Practical implications Based on the conclusions of this study, mitigating the negative effects of W_ICTs requires first limiting their occurrence. In addition, efforts should be directed toward reducing employees’ role overload and lowering their levels of moral disengagement. Finally, the provision of OSS for employees should not be overlooked. Social implications The phenomenon of W_ICTs has become increasingly widespread. This study examines its impact on knowledge hiding and contributes to a deeper understanding of changes in work patterns driven by information technology, thereby informing organizational adaptation. Originality/value This study integrates COR and CAPS to reveal a novel sequential pathway in which W_ICTs trigger role overload (affective) that fosters moral disengagement (cognitive), leading to knowledge hiding. By clarifying this affective–cognitive mechanism, it challenges the conventional view that ICTs necessarily promote knowledge sharing and enriches the theoretical understanding of knowledge hiding.",

          "authors": "So-Hyun Lee, Sumeet Gupta, Hee-Woong Kim",
          "abstract": "Purpose While existing studies have explored post-adoption behaviors such as IS continuance, relatively little is known about how IS routinization transitions into IS infusion and how their respective antecedents differ. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a model that explains how IS infusion is achieved through routinization, thereby uncovering the mechanisms through which organizations can fully leverage their IS investments. Design/methodology/approach Based on the six-stage IT implementation model, this study focuses on the routinization and infusion stages. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is applied to identify routinization antecedents, while psychological empowerment theory informs infusion-related factors. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted using CRM system usage data from employees at a telecommunications company. Findings The results show that IS routinization is necessary but insufficient for infusion. Routinization is mainly driven by UTAUT factors such as performance expectancy and social influence. In contrast, infusion is more strongly influenced by psychological empowerment conceptualized by competence, impact, meaning and self-determination. Routinization positively influences infusion, highlighting a sequential relationship. Originality/value This study extends the IS implementation literature by clarifying the transition from routinization to infusion and identifying distinct antecedents for each stage. It provides actionable insights for organizations seeking to go beyond operational use and achieve strategic gains through IS infusion.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study tries to unravel the autonomy paradox by shedding light on the joint effects of ICT-induced invasion and ICT-induced autonomy through a moderated mediation analysis. Design/methodology/approach The research model is empirically tested by a survey of 230 employees who use mobile ICTs after working hours for work purposes. Partial Least Squares (PLS) and PROCESS tools were used to validate the proposed hypotheses. Findings This research showed that ICT-induced overload mediated the relationship between ICT-induced invasion and strain. Besides, ICT-induced autonomy was found to strengthen the relationship between ICT-induced invasion and ICT-induced overload, as well as the mediating effect of ICT-induced overload. On the other hand, ICT-induced autonomy was found to have a positive effect on ICT-induced overload when ICT-induced invasion was high, while it had a negative effect when ICT-induced invasion was low. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional design of this study hinders the detection of causal relationships and the snowball sampling may raise concerns regarding generalizability. Practical implications Organizations should pay attention to the trade-off between ICT-induced invasion and autonomy to prevent employees from feeling strained. Originality/value Unlike prior studies, which address a demand-centric perspective, this study draws the demand-ability (D-A) imbalance perspective by explicitly considering the ability construct related to ICT-induced autonomy and the D-A imbalance construct captured by ICT-induced overload. Based on the person-environment (P-E) fit theory of stress, this study proposes a moderated mediation model that postulates the mediating effect of ICT-induced overload and the moderating effect of ICT-induced autonomy.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Brands are exploring innovative strategies to engage their target audience online by leveraging human and AI-generated metahuman influencers. This study examines the impact of endorsements from human and AI-generated metahuman influencers on online brand engagement, comparing each to a brand-only condition. Additionally, it assesses whether this impact is direct, indirect or moderated by influencer–brand fit. Design/methodology/approach We deploy two experiments with two real brands. In the first experiment (n = 199), the comparison was between a human influencer endorsement condition and a brand-only condition. In the second experiment (n = 297), we introduced an additional metahuman influencer endorsement condition, enabling us to examine responses to both human and metahuman influencer endorsements relative to the brand-only baseline. Findings The findings reveal that brand endorsements by human influencers significantly enhance online brand engagement compared to the brand-only condition, primarily through attachment transfer. While metahuman influencers can also drive engagement, the moderation effect – where the fit between the influencer and the brand strengthens attachment transfer – applies exclusively to human influencers. Originality/value This study is among the first to examine the effects of brand endorsements by human and AI-generated metahuman influencers, each compared to a brand-only control, on online brand engagement. It uses attachment transfer and brand fit as key mechanisms to uncover the dynamics of this relationship. The findings provide valuable insights into the role of social media influencers in brand marketing communications, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of their influence in today’s dynamic digital marketing landscape.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The current study proposes and empirically tests a novel marketing tactic for the metaverse: designing virtual stores differentially to convey different personalities of the same brand. We also examine how these brand personalities, as perceived from virtual store designs, influence customers’ identification with the brand and intention to purchase its products. Design/methodology/approach We conducted three experiments testing two sets of design tactics, which are theoretically feasible but empirically uncertain: tidy (vs stylish messy) and maximalist (vs minimalist) virtual stores. Findings First, we showed that the brand was perceived to be high in competence and sophistication as personality traits when presented in a tidy-style virtual store. Second, the brand was perceived to be high in the active brand personality when presented in a maximalist-style virtual store. The opposite was also observed: the same brand was perceived to be low in the active brand personality when presented in a minimalist-style virtual store. Third, consumers whose personalities are matched with the different store designs more strongly favor the brand and are more likely to buy the products of the brand. This effect was explained by the customers’ personality-based identification with the brand. Research limitations/implications The current study would benefit from testing the models across different categories and brand personalities to enhance generalizability. Practical implications Our findings reveal metaverse marketing tactics utilizing distinct designs of virtual stores that can express the same brand’s differential personalities, which can be tailored to consumer personalities in the metaverse, thereby increasing conversion rates. Originality/value The current studies present novel insights into how store designs influence perceptions of brand personality and shape consumer behavior.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Dynamic pricing platforms selling deadline-driven goods and services introduce time as a factor influencing conversion rates and purchase prices. We examined the online path-to-purchase for deadline-driven events to clarify the effect of device use and device-switching on conversion rates and ticket prices. Design/methodology/approach In Study 1, we examined website traffic and transaction data for 1.65 million user sessions from 2015 to 2019 for buyers searching for e-tickets on a prominent reseller platform. In Study 2, we addressed the procrastination of mobile device users and conducted a field experiment with over 140,000 users. Findings Greater time-to-event led to higher conversion rates when the first search and purchase occurred on PCs. Conversion rates for the first search on a mobile device were four times lower but yielded ten times higher average ticket prices. As time-to-event decreased, conversion increased for mobile device users, but at lower prices. Users switching from PC to mobile devices across search sessions were more likely to convert than those switching from mobile to PC. In Study 2, a provincial norm email message increased click-through rates significantly on both mobile devices and PCs with greater conversion and higher ticket prices. Research limitations/implications In contrast to static time and price in online environments, we find unique user behavior related to device use in a dynamic online marketplace. Originality/value This study focused on the effects of device use, device switching and time on conversion rates and ticket prices in a dynamic online marketplace. We tested how a provincial norm message may nudge a user to purchase further in advance and at higher prices.",

Additionally, those who experience health concerns that face social stigma, such as depression, are more likely to seek support online. To identify effective strategies that help individuals seeking support for depression receive high-quality social support online, we explore the role of two linguistic features in encouraging polite responses to their posts. This study employed a 2 (agency: human vs. depression) × 2 (causality: biological vs. nonbiological) factorial design. The politeness package for R was used to identify linguistic indicators of negative politeness and our results demonstrated that attributions of agency and causality did not have a significant direct effect on the prevalence of negative politeness in support responses. This suggests that support seekers’ understanding of the etiology of depression, and how they present it to support providers, has little impact on the quality of support provided in terms of negative politeness.",

Drawing on survey data from 1,340 Swiss–German participants, this study reveals that engagement with diverse political views is not solely shaped by stable personality traits but also by the characteristics of the informational context. Openness, for instance, shows a positive relationship with seeking controversial information in the media but not the interpersonal sphere, while extraversion is linked to a preference for controversial political discussions. Nevertheless, our results also point to a particular personality type, plasticity (i.e., shared variance of openness and extraversion), that seems to be more actively engaged in cross-cutting exposure across communication settings. In contrast, individuals high in stability (i.e., shared variance of conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness) tend to be somewhat less engaged.",

          "authors": "Sonny Rosenthal, Benjamin J. Li",
          "abstract": "Abstract: The soap opera effect is an unsettling feeling that some individuals experience while watching films at a high framerate. It has received little scholarly attention, and most explanations of it are speculative or anecdotal. Drawing on the mere exposure effect, this preregistered laboratory experiment provides new evidence of framerate sensitivity and cinemagoing as explanatory factors of the soap opera effect. Undergraduate students ( N = 270) reported their cinemagoing and completed a novel task to measure their framerate sensitivity. They also completed a task indicating their framerate preferences. Those with a higher framerate sensitivity and more regular cinemagoing preferred the standard framerate in one scene and the high framerate in another scene. These divergent findings may be due to differences in camera movement and luminance between the scenes.",

          "authors": "Shiyu Jiang, Rebecca Y. M. Cheung, Jun Gao",
          "abstract": "Interpersonal sexual objectification is a pervasive phenomenon among women and has been increasingly recognized in men. Research suggests sexual objectification is associated with two contrasting psychological outcomes: self-objectification and enjoyment of sexualization. Yet, little is known about how these outcomes vary by interpersonal context and gender, particularly in Asian contexts. To this end, two studies were conducted in the Chinese cultural context. In Study 1, a two-stage process was used to collect and screen objectifying comments towards women and men. In the first stage, 67 women and 41 men were recruited to generate a pool of comments. In the second stage, another 75 women and 50 men were recruited to evaluate these comments, resulting in eight representative comments for each gender. In Study 2, 239 women and 194 men participated in a 4 × 2 experiment examining how the perpetrator’s role (stranger, colleague, friend, or intimate partner) and the comment valence (positive or negative) affected self-objectification and enjoyment of sexualization. Results revealed distinct response patterns between genders. For women, positive objectifying comments led to lower self-objectification compared to negative comments in acquaintance contexts (i.e., colleagues, friends, and partners). However, no differences were found in the context with strangers. In contrast, men’s self-objectification remained stable across perpetrators and comment valences. Women’s enjoyment of sexualization was highest from intimate partners than from strangers, colleagues, and friends, whereas men’s enjoyment of sexualization was relatively high across perpetrators but lowest with colleagues. These findings extend objectification theory to the Chinese setting, highlighting gender-specific patterns in how interpersonal contexts shape psychological responses to sexual objectification.",

          "abstract": "Partner-schemas structures (i.e., the degree of interconnectedness in the beliefs one holds about their romantic partner) have been associated with relationship well-being and, to a lesser degree, depression, in cross-sectional research. However, little is known about how schema structures may impact couples in their daily lives. To address this gap, 260 couples were sampled at baseline to assess partner-schema structures, then surveyed for 14 days. Daily surveys captured relationship quality, relationship conflict severity, and relationship rumination; changes in relationship quality and relationship rumination on the day of a relational conflict; and depressed mood. Using multilevel modelling, guided by the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model, significant actor and partner effects emerged. Generally, the results suggest that an individual’s partner-schema structures are significantly associated with their own daily relationship quality, relationship rumination, increased relationship rumination on the day of a relational conflict, and depressed mood. Two partner effects also emerged, indicating that one’s own partner-schema structures may shape one’s partner’s relationship rumination on the day of a conflict, as well as their partner’s depressed mood. Exploratory analyses also suggest that the linkages between conflict severity and daily relationship quality, daily relationship rumination, and daily depressed mood may be moderated by partner-schema structures. These findings extend previous cross-sectional research to the daily dyadic context. Implications for future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Empathic accuracy (EA), the ability to accurately infer others’ thoughts and feelings, is critical for fruitful empathic exchanges in intimate relationships. Most EA research was limited in their real-life validity and actor-partner considerations. Since reduced mental resources have been linked to decreased judgment accuracy and reduced emotional expressions, we predicted that both actor’s and partner’s mental depletion would be associated with lower EA towards partners’ relationship appraisals and moods. We also investigated moderation by valence of mood and by gender. Additional analyses tested the presence of anchoring and how it related to mental depletion and EA. Eighty-seven heterosexual couples in Hong Kong ( N = 174, M age = 28.81) contributed baseline data and diary data over two weeks (totaling 2416 diary data points). Data were analyzed with the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. Self and partner’s mental depletion was associated with decreased EA. The associations were stronger in EA for negative moods and in men’s EA for partner’s positive moods. Anchoring was present in the sample and correlated with higher EA but less mental depletion. Results offer insights into daily variations in EA and the dual process model of social cognition, and have implications for optimal communication timing.",

For over a decade, the Department of Specialized Audience Programs operated as a semi-autonomous unit until it was absorbed into NPR’s general news division and later dissolved. Previous scholarship has suggested that NPR has been subject to economic and political pressures, which have limited its ability to fulfill its diversity mission; however, I found that NPR has been resistant to efforts to diversify its programming, despite receiving outside pressure from legislators, funders, and advocacy organizations.",

          "authors": "Aqsa Farooq, Adam Rutland, Luke McGuire",
          "abstract": "Adolescents’ online habits may contribute to the spread of misinformation due to their preference for trusted peers as sources of information over credible sources. This propensity can also make adolescents a population more vulnerable to misinformation, particularly during crises when misinformation levels surge. In situations of uncertainty and risk, such as during public health crises, trust plays an important and influential role. This study explored whether adolescents’ trust in an individual sharing misinformation, and trust in their misinformation about Covid-19, differed based on adolescents’ perceived risk of harm from Covid-19 (risk vs reduced risk) and the age of the misinformer (peer vs adult). When shown misinformation about a hypothetical Covid-19 variant, adolescents (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 131; 14–17 years old) trusted a misinformer more when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents were also asked to provide open-ended justifications for their trust evaluations which were analysed in accordance with the elaboration likelihood model. We found that adolescents who reported to more regularly scrutinising information were more likely to consider information and source credibility when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents who reported engaging in less information-scrutinising behaviours were more likely to consider their relationship with the misinformer when the misinformer was a peer. These findings suggest how the elaboration likelihood model can play an important role in risk communication amongst adolescents and emphasise the need for educating adolescents about the importance of scrutinising information, particularly during crises.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the relationship between local media ecosystems and territorial hope in depopulated rural areas of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). Drawing on geographies of hope as a travelling concept, we examine how local media shape affective orientations toward the future. Within the framework of rural mediatization, we conceptualize media ensembles as key drivers in the symbolic construction of place and as potential enablers of hope in territories historically marked by demographic decline. Approaching news deserts from the perspective of communicative resilience, we combine a media mapping of 721 depopulated municipalities with a face-to-face survey of 529 residents to analyze the role of local media in sustaining collective affective configurations. We construct an index of territorial hope based on three interrelated indicators: personal optimism, sense of belonging, and outward projection of the locality. Statistical analyses show that municipalities with more local media score significantly higher on this index, and a regression model confirms that media-related variables—especially interest in local news and trust in professional media—are stronger predictors of territorial hope than most sociodemographic factors. Our findings suggest that local media contribute to the emergence of territorial hope. This underscores the importance of integrating communication indicators into the study of geographies of hope and highlights their relevance to strengthen the symbolic agency of rural communities.",

          "abstract": "Privacy scholars have posited that institutional privacy threats arouse more uncertainty than social privacy threats, though research examining different types of privacy threats side-by-side is limited. This research uses the repeal of federal protection for abortion in the United States as a case study to explore reactions to these different threats. Moreover, by separately considering corporations and the state, we inductively examine beliefs about the flows of information and resulting power dynamics between individuals (horizontal) and multiple institutions (vertical). Data from interviews with 45 young women in California and Indiana revealed that privacy threats from institutions—especially the state—were perceived as more uncertain, and that these various threats were seen as intertwined. We present the construct of cooperative privacy threats to highlight the lack of boundaries between privacy threats, which often amplifies the risks they pose. Our findings elaborate on online privacy theory and may inform future privacy-preserving policy and technology design.",

          "abstract": "Online hostility has become increasingly common in digital public spaces, often to the detriment of marginalized groups. While prior research distinguishes between incivility and intolerance, little is known about whether users can recognize these forms as conceptually distinct. Moreover, the roles of prior digital hate perpetration and national context in shaping such perceptions remain unclear. This cross-national survey ( N = 4041; Austria, France, Hungary, and Sweden) addresses these gaps. Participants rated uncivil anti-immigration content not only as more uncivil but also as more intolerant than explicitly intolerant content, indicating an alarming misreading of exclusionary messages. Recent perpetration was associated with weaker recognition of incivility and intolerance, as well as reduced differentiation between content types, suggesting desensitization and blurred perceptual boundaries. The findings were consistent across countries, indicating that these mechanisms transcend national contexts. Strengthening users’ ability to recognize subtle exclusionary rhetoric is essential to counter its normalization in public spheres.",

          "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is widely regarded as a transformative force, reshaping our understanding of both life and death. One experimental frontier is its ability to recreate deceased human beings. Our article explores this nascent GenAI application situated at the threshold of existence. We analyze 50 cases from the United States, Europe, the Near East, and East Asia and distill three principal modes of AI resurrections: (1) Spectacularization, the public re-staging of iconic deceased cultural figures via immersive recreations for entertainment spectacle; (2) Sociopoliticization, the re-invoking of victims of violence in political or commemorative contexts, often as posthumous testimonies; and (3) Mundanization, the everyday revival of loved ones, allowing users to interact with the deceased through chatbots or synthetic media. To engage with the underlying industry that capitalizes on digital remains, we introduce the notion of spectral labor, in which the dead become involuntary sources of data, likeness, and affect that are extracted, circulated, and monetized without their consent. We argue that the use of GenAI to animate the deceased raises urgent legal and ethical questions around posthumous appropriation, ownership, work, and control.",

          "abstract": "The electronics Right-to-Repair movement, which challenges tech companies’ repair restrictions and advocates for more sustainable digital devices, is drawing increasing scholarly attention. While existing discussions focus on formalized activism modalities, this study analyzes an alternative form of repair activism in China through the lens of everyday resistance. We illustrate how independent technicians leverage self-made tools, improvised fixes, and unconventional solutions to extend handset lifespans and resist planned obsolescence. Moreover, we account for how such resistance is embedded in Shenzhen’s supply chains and global electronics trade flows, the very systems of power and capital that technicians seek to challenge. Drawing on Michel Serres’ framework of “the parasite,” we propose the concept of “parasitic activism” to theorize such embedded resistance, whose leverage comes precisely from appropriating and repurposing the host structures. This study thereby contributes to media scholarship on electronics repair cultures and invites a broader rethinking of activism in more pluralistic, context-sensitive terms.",

          "authors": "Yibeltal Temeche",
          "abstract": "The 1974 discovery of Lucy in Ethiopia marked a watershed moment in paleoanthropology. While the scientific community classifies Lucy as an extinct early hominin species that predates Homo sapiens by millions of years, in Ethiopia, she has been embraced as a national matriarch—the first human and mother of humanity. This commentary analyzes how government campaigns and media coverage actively promote a humanized, scientifically inaccurate identity for Lucy. By framing her as “one of us,” these narratives sacrifice scientific facts for emotional resonance and commercial appeal. This popular mischaracterization creates significant obstacles for public science education and undermines scientific literacy, raising ethical questions about the role of the state and media in science communication. Ultimately, the article advocates for a balanced approach that celebrates Lucy’s immense cultural and national importance without compromising the scientific integrity of human evolutionary science.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have examined the relationship between religion and science, but the role of secular belief systems in shaping attitudes toward scientific findings remains understudied. This research tested the leap of faith hypothesis, suggesting that secular individuals may accept scientific claims based more on faith in science than on scientific literacy. In Study 1 ( N = 202) and a preregistered Study 2 ( N = 300), Indonesian adults completed measures of secular beliefs, faith in science, scientific literacy, and confidence in scientific consensus. Across both studies, faith in science consistently mediated the effect of secular beliefs on confidence in scientific consensus, whereas scientific literacy did not. These findings suggest that secular individuals may place trust in scientific claims through conviction—indicating that confidence in science can operate as a faith-like commitment rather than a cognitive understanding.",

This study examines the role of media use and sociodemographic factors in shaping public attitudes toward science in Switzerland using panel data from three surveys over 6 years ( N 2016 = 1,051; N 2019 = 339; N 2022 = 122). Results show that media usage and sociodemographics influenced attitudes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower education and stronger religiosity correlated with reduced interest in or trust in science. Use of online legacy media showed rally-around-the-flag effects, but we found no clear differences between public and private broadcasters regarding their impact on science attitudes. These findings highlight the relationship of media use, sociodemographics, and public attitudes during societal uncertainty and over time, offering insights for targeted, context-sensitive science communication.",

          "authors": "Olli Hellmann",
          "abstract": "This paper analyzes articles from the popular Babylon Bee satire website to show how right-wing humor spreads climate change denialism. The findings reveal that denialist satire closely follows the news cycle, clustering around moments of heightened media attention. Satirical attacks focus primarily on the messengers of climate action—politicians, activists, and scientists—rather than on scientific evidence itself. These figures are most often discredited through ad hominem attacks, though other logical fallacy techniques are also frequent. A qualitative application of humor theory demonstrates how such satire resonates with conservative worldviews, reinforcing distrust of climate science and policy.",

          "abstract": "At the growing intersections of social media and critical disability studies, limited empirical research exists on the role of digital platforms in expressing and constructing neurodivergent identity among subpopulations that additionally belong to other minoritized groups. This study critically intervenes by mapping how what we term “marginalized neurodivergence” is digitally constructed, using the case of young neurodivergent members of the global South Asian (SA) diaspora on TikTok (SANT). We conducted a thematic analysis of 100 TikTok videos posted by SANT from 2020 to 2024 about their lived experiences of autism and/or ADHD, employing dual theoretical and conceptual lenses: the psychosocialcultural framework from counseling psychology and platform affordances from digital studies. Findings indicate that TikTok serves as a forum for SANT to explore overlapping psychological, social, and cultural concerns that may otherwise not be discussed within SA or neurodivergent communities. Although these issues exist outside of TikTok for SANT, the platform’s affordances allow for social, communicative, and expressive possibilities that in turn shape the creation, consumption, and circulation of such content. This study has direct implications for informing clinical support around mental health and disability among marginalized communities, as well as understandings of how digital platforms potentially serve as a mediating factor.",

          "abstract": "Social media offer the opportunity for much public discourse, but also come with the potential to spread misinformation far and wide. This study investigates how older adults respond to misinformation on social media and how their responses vary by sociodemographic factors and digital skills. Based on survey data collected in 2023 from 2000 adults ages 60+, we find that many users take a multifaceted approach to assessing false or misleading information on social media. The most common strategies are reading the comments for validation and checking the source. The prevalence of such responses to misinformation highlights older adults’ active participation in information verification on social media. Findings also suggest that those who use the internet less frequently and those with lower social media skills are less likely to use such strategies suggesting that digital inequality is at play when it comes to responding to misinformation.",

          "authors": "Andreas Jungherr, Adrian Rauchfleisch",
          "abstract": "Recent advances in generative AI have raised public awareness, shaping expectations and concerns about their societal implications. Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment—how well AI systems meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values. However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of AI-enabled systems in Germany ( n = 1800) and the United States ( n = 1756). We examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more normatively charged goals—like fairness and aspirational imaginaries—receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S. responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences.",

          "abstract": "Research into reporting methods of journalists in the United States often focuses on efforts to be more transparent. However, little research examines the role source attribution plays in the audience’s perception of message credibility and information adequacy. Over two experiments, this research tests the role official government and elite sources play in message credibility judgments when compared to other, nongovernment and nonelite sources. Results suggest that messages attributed to elite and government sources are perceived as more credible and higher in information adequacy than other commonly cited sources used in news. Additionally, this research finds that information attributed to social media is perceived as less credible and lower in value. The results have implications for sourcing practices of journalists, suggesting that use of nonelite sources in news might lower people’s perceptions of the information.",

          "abstract": "#EndSARS, an instance of social activism in Nigeria, was a reaction to police brutality and misgovernance. This study examines how users of Nigerian Twitter (now known as X) draw on various discourses to challenge police brutality and (re)construct their ascribed identities while simultaneously evaluating the actions of the Nigeria Police Force and those of the Nigerian government. Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen’s Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (2001), as well as James Martin and Peter White’s Appraisal Framework (2005), served as the theoretical framework. The findings revealed the (re)construction of four identity categories, namely paroxysmic, solidaristic, non-violent resistance and violent resistance. Paroxysmic identity mirrored deep-seated anger among the protesters. Solidaristic identity concerned empathy towards victims of police brutality. Non-violent resistance identity revealed the resilience, courage and audacity to challenge the dominant group, while violent resistance identity involved violent attitudes in reaction to police brutality. The study concludes that social media is a veritable tool for holding dominant groups to account and is a force for change in 21st-century society.",
