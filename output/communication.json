          "abstract": "This article aims to examine the gamification-based engagement strategies embedded in web-based Generative Artificial Intelligence interfaces, drawing on interface and game studies and employing the Octalysis Tool framework (Chou 2016) as a taxonomic instrument. Specifically, it focuses on those strategies that frame AI as a toy, highlighting components, mechanics, and dynamics that resemanticize human–AI interaction in ludic terms. Adopting the perspective of critical media and interface studies, it questions whether a reproachful explanation is legitimate in the case of GAI interfaces. After discussing the inconsistencies of this position, the article proposes two possible directions: the first is comparative in nature, seeking to trace elements of continuity with contemporary media tools; the second is speculative, aiming to emphasize the gap between human–AI interaction practices and properly ludic forms of play with toys.",

          "authors": "Ilgar Seyidov, Christian Pentzold",
          "abstract": "In countries where state institutions and the public largely reject LGBTQIA+ identities and issues, queer people struggle with visibility. Next to governments and technology providers, what queer people do, who they connect to, and how they express themselves is being watched and scrutinized by their families and proximate relations. This lateral surveillance is afforded by social media that establish, as we argue in this article, a prism. Here, LGBTQIA+ lives become refracted as extensive though incoherent patterns of digital traces. How queer people respond to this situation where the binary of visible versus invisible falls apart is poorly understood. To address that gap, we interrogate the precarious management of visibility attempted by LGBTQIA+ people in Azerbaijan with its heteropatriarchal, honor-driven culture. Based on our exploratory interview study, we find that queer Azerbaijanis were confronted with a highly ambivalent scopic setup where context collision loomed large. In effect, they supported LGBTQIA+ visibility but had personally decided not to live or promote it. Yet whilst their attempts to remain opaque may contradict their activistic compliancy, this was a logical reaction to too hard to handle terms of visibility.",

          "authors": "Sebastiaan Gorissen",
          "abstract": "Facilitating and mediating a sustained connection between themselves and their audiences is a continuous endeavor for most content creators operating within the online labor platforms characteristic of media and entertainment industries. For these creators, the adaptability and flexibility afforded by the expanded economic structures of platform intermediaries are both liberating and constrictive, as these changing marketplaces divest financial and regulatory responsibilities onto the creators themselves. Within these digital environments, media creators are significantly affected by intermediary platforms’ algorithmic management. Direct-to-consumer platforms – such as OnlyFans – have emerged as an answer to mainstream labor platforms’ algorithmic governance, and content creators’ embrace of direct-to-consumer platforms exemplifies a conscious counter to the affective influence of the platform economy. The patrons of direct-to-consumer platforms function as spatially dispersed benefactors, ushering in an era of ‘neo-patronage’ by financially supporting their chosen creators through sustained subscriptions and commissions.",

          "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has drawn widespread attention, with its capabilities and transformative potential drawing significant public and academic interest. Despite the growing industry and scholarly focus, the existing literature remains fragmented, lacking a cohesive framework to understand its complexity and underlying dynamics. This study addresses this gap by presenting a conceptual framework derived from a review of 98 peer-reviewed articles and conference papers published since 2020. It provides an overview of generative AI’s role across film, television, gaming, animation, extended reality (XR), and live performance sectors, offering an initial snapshot of the state of research and laying a foundation for future studies in this evolving field. Drawing on this analysis, the comprehensive review maps the key themes of the generative AI literature and explores their conceptual relationships. It identifies areas of progress and highlights gaps in the existing knowledge, proposing directions for further research to deepen the understanding of the field. By providing an in-depth examination, this study contributes to a more nuanced and informed perspective on generative AI’s integration and impact within the screen and live performance industries.",

          "title": "Cinema without frames: How Darkening bridges virtual and real to redefine presence and narrative embodiment",
          "authors": "Özgür Çalışkan",
          "abstract": "This study examines how virtual reality (VR) cinema transforms spectatorship, embodiment, and narrative engagement through a phenomenological analysis of Darkening (Ondřej Moravec, 2022), a VR film exhibited at the Czech National Film Museum (NaFilm). VR cinema places the audience inside the film’s world, fostering narrative embodiment through interactive and spatial storytelling. In Darkening , viewers engage in actions such as reaching for objects, responding to auditory prompts, and navigating a virtual environment, creating a fluid relationship between observation and participation. The museum setting enhances this experience by introducing a paradox of asynchronous co-presence, where the solitary nature of VR engagement contrasts with the implied presence of other viewers. This study introduces a three-stage framework consisting of experiential chronology, embodied interactivity, and cognitive reflexivity to analyze how VR cinema reshapes meaning-making and viewer agency. This research combines film phenomenology and narrative theory to demonstrate how VR cinema expands the boundaries of storytelling, interactivity, and presence, offering a profoundly affective and participatory cinematic experience in museum contexts.",

This scoping review maps existing research to support developers and scholars in understanding how narrative and character design intersect in interactive contexts. Sixty-nine studies were identified through a systematic search and analysed in two stages: a descriptive analysis and thematic analysis. The findings revealed a diverse research landscape and a range of storytelling techniques shaped by ludonarrative structures, audiovisual elements, and thematic frameworks. The review highlights key character design factors, emphasizing the importance of believable, relatable, and emotionally engaging characters in fostering immersive narratives. It also explores the broader impact of character-driven storytelling on players, including its potential to support learning, evoke emotion, promote social awareness, and enrich gameplay.",

          "authors": "Yankuan Liu, Pei-Luen Patrick Rau",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study develops a multi-level framework to examine user perceptions of large language models (LLMs). By investigating the relationships among scenario characteristics (irreplaceability, audience and purpose), user perceptions (familiarity, trust and attitudes) and usage contexts (individual, organizational and societal), this study explores how users evaluate LLM-based chatbots in various contexts, addressing a gap in existing research on LLM applications and their user acceptance. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this study crafted eight diverse usage scenarios spanning niche entertainment to significant production support. A questionnaire survey captured users’ familiarity, trust and attitudes, enabling a systematic analysis of user perceptions at individual, organizational and societal levels. Hierarchical clustering and linear regression linked user perceptions with scenario characteristics, forming the basis of the proposed multi-level framework. Findings Through the developed framework, this study identifies distinct perception patterns that systematically align with individual, organizational and societal levels of application. For instance, personal assistance scenarios receive higher perception scores, while societal-level applications reveal mixed user perceptions. These insights suggest that enhancing system performance and addressing user concerns are crucial for effective adoption. Originality/value This study introduces a user-centric, multi-level framework for analyzing LLM perceptions across contexts. It highlights the critical role of user perspectives in shaping ethical, reliable and widely accepted LLM applications, offering practical guidance for developers, organizations and policymakers.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore the mechanism of how gig work challenges affect work withdrawal behaviors, specifically examining the chain mediation effects of gig work challenges on perceived time poverty, job satisfaction and work withdrawal behaviors as well as the moderating role of decent work. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach was employed. There was a scenario experiment involving 120 gig workers and multiple surveys with 506 employees from different organizations. Findings Gig work challenges positively impact work withdrawal behaviors. Perceived time poverty mediates between gig work challenges and job satisfaction and job satisfaction mediates between perceived time poverty and work withdrawal behaviors. Besides, there is an inverse relationship between perceived time poverty and job satisfaction, and they play a mediating role in the linkage between gig work challenges and work withdrawal behaviors. Also, decent work has a moderating role. Originality/value This study delineates the sequential mediating effects of perceived time poverty and job satisfaction on the relationship between gig work challenges and withdrawal behaviors, advancing scholarly understanding in gig economy management. The study adapts the job demands-resources model to the gig context, elucidating psychological and organizational aspects and showcasing the model’s applicability.",

          "authors": "Lanhui Cai, Kum Fai Yuen, Diancen Xie, Mingjie Fang, Xueqin Wang",
          "abstract": "Purpose Omnichannel retailing offers consumers more channels and opportunities to engage in logistics. This study revisits the concept of consumer logistics with two objectives: establishing a comprehensive framework of consumer logistics in the context of omnichannel retailing and exploring potential consumer clusters by focusing on their involvement patterns in logistics activities. Design/methodology/approach Two exploratory studies were conducted. Study 1 involved exploratory factor analysis to identify the dimensions of consumer logistics activities. Subsequently, K-means clustering analysis was conducted to categorise “logsumers” based on their current preferences for logistics activities. Findings The findings reveal five dimensions within consumer logistics activities: pre-shopping strategic planning, pre-shopping information exploration, physical involvement in delivery, intellectual engagement in delivery and post-delivery return activities. Further, this study identifies four types of logistics activity participants: enthusiastic logistics participants, apathetic logistics participants, intellectual activity engagers and physical activity activators. Research limitations/implications This study expands the understanding of consumer logistics by offering a comprehensive segmentation framework across all logistics stages, including post-delivery returns. By integrating clustering analysis with logistics management, it reveals consumer logistics behavioural patterns. However, its findings are limited by regional and temporal contexts, suggesting that generalisations should be cautious. Originality/value This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding consumer logistics and lays the groundwork for market segmentation research in this domain. Furthermore, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of consumer engagement by examining logistics activity attributes and “logsumer” types, enabling retailers and logistics service providers to formulate differentiated strategies for diverse consumer groups.",

          "authors": "Georgina Guillén, Juho Hamari, Jaco Quist",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to increase our understanding of the value and ethical conflicts faced by sustainable consumption app (SCA) creators when applying gamification to support individual sustainability practices. The results include practical strategies and recommendations toward responsible innovation and sustainable human–computer interaction. Design/methodology/approach This study consists of semi-structured interviews with 21 SCA creators, an online survey on moral foundations and thematic mapping. Findings The apps’ content, expected impact, managerial issues and external aspects influencing their survival emerged as the four areas across which resources, the creators’ intentions, growth and trust-building strategies and gamification as a value destroyer and source of ethical tensions represent the main conflict areas. These tensions comprise engagement vs individual agency loss; third-party involvement and partnerships; rewards vs oversimplification; mandatory use vs personal drive; current knowledge vs further education; learning from others; stakeholders’ risks; experience vs unwanted outcomes and the meaning of value and collaborative design. The strategies to address these represent responsible innovation practices and are this study’s main contribution. Research limitations/implications Including insights from non-European SCA creators and users could help identify additional opportunities for SCAs to meet their objectives. Originality/value While studies on SCAs from the user perspective are abundant, this study takes the creators’ perspective to understand the dilemmas behind such tools. Focusing on ethical concerns and the value of gamification as a strategy to achieve the apps’ objectives offers a unique perspective for improving some of the most popular tools that enable sustainable consumption.",

          "authors": "Mingchuan Gong, Mengli Xu",
          "abstract": "Purpose An increasing number of social media platforms are utilizing social network integration to enhance sustained user participation. However, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms through which social network integration facilitates user continuance. This study applies communication visibility theory to explicate how social network integration enables visible communication among social media users in game environments, which enhances players’ social stickiness and commitment. Furthermore, we utilize social comparison theory to illuminate the effects of social comparison, spurred by relationships with acquaintances, on individuals’ continuance participation. Design/methodology/approach Our research model is substantiated through a longitudinal field study that gathered subjective and objective data from a social game. After two rounds of data collection, we obtained 231 responses to examine the research model. Findings Our results elaborate how communication visibility enhances players’ socialization with social media friendships, which further enhances their continuance participation in social games. We identify that social comparison exerts both a direct and moderating influence on players’ continuance participation. Practical implications Integrating social media friendships into social games enhances player retention by fostering social presence, engagement and comparison. Game operators should optimize interfaces, implement notifications and host interactive events. These strategies also apply to e-commerce and knowledge-sharing platforms, improving user participation and community interactions. Originality/value This study enriches the existing literature by clarifying how social network integration influences players’ sustained use within social games. It also provides practical insights into leveraging social network integration to enhance user retention across various social media platforms.",

          "authors": "Haosen Sun, Markus H. Schafer",
          "abstract": "Loneliness negatively impacts on the well-being of older adults, especially those with small social networks. While expanding networks and participating in social activities are commonly associated with lower loneliness, these strategies are not always feasible for everyone. Solitary activities, such as reading, may offer an alternative by relating to the subjective experience of loneliness and promoting satisfaction with existing networks. Using Waves 4–8 of the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we analyzed and compared how social and solitary activities moderated the relationship between core network size and loneliness among 31,935 participants aged 54 and above. We further conducted moderated mediation analyses to explore whether these activities moderate the association between network size and network satisfaction, which serves as a mediating path between network size and loneliness. Results show that daily engagement in solitary activities, particularly reading, was linked to lower loneliness among older adults with small social networks, with stronger associations than those observed for regular social activity participation, even after accounting for baseline loneliness, personality, changes in network size, and other sociodemographic factors. Network satisfaction helped explain the link between network size and loneliness, especially in relation to social activity. However, reading showed a broader protective effect that was associated with both greater satisfaction with one’s network and reduced loneliness, even beyond the role of satisfaction. These findings suggest that engaging in cognitively stimulating solitary activities, especially reading, may offer a meaningful alternative for individuals with a limited core network and at risk for loneliness.",

          "authors": "Adriana Ștefănel",
          "abstract": "This article examines the growing susceptibility of young Romanians to authoritarian leadership models in the aftermath of the 2024 European elections. While youth are often seen as champions of democratic renewal, recent data point to a significant erosion of democratic commitment, shaped by institutional distrust and emotionally charged media environments. This concern is heightened by Romania’s political developments in 2024, which saw the doubling of extremist representation in the European Parliament and the annulment of the first round of presidential elections due to alleged irregularities and social media interference. Drawing on a media‐centered theoretical framework and original survey data, the study finds that 74% of respondents support the idea of a strong leader unconcerned with parliamentary procedures. Socio‐demographic factors, such as gender, education, income, and urban–rural residence, significantly influence these attitudes, with lower education and income levels correlating with stronger authoritarian support. Media consumption patterns also emerge as critical determinants: reliance on social media and traditional media (TV and radio) is associated with heightened authoritarian inclinations, while online press consumption fosters greater democratic resilience. Platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp appear to amplify affective and symbolic political expression, even among those who primarily rely on traditional media sources. Furthermore, institutional trust proves to be domain‐specific; lower trust in security, religious, and educational institutions predicts higher support for authoritarian leadership. Rather than reflecting mere apathy, youth disengagement reveals complex interactions between media ecosystems, emotional political communication, and institutional skepticism. This study contributes to existing research by focusing on an understudied demographic (Romanian youth) during a volatile electoral moment. It combines nationally representative survey data with a media‐centered analytical lens to examine how platform‐specific information environments shape authoritarian attitudes.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how organizational capacity and environmental pressures shape social media adoption in local government. Using a mixed‐methods approach, we analyze Facebook adoption patterns across 6,254 Czech municipalities by scanning their official websites for Facebook links, a questionnaire survey (𝑁 = 330), and thematic analysis of posts from municipalities with extended powers. Results reveal a strong relationship between municipal size and Facebook adoption, with rates ranging from 14.1% in the smallest municipalities (fewer than 200 inhabitants) to 88.6% in the largest (10,000+). Primary adoption motivations include communication speed, ensuring citizen awareness, and meeting public expectations for a modern online presence, while resource constraints and fear of negativity constitute major barriers. Thematic analysis reveals dominance of practical information and community event promotion over dialogic engagement. The findings demonstrate how resource limitations create a digital divide in local government communication, with smaller municipalities facing structural barriers to social media adoption. This research contributes to understanding technology diffusion dynamics in fragmented administrative systems and the gap between social media’s dialogic potential and actual government communication practices.",

          "abstract": "This article analyses the escalating tensions between political actors and the media in Spain, focusing on how structural weaknesses in the journalistic field facilitate the internalisation of disinformation and political polarisation. Using field theory and qualitative data from interviews with journalists, regulators, and media professionals, the study explores how Spain’s deregulated, economically precarious, and structurally fragmented media environment undermines journalistic autonomy. Recent challenges to media legitimacy illustrate declining professional standards, insufficient self‐regulation, and the blurred boundaries of journalistic identity. The analysis challenges the view that the prevalence of disinformation is mainly a byproduct of political polarisation, arguing instead that low institutional autonomy has made Spanish journalism structurally vulnerable to post‐truth dynamics. The article concludes that Spain’s regulatory model, while formally protecting press freedom, lacks the internal governance mechanisms needed to uphold professional ethics and ultimately professional authority. As the European Media Freedom Act promises regulatory change, the article calls for renewed public and professional debate on journalistic standards, legitimacy, and the democratic role of the press in the face of mounting epistemic and institutional crises.",

          "abstract": "The article presents an interdisciplinary analytical framework contributing to the growing research field of visual political communication, focusing on the case of the social media images published by Italian politicians during the 2024 European elections campaign (May–June 2024). In the first part, the article outlines the context of the analytical framework at the intersection of three main research fields: political communication, in particular the study of electoral campaigns via social media; visual culture and communication, precisely the analysis of the visual representation, self‐representation, and counter‐representation of political leaders; and computer science, in particular the application of machine learning techniques for computer vision to recognize and categorize visual political content. In the second part, the article offers an application of the analytical framework by sharing some empirical results of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the visual content published by 21 Italian political actors on Facebook and Instagram during the campaign, focusing on their main visual formats, themes, and strategies of representation of political leadership. In the analysis, deep learning models are also employed to detect specific image characteristics by cross‐referencing their outputs with manual cataloguing performed on the same images and for the same attributes. In the end, on the basis of the research carried out, the article suggests possible paths for future interdisciplinary analysis of online visual political communication.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this review essay is to draw attention to the diversity of work done in the field of government social media communication research. It is a rapidly developing area of study that has been approached from multiple disciplinary perspectives and a variety of research traditions. We suggest that studies of government social media communication may be broadly classified based on two characteristics: (a) whether their focus is mainly on the senders, messages, media, audiences, or effects of communication; and (b) the domains of government policy and public administration that they address. We review existing literature along this classification and conclude by suggesting fruitful directions for future research.",

          "authors": "Debjani Chakraborty, Chhavi Garg",
          "abstract": "With increasing access to mobile devices and media, 77% of the population of India, the most populated nation in the world, are now mobile phone users. This has translated to an increasing user base across demographics, including older rural adults: Most own a dedicated feature phone and share access to a smartphone, while many older couples share access to one dedicated smartphone. With considerably lower literacy rates, especially among older women, using a mobile phone that is programmed in English comes with its own set of challenges, and the older users have developed their own unique strategies to navigate them. This study uses in-depth interviews and participant observation in a village in the agrarian state of Punjab, a state in north-western India. The findings indicate three types of users among older rural adults: techno-optimists who find the phone useful for younger users, individuals who use the phone solely for useful purposes, and participants who see the mobile phone as disruptive. Factors shaping usage include low digital skills, tendency to depend on warm experts (younger members of the family who can potentially teach them mobile media usage) to use the mobile phone on their behalf, and expectations of moral and ethical performativity. The study finds that, along with digital skills and age, social structure of living in a close knit family (joint family) forms a reticence even among techno-optimist older adults, who see the mobile phone as something for the young people to learn instead of upskilling themselves to use one.",

          "abstract": "News consumption is often treated as static behavior, yet situational and temporal factors play a significant role in shaping how individuals consume news throughout their daily lives. Mobile phones have become a driving force of dynamic news habits, especially among younger audiences. This study aims to bridge the gap between static perceptions of news consumption and the dynamic realities of daily mobile usage. To investigate this, we tracked news usage on the mobile phones of 384 young adults in Switzerland over three weeks in 2021, in a period surrounding a national referendum. These data were combined with two surveys at the beginning and end of the tracking period to examine how a political referendum, daily schedules, and browsing habits are related to the amount of mobile news consumption. Using a Bayesian time-lagged model, we found an increase in news consumption on the day of the referendum, and a slight decrease on weekends and during working hours. We also found that participants read more news when they first opened their phones than as a browsing session continued, and that higher news consumption was substantially associated with the use of X/Twitter and Instagram, but only slightly with TikTok.",

          "abstract": "The transnationalization of political issues has led to a greater need for multinational solutions and has increased the relevance of public diplomacy (PD). Although scholars have identified different approaches to digital PD, comparative research is lacking. This study addresses this gap by examining whether United States (US) embassies vary in their reliance on various PD instruments. Furthermore, it explores whether such variation aligns with contextual target audience variables, specifically different facets of political and cultural proximity. Based on a dataset that includes all Twitter accounts operated by US embassies over a year-long period ( n = 176,372 posts), the results suggest that embassies vary in their use of PD instruments. Moreover, the prevalence of PD instruments and advocacy topics covary with some of the analyzed facets of political and cultural proximity. Consequentially, the study suggests that US embassies partially tailor their messages to the interests of target audiences.",

Guided by fan activism and media logic theories, this study explores fan comment control in online public cultural spaces as a representative case of digital fandom in China. By investigating the digital mobilization of fan comment control and the interactions among fans, anti-fans, non-fans, and platforms, this study challenges the optimistic view in previous fan studies that regarded fan collective action as fan activism. Through participant observation and 20 in-depth interviews, this study finds fluidity in cultural identities within and outside the digital fandom and an ongoing negotiation between platforms’ efforts to regulate users and users’ strategies to adapt to algorithmic rules. Notably, under the reinforcing influence of platform dataism, fans’ diverse motivations contribute to transforming collective commenting from a potential form of activism into a struggle for discursive hegemony.",

Recently, scholars have turned their attention to exploring women’s agency in relation to social media to examine how particular groups of individuals participate in the curation of their online worlds in pursuit of a positive body image. In particular, we consider the experiences of specific racial groups who are interacting with what some claim are ‘whitewashed’ and algorithmically biased digital environments. We aim to contribute to this enquiry by drawing on semi-structured interviews and ‘content elicitation’ with 32 Chinese Canadian women who were invited to describe their experiences with health and fitness content on Instagram. We found that our participants displayed a heightened awareness of algorithmic bias and in response, attempted to actively ‘train’ their algorithms to provide content that reflected greater bodily diversity.",

          "authors": "Laura Niebling",
          "abstract": "The article introduces the concept of “consent capital” to analyze how writing and reading romantasy, a leading book genre on contemporary bookish platforms often criticized for its young female communities and “trivial” nature, has become a site for political discourse. Drawing on feminist research on romance since the 1980s, and theories on consent culture and cultural capital, the analysis traces romantasy’s role in the post-digital storytelling of body politics, particularly after 2016. Through a comparative analysis of contemporary romantasy series, exemplified by a case study on Rebecca Yarros’s Empyrean series and a focus on “alpha male archetypes,” the article argues that notions of consent, bodily autonomy, and trauma have been transformed into a form of cultural capital, which is actively practiced, but also discussed and aesthetically reflected upon on social media platforms. In post-digital storytelling, it informs cultural value debates and commodification strategies on “sides” like BookTok, where romantasy’s fictional renegotiations of consent capital intersect with the current political, legal and cultural debates on “consent” in countries in the “Global North”.",

However, the racial implications of such platform-mediated business relations remain underexplored. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Xuchang, a leading distribution and export center for wigs products in the global supply chain, this research examines the active role of Alibaba in orchestrating, structuring, and shaping the racial knowledge formation of rural Chinese wig sellers in their daily online interactions with Black clients. We argue that the exploitative nature of platform capitalism creates stress and exhaustion among rural wig sellers and pushes them to draw narrow and hasty conclusions about Blackness that dovetail with racialized hierarchy in the global wig industry and logistics networks. This research bridges the gap between platform studies and critical race studies and contributes to the reconceptualization of relations between platform and race.",

          "abstract": "In this article, I examine how the use of audience feedback in film production shapes creative decision-making. While existing scholarship often views audience data as a rationalising tool that reduces risk and economic uncertainty, little research has explored how such practices function within creative processes. Drawing on an empirical case study from the Danish film production culture, where a novel audience research initiative institutionalises interfacing with proxy audiences at the early stage of script development, I analyse how filmmakers negotiate the integration of audience insights. The analysis finds that audience research does not dissolve uncertainty, as the creative uncertainty of translating feedback into concrete creative action persists. This is underlined by the negotiated nature of the process, where filmmakers selectively filter and resist audience input, often privileging their creative vision over audience sentiment. These insights nuance prevailing claims about the predictive capacity of data-driven production and demonstrate that the negotiation between creativity and audience data is a contested feature of contemporary media production.",

          "authors": "Kari Steen-Johnsen, Audun Fladmoe, Karoline Andrea Ihlebæk",
          "abstract": "The emergence of right-wing alternative media has raised concerns about the diffusion of radical ideas among citizens and growing distrust in the media and public institutions. Based on representative surveys in Denmark ( n = 1,958), Norway ( n = 2,009), and Sweden ( n = 1,991), we examine what characterises right-wing alternative media users in terms of political attitudes and political, media, and social trust. The analysis reveals that right-wing alternative media users in Scandinavia tend to affiliate with far-right parties, support far-right ideas, and express lower levels of trust in political institutions, traditional media, and unknown others. Among these, support for far-right ideas and a lack of trust in traditional media are the most important characteristics. While support for far-right ideas characterises right-wing alternative media users in all three countries, low trust in traditional media is a more important characteristic in Norway and Sweden than in Denmark. The study advances knowledge of the role of ideology vis-à-vis various forms of (dis)trust among right-wing alternative media users, showing that while alternative media use across the Scandinavian countries displays a set of similarities, such use is also formed by national context.",

          "abstract": "LGB people have historical and contemporary experiences of discrimination, stigma, and violence. Research on social groups suggests that norms, rules, and expectations for group conduct emerge to provide responses to group threats, for example, oppression of LGB individuals, and arise from cultural expectations and agreements between partners. While previous research demonstrated that norm content , specific rules, and expectations in relationships established by LGB people differ from their heterosexual counterparts, it is unclear if norm strength (i.e., when norms are clearly articulated, shared, binding) and its role for relationship satisfaction vary across sexual orientations. Using multilevel meta‐analysis, we synthesized effects from four independent samples (total N = 1171) containing data on sexual orientation, relationship norm strength, and satisfaction. We tested whether (a) norm strength and (b) its association with satisfaction were dependent on sexual orientation and/or particular forms of norm strength. Contrary to expectations, we found no differences in norm strength across sexual identities or forms of norm strength. Our findings suggest similar degrees of norm strength govern LGB relationships. Limitations include cross‐sectional MTurk samples and mono‐informant data that prevent examination of dyadic processes. Future research should distinguish which normative mechanisms (e.g., the content of/conformity to norms) are responsible for shaping relationships.",

This article proposes one such mechanism in deference towards authority. Through Structural Equation Model on Eurobarometer 2021 data, I investigate if favoring expert guidance over public participation in decision-making on science-related issues mediates the relationship between people’s socio-economic status and engagement with science. Results show that higher socio-economic status is associated with greater engagement but also with favor toward experts’ deliberation. Preferring experts over public involvement in decision-making is also associated with more informative engagement and less general engagement. Nevertheless, this mediating role is rather weak. Moreover, the study examines how other perceptions of science relate to socio-economic status and engagement, emphasizing the broader social and structural factors that shape opportunities for participation.",

Building on the Integrated Behavioral Model, the results suggest that scientists’ beliefs about the societal benefits of a goal (i.e. attitudes) are the most consistent predictors of goal importance ratings and personal goal prioritization. Other beliefs are also associated with personal goal prioritization, including beliefs about personal benefits, agency (i.e. self-efficacy), and to a lesser extent, social norms. The data further suggests that basic scientists have similar goals to applied scientists who were in the sample, and that there are few differences across the six fields studied. The conclusion is that proponents of specific behavioral goals may wish to focus on communicating the benefits of goals to scientists, more so than norms or efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms are crucial for political and social engagement, where identity profoundly shapes public opinion. While existing research explores social media and identity, the rise of sophisticated bots complicates this relationship; bots programmed to mimic human identity groups may influence discourse and sway opinion on critical issues like elections and climate change. Addressing a gap in theoretical work, this article proposes the concept of instrumental bot identities, explaining how bots can be strategically designed to leverage and co-opt social identity processes for enhanced impact. By developing a theoretical framework, I outline the characteristics (e.g. relevance, familiarity, anonymity) and interaction patterns (e.g. influencing ingroup/outgroup dynamics) that could make specific identities instrumental for bot campaigns. Using the case of fossil fuel workers, a politically salient group in energy transition discussions, the article illustrates how bots could simulate classed and gendered characteristics to reinforce stereotypes, shape group norms, and ultimately influence public attitudes toward decarbonization policies. This framework highlights that bot effectiveness may stem from exploiting identity-motivated reasoning, offering crucial insights for understanding and mitigating online manipulation in polarized contexts.",

          "abstract": "Grounded in the conceptual frameworks of protest framing and digital repression, this study examines the adaptive messaging strategies employed by Vietnamese environmental activists in response to escalating repression, through physical coercion, across two key periods: before and after mid-2021. Our analysis of the Facebook content of one of Vietnam’s leading environmental groups indicates significant changes in the group’s adoption of protest frames, topical frames, and narrative roles, highlighting how activists balance public engagement with safety under authoritarian constraints. Specifically, after a wave of arrests of high-profile environmental activists, activists shifted their message framing strategies from motivational to diagnostic, focusing more on information provision rather than encouraging public engagement. In addition, after the arrests, activists increasingly shifted their narrative roles, increasing their blame on corporations as villains, while positioning the environment as a primary victim. This study enriches our understanding of digital activism in authoritarian contexts, offering theoretical insights and practical guidance for movements under similar constraints.",
