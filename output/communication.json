          "abstract": "Appreciating employees is a communicative behavior, however, research focused on communication is limited. This systematic review synthesized 41 records on employee appreciation to derive research recommendations. Research recommendations are related to (a) examining cultural differences, (b) examining differences in work environments and interindividual differences, (c) examining the match of wanted and received appreciation, (d) using more varied methods, (e) validating available and developing new instruments, (f) conducting meta-analyses and including under-researched concepts, (g) focusing on employee appreciation, (h) examining pitfalls and suitable strategies for conveying appreciation, and (i) examining the circular process of appreciation. This systematic review provides (communication) scholars with new research ideas which place employee appreciation at the center—and which are also of great interest for organizations.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Clifton",
          "abstract": "Statues are said to speak to us, to communicate who we are, and who and what we value—our culture. However, prior research has not sought to investigate the in situ and active role that statues play in constituting organizational culture in general, and even less so in the struggle to constitute organizational culture in conflictual situations. To address this lacuna, using the Montreal School of Communication’s notion of ventriloquism and data drawn from debate concerning whether to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes at Oxford University, or not, the purpose of this article is to demonstrate that statues can be weaponized in the struggle to impose or resist an organizational culture. We thus propose adding a critical dimension to ventriloquism to address the research question: how do statues speak to, and act on, us so as to communicatively constitute organizational culture in conflictual situations?",

          "authors": "Emilija Gagrčin",
          "abstract": "This article introduces the Scope of Civic Online Platform Engagement (SCOPE) framework to explain how users interpret and negotiate civic action on social media. It distinguishes between responsibility, which pertains to the obligation side of action (who should act) and legitimacy, which concerns who may act with authority and appropriateness. Building on affordance theory, boundary theory, and research on heuristics, SCOPE demonstrates how affordances shape the conditions for action. Users apply heuristics to interpret cues of visibility, relational ties, spatial mandates, and temporal urgency. These interpretations are then translated into boundary work, shaping responsibility and legitimacy judgments. To operationalize this process, the article proposes decision-making matrices that condense boundary judgments into simple two-question tests of when and by whom civic action is expected. The framework reorients the study of digital citizenship from abstract prescriptions of “good citizenship” to situated and recursive practices of boundary negotiation in platform environments.",

          "authors": "Christian Baden, Annett Heft, Michael Vaughan, Barbara Pfetsch",
          "abstract": "Social media have profoundly changed social communication practices across a vast range of contexts. To theorize these changes, numerous authors have proposed digital affordances as a conceptual lens. Yet, to date, most accounts of digital affordances either gloss broadly over cross-platform or use-dependent differences in practices; or they are highly context-specific, obstructing theoretical integration. In this article, we conceptualize social media affordances on an intermediate level of abstraction that foregrounds consequential differences in how digital social media platforms structure social communication practices. Focusing on the characteristic communication needs of social movements as an exemplary case, we identify how social media platforms present users with differential affordances for articulating public claims, building collective identities, and mobilizing contentious performances. We examine how key contextual conditions alter the value of differential affordances, potentially resulting in differential communication practices and platform preferences. We conclude by discussing key opportunities of our approach for comparative research and theory building.",

          "authors": "Ronald Yi Xiu Wu, Tianguang Meng",
          "abstract": "This paper examines Chinese K-pop fan communities’ responses to the 2016–2017 Korean Wave Ban, which restricted the circulation of Korean cultural materials amid diplomatic tensions. The study asks whether fan discourse – previously shaped by South Korea’s more democratic and individualistic environment – would shift toward state ideology or preserve alternative orientations once outside influences were curtailed. Drawing on a dataset of Weibo posts before and after the ban, thematic coding and regression analysis track how online dialogue evolved. Findings show a sharp rise in debates about policy and governance, but no corresponding increase in nationalist or security-driven rhetoric; rather than embracing state narratives or engaging in overt resistance, fans adapted by reframing entertainment discussions into institutional or bureaucratic terms. This strategy of maneuvering reflects coping within constraints while maintaining group identity. The study thus conceptualizes fan communities as emotional and discursive enclaves, whose expressive strategies flexibly adjust to regulation. It highlights how cultural governance reshapes digital participation without reducing fandom to a passive vehicle of state ideology.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the experiences of women working in the Czech game industry, highlighting the structural inequalities, sexism, and organizational challenges they face. To this end, seventeen in-depth interviews were conducted. The research identifies both benevolent and hostile forms of sexism, with women frequently relegated to tokenistic roles, experiencing heightened scrutiny, impostor syndrome, and unequal pay. As a result, respondents adopt a range of coping strategies, including ignoring the problems, openly expressing dissatisfaction with the work environment or forming support networks. The aim of this article is to better understand the complex and multilayered nature of sexism in the context of game industry and game culture. It represents one of the pioneering studies on women in the gaming industry, providing valuable insights into their position within the Central European context.",

Results showed that icons, particularly for field-independent individuals, elicited greater capture, suggesting a generalized digital attentional bias, and cognitive style play a key role in the process.",

          "abstract": "This essay explores the interactions of violence, self-care, and nationalistic ideology in Rise of the Rōnin (2024), a historical action RPG set in Bakumatsu Japan (1853–1868). The study examines how elements of “cozy games” appear in gameplay through animal interactions and human relationships, emphasizing the contrast between brutal samurai combat and moments of peace. Findings build on model of “situational coziness” given by Waskiewicz and Bakun to examine the cozy elements distributed throughout the open-world game environment. Analyzing game mechanics, narrative design, and player agency, the research highlights how the game crafts an emotional engagement that both softens and legitimizes its ideological stance, positioning self-care and loyalty as virtues aligned with Japan's turbulent path to modernization. The inclusion of nationalist ideologue Yoshida Shōin (1830–1859) as a central figure in the narrative limits the game in terms of global distribution, most notably in South Korea.",

          "abstract": "Exiting the totalistic and intensively focused structure of missionary service prompts sense-making as missionaries return and adapt to life at home. Drawing from organizational, religious, and interpersonal communication literature, we use the communicated sense-making model to explore how 26 Christian missionaries made sense of their experiences and post-missionary identity. Our findings suggest that missionaries used three sense-making devices—metaphors, memorable messages, and personifications—to find certainty in uncertainty, mobilize identity work, and position themselves toward others. We extend the communicated sense-making model by clarifying the functions of sense-making devices, introducing personification as a novel sense-making device, and proposing in-group vernacular as a shared set of linguistic and ideological resources that can enable or constrain sense-making surrounding difficult life events and transitions.",

          "abstract": "Using internet technologies exposes individuals to constant surveillance by companies and other actors. Perceptions of constant surveillance—termed “dataveillance”—are theorized to induce chilling effects (i.e., inhibiting legal and legitimate online activities) posing risks to individuals and societies. In this preregistered longitudinal 3-wave experiment (N = 774), we investigate whether news articles addressing constant online surveillance induce feelings of dataveillance and behavioral inhibitions. Moreover, we extend theoretical notions of dataveillance by examining whether perceived dataveillance relates to other factors that drive privacy behaviors—privacy resignation and critical privacy literacy. Results of Bayesian random-effects within–between models indicate that perceived dataveillance is positively associated with inhibited behaviors, resignation, and literacy. However, these relations only pertain to the between-person level as the within-person associations are possibly too small to be meaningful. Critical privacy literacy might be central for privacy behaviors as we find both between- and within-person associations with self-inhibition.",

The integrative model of behavioural prediction (IMBP) and behavioural reasoning theory (BRT) are used as underpinning theories to examine proposed hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach Using a sequential mixed-methods approach, this study begins with a qualitative study in phase 1 by conducting in-depth interviews. The insights gained from phase 1, along with pertinent literature, form the basis for constructing the conceptual framework research model. This model is then empirically validated in phase 2. A total of 318 responses were collected to examine the proposed hypotheses. The obtained data were analyzed via the structural equation modelling approach. Findings The results of this study reveal that social anxiety and anonymity are significantly associated with positive anticipated emotions. Further, the results also show that avatar customization, social anxiety and anonymity are significantly associated with negative anticipated emotions. Further, anticipated emotions are also associated with attitude and perceived norms towards dating in the metaverse. Moreover, attitudes towards metaverse dating and perceived norms towards metaverse dating are positively associated with dating intention in the metaverse. Finally, results show time spent in the metaverse as a significant moderator. Originality/value This research reveals how users approach dating in metaverse environments, drawing on BRT and the IMBP. These findings offer valuable insights for dating platforms seeking to enhance metaverse dating experiences.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The advancement of information technology (IT) offers opportunities for leveraging senior-care services, a unique public service. Understanding how government leaders translate IT fashions into governmental actions is critically important for both scholars and practitioners in the current digital governance landscape. Drawing on sensemaking and social learning literature, we propose that government leaders’ IT fashion-grabbing and social learning influence their IT beliefs and the consequent governmental actions, including structural governance specification for and material engagement in IT-enabled senior-care services. Design/methodology/approach This study combined a survey methodology and objective data collection about reginal characters. 285 valid observations of town-level local governments in Beijing, China, were obtained. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for model testing. Robustness checks were conducted. Findings The results validated the effects of government leaders’ grabbing and social learning practices on organizational actions on IT-enabled senior-care services and these effects were mediated by their meaning-construction on IT. Furthermore, leaders’ construction of IT beliefs exerted a larger effect on symbolic actions than on substantive actions of local governments. Practical implications Government leaders need more prospective sensemaking with insight on plausibility and future to adapt to the fast-changing IT fashion. Leaders’ social learning is important for their meaning-construction and governmental arrangement in IT-enabled senior-care service delivery. Originality/value This study contributes to juxtaposition of sensemaking and social learning for explaining the new IT-enabled senior-care service delivery.",

A meta-analysis of 223 effect sizes from 103 studies supported the presence of both reciprocal and self-causing relationships, suggesting their robustness as communication phenomena. Time lag moderated self-causing effects, such that longer intervals weakened these effects. Longer lags attenuating the influence of media/communication on subsequent outcomes approached but did not reach statistical significance, and did not significantly alter the reverse pathway. Exploratory moderation analyses showed that effect sizes varied by audience age, analytic methods, topic areas, and media types. Findings highlight the importance of time lag specification in studying dynamic media effects.",

          "abstract": "For those with marginalized identities, social media may offer opportunities for identity exploration and affirmation but may also pose challenges of context collapse, wherein the presence of multiple audiences makes identity-related posting awkward or dangerous. To probe short-term longitudinal patterns, 337 LGBTQ+ 15- to 22-year-olds completed six weekly surveys during Pride Month. As hypothesized, identity exploration was associated with self-reported frequency, positivity, and authenticity of youths’ LGBTQ+ self-presentations online, primarily among those who, on average, rated their online audiences as less heterogeneous (i.e., perceived less context collapse). Consistent with the self-effects model, positivity of self-presentations predicted increases in self-acceptance and self-esteem, with the latter association stronger for those who, on average, received more supportive feedback. In contrast, frequency and authenticity of self-presentations did not predict self-acceptance and self-esteem.",

          "abstract": "Mobile and social media are often identified as a means of enhancing social connection for those who wish to connect. In line with research on relational maintenance and the communicate bond belong theory, a need for connection can drive individuals to reach out to relational partners through mobile and social media, which might boost overall well-being. Using 3 longitudinal datasets that differ by time period (i.e., 6 years, 1 year, 1 month) and context (i.e., older adults’ pandemic-era communication, college student communication with friends, daily diary study of social media use), we test whether change in sociality moderates the association between frequency of mobile and social media use and well-being. In contrast to our hypothesis, when experiencing declines in sociality, the use of mobile and social media was either unrelated to well-being or associated with a decline in well-being. These findings challenge long-held assumptions about relational maintenance through media.",

          "abstract": "This study extends the Virtual Relational Memory model (VRM) to examine the intersection of communication technology, attachment orientation, and post-breakup adjustment. Prior research linked the retaining of virtual possessions to a decline in post-breakup adjustment, and this study investigates the role of avoidant and anxious attachment orientation. Using United States collegiate students, participants ( N = 357) completed an online questionnaire regarding their attachment orientation, ideals regarding their handling of their virtual possessions post-breakup, and post-breakup adjustment. Findings reveal that anxious attachment predicts making decisions based on past partners, which negatively relates to adjustment. Similarly, avoidant attachment predicts making decisions based on the emotional impact of the virtual possessions, which also negatively relates to post-breakup adjustment. This study’s implications underscore the significance of attachment orientation in guiding individuals through managing the virtual possessions of past relationships.",

Using secondary data ( N = 176 dyads), we identified seven conversational motifs involving five-turn sequences of talk between seekers and providers that appeared regularly during conversations. Motifs involving the discussion of feelings were more likely when the prospect of a face threat was not salient and communicating using instant messaging. Inconsistent with our predictions, the problem description motif involving the sharing of facts about the problem was more prevalent when the potential for a face threat was salient and communicating face-to-face. Also contrary to our predictions, the expressing and implicitly recognizing feelings motif was associated with increased seeker distress.",

          "abstract": "Cross-sectional associations between greater attachment insecurities (i.e., anxiety and avoidance) and lower sexual satisfaction are well documented. However, little is known about these associations over time and their explanatory mechanisms. One such potential mechanism is sexual communication, given that attachment insecurities can complicate discussing sexual matters and that positive sexual communication is a pathway toward greater sexual satisfaction. The current study examined whether negative (e.g., blame, avoidance) or collaborative (e.g., problem-solving, sharing feelings) sexual communication patterns (SCP) explained the longitudinal associations between attachment insecurities and sexual satisfaction, using cross-lagged mediation panel analyses. A sample of 441 community adults involved in a romantic relationship completed online questionnaires assessing attachment, SCP and sexual satisfaction at three time points over one year. Results yielded two direct associations showing that individuals with greater attachment avoidance at baseline used more negative SCP six months later and that greater use of collaborative SCP predicted greater sexual satisfaction six months later. One significant indirect association from greater attachment anxiety to lower sexual satisfaction via lower collaborative SCP was also found. These longitudinal findings extend the understanding of mechanisms linking attachment and sexual satisfaction and underline the relevance of targeting how partners communicate about their sexuality in order to improve their sexual satisfaction over time.",

Findings show that while the users acknowledge AI’s potential to improve efficiency and writing quality—and are sometimes delighted by the prospects—they emphasize the need for a human journalist in the loop. Many are concerned about AI replacing human journalists; some fear AI’s capacity to produce fake news, biased content, and clickbait, while others find AI annoyingly inappropriate and its writing generic and impersonal. Regarding transparency and labeling, opinions range from seeing it as irrelevant or context-dependent to essential.",

          "abstract": "Press freedom in Turkey has frequently been questioned throughout its history. Acts of violence against journalists have become a critical issue sometimes resulting in fatalities. This study examines how murders of journalists in Turkey are represented in the media. It focuses on whose stories of the murdered journalists are neglected and whose are brought to the forefront. By addressing the representation of these deaths, the research questions the role of both traditional and digital media in shaping public perception. It investigates how long death-related news remains in the public spotlight and whether commemorations on death anniversaries receive coverage. Numerical differences regarding deaths between new media and traditional media outlets have also been examined. Additionally, the study explores the social and political contexts that contribute to the silences, omissions, and gaps in the narratives surrounding murdered journalists. Through these findings, the study aims to reveal how these stories contribute to the construction and erasure of memory in the media landscape.",

          "authors": "Laurence Stewart, Thandi Bombi",
          "abstract": "On 27 July 1927, a passenger train collided with a goods train near the town of Mapleton in South Africa. Twenty-seven black passengers and four white train staff died and scores more were injured in one of the largest train disasters in the country’s history. Injured black passengers were transported to hospital in disused coal trucks and those killed were buried in “one large grave” near the scene of the accident, while the white train staff were quickly treated and those who died had individual funerals. This article uses the case of the Mapleton disaster to illustrate the media’s role in narrating death and the relationship between history, journalism, and memorialisation. The study draws on archival documents and newspapers for two purposes: First to construct a history and second to conduct a thematic content analysis of newspaper articles that covered the tragedy. Using the concept of bearing witness, the study attempts to understand the role played by the media in preserving the memory of those who have died tragically, been buried, and are now forgotten. The study argues that although journalists play a vital role as servants of history, their privilege in creating narrative results in a historical construction and collective memory that quiets some voices while elevating others. This impacts the capacity for recognition and memorialisation. In addition, the case illustrates how, in the context of tragedy and mass suffering, the media can facilitate public agency and responses that are counter to the hegemonic structures in society.",

          "authors": "Zheng Yang, Yuanting Huang, Mingyue Zhu, Xi Lu",
          "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that platform differences can affect users’ online political engagement. However, there are few studies exploring the impact of different terminals on the online political engagement of netizens on the same platform. To explore this issue, this study captured user messages from four different terminals of the Leadership Message Board on People's Daily Online : the WeChat Mini Program; application client; mobile webpage; and PC webpage. The aim was to discover the differences in user political engagement behavior when using different terminals for the same platform. The findings show that although users try to engage in political issues online on the same platform with similar purposes, the differences in what terminal they use to access it significantly affect the results of such engagement. Concepts of “rehearsal space,” “psychological ownership,” and “redirection convenience” are introduced to help explain this phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "Mobile media, and the larger digital technological systems of which they are a part, both shape and are shaped by contemporary experiences of aging. With the aim of exploring older adults’ understandings, uses of, and experiences with digital technologies in their everyday lives, we conducted four exploratory focus groups in two Canadian cities, with a total of 29 participants representing a diverse range of ages, living situations, and socio-economic statuses. Challenging stereotypes of technophobic or health-obsessed elders, our participants reported using a wide variety of devices and apps for a multiplicity of purposes. Focus groups were characterized by open-ended discussion, eliciting complexity, creativity, and agency in our participants’ understandings and experiences of their digital worlds. Two main themes emerged from the analysis. First, a number of tensions – self-talk vs practice, design vs adaptation, “scripts” vs recreation – were articulated. Second, participants recounted the complex negotiations between technologies and people, bodies, environments, and resources that conjoined to shape their navigations of digital worlds. We suggest that open-ended dialogue with older adults is a promising method for understanding their ongoing, complex, and socially and materially situated engagements with technology. As a generative methodological tool, the focus group not only captures these dynamics but also produces the frictions, negotiations, and shared reflections that reveal them.",

          "authors": "Moa Eriksson Krutrök, Pär Poromaa Isling",
          "abstract": "As AI-driven language models transform communication, minority languages like Meänkieli—a national minority language in northern Sweden—face new forms of digital marginalization. Historically suppressed by the Swedish state, Meänkieli now risks exclusion from rapidly evolving AI ecosystems. This article examines how current AI platforms shape language inclusion, combining semi-structured interviews with language technologists, conservators, and promoters, and a platform analysis of AI translation and language tools. Drawing on these materials, we develop the concept of “technolinguistic suspension” to describe the state in which Meänkieli currently exists: symbolically recognized yet excluded from the technological infrastructures that increasingly define linguistic legitimacy. We identify four interrelated aspects—two conditions (non-representative technologies and low-resource status) and two responses (active work-arounds and AI skepticism)—that illuminate how institutional neglect and platform-level dynamics jointly constrain digital revitalization. The study argues that overcoming technolinguistic suspension requires both structural reforms in platform design and sustained institutional commitment to minority language futures.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes a Bourdieusian theory of digital-regional capital to explore the mediated bond between migrants and their hometowns, addressing an under-studied issue in the context of transregional mobility while filling a gap in the spatial dimension of prior digital capital studies. Focusing on the interplay among digital capital, internal migration, and the development of rural and inland regions in China, this research conducts interviews with 48 internal migrants and 2 government representatives, examining how China’s techno-nationalism/regionalism, combined with various digital platforms, particularly WeChat’s dominant role, has co-shaped digital-regional capital. Key findings reveal that state-led and decentralized technological advancements have equipped Chinese internal migrants with crucial digital capital, enabling their engagements in online networks and economic activities. Thus, migrants can effectively convert their resources into consumption and investments that benefit their hometowns, forming digital-regional capital. However, economic, gendered, and generational disparities create unequal access to and benefits of digital-regional capital.",

          "abstract": "Despite the popular use of the term “toxic” while addressing the high prevalence of abuse in Indian romantic relationships, the scientific literature on “toxic” relationships remains scarce and prompts a fundamental inquiry into the precise criteria by which a relationship qualifies as “toxic.” Using an exploratory approach, the present study aimed to conceptualize “toxic romantic relationships” based on semi‐structured interviews of 48 young adults from India, recruited using purposive sampling. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts offered a comprehensive view of toxic relationships across three facets, that is, healthy characteristics of a romantic relationship, unhealthy characteristics of a romantic relationship, and the subsequent negative impact on the individuals. It could be inferred that a romantic relationship can be regarded as “toxic” only when there is at least one unhealthy relationship characteristic present, the severity of which should be such that it has at least one negative impact on the individual(s) involved, regardless of whether there are healthy relationship characteristics present or not. The study offers insights that can inform educational programs, mental health interventions, and social policies to support individuals navigating such relationships, both within the Indian cultural context and beyond.",

          "authors": "Lin Zhang, Jingyan Elaine Yuan",
          "abstract": "This introduction repositions “platform” and “Asia” as unstable, contested imaginaries rather than fixed objects of analysis. Bringing platform studies into dialogue with Asian studies, we argue for a double move of deconstruction and reconstruction: interrogating how platforms are historically framed through metaphors, archives, and business genealogies, and how “Asia” has been imagined through colonial, Cold War, and postcolonial projects. Using Asia as method, we show how regional trajectories of platformization—superapps and platform business groups, infrastructuralization, and the absorption of informal economies—both provincialize Euro-American frameworks and generate new concepts. At a conjuncture marked by an uneven transition beyond neoliberalism, platforms in Asia formalize informality, extend state infrastructures, and mediate global capital, producing hybrid labor regimes and renewed state–platform entanglements while intensifying inequalities. We organize the special issue around four productive tensions: (1) technological/media affordances vs. cultural specificities; (2) methodological localism vs. theory-building; (3) state power vs. transnationalism; and (4) inter-Asia references vs. power inequalities. Across these frictions, contributors trace alternative genealogies (e.g., from Japanese convenience stores to K-pop fandom platforms), analyze platformized labor and entrepreneurial subjectivities, and rethink governance through fragmented, conjunctural state formations. We contend that metaphors are useful to think with—yet the dominance of “platform” as a corporate framing also calls for critical pivots to alternative figures that open different political and analytic possibilities. Viewed from Asia, platform capitalism appears as a dynamic, contested world-making process that renders visible the uneven, emergent shapes of post-neoliberal futures.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the role of encrypted messaging apps, specifically WhatsApp, in disseminating political disinformation during South Africa’s 2024 general elections. Drawing on a dataset of 22,384 messages from 47 politically active WhatsApp groups and 6,283 unique users, the study identifies how AI-generated deepfakes, emotional manipulation, and ideological group structures facilitated the spread of false political narratives. Using MyFactChecker, an AI-powered sentiment and verification tool, we reveal that disinformation most frequently relied on fear-based appeals (41%), identity-driven rhetoric (32%), and content mimicking credible journalism (27%). The findings show that disinformation gained traction not through factual accuracy but through emotional resonance and relational trust within ideologically cohesive groups. Even when flagged as false, corrective content was often dismissed as propaganda or foreign interference, thus underscoring how truth contests unfold within closed, affective networks.",

          "authors": "Chris Wells, Michelle A. Amazeen, Sara Weinberg",
          "abstract": "Confronting severe economic challenges in the twenty-first century, many news media are forging new relationships with advertisers, including the focus of this study: native advertising. At the same time, as the climate crisis worsens, and political pressures and news coverage increase, we are seeing the fossil fuel industry expand and shift its communication about the topic. This study sits at the intersection of these trends: we ask to what extent, and how, native advertisements are being employed in fossil fuel communication campaigns. We analyze 252 native ads sponsored by fossil fuel companies between 2014 and 2022 in leading English-language news outlets. Led by human quantitative content analysis, with supplementary automated text analysis, we show that the style of climate science denial documented by, for example, Oreskes and Conway, is absent from native ad communications; in its place are frequent mentions of the environment, the reality of climate change, and the need to decarbonize. In fact, the primary position of fossil fuel companies in our data is the assertion that they are leading the decarbonization of energy systems. To do so, they strongly emphasize the relative virtues of natural gas and promote investments in unproven new technologies. A secondary tactic emphasizes the importance of energy to development and quality of life. Our discussion explores the challenges of analyzing claims that are often superficially true but misleading in context and the questions misleading native advertising raises for news media in a challenging digital media landscape.",

          "abstract": "Freedom of speech is an essential pillar of democracy. Despite constitutional protections, citizens in some liberal democracies increasingly feel the “bulwark of liberty” under pressure. While the underlying causes of these developments remain largely ambiguous, a fundamental question persists: What exactly do citizens have in mind when assessing the concept of “freedom of speech” – and who do they believe is restricting it? Clarifying this is essential for interpreting survey data, understanding underlying causes, and developing effective strategies to counter this trend. A quota-representative national survey of German citizens ( N = 1,490) reveals (1) that most respondents perceive free speech in both legal and social terms. Additionally, (2) a notable portion perceives freedom of speech as too restricted, driven by both dimensions, slightly emphasizing the legal aspect. Finally, (3) perceptions of the general status quo and both dimensions are – at least partly – shaped by different actors, underscoring the need to distinguish the social and the legal dimensions of freedom of speech.",
