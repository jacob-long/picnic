          "authors": "Hossein Turner",
          "abstract": "Conspiracy theories (CTs) represent a persistent challenge in evaluating major events, as they often employ fallacious forms of narrative reasoning and persuasion to posit conspiratorial agency and motives. While many CT narratives conflict with logic and reason, a minority may possess a degree of plausibility. But by what standards can plausibility of a CT be measured? This article introduces concepts from legal storytelling, rhetoric and cognitive linguistics to expand Walter Fisher’s narrative paradigm framework, enabling auditors to critically engage with the rhetorical dynamics of CT narratives. Through an analysis of official and alternative narratives surrounding the death of a Russian spy, this article demonstrates how, in a similar way to the role of jurors in criminal trials, auditors may either join the rhetor in co-creating a coherent and plausible narrative, or end up challenging the rhetor by identifying problems and thus planting the potential seeds of rival accounts.",

          "authors": "Sarah Martindale, Jonathan Hook, Richard Carter",
          "abstract": "This article represents our editorial contribution to the exploration of immersive storytelling, broadly conceived in this Special Issue as a set of creative and design practices, audience experiences, a field of study and a toolkit of rapidly developing digital technologies. Herein we set out our motivation for collaborating as an interdisciplinary team seeking to interrogate and expand on celebratory industry-led discourses that (over-)emphasise the transformative potential of digital innovations for immersive storytelling without properly situating these as part of longer trajectories of creative and audience practice. We provide an account of this background context that purposefully shifts the focus from technologies of the moment – Virtual Reality, the Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence – to the underpinning storytelling that can give rise to, as well as make use of, these technologies to facilitate immersion. Having introduced the various perspectives on immersive storytelling presented in the articles collected in this Special Issue, we go on to draw out key themes, topics and approaches from the body of work as a whole. Our analysis encompasses definitional questions, interdisciplinary perspectives and the sharing of expertise. It highlights the role of users as the nexus of technology and narrative, including emotional and sensory interactions, which contribute to their agency within immersive experiences. The discussion of immersive storytelling moves beyond a focus on VR to consider the wider context, including the overlap between real-world locations and narrative content of experiences, and the importance of setting audience expectations. Because, taken together, the articles include multiple projects and case studies involving designing and making immersive experiences, it is apparent that this is an expanded, rather than normalised, design space in which inclusion and exclusion are important considerations. From these findings we put forward a future agenda for the field of immersive storytelling, which revolves around issues of accessibility, ethics and audience research.",

          "abstract": "Fact-checking journalism challenges procedural norms of objectivity by providing truth verdicts. By actively evaluating statements and online rumors based on evidence weight, fact-checkers aim for robust, scientific objectivity. Despite this trend, there is a lack of studies analyzing evidence types used in verification articles, a gap which this article seeks to address. This comparative research examines types of valid evidence—documentation, digital forensic tools, and statements—employed by fact-checkers across 12 organizations in the UK, Germany, Portugal, and Spain ( n = 1976). Results are interpreted using media systems and digital indicators. Notably, Spain, with high political polarization and social media use for news, heavily utilizes digital forensic elements. Germany and the UK, known for high journalistic professionalism and low epistemic vulnerability, predominantly feature ‘all-inclusive’ evidence combining documents, statements, and forensics. Public service broadcasters exhibit the highest levels of verification complexity (hard fact-checking), contrasting with global news agencies, which generally favor softer fact-checking approaches, except for DPA.",

The aim of this study was to better understand character creation, avatar identification, and virtual gender expression for nonbinary players, who's gender does not typically align with traditional male/female binary avatar options. Twenty-five nonbinary video game players participated in exploratory semistructured interviews. A grounded theory approach was used to thematically analyze the transcribed data. Nonbinary players use avatars to explore and experience nonbinary gender expressions. When nonbinary gender options are not available, players describe methods for circumventing in-game features and norms. Participants express negative experiences due to gender choice constraints. Lastly, participants suggest features that would allow for a gender expression that is congruent to their own gender. These findings have important implications for improving the wellbeing of nonbinary and gender-diverse players.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the effect of de-influencing and its related content on consumer behavior compared with influencing content. It considers the gender of de-influencers and consumers’ varied reactions to distinct types of de-influencing. Design/methodology/approach Based on informational social influence theory, we conducted three experiments to investigate how consumers perceive and respond to de-influencing: the first explores consumer perception of social media de-influencers compared to influencers; the second examines the effect of de-influencers’ gender and the last compares consumer attitude toward various types of de-influencer content. Findings Consumers find de-influencers more credible than “traditional” influencers. De-influencing messages significantly affect attitude and purchase intention. The de-influencing creator’s gender does not affect brand attitude, perceived message effectiveness or perception. However, de-influencing video content influences attitudes toward brands and video effectiveness. Messages focusing on ethics and health elicit more negative perceived attitudes toward the brand. Research limitations/implications This pioneering research introduces “de-influence” as a new dynamic in social media marketing, revealing consumers’ preference for authentic, skeptical content over traditional influencer promotions. This lays the foundation for future research on consumer behavior and brand perception in digital spaces. Practical implications Brands in trust-sensitive industries should embrace authenticity and engage with de-influencers to build trust, turn criticism into growth opportunities and align themselves with consumer value. Originality/value Our study represents pioneering research in the emerging field of de-influencing, filling gaps in the literature and offering a comprehensive contribution to social media research.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The persistence and virality of conspiracy theories online have raised significant concerns. This study revisits Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations theory to examine the spread of conspiracy theories on social media, specifically focusing on how factors influencing their diffusion evolve over time. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes over 1.18 million COVID-19-related tweets using a combination of natural language processing, social network analysis and machine learning techniques. It explores the dynamic roles of novelty, content negativity, influencers, echo chamber members and social bots in the diffusion of conspiracy theories. Findings The results indicate that novelty, influencers, echo chamber members and social bots are positively associated with the spread of conspiracy theories. The initial dissemination of conspiracy theories is primarily driven by content novelty and influencer involvement. Over time, the perpetuation of these theories becomes increasingly influenced by content negativity and the involvement of echo chamber members and social bots. Social bots serve as important connectors within echo chambers and their removal significantly reduces network cohesion. Practical implications The findings provide practical guidance for social media platforms and policymakers in monitoring diffusion patterns and applying targeted interventions. Originality/value This study introduces a time-sensitive approach to understanding the spread of conspiracy theories on social media. By identifying the key drivers at different stages of the diffusion process, this study offers valuable insights for developing effective strategies to counteract the proliferation of conspiracy theories at various points in their lifecycle.",

          "authors": "Jolien Trekels, Eva H Telzer",
          "abstract": "Media effects research has observed significant diversity in the effects of social media on adolescent well-being, with outcomes ranging from positive to negative and, in some cases, neutral effects. In an effort to comprehend and elucidate this diversity, we have formulated The Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues, a theoretical framework that systematically categorizes potential sources contributing to these variations. This dynamic model encompasses the complex layers of social cues present within platforms, the social environment, and individual (neuro)susceptibility, collectively shaping how social media influences the well-being of adolescents. The primary goal of this model is to enhance research by concurrently considering a broader range of individual difference factors, providing a comprehensive framework for investigations into the complex interplay of social context in social media effects.",

          "authors": "Katherine A. Collins, Ryan L. Boyd",
          "abstract": "Linguistic bias is the differential use of abstraction, or other linguistic mechanisms, for the same behavior by members of different groups. Abstraction is defined by the Linguistic Category Model (LCM), which defines a continuum of words from concrete to abstract. Linguistic Intergroup Bias (LIB) characterizes the tendency for people to use abstract words for undesirable outgroup and desirable ingroup behavior and concrete words for desirable outgroup and undesirable ingroup behavior. Thus, by examining abstraction in a text, we can understand the implicit attitudes of the author. Yet, research is currently stifled by the time-consuming and resource-intensive method of manual coding. In this study, we aim to develop an automated method to code for LIB. We compiled various techniques, including forms of sentence tokenization, sentiment analysis, and abstraction coding. All methods provided scores that were a good approximation of manually coded scores, which is promising and suggests that more complex methods for LIB coding may be unnecessary. We recommend automated approaches using CoreNLP sentiment analysis and LCM Dictionary abstraction coding.",

          "abstract": "In this survey study ( N = 235), we examined the associations among young adults’ perceptions of family communication patterns (FCPs), maternal psychological control (MPC), and depression in Hungary and China. The results revealed that Chinese young adults reported higher levels of family conformity orientation, MPC, and depression compared to their Hungarian counterparts. Additionally, Chinese and Hungarian young adults reported similar levels of family conversation orientation. Furthermore, results indicated that conversation orientation was a direct negative predictor of young adults’ depression. Lastly, conformity orientation was a positive indirect predictor of depression through MPC. These findings underscore the significant roles of general FCPs and specific parental behaviors play in the mental well-being of young adults.",

Results showed that contact quality with the CIS contact positively predicted perceptions of CISs as nice and kind and negatively predicted perceptions of CISs as rude and annoying, shy and socially awkward, and culturally maladjusted, independent of the moderating variable. On the contrary, contact frequency negatively predicted perceptions of CISs as nice and kind and positively predicted perceptions of CISs as rude and annoying when the outgroup contact was an acquaintance. Additionally, results showed that both contact quality and frequency positively predicted relational solidarity with the Chinese contact, which was, in turn, associated with positive and negative perceptions of CISs. Particularly, these significant indirect effects of contact quality were stronger when the CIS contact was a friend, indicating the significance and complexities of our findings.",

We conducted a scoping review to understand what is currently known about the linguistic representation of Indigenous Peoples. We included peer-reviewed articles from all disciplines published between 2000 and 2024 on language use and discourse in the context of framing, bias, and/or stereotyping of Indigenous Peoples in Canada, the United States, Australia, and Aotearoa New Zealand. Of 1672 articles, 80 were reviewed and analyzed by mode of language, field of study, and time. A subset of the articles (n = 60) underwent a reflexive thematic analysis, from which we identified seven themes. We found that linguistic representations of Indigenous Peoples were disproportionately negative and involved deficit- rather than strengths-based discourse. Greater attention to linguistic representations of Indigenous Peoples is needed within healthcare and education, and future research should include language in historical documents and academia.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing concern about the spread of misinformation on the internet. One of the key solutions to address this challenge is the practice of information verification by individuals. Current research on information verification tends to overlook the influence from individuals’ information and social environment. Informed by the media repertoire and the egocentric network approach, this study proposes to examine one’s news repertoire and news discussion networks as critical correlates with verification beliefs and behavior. A survey with a nationally representative sample in the United States ( N = 1,088) revealed that a rich news repertoire and a higher level of news capital embedded in news discussion networks are positively associated with one’s perceptions of self-efficacy and actual engagement in information verification. In addition, the study uncovers the moderating role of news capital in magnifying the positive linkage between news repertoire richness and verification self-efficacy as well as the indirect pathway linking news repertoire richness to verification behavior via verification self-efficacy. Overall, our study offers a news ecology perspective that expands scholarly understanding and theorization of information verification.",

          "authors": "Jana Zündel",
          "abstract": "This essay explores how seriality and televisuality inform and fuel meme culture. Television and streaming series not only provide material for internet memes, i.e., appropriable audio-visual extracts that circulate on social media and video-sharing platforms, but often already feature meme-like visuals themselves, e.g., visual or scenographic imitations of artwork, reenactments of movie scenes, or even entire iconographies of a media franchise. In a semi-historical approach, this essay explores these “memefications” as intertextual practices for recalling, recycling, and preserving cultural artifacts. Citing various cases in US series from an autobiographical collection of such revisualizations and elaborate referential networks in both legacy TV series and popular contemporary shows, this essay proposes a taxonomy of pre-internet memefication within and between series: intermedial, interserial, and intraserial memefications. I discuss them as aesthetic and praxeological precursors of current moving image memes such as TikToks, which similarly restage scenes, characteristics, or tropes from other shows, films, or media. As it is a key characteristic of televisuality to adopt and transform modes of representation from other media, I argue that television may have premeditated and mastered memefication before the conception of internet memes, which are now prevalent in everyday communication.",

          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=\"EN-US\"&gt;The social media landscape is replete with images of animals that users share, repost and like, and there are not just cats anymore; various nonhuman species have become a part of the social media “ecosystem” from cute puppies to exotic dragons. They are not simply models for different formats of content anymore, on Instagram they have their own accounts and they become influencers almost like humans. At the same time, such accounts have odd status – they create the ‘illusion’ that animals can have control over their representation thus showing their identity on social media and that they are actors independent both from human curators and from the policy and affordances of Instagram as a digital platform. The paper is aimed at answering two main research questions: what forms of identity, and whose identities, are represented in pet accounts curated by human owners? What strategies and platform tools are chosen by the owners for curation and performing animal agency in pet accounts? Thus, the paper addresses three theoretical fields: 1) human-animal relationships, 2) representation of identity and agency in social media, 3) politics and affordances of digital platforms. Based on the discussions in these fields the authors propose qualitative in-depth analysis of six pet accounts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Through the affordances of social media platforms, users expand the range of topics and content accessible to the public, simultaneously exposing these subjects to increased visibility and potential debate. Platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, X, and Telegram enable anyone to create channels and publicize content on virtually any topic, fostering niche communities. In other words, platforms, driven by their pursuit of attention, time, and data, cannot be analyzed solely through a business or organizational lens. The economic dimension is intertwined with cultural formations—beliefs, values, and identity constructions—which carry an anthropological dimension. In this thematic issue, we are particularly interested in the gendered aspects of this intertwining.",

In this article, we suggest the introduction of the datacasting paradigm, which takes into account the increasing relevance algorithms have in selection processes on audiovisual platforms. We use TikTok as a case study as it is an entirely algorithmic platform, and therefore embodies the heart of our discussion, and analyse how the algorithmic flow within the platform influences user experience, the impact it has on the enjoyment of content, and whether the platform can be considered televisual. We have opted to frame TikTok within debates on flow, as we believe that is what is at the core of the platform experience. Through the analysis of in-depth interviews, we extracted two main categories of responses: TV on TikTok and TikTok as TV. The former includes all responses related to the consumption of traditional televisual material on the platform, while the latter looks at all potential connections between the platform and television viewing habits.",

          "abstract": "This article interrogates the privileging of intimacy in contemporary discussions of media in general and audio journalism in particular (within a broadly Anglo-American frame). It posits that the prominence of the term in relation to podcasting specifically, together with the communicative practices it purports to describe, has become ideological. The article begins by exploring how the intimate address of radio and podcasting has been variously invoked and celebrated in public and academic discourse across a century of spoken word media. This historical overview provides a context and counterpoint to the ways in which intimacy is invoked in contemporary discourses and the contradictions encapsulated by the notion of an “intimate public sphere” (Berlant, 1998). It highlights how the language of intimacy in the public realm—with all its positive connotations, including in relation to building trust—can be appropriated or transformed under the logics of communicative capitalism (Dean, 2005) to disguise unequal power relations, restrict communication across difference, and feed into a culture of atomised individualism. The article turns instead to a cosmopolitan ethics of “proper distance” (Silverstone, 2004) combined with a feminist ethics of care as a way to negotiate the balance between intimacy and trust for the listening public.",

          "authors": "Simone Knox, Kai Hanno Schwind",
          "abstract": "This article offers a comprehensive analysis of how increasingly globalised infrastructures, marked by industry expansion, consolidation, and the impact of streamers, affect the workflows and practices within local dubbing industries. Informed by extensive, original interviews with managerial and creative dubbing practitioners, and industry fieldwork observations since 2017, the article is located within a post-Bourdieuian framework, exploring what significant change for the field and its habitus has meant for agency. Having identified a persistent lack of engagement with the dubbing of television in existing scholarship across several disciplines, the article considers how dubbing practitioners negotiate a wider industrial push towards more streamlining, standardisation, and more attendance to issues concerning equity, diversity, and inclusion. Here, the article offers the notion of oblique agency, to capture how creative agency is moved away from local creative practitioners, through more managerial oversight, prescriptive guidance and tools, and feedback cultures shaped by corporate agendas. Simultaneously, some agency is left to these practitioners, most acutely felt in the case of dubbing contemporary television (marked by narrative and tonal complexity), due to a lack of investment and recognition of dubbing as inherently creative. The article takes care to explore the complexities of these dynamics, especially a pronounced heterogeneity of views, including simultaneous criticism and enjoyment by creative practitioners, as well as a considerable gap between their perspectives and those of managerial practitioners. In this way, the article seeks to make a much-needed contribution to nuanced engagement with dubbing infrastructures and working practices.",

          "authors": "Raúl Rodríguez-Ortiz, Manuel Fernández-Sande",
          "abstract": "This study analyses the narrative strategies employed in 11 independent narrative non-fiction podcasts from seven Ibero-American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico. The research concentrates on identifying the primary narrative trends applied within this genre of audio journalism, focusing on how the role of the narrator and the structure of the story boost credibility and listener engagement. The methodology combines semi-structured interviews with 16 podcast producers and content analysis of 73 episodes to explore how these podcasts shape their narrative approaches. The results reveal that these podcasts use various journalistic subgenres, including interviews, sound chronicles a recognised genre within narrative and radio journalism in Ibero-American, and other more artistic or experimental formats such as radio features, along with narrative structures like episodic, Aristotelian, and counterpoint, allowing for diverse forms of storytelling. In addition, the study underscores the incorporation of sound archives, personal life stories, and other audio techniques to enhance the narrative’s depth and emotional resonance. These elements contribute to producing socially relevant stories that often challenge stereotypes and address underrepresented voices in society. Ultimately, this research highlights the role of independent non-fiction podcasts in the evolution of audio journalism in Ibero-America.",

          "authors": "Robert Sparrow, Ellen Y Zhang",
          "abstract": "Veneration of paternal ancestors plays an important role in Chinese tradition. In this article, we offer some speculations about how a new ‘thanatechnology’ – digital personality emulation – may impact on ancestor worship. We explore the ethical issues raised by the use of personality emulations for this purpose, drawing on Confucian, Daoist and contemporary Anglo-American perspectives. For Confucians, the key questions concern the extent to which this technology automates the task of remembering and whether it is corrosive of filial piety. Daoists might be critical of personality emulations owing to a larger disagreement with Confucians about the role of ritual in a good human life. Finally, recent discussions in the Anglo-American literature suggest that the use of this technology would raise questions about the consent of the deceased to emulation, the privacy of users, the danger that users will be manipulated by the designers and/or manufacturers of emulations, and the impact of emulations on the grieving process.",

          "abstract": "This article delves into the process of technological adaptation to local environments by presenting the case of food delivery platforms in Mexico City. Primarily, it focuses on the tension between design and local economic practices. Given the primacy of cash as an object of economic exchange, platforms facilitate cash payments. Platforms then delegate the task of cash administration to couriers. Labor control around this task is then institutionalized in the form of platform features. Furthermore, platform dependency to cover basic necessities shapes divergent experiences of the delegated task of cash administration. Conceptually, this article employs the Latourian concept of delegation to explore the human and nonhuman enrollments mobilized to adapt digital technologies to local environments.",

          "authors": "Pablo Mangas, Juan Carlos Sierra, Carlos Pérez‐Amorós",
          "abstract": "The subjective orgasm experience (SOE) is conceptualized as the evaluation of orgasm from a psychological approach. There are a few precedents regarding the association of this dimension of sexuality with nonsexual aspects, such as relationship satisfaction. This study involved 110 Spanish same‐sex couples (53 male and 57 female), ages ranging from 18 to 54 years, and an average relationship duration of 42.82 months. Most participants reported exclusively homosexual sexual practices, with some engaging in varying degrees of bisexual contact. The study analyzed the dyadic effects of SOE dimensions (i.e., affective, sensory, intimacy, and rewards) on relationship satisfaction and the extent to which intradyadic discrepancies in SOE dimensions explain the variance in relationship satisfaction. In male couples, relationship satisfaction was positively explained by the individual's affective dimension and negatively explained by the partner's intimacy dimension. In female couples, it was positively explained by the partner's rewards dimension. The analysis of discrepancies revealed a decrease in relationship satisfaction due to intradyadic discrepancies in the affective and intimacy dimensions, but only in male couples. Our findings emphasize the need to consider how the perception of orgasm may influence satisfaction with relationship quality and the valuation of bonding.",

However, criticism also spread among various left-wing and environmentalist milieus, which represents an understudied phenomenon. Relying on different strands of scientific literature, and on a qualitative research design aimed both to take account of the political heterogeneity within this critical area and to deepen its links with environmentalism, we aim to highlight the limits and normative implications of its interpretation as solely populism, and to contribute to the elaboration of a different interpretive model. Qualitative and frame-bridging analysis highlighted the consolidation of worldviews in clear opposition to hegemonic values, where the criticism of science finds a more appropriate explanation in a denunciation of the intrusiveness of capitalism in science production, as well as in a rejection of “reductionism” and a claim to self-determination that extend from ecological to health issues.",

In this experiment, participants were “forced” to view one of three climate appeals (threat, humor, informational), reflecting the typical between-subjects experiment, or they were permitted to choose between one of these appeals (or topical alternatives), reflecting real-world media choice. Compared with forced exposure, choice exposure resulted in slightly less reactance and slightly greater enjoyment, appreciation, and persuasion outcomes—even after accounting for self-selection biases. These findings underscore the value of treating research participants as selective consumers of science content.",

Using a repeated cross-section design, we tracked intentions to engage in protective behaviors, demographics, and four message perceptions: exhaustion, overload, repetition, and exaggeration. Exhaustion increased over time and became negatively related to intentions (rising negativity model). Exaggeration was stable across the 36 weeks, yet had the strongest negative relationship with intentions and that relationship increased over time (fixed model with increasing negative relationship). Overload and repetition were positively related to intentions, but the relationships faded over time (fading positivity model).",

          "abstract": "Digital media allow users the ability to engage in and be exposed to trolling. Although many people may enjoy the occasional opportunity to witness others being trolled, a relative minority directly troll others, those whom we can label overt trolls. Nevertheless, features afforded on social media and online communities (e.g., likes, upvotes) make it accessible for people to positively react to and support trolling, becoming supportive trolls, a potential steppingstone into overt trolling. In the theoretical contexts of social cognitive theory and the bystander effect, we advance a model in which enjoyment of observing trolling prompts supportive trolling, which could then lead to overt trolling. Analyses of data from an online survey conducted in the United States ( N = 604) show the positive link between enjoyment of observing trolling and supportive trolling is stronger among individuals with higher fear of punishment, while the subsequent link between supportive and overt trolling is stronger among those with higher online disinhibition. Our findings hold implications in understanding the effects of trolling on social media audiences and how trolling can be performed in nuanced ways.",

          "authors": "Ta’Les Love",
          "abstract": "Research on the beauty influencer economy highlights the role that racism plays in platform labor, as race is a prominent determinant in the hierarchy of influencers. While the literature on beauty influencers reveals the multi-faceted labor necessary for success in the genre, less attention is given to the ways that skin tone discrimination—or colorism—defines one’s subject position as a beauty influencer. I argue that skin tone is an identity characteristic that ultimately multiplies the labor required of beauty influencers, particularly for Black women with darker complexions. The extra labor required of persons from a marginalized subject position within a marginalized population is called Racial Phenotype Labor (RPL). Due to racist beauty standards and historical disdain for African phenotypes, Black people—and Black women specifically—with phenotypic features perceived as undesirable enter the digital influencing economy at an additional disadvantage. Societal preference for lighter skin impels darker-skinned creators to complete additional physical, emotional, and mental work in the beauty influencing community. This research asserts that the first layer of RPL involves skin tone work, where beauty influencers must combat the negative preconceptions and discourses typically associated with dark skin. I also suggest that they must combat these biases while simultaneously presenting themselves as marketable to cosmetics companies, viewers, and platform algorithms. This research study uses methodological triangulation through critical technocultural discourse analysis, thematic analysis, and autoethnography to analyze the beauty content of two prominent Black influencers—both advocates against colorism. Ultimately, I conclude that colorism remains especially gendered and functions as an agent of racial capitalism within the digital influencing economy.",

          "abstract": "Emotionality is a well-established strategy for boosting audience engagement on social media. While fact-checking is positioned to provide objective information, fact-checking posts on social media often involve heightened emotionality. How much emotionality is present and how emotionality influences audience engagement and public sentiment toward fact-checked targets remain largely understudied. Informed by social psychological frameworks explicating message-level factors influencing public engagement and sentiment, the present study examines emotionality in 49,270 fact-checking posts created by 10 United States fact-checking organizations on Facebook from 2017 to 2022. Results showed that emotionality in fact-checking posts significantly increased by 13.5% over the years. Editorial fact-checkers (e.g., Washington Post) used higher levels of emotionality than independent fact-checkers (e.g., snopes.com). Emotionality positively indicated public engagement as predicted. However, in both fact-checked true and false information, emotionality was negatively associated with the public’s sentiment toward fact-checked targets, suggesting a potential spillover effect on stories verified to be true. This study reveals that emotionality in fact-checking posts boosts social media engagement yet with the potential of compromising fact-checking effectiveness.",

Research has explored the tensions between transnational and regional linkages, striving to understand when transborder flows of data bring benefits or drawbacks. By viewing global data flows as a social change process, this commentary strives to complement existing perspectives. It advocates embedding data studies within the framework of social transformation theory to transcend the distinction between theory and its empirical application across diverse social and cultural contexts. Inspired by Stephen Castles’ approach to human migration, it introduces the concept of “social data migration” as a dynamic social transformation. This approach enhances our understanding of the complex, interconnected, and context-dependent nature of transnational flows of data across platforms amid rapid global changes.",

          "authors": "Saif Shahin, Mingyi Hou",
          "abstract": "The #StopAsianHate hashtag movement emerged as a challenge to the rising tide of racism in the United States during the coronavirus pandemic and contributed to the legislation of the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act. Our research brings together concepts from social movement studies as well as network science and celebrity-fandom studies to examine a corpus of tweets about the movement. We employ a mixed-methods design combining structural topic modeling with digital discourse analysis. Even though the movement rose up against White Supremacist structural racism, we find that right-wing provocateurs with large followings often hijacked its hashtags to amplify sporadic Black-on-Asian violence. But the active participation of Asian celebrities such as BTS, with their own huge followings online, bolstered the movement. Their posts and statements about anti-Asian violence were heavily reposted and dominated the digital discourse. Crucially, we show how their fans helped boost the movement’s anti-racist agenda by repeatedly posting similar messages in concert, which we compare with the offline fan practice of “chanting” as a form of collective identity performance. While theories like the logic of connective action view digital activism as individualized and decentralized, our research elucidates its hierarchical structure and the oversized role of provocateurs and celebrities in raising the visibility of competing claims and agendas by re-contextualizing hashtags. At the same time, culture industries and practices can create bottom-up solidarities that can have a political impact by raising particular agendas in the digital attention economy.",

          "authors": "Qinfeng Zhu, Tai-Quan Peng, Xinzhi Zhang",
          "abstract": "In an era of pervasive misinformation, equipping citizens to counter its spread is increasingly critical. This study examines news authentication—individuals’ proactive verification of news—as a key indicator of resilience to misinformation. Guided by the theory of planned behavior and the resilience model, we examine how individual characteristics and structural contexts interact to influence news authentication. To do so, we adopt a multilevel comparative approach, analyzing news authentication in three distinct societies: Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and the United States. Drawing on a preregistered, population-based survey conducted in 2022 ( N = 6,082), we apply multigroup structural equation modeling to identify the influential factors. Our findings show that, at the societal level, news authentication is more prevalent in the United States and Hong Kong, where severe polarization and fragmented, low-trust media environments amplify misinformation risks. Conversely, the Netherlands exhibits lower levels of news authentication, potentially due to its relatively cohesive media environment and moderate polarization. At the individual level, political efficacy and institutional trust are consistent predictors across societies, underscoring the importance of political empowerment and trust in fostering resilience. Education significantly predicts news authentication only in the United States, where the complex information landscape necessitates higher cognitive engagement. Notably, conspiracy beliefs positively associate with news authentication in the Netherlands and the United States, reflecting a potential “dark side” of this behavior in contexts marked by growing anti-establishment sentiments. These findings highlight the interplay between individual capacities, political beliefs, and broader media and political environments in shaping resilience to misinformation.",

          "abstract": "Democratic backsliding has been on the rise globally, including in the established and transitional democracies of the Global North, with populist leaders adopting similar practices of undermining the epistemology of journalism or attempting to capture news media outright. A representative survey with 391 Bulgarian journalists conducted as part of the Worlds of Journalism Study in 2021–2024 shows that corruption through the misuse of European and national funds has become one of the main survival mechanisms for their news outlets. This is complemented on a personal level with the finding that nearly two in five journalists have been forced to hold a second job, which has often led to conflict-of-interest issues. The Bulgarian case study is an excellent illustration of the consequences of a 13-year-long rule by populist leader Boyko Borisov and concurrent practices of Berlusconization and media capture in this Eastern European country, which for over a decade (2011–2022) had the lowest press freedom ranking among all European Union member states. The study shows an increased recognition among journalists of the power of journalistic agency, that is, their own role in the media capture process. The link between journalistic agency and media capture is of essential importance but has not been studied sufficiently.",

          "abstract": "This study integrates the perspectives of issue niche theory and issue ownership theory to examine how variations in issue salience affect the resources available to political organizations affiliated with different parties. Analyzing a database with millions of donors’ political donation records, our time series analysis reveals a nuanced interplay: When some issues associated with Democrats assume the spotlight, there is a discernible increase in left-leaning donations. Simultaneously, when other Democrats issue raises to prominence, there is a notable suppression of right-leaning contributions. These findings underline the persuasive force of issue ownership for each party, which either bolsters fundraising for affiliated political organizations or obstructs donations to opposing groups. Furthermore, we observe that competence-related issues, such as COVID-19 and the economy and inflation, exert a substantial influence on political contributions among both left- and right-leaning donors. Notably, competence issues demonstrate a more pronounced influence on donor behavior compared to associative issues. Overall, our study suggests a refined issue niche theory tailored to the political context, where issue niches are shaped not only by issue salience but also by the precise issue ownership type.",
