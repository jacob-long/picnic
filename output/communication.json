          "abstract": "Purpose This study seeks to understand what organizational changes are occurring within two vertical cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) implementations using socio-technical systems (STS) theory. Design/methodology/approach We conduct an exploratory field study of two business unit CRM implementations and collect data through field notes, emails, conversations and interviews. We apply STS theory and qualitative techniques to analyze the actors, structures, technology, tasks and their interdependencies. Findings Dependence on central IT significantly decreased for both units, but these vertical cloud-based CRM systems could not be implemented and maintained without expert IT actors. We found variations of IT expertise skills and dependence on central IT resulting in three differences: the business unit’s development processes, the ability to implement and maintain systems internally and CRM capabilities available to the business units. Extensive product research should be conducted prior to making decisions, implementation plans and goals. Business units should be cautious about vendor claims of self-sufficiency and no technical expertise requirement. Originality/value We extend the literature on user-led system implementations by studying implementation processes and applying Leavitt’s STS diamond to examine four interdependent dimensions. We apply Leavitt’s theoretical model as a tool to frame and guide our understanding of the differences and impacts of user-led implementations. We identify the activities for successful user-led cloud implementation and present propositions for organizations to consider when supporting user-led systems. When systems are supporting decentralized business processes, the implementation efforts will be complex and require more time to successfully implement a useable solution.",

Design/methodology/approach Using 21 semi-structured interviews, the experiences of women are explored to understand how they strengthened their capabilities to acquire support and achieve resilience during crisis. Findings Findings demonstrate different ways women developed their bonding and bridging social capital at personal, family and community level to seek online support and empower themselves to achieve disaster resilience. While the context of this study is pandemic, findings are applicable to other crisis scenarios. Originality/value The research enhances the importance of online social capital in developing agency, capabilities and resilience during crisis. It enables to understand how practitioners should not limit technology use to disaster preparedness and prevention, but it could also be used in responding and recovering from crisis.",

Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a privacy-preserving location data collection approach based on local differential privacy (LDP) and validates the feasibility of the approach through experiments on three real-world public check-in datasets. Findings The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which preserves privacy while retaining over 90% of the data utility. Practical implications This research has the potential to assist tourism practitioners in establishing improved collaborations with trusted third parties, enabling the exploration of user location data insights without undue concerns regarding indirect privacy breaches during data mining, thereby enhancing travellers’ experience and aiding businesses’ decision-making. Originality/value This paper is likely to be the first to represent a promising solution for addressing privacy leakage concerns related to non-sensitive data in data mining. It provides a location data collection technology that strikes a balance between user privacy and data utility for tourism practitioners.",

          "authors": "Abdul Hameed Pitafi, Fazeelat Masood, Sheena Pitafi",
          "abstract": "Purpose The present research aims to explore the influence of enterprise social media (ESM) features on employee agility through knowledge sharing and hiding. ESM strain was taken as a moderator in the association among knowledge sharing, knowledge hiding and employee agility. Communication visibility theory is used to underpin the hypothesized research model. Design/methodology/approach Data is collected from 374 Chinese employees working in different companies. A structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied using AMOS software 21.0. Findings Findings illustrate that ESM features namely analysis, tracking and communication are significantly connected to knowledge sharing and negatively to knowledge hiding. Knowledge sharing is significantly related to employee agility while knowledge hiding is negatively linked to employee agility. Further, ESM strain strengthens the negative connection between knowledge hiding and employee agility. However, ESM strain has an insignificant moderating effect in the connection between knowledge sharing and employee agility. Practical implications The current research has practical implications for ESM users and ESM-enabled organizations. For individuals who use ESM to promote knowledge within an organization, this study highlights the important functioning of ESM features that include analysis, tracking and communication. For managers, this study suggests the use of ESM features to promote knowledge sharing and inhibit knowledge hiding. Originality/value The current research investigates how ESM features are associated with employee agility in the workplace. This study proposes that knowledge sharing and knowledge hiding are the mediators of the effect path between ESM features and employee agility. Moreover, the present study extends to ESM literature by highlighting the moderating role of ESM strain using communication visibility theory as a theoretical lens. Lastly, this study quantifies the benefits of ESM features to help organizations train agile employees.",

          "authors": "Junli Wang, Ling Yuan, Ruida Li",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the current digital transformation era, guiding employees toward realizing self-leadership has become a critical strategy for enterprises to mitigate the risks of external uncertainty. This study explores the intrinsic relationship between enterprise social media (ESM) communication visibility and self-leadership on the basis of communication visibility theory (CVT) and conservation of resources theory (COR) to support the sustainable growth of employee self-leadership. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 332 Chinese employees across three stages. Hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method were employed to test the hypotheses. Findings Network translucence and message transparency positively affect self-leadership. Relational energy and job control mediate the relationship between communication visibility and self-leadership. Moreover, response expectations weaken the positive relationship between relational energy and self-leadership as well as between job control and self-leadership. Practical implications Managers can use ESM to provide work and social support for employees’ job control and social network development to achieve long-term maintenance of employees’ self-leadership. At the same time, within the context of ESM use, moderately reducing response expectations can offer situational support for employees to achieve self-leadership. Originality/value This research sheds light on the internal mechanism by which ESM communication visibility affects self-leadership and explores the key boundary conditions that impact how self-leadership is formed. These findings expand the understanding of self-leadership development in the context of ESM use and offer new technical insights for guiding and fostering sustainable employee self-leadership.",

          "authors": "Mahdi Abouei, Nima Kordzadeh, Maryam Ghasemaghaei, Bilal Khan",
          "abstract": "Purpose Users contribute to online communities by posting and responding to discussion threads. Nonetheless, only a small fraction of threads gain popularity and shape community discourse. Prior studies have identified several factors driving thread popularity; however, despite their prevalence, the role of emotional expressions within discussion threads remains understudied. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of thread starters’ valence and embedded discrete emotions of anger, anxiety and sadness on thread popularity, drawing on the negativity bias and the emotion-as-social-information theories. Design/methodology/approach Using two samples from Reddit, this study employs negative binomial regression analysis to examine the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results demonstrate that negativity in thread starters significantly influences thread popularity; however, the expression of discrete emotions impacts popularity variously. In some contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccination subreddits, embedded anger in thread starters decreases thread popularity, whereas anxiety and sad expressions enhance it. In other contexts, such as professional discussions (e.g. r/Medicine subreddit), anger and anxiety expressions increase thread popularity, while sad expressions have no significant influence. Research limitations/implications The study is limited by its focus on specific emotions and contexts. Future research could examine a broader range of emotions, post-content modalities and the impact of cultural and linguistic differences. Originality/value This study contributes to theory by offering a new definition of thread popularity and enhancing our understanding of the impact of emotions in online discussions. It also provides practical implications for online community members and moderators seeking to promote discussion posts that help achieve community goals.",

          "authors": "Zhenya Tang, Leida Chen",
          "abstract": "Purpose Digital device recycling platforms (DDRPs) are customer-to-business online marketplaces that allow consumers to trade in or sell their used electronics, like smartphones and laptops, directly to a business for cash or credit. Guaranteed data destruction is a service provided by most DDRPs to securely erase all data on devices being recycled or traded in. Perceived credibility of the service refers to the extent to which customers are confident in the effectiveness and reliability of the service offered by a given DDRP. Grounded in privacy calculus theory, the current study aims to explore the influence of perceived credibility of guaranteed data destruction service (GDDS) on one’s intention to use a DDRP. Design/methodology/approach An empirical study was conducted through an online survey of Chinese DDRP users. The proposed model was tested by analyzing the collected data using the structural equation modeling approach. Findings Our results indicate that perceived credibility of GDDS affects users’ intention to use DDRPs by decreasing privacy concerns and increasing perceived convenience and environmental benefits of these platforms. Research limitations/implications This study’s findings are based on data collected from Chinese DDRP users, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other cultural or market contexts. Practical implications This study provides practical guidance for DDRPs, emphasizing the importance of enhancing perceived credibility through transparent data destruction practices and certifications. Originality/value The findings of the current study offer implications for theory development in sustainable information technology and e-commerce as well as practical suggestions for increasing usage of DDRPs.",

          "authors": "Xiao Deng, Jiayu Li, Yaying Huang",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores how employees respond to social media-induced fear of missing out (FoMO) in the workplace and examines the subsequent impacts of these responses. Based on the transactional theory of stress and coping, the research focuses on how FoMO affects employees’ adoption of stress-coping behaviors: active work interruption (a problem-oriented strategy) and social network interaction (an emotion-oriented strategy). It further investigates the outcomes of these coping strategies – job burnout (resulting from the problem-oriented strategy) and workplace relationships (resulting from the emotion-oriented strategy). Additionally, the study explores how the perceived competitive climate moderates the effect of FoMO on these coping behaviors. Design/methodology/approach A two-phase survey yielded 244 responses, which were then analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling to validate the relationships among the variables. Findings The findings revealed that FoMO increases employees’ active work interruption, leading to job burnout. In addition, FoMO leads employees to engage in more social network interaction, which promotes workplace relations. The perceived competitive climate positively moderates the indirect effect of workplace FoMO through active work interruption and job burnout. Originality/value This study emphasizes that individuals are not merely passive recipients of stress but active agents in coping with it. This shift from “passive impacts” to “active responses” helps uncover the bidirectional impacts of social media-induced FoMO on employees, thereby enriching our understanding of FoMO and expanding the application of the transactional theory of stress and coping. Additionally, we explore the boundary conditions of the FoMO mechanism and advance research related to the perceived competitive climate.",

Although systematic reviews and bibliometric analysis are distinct methods, they complement one another in research by enabling the synthesis and analysis of existing literature. Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) were selected as the bibliographic databases for this study since they are generally accepted as the most comprehensive data sources for various purposes. Findings Findings revealed 186 publications during these periods, with the top three publications being the Journal of Business Research , Business Horizons and California Business Review . Top-ranking researchers hailed from Germany, Japan and Spain. Keywords that appeared were innovation, digital transformation, artificial intelligence and DT. In the management area, there are fewer studies conceptualising DT management that led to this study forming a conceptual framework using a qualitative, interpretative and thematic analysis approach. Originality/value These findings are relevant for understanding the phenomenon of DT and DT management. The study contributes to the emerging body of knowledge in management and DT.",

          "abstract": "This research delves into the dualistic nature of datafication, revealing its capacity to both illuminate and mask realities within media organizations. Datafication, the strategic use of data in organizations, offers insights into, and transforms, how work and individual outcomes are perceived and evaluated. This study examines how data-centric practices—embodied in metrics, rankings, and algorithms—can skew the playing field, creating scenarios where workers may feel (un)fairly (dis)advantaged or (mis)represented. The findings indicate that while data can provide valuable insights fostering cooperation and learning, it can also create competition and apprehension among journalists. Through the concept of “coopetition” we show how media professionals employ data opportunism to leverage information while also grappling with data skepticism amid potential misinterpretations and increased competition. Hence, the findings contribute to the research on datafication by demonstrating how workers utilize interpretative flexibility depending on what the data and metrics make visible.",

          "abstract": "How do couples differ from other couples in how they regulate their own and their partner’s emotions? Although research on emotion regulation is blooming, insights into joint emotion regulation profiles—that is, the overlap between partners’ specific strategies to regulate themselves and their partner—remain limited. To address this gap, we identified joint intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation profiles in 120 mixed-sex couples; clustering couples together based on both partners’ reported intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation strategies. Additionally, we examined associations between profile-membership and well-being indicators. The identified joint emotion regulation profiles differed in three ways: (1) degree of regulation (e.g., no use of any vs. high use of all strategies), (2) strategies predominantly used; and (3) degree of similarity—or lack thereof—between partners. Together, these findings provide the first insights into the role of joint emotion regulation profiles in the health of couples and their relationships, highlighting the unique roles played by both partners in regulating their own and their partner’s emotions. Further research is needed to assess if these results generalize to inclusive samples and daily life.",

          "abstract": "This article critically explores Netflix’s use of diversity as a strategic tool within its global production culture; it focuses on how the streamer increasingly deploys various narratives about diversity and inclusion to legitimate its presence, rationalize its operations, and normalize the industrial changes it generates. Through a critical discourse analysis of Netflix’s corporate communication—press releases and diversity reports published between June 2022 and February 2024—the study identifies four central discourses that shape Netflix’s approach. These discourses reveal that while Netflix positions itself as a socially responsible actor championing diversity and inclusion, its strategy intertwines cultural values with commercial imperatives. By appealing to local talents worldwide, Netflix’s rhetoric not only opens opportunities for underrepresented voices but also risks simplifying complex local identities to fit global market demands. The article concludes that Netflix’s approach to diversity, while progressive on the surface, may in practice constrain creative autonomy, subtly reinforcing existing global power structures and shaping diversity through a commercial lens.",

          "abstract": "This research contributes to understanding how podcast intimacy shapes the evolving relationship between journalists and their audiences in the digital age. Intimacy in podcasting refers to creating a close emotional connection between journalist and audience, facilitated by this audio format and the growth of headphone—and earbud—listening. Podcasting allows for a more personal relationship, where journalists not only inform but also share emotions and experiences. However, this “emotional truth” can blur the boundaries between fiction and reality, raising ethical challenges regarding objectivity. Based on 14 semi-structured interviews with journalists producing daily news podcasts and documentaries, we examine how intimacy is constructed and experienced in these types of productions. Using a qualitative approach, we explore the boundaries of intimacy in journalists’ discourse, as well as the challenges it poses and the opportunities it offers for the production of news podcasts.",

          "authors": "Natalia Vereshchagina, Irina Dushakova",
          "abstract": "The social media landscape is replete with images of animals that users share, repost, and like. The various nonhuman species that have become a part of the social media ecosystem are no longer merely models for different content formats but have their own accounts and become influencers almost like humans. Instagram’s gender-related politics do not regulate images of animals; one can hypothesize that pet accounts could serve as spaces, tools, and sources of creative content for gender representations free from stereotypes or undermining gender norms. This article aims to answer two main research questions: In what sets of actions is gendered human–animal identity performed in pet accounts? What curating strategies and platform tools are selected by owners to perform gender in pet accounts, within the limits of the platform affordances? To answer these questions, the article addresses three theoretical fields: (a) human–animal relationships, (b) the representation and performing of identity, and (c) the politics and affordances of digital platforms. Based on previous research in these fields, the authors suggest an analytical approach comprising account architecture (content of the header, saved/pinned stories, and relationships with other pet accounts) and account content (format in which content is created and presented). The empirical part is based on the analysis of six regularly updated accounts run on behalf of pets that were active at least three months prior to the beginning of the research.",

Through the affordances of social media platforms, users expand the range of topics and content accessible to the public, simultaneously exposing these subjects to increased visibility and potential debate. Platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, X, and Telegram enable anyone to create channels and publicize content on virtually any topic, fostering niche communities. In other words, platforms, driven by their pursuit of attention, time, and data, cannot be analyzed solely through a business or organizational lens. The economic dimension is intertwined with cultural formations—beliefs, values, and identity constructions—which carry an anthropological dimension. In this thematic issue, we are particularly interested in the gendered aspects of this intertwining.",

          "abstract": "Public discussions of controversial science fields like COVID-19 or climate science increasingly address inner-scientific structures and the norms guiding the scientific system—aspects that are normally discussed within the scientific community. However, not much is known about the endorsement of scientific norms by non-scientists and how those endorsements differ between controversial und uncontroversial science fields. We conducted a cross-sectional national survey in Germany ( N = 1007) to capture the public endorsement of scientific norms and explored the role of the science field, political ideology, and science news consumption. Results suggest that the endorsement of scientific norms is significantly higher in controversial fields than in less controversial fields. More left-leaning political ideology is connected to higher levels of norm endorsement; science news consumption is partly associated with lower scientific norm endorsement. We discuss our findings regarding their implications for the public’s image and understanding of controversial science fields.",

One approach is by examining media framing of artificial intelligence, including news coverage, which is a reflection of societal perceptions and a key influence over people’s understanding. As such, this study examines the framing of communicative artificial intelligence in Singapore, looking at how the news media frame communicative artificial intelligence and characterize it as a social actor. Through a manual content analysis of 336 news articles from three major news websites in Singapore, this study found that the news media in Singapore tend to focus on the benefits and advances of communicative artificial intelligence and portray communicative artificial intelligence as a tool rather than social actor. However, when comparing news coverage of communicative artificial intelligence after the advent of ChatGPT, the news framed communicative artificial intelligence more in terms of risks, regulations, responsibilities, and conflict.",

          "abstract": "Online platforms have enacted various policies to maintain a safe and trustworthy advertising environment. However, the extent to which these policies are adhered to and enforced remains a subject of interest and concern. In this work, we present a large-scale audit of adult advertising on Twitter (now X), specifically focusing on compliance with its adult (sexual) content advertising policy. Twitter is an interesting case study in that it—uniquely from other social media platforms—allows posting of adult content but prohibits adult content in advertising. We analyze approximately 35,000 ads on Twitter with respect to their compliance with the adult content ad policy through Perspective API and manual annotations. Among other things, we find that nearly 38% of ads violate Twitter’s adult content advertising policy—of which, the platform eventually removed only about 63% of these non-compliant adult ads. We also find inconsistencies in the moderation of such ads across languages, highlighting the need for more reliable and consistent moderation practices across different languages. Overall, our findings highlight blindspots in Twitter’s adult ad policy enforcement for certain languages and countries. Our work underscores the importance of external audits to monitor compliance and improve transparency in online advertising.",
