          "title": "Resonance in an accelerating world: Understanding the emergence and characteristics of post-digital artifacts",
          "authors": "Johan Jansson, Claes Thorén",
          "abstract": "Modern society is characterized by technological and social acceleration. Digital devices and technologies have been integrated into nearly every aspect of our lives, from the public to the personal, transforming the material, social and mental worlds at an accelerating rate. To deal with the feeling of acceleration, carefully limiting the number of choices and features in the digital devices we use every day is central in order to facilitate and sustain creativity and focus. Under the umbrella term of post-digital artifacts, there are today several examples of ‘alternative’ products that offer limited functionality as a feature – and they seem to be growing in popularity. Using a qualitative analysis of online texts surrounding a selection of post-digital artifacts: two mobile phones (the Light Phone and the Punkt), a writing tablet (reMarkable), and a writing tool (Freewrite), the aim of this article is to understand the emergence of these post-digital artifacts and what the emergence says about a contemporary post-digital condition. The analysis results in an analytical framework identifying trajectories of opposing conceptual pairs of the digital and the post-digital. In addition, the article applies Rosa’s concept of ‘alienation’ and ‘resonance’ in order to further understand how and why these artifacts play a role in creating meaning and resonance in a digital society characterized by acceleration. Arguably, resonance (or a lack thereof) emerges as the key currency around what is at stake in the post-digital condition. Reclaiming control over knowledge, activities, spatiality and temporality emerges as essential to understanding what resonance means and what the case products produce.",

          "authors": "Marta Dynel",
          "abstract": "This paper contributes to the nascent research on Internet memes examined as items of (de)legitimising discourse, its empirical focus being memes addressing NFTs (non-fungible tokens). The mystifying NFT trade became hype in 2021, attracting massive media coverage and stimulating heated discussion across social media, which includes memetic content production. This study explores the multimodal discourses of (de)legitimisation in NFT memes. Based on a dataset of relevant 993 memes extracted manually from an automatically generated corpus of 1628 Twitter memes, a deductive-inductive multimodal analysis proves the original dichotomy (underlying the polarised views expressed through memes) insufficient. Seven memetic patterns dictated by (de)legitimisation stances are identified. In addition to NFT-legitimising and NFT-delegitimising categories, ambiguous equipotential (de)legitimisation memes, two categories of memes with blended (de)legitimising stances and two categories of elusive-stance memes are distinguished. The notion of ‘quasi-legitimisation’ is proposed to capture the memetic categories that normalise the thorny concept of NFTs.",

          "abstract": "This study analyses the elements involved in adapting a video game or video game saga into a film or series, aiming to propose a model of film adaptation by identifying independent intertextual and intermedial variables. A review of specialized literature in game studies, cinematography, intertextuality, intermediality, and adaptation was conducted. Independent variables were extracted and used to analyze the series adaptation of the Fallout saga. The results are discussed in relation to theoretical precepts from the literature. The findings allow for the proposal of a cinematic adaptation model that interprets different narrative and digital levels of video games. Key elements include the narrative base, construction of an independent story, addition, omission, intermedial translation, suppression, and manageable complexity.",

          "authors": "Ayoung Suh",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in the use of virtual reality (VR) for organizational collaboration has dramatically increased. However, empirical research on the optimal types of VR and avatar designs for effective collaboration remains limited. To address these gaps, this study investigates how VR types (immersive vs non-immersive) and avatar similarity (high vs low) impact collaboration performance, with a focus on the mediating roles of somatic, psychological and behavioral engagement. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on embodied cognition theory and grounded in user engagement theory, we developed a research model that delineates the factors influencing collaboration performance. This model was empirically tested with data collected from a laboratory experiment involving 195 participants, employing a 2 × 2 factorial design. The Engage VR was used for the experiment because it supports the same virtual environment for collaboration between immersive and non-immersive VR contexts. The data were analyzed at the team level ( n  = 65). Findings The results of this study reveal that both immersive VR and high avatar similarity significantly enhance collaboration performance by augmenting somatic engagement, which subsequently boosts psychological and behavioral engagement. Originality/value This research deepens the scholarly understanding of the intricate interplay among VR types, avatar design and user engagement. The study’s theoretical implications underscore the conceptualization of somatic engagement as a critical dimension of user engagement in virtual collaboration, enriching the extant literature on VR-based collaboration. It also provides pragmatic insights to enhance virtual collaboration in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Evolving business landscapes have highlighted the crucial role of innovative digital transformation strategies (DTSs) in reimagining organisational operations and responses to optimise performance, regardless of organisational size or employee composition. The study suggests that DTS is a process that occurs continuously, rather than being a one-time event. It also underscores the critical role of personal resilience and organisational support in achieving job performance goals. Design/methodology/approach Using a survey analysis, this study examines the impact of organisational response and agility, as fundamental components of DTS, on employees' job performance. In addition, it investigates how boundary conditions of personal resilience and organisational support moderates the relationship between (1) organisational agility and job performance, and (2) organisational response and job performance. Findings The research findings demonstrate the impact of DTS on job performance. It highlights the mediating roles of organisational support and agility in improving employees' performance. The study also discusses the critical role of personal resilience and organisational support in navigating the insightful impacts of organisational agility and organisational response on the job performance. Originality/value This paper presents a theoretical framework that integrates the dynamic capabilities of employees and organisations, providing academics and practitioners with a comprehensive perspective on the growth of employees' dynamic capabilities. By offering insightful discussions, the study highlights that, while creating new DTS, organisations not only improve their dynamic capabilities but also enhances the people’s dynamic capabilities and make them more resilient.",

          "authors": "Baoku Li, Ruoxi Yao, Yafeng Nan",
          "abstract": "Purpose Benefiting from the development and innovation of artificial intelligence and affective computing technology, social chatbots that integrate cognitive analysis and affective social services have flooded into the consumer market. For cognition and emotion-oriented tasks, social chatbots do not always receive positive consumer responses. In addition, consumers have a contradictory attitude toward the anthropomorphism of chatbots. Therefore, from the perspective of mind perception and the two dimensions of social judgment, this research explores the mechanism of consumer responses to anthropomorphic interaction styles when social chatbots complete different service tasks. Design/methodology/approach This paper utilizes three behavior experimental designs and survey methods to collect data and the ANOVA, t -test and bootstrap analysis methods to verify the assumed hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that when the service task type of a social chatbot is cognition-oriented, compared to a warm anthropomorphic interaction style, a competent anthropomorphic interaction style can improve consumer responses more effectively. During this process, agent-mind perception plays a mediating role. When the service task type of a social chatbot is emotion-oriented, compared with a competent anthropomorphic conversation style, a warm anthropomorphic conversation style can improve consumer responses. Experience-mind perception mediates this influencing relationship. Originality/value The research results theoretically enrich the relevant research on the anthropomorphism of social chatbots and expand the application of the theory of mind perception in the fields of artificial intelligence and interactive marketing. Our findings provide theoretical guidance for the anthropomorphic development and design of social chatbots and the practical management of service task scenarios.",

          "authors": "Lin Xiao, Xiaofeng Li, Jian Mou",
          "abstract": "Purpose Short-form video advertisements have recently gained popularity and are widely used. However, creating attractive short video advertisements remains a challenge for sellers. Based on the visual-audio perspective and signaling theory, this study investigated the impacts of three visual features (number of shots, pixel-level image complexity and vertical versus horizontal formats) and two audio features (speech rate and average spectral centroid) on user engagement behavior. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a field study on TikTok. To test our various hypotheses, we used regression analysis on 2,511 videos containing product promotion information posted by 60 sellers between January 1, 2020 and November 20, 2021. Findings For visual variables, the number of shots and pixel-level image complexity were found to have nonlinear (inverted U-shaped) relationships with user engagement behavior. The vertical video form was found to have a positive effect on comments and shares. In the case of audio variables, speech rate was found to have a significant positive effect on shares but not on likes and comments. The average spectral centroid was found to have significant negative influences on likes and comments. Practical implications This study provides specific suggestions for sellers who create short-form videos to improve user engagement behavior. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on short-form video advertising by extending the potential drivers of user engagement behavior. Additionally, from a methodological perspective, it contributes to the literature by using computer vision and speech-processing techniques to analyze user behavior in a video-related context, effectively overcoming the limitations of the widely adopted survey method.",

          "abstract": "Purpose In the past decade, the use of neurophysiological measures as a complementary source of information has contributed to our understanding of human–computer interaction. However, less attention has been given to their capability in providing measures with high temporal resolution. Two studies are designed to address the challenge of measuring users’ cognitive load in an online shopping environment and investigate how it is related to task difficulty, task uncertainty and shopping convenience. Design/methodology/approach Two experiments using behavioral and neurophysiological measures are conducted to investigate how various types of the cognitive load construct can be measured and used in an online shopping context. Findings Results of the first study suggest that although all cognitive load measures are influenced by task difficulty, only accumulated load (i.e. total cognitive load experienced during a task) is sensitive to task uncertainty. Results of the second study show that convenience negatively influences accumulated load, and the latter negatively influences user satisfaction. Practical implications Our research offers practical value by providing designers with a validated method to measure users’ cognitive load, enabling the identification of usability issues and design improvement. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by developing a rich and temporally high-resolution measurement of the cognitive load construct and examining how it can inform us about users’ cognitive state in an online shopping environment.",

          "authors": "Tom Brock, Garry Crawford",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the cultural and economic circumstances that shape esports consumer agency through case studies of “experiential consumption” (Miles, 2021). Design/methodology/approach A multiple-case study approach (Stake, 2006) is deployed alongside participant observation and document analysis to identify three cases of experiential consumption in esports – an esports tournament, a large online community for gaming peripherals and accessories, and an esportswear fashion brand. Findings The research identifies three aspects of experiential consumption relevant to esports. First, tournaments are sensory and emotional “spectacles”, immersing consumers in memorable experiences. Second, online gaming communities enable consumers to express themselves through “self-work”. Third, esportswear companies engage consumers with exclusive, authentic fashion experiences via “lifestyle branding”. Research limitations/implications The case studies highlight the need for future cross-cultural research on esports experiences, particularly how regional differences shape consumer behaviour. The impact of emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain and AI on personalising experiences, enhancing interactivity and related ethical considerations should be further explored. Practical implications Esports stakeholders can enhance esports events with real-time data analytics, VR and AR to create immersive experiences. They can also diversify income streams via personalised and exclusive apparel lines that reflect consumer identity, collaborating with mainstream fashion or entertainment brands. Compelling, emotionally resonant storytelling can deepen fan engagement and help build brand loyalty. Originality/value This article presents a new theoretical understanding of esports consumption through multiple case studies of experiential consumption, revealing the central role that “experience” plays in shaping the design and choice of esports products and services.",

          "abstract": "Positive attitudes toward regional/minority languages are an essential precondition to language maintenance/revitalization. We investigate implicit and explicit attitudes toward Welsh and English and their relationship with childhood and adolescent age exposure among adult Welsh speakers from northwest Wales. Results indicate that implicit and explicit attitude constructs diverge and therefore bear differentially on language maintenance/revitalization. Specifically, comparing speaker data from the Language and Social Background Questionnaire with results from two independent studies, employing the Attitudes towards Languages (AToL) Scale and an Implicit Association Task respectively, we show that the implicit measure reveals a positive correlation between attitudes and exposure in primary school age. Conversely, the AToL returned no statistically significant factors, suggesting differential sensitivity of the explicit and implicit measures. We argue that an understanding of both types of attitude constructs, and attending to exposure levels especially as they relate to intergenerational transmission, is necessary to implement an effective language maintenance/revitalization strategy.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: The affordances of online channels can influence communication, and communicators sometimes value affordances differently in different relationships. This study examines how two affordances, anonymity and visibility, combine with relationship closeness to shape how people seek support online. Participants ( N = 171) composed a support-seeking message they imagined sending to various audiences in one of several online channels. Participants and outside observers rated the breadth, depth, and emotional content of the messages. The results suggest relationship closeness was negatively associated with perceived anonymity and perceived visibility. Greater anonymity corresponded with higher observed depth in support-seeking messages and greater visibility corresponded with higher self-reported emotional content. Furthermore, each affordance was positively associated with the observed emotional content of messages at low levels of closeness, and anonymity shared a negative association with the self-reported depth of messages only when visibility was low and closeness was high. Findings suggest that the content of support-seeking messages hinges, in part, on affordances and relationship characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Close sibling relationships can serve as a salient source of support, particularly for individuals navigating stressors associated with emerging adulthood and minoritized identities. Using attachment theory and the temporal intersectional minority stress model as guiding frameworks, mixed-methods data were collected from 939 emerging adult college students to examine the role that siblings play in sexually diverse individual well-being. Sexually diverse emerging adults who perceived close sibling ties did not exhibit a negative effect of prospective anxiety on their self-esteem, but did experience an elevation in positive affect in the face of prospective anxiety, whereas sexually diverse individuals who had poor sibling relationships and heterosexual emerging adults did not show these protective effects. Interactions were not significant for negative affect. Sexually diverse emerging adults shared their lived experiences of how their siblings contribute to their well-being, including themes of affect, sibling interactions, sibling qualities, and coping within the relationship. Most sexually diverse individuals appeared to view a positive effect of siblings on their well-being despite less proximity to the family of origin.",

          "authors": "Katie Read, Dilan Kılıç, Rotem Kahalon, Verena Klein",
          "abstract": "Objectification theory posits that women are treated merely as a body, valued for its use, pleasure and consumption by and for others, mainly men. Women are also disadvantaged relative to men when it comes to sexually pleasurable experiences, including lower orgasm rates and a higher burden of performing sexual emotional labour (e.g., faking orgasm, performing desire for the partner, tolerating discomfort or pain during sex). We tested the hypothesis that objectification within romantic relationships (i.e., partner-objectification) may contribute to this tendency. Using data from 160 heterosexual couples, we aimed to explore how women’s self-objectification, perceived partner-objectification, and men’s self-reported partner-objectification are related to women’s orgasm rates and performance of sexual emotional labour. Self-objectification predicted women’s performance of sexual emotional labour but did not predict women’s orgasm rates. Our results further indicate that to the extent that women perceived themselves as being objectified by their male partner, they tend to report lower orgasm rates and greater performance of emotional labour. However, men’s self-reported partner-objectification did not. These findings suggest that women’s meta-perceptions are of greater importance for women’s sexual well-being than men’s self-reports. The research has implications for societal interventions aimed at preventing the consequences of partner-objectification, as well as for discussions in sex and relationship therapy for couples.",

          "authors": "Na Luo, Bin Bai, Karla Van Leeuwen",
          "abstract": "Prior studies on coparenting have primarily focused on mothers and fathers, neglecting coparenting dynamics in multi-generational families. This study aimed to investigate coparenting perceptions among mothers, fathers and grandparents, and explore the associations between the coparenting relationship and adolescent problem behavior, as well as demographic characteristics. The sample included 1163 families with children aged 10–13 years. Mothers ( n = 997) and fathers ( n = 863) provided ratings of their coparenting relationship toward their partners and one grandparent, while grandparents ( n = 249) reported on the coparenting relationship with mothers. Results showed that compared to mothers, fathers reported more undermining of their own parenting by their partner. They were more supportive of their partner’s parenting and more positive about the division of labor. Fathers rated the overall coparenting relationship more positively than mothers, as indicated by the General Coparenting Scale. Notably, grandparents reported significantly more positive coparenting relations with mothers than mothers’ reports of coparenting with grandparents, expressing affirmation of parental competency and alignment with parenting practices. More positive coparenting was associated with less problem behaviors, which was true for coparenting across parents and grandparents. Furthermore, older adolescent age and higher socioeconomic status were significantly correlated with increased coparenting agreement and closeness. Maternal and paternal grandmothers did not differ in their ratings of the coparenting relationship with the child’s mother. These findings underscore the significance of recognizing differential perceptions among family members regarding coparenting behaviors, providing valuable insights for tailoring specific recommendations to enhance coparenting quality within diverse families.",

Findings reveal that journalists are adopting pragmatic strategies to bring some equilibrium to the field amid Taliban pressures. The existing practices involve renegotiating journalistic approaches where certain aspects are modified and others totally abandoned due to authoritarian constraints. This evolution underscores the profession’s resilience and adaptability, diverging from Western ideals but essential for survival in these strict conditions.",

          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;After a significant surge of active fact-checking organisations in the past decade, more than 100 countries are being covered by fact-checkers today. Although the fact-checking movement is diverse, most operate on a national level. However, there are also organisations that operate on a sub-state level. Based either by community or geographic region, these fact-checkers investigate statements that are relevant for a specific population, and might otherwise remain unaddressed. In Europe, signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network are active in regions with federal or devolved power. This study brings a comparative analysis of regional fact-checkers in Europe, drawing on a combination of qualitative interviews with the organisations’ editors and managers, and a complementary document analysis. Our findings highlight the difference of organisational formats on fact-checking motivations, the difference in scope between political fact-checking and debunking routines, and the collaborative relations of regional fact-checkers with national and international organisations. This article adds to the debate of the global fact-checking movement by raising awareness of regional and local fact-checking, to overcome so-called fact deserts.&lt;/p&gt;",

          "authors": "Bingbing Zhang, Heather Shoenberger",
          "abstract": "While recent research has demonstrated how exposure to cross-cutting political opinions intensifies politically motivated disconnectivity on social media, there has been a notable gap in examining the influence of emotions and psychological traits in this process. Guided by the theories of selective avoidance and affective intelligence, our study employed a survey through Qualtrics panel drawn from a population-matching sample (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 498) of the US population to investigate how perceived political disagreement on social media affects decisions to unfollow and unfriend others through the induction of affective responses (e.g., anger, anxiety) and the role of psychological trait—need to belong. Controlling for demographics and political ideology, our mediation analysis revealed that perceived political disagreement was significantly related to anger, which was further positively associated with both unfollowing and unfriending on social media. Perceived political disagreement was also related to anxiety while anxiety was positively associated with individuals’ behaviors of unfollowing and unfriending. Furthermore, results showed that the need to belong played a significant role in moderating the relationship between perceived political disagreement and unfriending. When perceiving the same level of political disagreement, individuals with a higher need to belong were less likely to unfriend others on social media, compared to those with a lower need to belong. However, the need to belong did not exert a significant impact on how perceived political disagreement influenced unfollowing behavior. This study contributes to understanding the nuanced dynamics of disconnectivity on social media, particularly in navigating political disagreements.",

          "abstract": "&lt;span&gt;This thematic issue explores the global fact-checking field, focusing on its organizations, practices, and institutional dynamics. Over the past decade, fact-checking has expanded to over 400 organizations, with approximately half operating in the Global South. Fact-checkers have built a solid institutional framework featuring annual conferences, regulatory bodies, and partnerships with big techs and public organizations. Even with this cohesion, the fact-checking movement remains deeply heterogeneous. Organizations range from small local outlets to global media giants, operating within varied media and political systems. These differences shape how fact-checkers define their mission and approach misinformation, and offer a valuable lens for journalism and political communication studies to analyze evolving media systems and digitalization effects worldwide. Given such diversity, our issue addresses the need for research to observe regional and comparative perspectives on fact-checking alongside studies of broader global trends. Recent scholarship has focused on how fact-checkers adapt to diverse environments, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and how the field is evolving. It also examines fact-checkers' relationships with platform companies, policymakers, and transnational institutions combating misinformation. Contributions employing diverse methodologies, from case studies to large-scale content analyses, are included, with a particular emphasis on understanding organizational and contextual specificities in this crucial area of media and political communication.&lt;/span&gt;",

          "abstract": "Using internet shutdowns as a reaction to civil unrest has become a common response from the Indian state. In 2022, India remains at the top with the highest number of recorded shutdowns in the world, for the fifth consecutive year. Several state and central governments have used this tactic to suspend the flow of information, either to curtail the ability of citizens to organise through social media networks, dominate discourse around an event, or both. Many such instances have increased the circulation of misinformation, leading to polarised online spaces created partly due to the lack of internet connectivity. Digital disconnection then becomes a condition forced upon its citizens rather than a voluntary choice made by individuals. To explore the impact of internet shutdowns on civic discourse, I look at the case of the farmers’ protest in India, that lasted from September 2020 to November 2021. The movement successfully led to the repeal of the three controversial farm laws. The protest faced challenges due to internet shutdowns along with other forms of crackdown by authorities. I use in-depth interviews to bring in the voices of the various stakeholders who participated in this movement. In this article, I would like to place the farmers’ protest as a vantage point from where one can look at how the Indian state has used internet shutdowns to control dissent.",

Those who exit ultra-Orthodox Judaism often struggle with loss of social support while simultaneously increasing their use of social media. We conducted a cross-cultural survey among 1146 individuals who left ultra-Orthodox Judaism. Our findings show that escapist and avoidant coping through social media correlated with more negative mental health outcomes, while using social media to problem solve and perceiving oneself as giving and receiving social support correlated with more positive outcomes. Resilience negatively associated with escapist and avoidant styles of coping through social media. Some aspects of perceived social support had positive associations with resilience.

The results show positive within- and between-person effects of a preference for interacting with artificially intelligent systems (over humans) and the use of smart technology on digital relatedness as well as positive between-person effects of a sense of local community belonging. The positive effect of using smart technology was particularly evident for individuals with a lower or medium level of local community belonging.

          "abstract": "Recent studies have explored how the purveyors of problematic information can mobilize online crowds by tapping into positive feelings like amusement, belonging, and optimism. Unfortunately, it is not clear how such participation and emotions can also help communities reduce the spread of problematic information. We address this gap by examining how a group of Japanese social media “watchers” monitored and countered YamatoQ, a pro-QAnon Japanese conspiracy group. We analyze interviews with 12 watchers to make empirical contributions about the how, where, and why of their activities. Participants describe a playful approach to confronting problematic information, whereby they leverage a sense of improvisation, humor, and community to meet the challenges of their work. These results extend our knowledge of volunteer efforts to address problematic information, and expand the range of perspectives represented in the literature regarding the participatory and emotional aspects of problematic information.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the association of socioeconomic status (SES) and digital and AI literacy with types of Chat GPT use by college students, with subsequent implications for academic self-efficacy and creativity, conditioned by trust. Analyses of a survey of U.S. college students (N = 947) show that SES has a greater association with AI literacy than with general digital literacy. Two dimensions of Chat GPT activities emerge: academic support and displacement. Structural equation modeling reveals that AI literacy is positively associated with both activity dimensions, while digital literacy is unexpectedly a negative contributor. Further, academic support is strongly linked to positive outcomes whereas academic displacement is negatively associated. Attitudinal trust in Chat GPT moderates the overall relationships. Our findings suggest that conventional digital inequality persists and evolves with generative AI, traditional digital literacy becomes insufficient in the age of AI, and trust in this new and opaque digital technology influences these relationships.",

          "abstract": "Digital self-entrepreneurship has become one of the most popular career options among younger generations. However, limited attention has been paid to the relationships between socioeconomic differences and digital self-entrepreneurship among youths. Using an extended Bourdieusian framework, this article critically reassesses vloggers’ digital creative labour, conditions and decisions by conceptualising them as various outcomes of position-taking in the emerging field of digital cultural production, tied to socioeconomic differences. Based on interviews with YouTubers in Hong Kong, this study examines how class background shapes young vloggers’ career paths and future aspirations. The findings reveal their divergent class-inflected orientations towards the common tensions between (1) platform productivity and creative autonomy, (2) elite evaluation and mass rating and (3) career planning and an uncertain vlogging future. Shifting the focus to the nexus between class inequality and the platform creative economy, this article provides a nuanced account of digital creative work amid platform precarity and uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Depressive symptoms can spillover between romantic partners. From an attachment lens, depressive symptoms passing from one partner to another may be more frequent in the context of anxious attachment. Using 1179 German couples who remained together across 4 years (five waves) from the Panel Analysis on Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics, analyses tested the extent anxious attachment moderated the initial level of depressive symptom spillover between partners' depressive symptom trajectories. Results revealed that men's and women's higher initial depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with changes in their partners' depressive symptom trajectories. However, the current study found that women's anxious attachment was associated with the link between men's initial depressive symptoms and the trajectory of women's depressive symptoms. Specifically, women who were more anxiously attached had a small, but greater risk of experiencing increased depressive symptom spillover across a four‐year period when their male partners had higher initial depressive symptoms. Together, this suggests depressive symptom spillover did occur among a general population of German couples, but primarily in the context of more anxiously attached women. Future research should examine the role attachment plays in the depressive symptom spillover among couples.",

          "authors": "Grace Vieth, Alexander J. Rothman, Jeffry A. Simpson",
          "abstract": "Close relationships are associated with many positive outcomes throughout life, including improved physical health and well‐being. Traditionally, theory and research on the health benefits of close relationships have focused on either the total amount of support perceived available within a person's entire social network or the support provided by romantic partners (Shankar et al. in Psychology and Health , 30(6), 686–698; 2015). Limited work has examined the impact of distinct relationship types, particularly friends. In this article, we address this critical gap in our current knowledge. First, we identify the features of friends and friendship networks that distinguish them from other types of adult relationships, especially romantic relationships. Second, we use the strength and strain model (Slatcher &amp; Selcuk in Current Directions in Psychological Science , 26(1), 16–21; 2017) as a framework to consider how adult friendships might impact physical health in ways similar to but also distinct from romantic partners. Utilizing this specific model, we identify features of friendships—the size and structure of friendship networks, the norms that define friendships, and the levels of interdependence in friendships—and discuss how each feature can amplify or blunt the strengths and strains afforded by friends, including their impact on health. Finally, we provide a roadmap and identify priorities to advance research on friendships and physical health.",

Across three preregistered online studies ( Ns = 1,000), participants who read information about conspiracies involving agribiotechnology companies or biobank scientists were more likely to endorse conspiracies. Other effects of exposure to conspiracy information were mixed. In Study 1, reading about an agricultural biotechnology conspiracy had a small significant effect on reducing intentions to eat genetically modified food. In Study 2, exposure to a conspiracy involving biobank scientists decreased support for biobanks, mediated by decreased trust in biobank scientists. In Study 3, this conspiracy had no effect on wider beliefs of the role of science in society (science populism), nor support of genetically modified food-promoting policies. Overall, we found that exposure to conspiracies involving scientific claims increased conspiracy belief endorsement and can further negative effects. However, the effects of conspiracies on science populism appear limited.",

We conducted a lexicometric study of 343 French press articles with a hierarchical descending classification analysis and a correspondence analysis. Results indicate an evolution in the media treatment of human genome editing, from a popularization perspective to a focus on ethical and legislative aspects of genome editing.

          "abstract": "This study examines how social media platforms shape encounters with religious “others” across diverse cultural contexts, focusing on Muslim users in Pakistan and Buddhist/Christian users in Hong Kong. Through qualitative interviews and reflexive thematic analysis, we identify key patterns in how these platforms both facilitate and constrain meaningful interreligious dialogue. We find that while religious social media can expand exposure to diverse perspectives, it often reinforces in-group boundaries and amplifies polarization through echo chamber effects. Our findings further reveal that users engage in selective exposure, primarily interacting with like-minded believers, while also developing new competencies as “religious bridge-builders” in some cases who cultivate new competencies for interreligious communication. We develop a theoretical framework of “digital othering” to explain how believers navigate religious identity, knowledge, and community in online spaces. By adopting a cross-cultural comparative approach, the study contributes to our understanding of religion in the digital age, offering insights into the culturally specific manifestations of digital othering while also identifying broader patterns that transcend particular contexts. This research advances the field of digital religion studies, providing a nuanced understanding of how social media reshapes religious expression, authority, and interreligious relations in an increasingly digitized global society.",

          "authors": "Frederic Gerdon",
          "abstract": "With technological advances, governments and companies gain opportunities to collect data to provide public benefits. However, such data collections and uses need to fulfill ethical standards and comply with citizens’ privacy preferences, which may vary across several dimensions. The Comparative Privacy Research Framework suggests specific comparative dimensions that may shape such privacy-related perceptions. I propose how to integrate into this framework a specific meso-level perspective for concisely operationalizing data uses context-specifically: the privacy theory of contextual integrity, developed by Helen Nissenbaum. This article presents an empirical application of this approach by investigating specific data use scenarios across countries, while simultaneously considering temporal, international, and individual-level variation. To this end, an online survey experiment was conducted in three countries (Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom) in December 2022 and May 2023. In this experiment, respondents rated the appropriateness of fictitious data use scenarios. The scenarios varied by data type, data recipients, and conditions of data use. The results show that the effects of contextual parameters vary across countries to different degrees. Respondents react particularly sensitively to changes in data types, with health data being overall most accepted to be used. The relative acceptance of the data recipients clearly varies across countries. Country-level individualism is not consistently related to the desired level of control over data. These findings highlight the usefulness of contextual integrity to unmask meso-level, context-specific variations in privacy attitudes across countries. A meso-level perspective that operationalizes data uses according to contextual integrity can therefore inform comparative privacy research and privacy-related policymaking.",

          "authors": "Arne Freya Zillich, Annika Wunderlich",
          "abstract": "Social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat offer adolescents many opportunities to control how other users see and perceive them. By observing their peers’ self-presentations and receiving feedback on their own self-presentations from them, adolescents learn what is typical (descriptive norms) and appropriate (injunctive norms) on different social media platforms. Based on computer-assisted face-to-face surveys with German Instagram and/or Snapchat users aged between 14 and 16 years ( N = 1,002), we examined the impact of descriptive and injunctive norms on adolescents’ self-presentation practices on social media. Drawing on the theory of normative social behavior and the affordances approach, we also considered the norm-moderating factors of outcome expectations, group identity, platform differences, and perceived content persistence. We provide evidence that both descriptive and injunctive peer norms influence adolescents’ staged self-presentations, authentic self-presentations, and presentations of everyday life, although none of the moderating factors reached practical significance.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by an unprecedented influx of misinformation often with adverse impact on the effectiveness of institutional responses to the health crisis. However, relatively little is still known about the factors that may have facilitated the proliferation and public acceptance of misinformation related to the virus or to the government’s anti-pandemic measures, particularly in comparative perspective. Utilizing data collected by a representative cross-country survey ( N = 5,000) in four countries led by populist leaders during the pandemic—Brazil, Poland, Serbia, and the United States—this study explores the links between three mutually interrelated factors, namely media usage across different platforms, affinity to populism, and trust in scientific expertise, and people’s beliefs in selected COVID-related misinformation. The findings show that preexisting attitudes, especially affinity to populism and mistrust in experts, are generally stronger predictors of people’s likelihood to endorse misinformation related to the pandemic than their news consumption patterns. Nevertheless, the analysis also indicates an important role played by exposure to specific media brands, particularly those promoting a skeptical stance toward preventive measures and COVID-19 vaccines, as well as messaging apps, which display stronger relationship with misinformation beliefs than social networking sites. The article concludes by discussing implications for practical efforts to combat misinformation, especially during a health crisis.",

          "authors": "Magdalena Saldaña, Ximena Orchard, Sebastian Rivera, Guillermo Bustamante-Pavez",
          "abstract": "News consumption and voting behavior are interlinked and particularly important in elections where traditional political cleavages are not easily applicable. This relationship becomes more complex and uncertain in contexts of low trust in the news media and high levels of misinformation circulating in different news ecosystems. In this study, we test an indirect path between differentiated news media consumption and voting choices, mediated by belief in misinformation, and moderated by news media trust. Our data come from a two-wave panel survey of 1,332 respondents, conducted in Chile before and after the 2022 Constitutional Referendum, a political event that captured international attention after a constitutional proposal was rejected in a process initiated with high public support. Our analyses found that news media consumption significantly affected voting preferences in the referendum, not only indirectly through the acceptance of misinformation, but also directly, suggesting that news organizations might act, intentionally or not, as soundboards of misinformation. These findings suggest that countries with enough press freedom to rely on the news media to be informed but also a high concentration of ownership, topics, and angles covered, might become fertile soil for misinformation to spread in the form of professional news coverage, instead of fabricated, easy-to-spot fake pieces circulating in dubious websites or on social media.",

          "authors": "Miriam Kroman Brems",
          "abstract": "Many western democracies have witnessed an upsurge of partisan alternative media that explicitly challenge the legitimacy of mainstream media and politics alike and promote populist discourses. Accordingly, alternative media are often discussed in relation to lower levels of political trust and support for populist parties. Yet, only a limited number of studies have investigated these relationships empirically. Drawing on survey data representative of the Danish adult population ( n = 1,518) collected in January/February 2023, this study investigates how using alternative media is related to political trust, populist attitudes, and populist vote intentions. Unlike previous studies, it distinguishes between left-wing and right-wing alternative media users and finds notable differences: Users of right-wing alternative media have lower political trust, hold more populist attitudes, and have greater predicted probability of intending to vote for a right-wing populist party than non-users, but similar results were not found for users of left-wing alternative media. The study discusses potential explanations for this and how (different) alternative media might impact democracy.",
