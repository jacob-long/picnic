          "authors": "Jessica Houston Su, Kelly Musick",
          "abstract": "Early childbearing is associated with poor outcomes for parents and children, potentially exacerbating inequality within and across generations. Building on the structural sexism and health perspective, we argue that systemic gender inequality is a conceptually important—and understudied—factor in early childbearing. Using survey data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health ( N = 5,052 female respondents and 32,595 person-years) merged to state, county, and school characteristics, we investigate how exposure to structural sexism during adolescence shapes early childbearing. We measure structural sexism in institutional domains with state and county-level measures of economic, cultural, and reproductive health. We also generate a novel measure of structural sexism in interactional domains, capturing gendered expectations, power dynamics, and conservative religious beliefs among school peers. We find that institutional sexism is associated with a higher likelihood of early childbearing among young women racialized as Black, but not among those racialized as White. Interactional sexism is also a significant predictor of early childbearing, and is especially salient for adolescents as they turn to peers for social cues about gender roles. Our results underscore the importance of institutional and interactional forces for shaping families and raise questions about increasingly polarized gender climates post- Dobbs.",

          "title": "Can fertility decline help explain gender pay convergence?",
          "authors": "Alexandra Killewald, Nino José Cricco",
          "abstract": "Prior scholarship demonstrates that motherhood wage penalties and fatherhood wage premiums contribute to the gender pay gap. These analyses typically take a cross-sectional perspective, asking to what extent gender inequalities in the association between parenthood and wages can explain gender pay inequality for a given cohort or at a given moment in time. By contrast, explorations of gender pay convergence over time have tended to start at the firm’s door, testing the explanatory power of changes in men’s and women’s human capital and job characteristics and neglecting the contributions of fertility change. We bring these two strands of research together, asking to what extent declines 1980–2018 in US employees’ number of children can explain gender pay convergence over the same period. Using a descriptive decomposition and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we show that, in gross terms, fertility decline can explain almost one-quarter of gender pay convergence from 1980 to 2018. Even net of a host of controls for human capital and job characteristics, fertility decline explains 8 percent of the attenuation of the US gender pay gap 1980–2018—about half as much as changes in education and about a quarter as much as changes in full-time work experience and job tenure combined. Finally, we show that employees’ fertility decline was fastest in the 1980s and subsequently slowed; this, in conjunction with persistent gender differences in parenthood–wage associations, helps explain stalled progress toward gender pay parity.",

          "title": "Gender, Power, and Nonpreferred Contraceptive Use in the United States: Results from a National Survey",
          "authors": "Kristen Lagasse Burke, Laura Duberstein Lindberg",
          "abstract": "Power dynamics in social interactions likely affect individuals’ ability to use their preferred contraception, yet research has primarily emphasized financial barriers. Using data from a national survey of people assigned female at birth, we apply a social-ecological framework to assess a broader range of factors shaping nonpreferred use. Over one-quarter of respondents were not using their preferred method; among them, nearly half preferred vasectomy, condoms, or withdrawal. Partner disagreement was the most common reason for nonpreferred use and was associated with experiencing partner contraceptive coercion. Black women, who face structural racism in the health care system, were more likely to attribute their nonpreferred use to a provider’s recommendation. These findings demonstrate how gender and power shape contraceptive use despite the preferences of those at risk of pregnancy, highlighting the need for cultural, policy, and health care shifts to resolve contraceptive preference-use discordance and increase gender equity in the responsibility of pregnancy prevention.",

          "title": "The Significance of Name-Based Racial Composition in Analyzing Neighborhood Disparities",
          "authors": "Karl Vachuska",
          "abstract": "Contemporary sociological research emphasizes the need to analyze inequality beyond nominal categories. Although research has grown in this regard at the individual level, little research has pursued this approach with neighborhoods. This article explores how names can serve as a measure of the perceived typicality associated with race and how names are associated with neighborhood characteristics. Analyses on data with the names of over 300 million Americans demonstrate that name-based racial composition more fully explains socioeconomic disparities among neighborhoods than conventional survey-based racial composition metrics. Neighborhoods with the most Black-sounding names demonstrate greater socioeconomic disadvantage than neighborhoods with the most individuals self-identifying as Black. Additionally, naming patterns explain variation in socioeconomic inequality within both predominantly nominally Black neighborhoods and predominantly nominally White neighborhoods—where little nominal racial variation exists. This research suggests that infracategorical measures of race can provide additional predictive power to nominal measures of racial composition when analyzing neighborhood inequalities",
