          "title": "How Does Culture Matter for Attainment, and How Would We Know If It Did?",
          "authors": "David Brady, Aliza Luft, Ezra W. Zuckerman Sivan",
          "abstract": "In their 2022 ASR article, Horwitz, Matheny, Laryea, and Schnabel (HMLS 2022) argue that religious subculture significantly shapes educational stratification, emphasizing how Jewish subcultures, especially for young women, foster an education-enhancing “habitus and self-concept.” While commending their aim to identify “clear explanatory mechanisms” and avoid essentialist explanations, this Comment critiques HMLS’s methodology and conclusions, addressing the broader question: Can parental cultural socialization explain group-level differences in educational attainment? We identify four issues: mismeasurement of Jewish parentage, insufficient controls for social class, and two gaps in specifying and operationalizing cultural mechanisms. Re-analyzing the National Survey of Youth and Religion (NSYR), we show that HMLS’s findings remain stable after correcting Jewish parentage mismeasurement but shift substantially when better adjusting for social class. We argue that cultural explanations must meet two additional principles—portability and convertibility—to avoid lapsing into essentialism or reproducing “culture of poverty” narratives. These principles require that (a) social and cultural mechanisms function independently of group membership and be transferable across actors and fields, and (b) structural advantages and barriers are acknowledged and integrated. This Comment thus extends existing guidelines for analyzing the role of culture in stratification and offers a framework for identifying non-essentialist mechanisms driving group differences in attainment.",

          "authors": "Masha Krupenkin, Elad Yom-Tov, David Rothschild",
          "abstract": "How do protests affect Americans’ gun ownership decisions? Using a novel dataset of gun-related web searches in combination with geocoded protest data, we examine the effects of the 2020 Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests on Americans’ interest in firearm purchase. We find a clear relationship between geographic proximity to BLM protests and firearm purchase web searches, but a null relationship between these searches and proximity to re-opening protests. We then examine racial attitudes of would-be gun buyers using users’ web search histories and find that users exposed to racially conservative narratives had significantly larger spikes in gun purchase interest during the 2020 BLM protests than did other comparable searchers. These results suggest that Black civil rights protests can serve as a catalyst for gun purchase interest.",

          "title": "Shifting partnership ideals with online technologies among unmarried women in India",
          "authors": "Luca Maria Pesando, Koyel Sarkar, Sabino Kornrich",
          "abstract": "This study complements existing scholarship in family sociology and digital demography by investigating the role of digital technologies in shaping partnership ideals among unmarried women in India. We build on the premise that, by means of faster communication, effective information dissemination, and reciprocal exchange of norms and ideals, recurrent exposure to globalized cultural scripts through the Internet may shape family-related outcomes such as views and opinions regarding different aspects of family life. Leveraging new data from a primary survey of unmarried, partnered women living in cities across twenty states, we find that daily Internet use is positively and significantly associated with modern partnership ideals, measured as secularized views on the choice of a partner, the importance of marriage, partner preferences, and views about love marriage. Moreover, we show that accessing the Internet independently—vis-à-vis through a shared device—is what matters the most, and that results are stronger among high-educated individuals. We assess the selectivity of the sample by conducting subgroup analyses and replicating our findings on the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2019–2021. Lastly, we offer evidence that these findings can be deemed causal, complementing our results with an instrumental-variable approach leveraging digital geographical information. Our findings reveal that digital technologies may be gradually contributing to shifting views about marriage and family formation, even in a context such as India, which has traditionally exhibited strong resistance to modernization forces, at least in the realm of the family.",

          "authors": "Rodolfo Disi Pavlic, Rodrigo M Medel, Matías Bargsted, Nicolás M Somma",
          "abstract": "We examine the relationship between proximity to actively policed protest events and people’s willingness to justify violence against police forces. Focusing on the Chilean social uprising, a series of massive protests between 2019 and 2020, this study highlights the significant implications of law enforcement issues on government legitimacy and the potential for protest policing to escalate violence. To conduct our research, we use a difference-in-differences design that combines survey data with georeferenced data on protests that experienced active policing near survey respondents. Our results show that spatial and temporal proximity to such protests significantly increases people’s willingness to justify violence. Additionally, this effect is not uniform across all ideological groups. Exposure to protests with active policing strongly affects centrists, whereas it is negligible for leftists, rightists, and independents. Different robustness checks largely support a causal link between proximity to actively policed protests and justification of violence against the police. These insights contribute to our understanding of how mass mobilizations and state responses influence public attitudes, emphasizing the nuanced impact of protest policing on different ideological segments of society.",

          "title": "Educational expansion reforms and intergenerational educational mobility in Norway",
          "authors": "Adrian Farner Rogne, Siri Frisli",
          "abstract": "The latter half of the 20th century was marked by a massive expansion of higher educational systems in many Western countries. This development provided greater educational opportunities, resulted in a marked increase in educational attainment, and has been attributed as an important factor behind increased intergenerational educational mobility. Most previous studies of these developments are based on analyses of aggregate trends in educational attainment and mobility and overlook the geographical dimension of educational expansions. The geographic location of colleges and the local availability of higher educational institutions may have had important impacts on local patterns of intergenerational educational mobility. We study the impacts of major educational expansion reforms that took place between 1969 and 1993 in Norway and resulted in a massive decentralization of higher educational opportunities. Combining recent developments in differences-in-differences methodology, detailed data on the establishment and upgrading of such institutions, and population-wide register data on social origins and educational attainment, we study the effects of the establishment and upgrading of local colleges on educational mobility. Results suggest that these improvements in local educational opportunities had little to no impact on intergenerational educational mobility locally. We discuss our findings in light of the Norwegian welfare state context.",

          "abstract": "Linkages between surveys and administrative data provide an important opportunity for social and health research, but such linkages often require the informed consent of respondents. We use experimental data collection across five different samples to study how consent decisions are made. More reflective decision processes are associated with higher rates of consent, greater comprehension of the proposed data linkage, and greater confidence in the decision, but only about a third of respondents report using a reflective decision process. This suggests that the provision of additional information is unlikely to lead to significant improvements in informed consent.",

          "abstract": "This article proposes some new measures of intergenerational persistence based on the idea of characterizing the memory of origin in the stochastic process that links the socioeconomic classes of parents and children. We introduce “memory curves” for all future generations given any initial condition of class for a family dynasty, which reveal how initial conditions interact with the transition process between parents and children to create mobility and persistence. We also propose ways to aggregate information across different classes to produce overall characterizations of mobility in the population. To illustrate our measures, we estimate occupational “memory curves” using U.S. survey data. Our findings show that, on average, the memory of initial conditions dissipates largely within three generations, though there is meaningful heterogeneity in mobility rates across dynasties originating from different occupational classes.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on interviews with 65 people experiencing homelessness (PEH) in Victoria, British Columbia (Canada), this article examines the role and impact of municipal by-laws’ daily governance of PEH and their possessions. We argue PEH’s possessions are a site of governance that by-law officers use to exert both punitive control and responsibilization onto PEH’s lives. We show how the daily governance of possessions enhances and reinforces existing strategies of displacement and motion and illuminate how forms of governance tied to the movement of PEH can be simultaneously experienced as both routinized and random when subjectively enforced.",
