          "title": "How Values and Uncertainty Shape Scientific Advance in Peer Review",
          "authors": "Daniel Scott Smith, Neha Nayak Kennard, Tianyu Du, Daniel A. McFarland",
          "abstract": "Tens of thousands of scientists contribute to peer review as journal editors and reviewers of the millions of manuscripts submitted every year. How do they decide what is quality work? What values do they apply in evaluating which science merits publication and which does not? How do they respond to dissensus and uncertainty? Who has the greatest influence over the final outcome? This study combines close reading with large language models to analyze 80,000 reviews of 28,000 accepted and rejected manuscripts in engineering and the life sciences. By following reviewers’ value judgments and editorial decisions, we come to a different view of how epistemic cultures are practiced in journal science. Instead of a consensual dialogue revealing salient norms, we find reviewers differently weigh (“commensurate”) their judgments to attribute value to works. Their pluralistic viewpoints elevate uncertainty about the work, and editors respond by aligning with the most negative of reviewers. Surprisingly, we observe engineers and life scientists find the same epistemic criteria are salient, valued, and influential, with novelty and accuracy being primary. These results underscore how contingency and uncertainty are structural features of STEM peer review and essential to its effectiveness and legitimacy.",

          "title": "How Religious Subcultures Interact with Gender to Shape Educational Trajectories: A Rejoinder to Brady, Luft, and Zuckerman Sivan",
          "authors": "Ilana M. Horwitz, Kaylee T. Matheny, Krystal Laryea, Landon Schnabel",
          "abstract": "We respond to Brady, Luft, and Zuckerman Sivan’s critique of how religious subcultures—particularly Jewish upbringing—shape educational attainment. Their reanalysis, while differently specified, reinforces our central finding: adolescents with Jewish upbringing demonstrate higher rates of college completion and selective institution attendance. We defend our use of a multidimensional SES index—including income, education, and occupational prestige—grounded in stratification research, and we consider the theoretical and empirical utility of their proposed alternatives. Yet their replication overlooks the qualitative evidence central to our argument: the role of self-concept congruence, or the alignment between one’s identity and educational trajectory. Among girls with at least one Jewish parent, we find that attending a selective college is not simply an instrumental goal but part of who they envision themselves becoming. This congruence is shaped by a habitus rooted not only in social class but also in Jewish upbringing. In contrast, similarly positioned non-Jewish peers do not express the same identity-education alignment. We also respond to their concern that our work risks essentialism or reflects “culture of poverty” arguments. Our study explicitly avoids attributing educational outcomes to ascribed group identity. Instead, we identify clear, transferable mechanisms, including habitus and self-concept congruence, through which religious subcultures influence educational trajectories. These mechanisms are socially transmitted, shaped by family culture and broader structural contexts, and portable across groups and settings. By addressing these critiques, we contribute to debates about how culture shapes stratification without reducing outcomes to group-based determinism.",

          "authors": "Yifeng Wan",
          "abstract": "Who receives child custody—mother, father, or both—offers insight into family institutions and gender dynamics. Analyzing over 220,000 digitized divorce decrees from China’s patrilineal family system, this study reveals a paradox: despite mothers serving as primary caregivers, fathers more frequently obtain custody. Two institutional pillars of patrilineage explain this outcome. First, paternal grandparents commonly assume childcare responsibilities as fathers’ proxies, reducing mothers’ custody prospects. Second, fathers’ predominant ownership of the marital home creates additional barriers for mothers seeking custody. This paternal advantage intensifies in cases involving sons and in rural areas. Among families with multiple children, split custody arrangements predominate, typically allocating sons to fathers and daughters to mothers. These findings illuminate the interplay between family law, patrilineal tradition, and gender inequality.",

          "authors": "Irem Tuncer-Ebetürk, Jessica Kim, Yasemin Nuhoğlu Soysal",
          "abstract": "In the past three decades, the global diagnosis rate of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has grown drastically. While existing sociological studies demonstrate the complexity of ADHD diagnoses and treatment in specific national contexts, their ability to explain ADHD’s global growth is limited. In this article, starting from a macro-sociological perspective and drawing on world society theory, we empirically investigate the prevalence of ADHD diagnosis rates across 135 countries from 1996 to 2019. We find that the increasing rates of ADHD diagnosis worldwide since the 1990s are linked to two interconnected global cultural processes: (1) the global rise and institutionalization of child-centered cultural perspectives and (2) the global diffusion of narratives that define ADHD as a health condition impairing children’s well-being and development. Our findings do not support alternative explanations such as a nation’s level of development (measured by GDP, poverty, democracy, and tertiary enrollment rates) or healthcare quality and universal access. These findings highlight the substantial influence of global conceptions of childhood and health on ADHD prevalence rates worldwide, while downplaying the importance of national conditions. We contribute to the existing sociological literature on ADHD in two key ways. First, by conducting the first cross-national, longitudinal study of ADHD worldwide we provide novel insights about ADHD prevalence at the world level while identifying the key global factors driving this trend. Second, in merging the existing ADHD literature with the analytical frameworks advanced by world society theory, we introduce a new conceptualization of ADHD as not only a medical disability but also a global cultural phenomenon and institutional priority.",

          "title": "Blending in or moving on? Immigrant coworkers, assimilation, and employee turnover",
          "authors": "Edvard Nergård Larsen, Aleksander Å Madsen, Are Skeie Hermansen",
          "abstract": "How does the presence of immigrant coworkers shape the likelihood that minority employees stay or leave their jobs? This study uses linked employer–employee administrative data covering the entire Norwegian labor market to investigate how workplace immigrant concentration influences turnover among immigrants and their native-born children. Building on theories of organizational demography, we ask whether working alongside a higher share of immigrant-background coworkers fosters employee retention—consistent with mechanisms of social contact and homophily—or instead prompts workplace exit, as suggested by group threat and competition theories. Our findings reveal that greater representation of immigrant-background coworkers significantly reduces turnover among immigrants, especially when contact occurs within same-skill occupations. The exposure effects reducing the likelihood of workplace exit are also stronger when immigrant-background employees share the same national origin with their minority coworkers and when minorities are better represented among top earners in the organization. For children of immigrants, the effects of coworker composition are weaker, consistent with theories of assimilation and the weakening of ethnic boundaries across generations. Taken together, these results support social contact theories, which claim that a more inclusive work environment and coworker support in more ethnically diverse workplace contexts foster organizational attachment and reduce turnover among immigrant-background minority employees. However, minority employees’ increased retention in organizations with higher immigrant concentration may also reinforce patterns of ethnic workplace segregation.",

          "title": "Conceptualizing Affective Climate Polarization",
          "authors": "Emily Huddart, Tony Silva, Parker Muzzerall, Sophia Dimitrakopoulos",
          "abstract": "Existing research demonstrates that liberals are more likely than conservatives to endorse climate policies. Scholars attribute this to differences in worldviews, elite cues, and misinformation. But political divisions are also emotional, as evidenced by partisans’ increasingly disliking one another. Recent work extends this pattern beyond political identity to the domain of issue-based polarization. The authors apply these insights to the sociology of climate change, advancing the concept of affective climate polarization to situate climate attitudes as expressions of social identity and group affiliation. Drawing on original survey data from a nationally representative probability sample ( n = 2,503), the authors examine how supporters and opponents of decarbonization evaluate each other on dimensions of emotional warmth. Supporters and opponents both express in-group favoritism and outgroup dislike, patterns indicative of polarization. Supporters’ animosity appears driven by frustration at opponents’ resistance to endorsing policy to mitigate climate change. Opponents’ animosity seems to be driven by frustration at being morally judged for their climate attitudes. The authors argue that climate attitudes are increasingly tied to identity-based boundary-making, whereby individuals perceive those with opposing climate views as members of morally distinct (and suspect) groups. This contributes to theorizing climate politics as a site of social conflict, boundary-making, and emotionally grounded group differentiation.",

          "title": "Racial Gaps in Career Mobility during the Great Migration",
          "authors": "Dirk Witteveen",
          "abstract": "The author investigates whether the Great Migration closed or mitigated racial disparities in career advancement. Using linked historical census data, tracking individuals from the early twentieth century, the author analyzes the occupational mobility of Black and White men who came of age during the Great Migration. The author uses two longitudinal analyses of occupational status over a 30-year period (e.g., 1900–1930 and 1910–1940) to compare career trajectories across racial and migratory groups. The results show that Black men who left the Jim Crow South for northern states—rapidly growing industrial areas in particular—experienced the same level of career mobility as those who remained in the South. Furthermore, northern Black men attained higher occupational status than southern Black men who had migrated to the North, indicative of a career mobility ceiling experienced by Black migrants. While starting their careers at different occupational levels, White men enjoyed significantly greater career mobility in both the South and the North. These findings imply that the Great Migration, despite escaping the worst versions of Jim Crow, maintained racial gaps in career mobility. This descriptive longitudinal account of occupational attainment underscores the durable impact of racialized opportunity structures even amid economic modernization.",
