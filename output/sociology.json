          "title": "Same Policy, No Standardized Outcome: How Admissions Values and Institutional Priorities Shape the Effect of Test-Optional Policies on Campus Diversity",
          "authors": "Greta Hsu, Amanda Sharkey",
          "abstract": "Standardized tests were introduced to U.S. higher education as systematic, neutral measures of students’ intellect. Over time, they became central gatekeeping tools in the college admissions process. However, these tests have faced growing criticism for reinforcing inequality and privileging structurally advantaged students, leading many colleges to eliminate them as admissions requirements. In this study, we extend insights from institutional theory and the study of higher education to develop a novel theory of how the potential diversity benefits of test-optional admissions are contingent upon institutional definitions of merit and competing financial priorities. More specifically, we argue that admissions offices’ claims regarding which criteria are most important to thinking about and evaluating merit can shape the outcomes of test-optional policies in systematic ways. Using data from several sources, including the National Center for Education Statistics’ Integrated Postsecondary Education System and the College Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges, we find that, while eliminating requirements generally leads to an increase in enrollment of underrepresented minority students, this effect is significantly reduced at institutions that continue to strongly value quantitative academic metrics in evaluations of merit. Moreover, when alternative institutional priorities such as financial pressures rise, diversity increases from test-optional policies tend to decline. These findings are especially salient in 2025, as institutions face mounting legal and political restrictions on diversity-related practices. Our findings suggest that the impact of policies like test-optional admissions—once viewed as viable alternatives to race-conscious practices—may be limited unless accompanied by shifts in how institutions define and reward merit.",

          "abstract": "The Network Scale-up Method (NSUM) uses social networks and answers to “How many X’s do you know?” questions to estimate sizes of groups excluded by standard surveys. This paper addresses the bias caused by varying average social network sizes across populations, commonly referred to as the degree ratio bias. This bias likely exists for all populations, resulting in either positively or negatively biased population size estimates. We show how the degree ratio affects size estimates and provide a method to estimate degree ratios without collecting additional data. We demonstrate that our adjustment procedure improves the accuracy of NSUM size estimates using simulations and data from two data sources.",

          "title": "Navigating the Labor Market among People Who Use Drugs: Qualitative Evidence from a Justice-Involved Sample",
          "authors": "Mike Vuolo, Anneliese Ward, Lesley E. Schneider",
          "abstract": "Given substantially higher substance use rates among justice-involved people and that employers are largely protected from disqualifying people who use drugs, the U.S. Department of Labor called for incorporation of substance use recovery into the “second chance” hiring framework for individuals with criminal records. Despite this call and a sizable literature on applicants navigating the market with a criminal record, the labor market experiences among the subset who use substances has not been directly studied. The authors address this research gap using 43 in-depth interviews with people with criminal records in central Ohio who use substances. With substance use taking primacy over possessing a record, two thematic approaches emerged. First, participants remained in the formal labor market by restricting applications to employers not conducting drug screens, along with avoiding triggering jobs and using evasion techniques. Second, participants described disconnecting from the labor market while using, either generating illegal income or describing addiction as too all encompassing to work. These results demonstrate that the restrictive labor market for people with criminal records is further limited among those who use substances and how substance use can prohibit labor market attachment. The authors describe implications for employment policy and the punitive nature of substance use control.",

          "title": "Political Ideology and American Attitudes Toward Police Reform: The Case of the Conflicted Conservative",
          "authors": "Jonathan C. Reid, Samantha J. Brown, Kwan-Lamar Blount-Hill",
          "abstract": "Amid recent controversies in American policing, the authors draw on insights from political science to explore the case of “conflicted conservatives,” Americans who self-identify as conservative but who are operationally liberal in policy preferences. Compared with other political collectives, conflicted conservative attitudes are theorized to be driven primarily by utilitarian concerns about social conditions and government performance rather than by symbolic beliefs. This orientation is believed to enable the group to wield disproportionate influence on elections and public policy, acting as decisive swing voters. The authors use data from Harvard University’s Cooperative Election Study ( n = 39,174) to examine support for police reform among conflicted conservatives and other ideological groups. The findings indicate that the views of conflicted conservatives toward reforming the police differ from those of “consistent conservatives,” who are both symbolically and operationally conservative. However, the findings reveal that conflicted conservatives do not show special regard for utilitarian concerns over symbolic beliefs. These findings collectively highlight the complexity of contemporary political ideology and underscore the need for further inquiry into the social policy preferences of emerging and established ideological groups.",

          "title": "Beyond a Monoracial Paradigm: Parents Practicing Racial Humility in the Racial Socialization of Mixed-Race Children",
          "authors": "Katherine Johnson",
          "abstract": "Interracial parents face unique challenges in racially socializing their mixed-race children, but this socialization is imperative to their overall well-being and self-esteem. Using critical multiracial theory, the author argues that the interracial parents included in this study overwhelmingly understand the harm of promoting a monoracial paradigm of race when raising their children. They demonstrate this by implementing racial humility in their socialization practices to support and encourage the formation of a positive racial identity in their children. Drawing upon in-depth, semistructured interviews with 19 sets of interracial parents in the United States, the author identifies four themes related to how parents practice racial humility: (1) allowing their children to explore their mixed-race backgrounds by not forcing them to “pick a side,” (2) using specific language to identify children’s unique racial background, (3) encouraging ethnic and cultural engagement through bilingualism, and (4) exposing children to toys and media that feature mixed-race characters and a spectrum of skin tones. This study contributes to literature examining racial socialization practices of multiracial families and expands the concept of “racial humility” to sociology.",
