          "title": "Rationality or Relationality in Life and Death: Regulating Organ Donation in Singapore and Taiwan",
          "authors": "Wan-Zi Lu",
          "abstract": "Lawmakers often attempt to settle conflicting values. However, we know little about how regulatory reasoning influences organizational practices and shapes the conditions under which people respond. This article examines unexpected outcomes of deceased organ donation in Singapore and Taiwan, whose governments have had to address cultural and emotional resistance to the practice. Adopting an opt-out law, Singapore created a larger pool of legal organ donors yet generated worse donation outcomes than Taiwan, whose opt-in regulation has resulted in a smaller pool of potential organ donors. Drawing from interviews and archival research to solve this puzzle, I argue that moral infrastructure—the regulation-endorsed organizational arrangements to tackle cultural and emotional tensions—determines whether and when people change their minds regarding shared cultural norms. Singapore’s regulation prioritizes instrumental rationality and generates efficiency-driven organizational practices. These practices lead to affective circumvention , sidestepping emotions to expedite organ procurement and, in turn, prompting patients’ families to withdraw from hospital care. By contrast, in Taiwan, relational reasoning creates arrangements that promote affective coordination , a process that empowers intermediaries to work with grieving families and morally reframe donation. An institutionalized emphasis on relationality fosters cooperation and provides opportunities to re moralize a contested practice.",

          "title": "Rethinking migrant reception in the age of color-blind racism: an experimental approach",
          "authors": "Michael Middleton",
          "abstract": "A large and robust literature has emerged in recent years that looks at the acceptance of migrants into Western countries. Surprisingly, these studies have consistently found that residents in Western countries accept non-White migrants at virtually the same level as White migrants. Missing from these studies is an engagement with racism in its modern form, which is often more “color-blind,” or hidden, rather than overtly expressed, and thus can be more difficult to capture. In this study, I ask the following questions: (1) What role do racialization processes play in attitudes toward migrants? and (2) Do these processes vary across different questions of acceptance? To answer these questions, this study utilizes Duboisian insight to argue that, while White attitudes toward non-White migrants may be positive in the abstract, when Whites are forced to give up their symbolic and material power in the process, this positive reception wanes. The study utilizes a conjoint design experimental online survey to test the acceptance of migrants applying for refugee status across multiple outcomes: (1) legal acceptance, which measures the acceptance across the physical border, and (2) symbolic acceptance, which measures the acceptance into American society. These findings replicate prior research in finding no significant difference between the legal acceptance of White and non-White migrants among White respondents. However, when the acceptance outcome becomes symbolic, this parity dissipates. This study contributes to the literature by adding a symbolic layer to migrant acceptance in the United States, an important distinction in the era of color-blind racism.",

          "authors": "Berenike Firestone, Ruth Ditlmann, Oguzhan Turkoglu",
          "abstract": "Awareness of past atrocities is widely seen as critical for restoring justice and building resilient democracies. Cultural representations are often deployed by cultural elites to keep the past alive. Yet, we know little about how ordinary citizens respond to them. Through a survey experiment (n = 2198), we measured the effect of three different prototypical cultural representations of the Holocaust on intentions to commemorate the Holocaust, intentions to counter antisemitism, and attitudes towards minoritized groups. We find that all three forms demonstrate overall effectiveness in motivating individuals in support of commemoration and against antisemitism and improving their attitudes towards minoritized groups. We find heterogeneous treatment effects by party affiliation. For far-right supporters, reading about the story of an individual victim is particularly effective. For others, representations that center the sheer extent of atrocities or focus on symbolic justice efforts show a greater effect on action intentions. We repeated the survey with the same respondents three months later (November 2023), following the start of the Israel–Gaza war, and found that means and treatment effects remained overall stable despite the change in context. The results demonstrate the power of cultural representations of historical injustice for motivating people to take action and reducing their prejudice today.",

          "abstract": "Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption, developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study 2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking method.",

          "authors": "Kimberly McErlean",
          "abstract": "In the context of women’s increased economic status coupled with declining divorce rates, the “gender revolution framework” suggests that greater gender equality in the division of labor has contributed to the stability of contemporary marriages. Yet recent research on this topic is not in consensus that this is the case. This study uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to test the hypothesis that progress toward gender egalitarianism, and associated changes in the relationship between the division of labor and divorce, is bifurcated across levels of education in the highly stratified United States. The results indicate modest support for the idea that the college educated have been vanguards of the progression of the gender revolution, but also that different forms of gender egalitarianism may have emerged across groups. Among college-educated couples, gender egalitarian and gender-specialized arrangements have similar risks of divorce in recent years, in line with an egalitarian essentialist perspective. Among less educated couples, results suggest that progress toward gender equality in paid labor may reflect economic need rather than shifting gender norms. Together, these findings illustrate how structural and cultural changes in the organization of work and family life have played out differently across levels of education.",

          "title": "Institutional Decline and Resilient Belief: Understanding Secularization in Latin America",
          "authors": "Matthew Blanton",
          "abstract": "A large body of literature analyzes trends of religious decline across Western Europe and North America. Often rooted in secularization theory—the idea that modernization reduces religious beliefs and practice—this research lacks attention to global, comparative contexts. In this study, the author addresses that gap by examining religious trends spanning two decades across 17 Latin American countries to analyze changes in religious affiliation, church attendance, and religious importance. The author demonstrates that institutional religiosity, measured by affiliation and church attendance, is declining, whereas personal religiosity, measured by religious importance, remains resilient and is even increasing. This fragmented secularization is distinct from patterns observed in Western Europe and the United States. Further analyses highlight additional differences, showing that religious dimensions in Latin America are less tightly correlated and that the religiously unaffiliated maintain stronger religious beliefs and practices than their counterparts in the West. To account for this divergence, the author integrates insights from the neosecularization paradigm with Latin American theories of popular religiosity and lived religion. This synthesis provides a more precise framework for understanding secularization in Latin America and offers a model for applying secularization theory to non-Western contexts, in which modernization unfolds in diverse ways.",

          "abstract": "The coronavirus pandemic drastically reshaped how much of society functioned. Most of these changes were unfortunate in some way, but one change welcomed by many was the student loan repayment pause. This pause was enacted as relief given the pandemic’s effects on the economy and people’s financial standing. Approximately 35 million borrowers qualified and received, at least temporarily, not only some financial but also emotional respite from the heavy burden of debt. How was the repayment pause received emotionally by Latinx millennial borrowers? How did these borrowers feel before and then during the pause? Drawing on interviews from two waves of data collection—one in 2018 and another in 2022—the authors found an increased sense of agency among borrowers as well as an expanded spectrum of emotions, ranging from positive feelings of optimism to a more critical analysis of the student loan system during the repayment pause.",

          "abstract": "Does exposure to migrant death alter immigration-related public opinion? Scholarship has extensively demonstrated the impact of events on attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. In doing so, however, focus has almost exclusively been placed on events that pose a direct threat to ingroup members. The authors extend this line of research to further comprehend the formative basis of the said attitudes by focusing on events that uncover the threats outgroup members are subjected to, such as migrant shipwrecks. The authors examine one of the deadliest migrant shipwrecks that have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea in recent history, the so-called 2013 Lampedusa shipwreck, in which at least 368 migrants lost their lives. Using Italian data from the European Social Survey (round 6), the authors show that in the aftermath of the event, attitudes toward immigration changed, and Italians became more willing to adopt a less restrictive immigration policy. However, attitudes toward immigrants remained unchanged: the levels of perceived ethnic threat were not altered. These findings not only expand on the prevailing understanding of the effect of salient migration events on immigration-related attitudes but also highlight the divergent formative basis of these attitudes.",
