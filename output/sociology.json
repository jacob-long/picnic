          "authors": "Amy Kroska, Sarah K. Harkness, Kelsey N. Mattingly, Mollie A. Lovera",
          "abstract": "Many studies suggest that people discriminate against individuals with a mental illness. Despite these generally robust patterns, however, variability in the results from laboratory experiments examining competence-based discrimination leaves questions about the specific diagnoses that elicit the discrimination and gender differences in the discriminatory behavior. Therefore, we revisit this question with a design aimed at clarifying some of the ambiguities. We examine the effects of two diagnoses (schizophrenia and depression) and a nonpsychiatric health problem (the need for leg surgery). As with other laboratory studies, we examine if and how a teammate’s psychiatric diagnosis affects participants’ willingness to accept the teammate’s problem-solving suggestions in a two-person task group. But we go beyond the previous studies by crossing the teammate gender with participant gender and by exploring the robustness in our results by examining the moderating role of numerous participant attributes (e.g., education, social desirability, parents’ education, age, political liberalism, three gender ideology scales, trust in others). We find that participants discriminate against teammates with both types of psychiatric diagnoses but not against teammates with the nonpsychiatric health problem and that this pattern is highly robust: The processes are almost entirely unrelated to teammate gender and participant attributes, including participant gender. Together, these results suggest that both schizophrenia and depression elicit competence-based discrimination, that these processes differ very little by participants’ demographic and attitudinal attributes, and that the status beliefs underlying this discrimination may be fairly uniform.",

          "abstract": "The authors visualize how implicit racial bias at the collective level varies across European countries and how it changed between 2009 and 2019. To obtain population-level estimates, the authors re-weight implicit association test data from the Project Implicit international dataset ( n = 184,745). Implicit bias against Black people is stronger in southern and eastern vis-à-vis northern and western European countries. It decreased until the mid-2010s but started to increase thereafter.",

          "abstract": "The #MeToo movement illustrated how higher-ups may abuse their power by engaging in sexual harassment and generated heightened concern about hierarchical workplace romantic relationships. In a survey experiment, the authors test whether sexual attention from a superordinate outside one’s reporting chain (desired or not) leads to stereotyping and resultant career penalties. A woman employee who reported sexual harassment was seen as less warm and more attention seeking and cutthroat but also more assertive and willing to speak truth to power, although some perceptions varied by the harassment type. A woman who declared a romantic relationship with a superordinate was viewed as less committed to the organization. This stereotyping did not translate to workplace penalties apart from a marginally significant raise penalty against the woman who reported unwanted sexual advances. However, the authors find that experiencing sexual attention from a superordinate, whether desired or not, is damaging to working women’s reputations.",

          "authors": "Ryan Fajardo",
          "abstract": "Reporting suggests that declining salaries cause high multiple job holding (MJH) among full-time public school teachers in the United States. Studies investigating this relationship assume an individual teacher, neglecting the effects of family characteristics on work behavior. This article examines K–12 public school teachers’ employment patterns for March and July from 2011 to 2019 to test the associations of state-level teacher salaries and familial roles with MJH. In March and July, a teacher’s familial role correlates with MJH in a pattern consistent with persistent work-family divisions: Male teachers, single or married with children, are the most likely to hold another job, and married female teachers with children are the least. These differences increase during the summer break. State-level salaries correlate with MJH only in July. Single male teachers exhibit greater sensitivity to salary changes. This article demonstrates how family characteristics, occupational schedules, and salaries interact and influence MJH.",

          "authors": "Esther Chan, Di Di",
          "abstract": "Researchers have explored the relationship between religiosity and people’s gendered perspectives within the private sphere. However, there is limited research on how religiosity relates to people’s gendered perspectives in the public sphere. The authors examine the association between religiosity and the view that men make better leaders than women in two public spheres, politics and business, and explore variations by national context. Drawing on data collected in 44 national contexts, the analysis reveals that individuals with higher religious attendance are more inclined to support men’s leadership over women’s leadership in both political and business domains. Notably, this relationship is nuanced by a country’s level of economic development. Greater religiosity is associated with greater support for men’s leadership in more economically developed countries, whereas the reverse occurs in countries with lower economic development. The findings urge a more critical examination of religion’s role in shaping global perspectives on gender equity.",

          "authors": "Jon Overton, Michelle D. Fretwell, Kevin Weng, Christopher P. Dum",
          "abstract": "Existing research shows that first-person narratives can reduce exclusionary attitudes against marginalized groups. In this article, we test how they might mitigate stigma against formerly incarcerated people. We outline two mechanisms: (1) signaling, wherein sharing an autobiographical narrative improves others’ perception of oneself, and (2) role-taking, wherein the content of the narrative leads the audience to see themselves in the author’s place, thereby changing their evaluation of the author. We test these mechanisms using data from a vignette-based online experiment. We examine how a sample of college students respond to a hypothetical classmate who discloses a history of incarceration. Overall, we find support for the signaling mechanism. We also find that desired social distance falls primarily because the narrative increases the classmate’s perceived warmth (e.g., sincerity, trustworthiness, friendliness, etc.). Findings suggest advocates and institutions should create opportunities to obtain and present credentials and skills that will credibly signal warmth.",
