          "authors": "Mustafa Emirbayer",
          "abstract": "Despite being an uncommon topic in sociological inquiry, collective defense mechanisms are a widely known phenomenon in social life. Whenever people experience anxieties in common, shared defensive processes can arise at an unconscious level, shunting off these anxieties from reflective awareness. This can happen in social and organizational settings that are intimate and impersonal, small and large, short-lived and enduring. How can we better theorize collective defenses and their role in the social world? This article demonstrates how coordination mechanisms can align individual defenses into shared defenses, a micro-to-macro transition. It explores how collective defenses can take on a variety of empirical forms, whether as interaction-order dynamics, cultural discourses and narratives, or institutionalized rules and arrangements. And it shows how this understanding of collective defenses can be incorporated into still larger frameworks of inquiry into power and inequality in social life. It also suggests ways in which methodological innovations can help the study of these shared defenses become more transparent, nonarbitrary, and rigorous, allaying concerns sociologists long have had about investigating unconscious processes. By highlighting the formation, deployment, and potential undoing of collective defense mechanisms, this article illuminates an exciting new terrain for sociologists to explore and opens up new possibilities for more constructive and non-defensive real-world problem solving.",

          "title": "Abortion Policies in a Polarizing World Society, 1970 to 2020",
          "authors": "Wade M. Cole",
          "abstract": "This article examines how global contention over reproductive rights influenced national abortion polices over the past half-century. I glean four models of normative contestation in world society and its consequences for diffusion and institutionalization, arguing that a theory of polarization best accounts for developments in norms and policies on abortion. Fixed-effects regression analyses of up to 160 countries between 1970 and 2020 test the empirical implications of this argument. Several noteworthy findings emerge. First, country linkages to international nongovernmental organization (INGOs) predict abortion liberalization, but memberships in “illiberal” international organizations and alliances are associated with more restrictive abortion policies. Second, these relationships are conditioned by a shifting global context: in recent years, the association between illiberal affiliations and policy restrictions strengthened, while the liberalizing effect of INGOs weakened. And third, illiberal affiliations disrupt or “spoil” the effect of INGO linkages on policy expansions, illustrating the consequences of mutual engagement between rival transnational networks. Similar patterns characterize the effects of women’s and pro-family INGOs on abortion policies in the post–Cold War period. These findings point to growing polarization between liberal and illiberal forces in world society and suggest the incipient institutionalization of rival norms on abortion.",

          "title": "Contesting the State: Embodied Threat and the Emergence of Prisoner Mobilization",
          "authors": "David Jonathan Knight",
          "abstract": "Prior studies cast U.S. imprisonment as politically demobilizing. This article complicates that proposition by exploring when, and how, threat under penal confinement leads people to mobilize. Using interviews with currently incarcerated and recently released men across three states, I show that although imprisonment generally fosters political inaction, collective mobilization does arise under certain conditions. First, people in prison mobilize in response to embodied threats —fundamental threats eliciting visceral reactions that signal future harm (i.e., premature death or permanent incapacitation). Second, to collectively mobilize, a subpopulation of similarly threatened prisoners must be present and see the threats as a shared problem. Collective prisoner mobilization is more likely when both conditions are present; mobilization is unlikely when neither condition is present; and individual political contention is more likely when conditions are partially present. This range of political responses among incarcerated people is more dynamic than previously reported. Imprisonment has selective political effects, mobilizing the most repressed individuals within prison to devise new strategies to contest their repression.",

          "authors": "Liudmila Listrovaya",
          "abstract": "This research investigates the ways in which authoritarianism constrains the transnational political engagement of recent Russian emigrants, a group known as relokanti. The study centers on three interconnected social roles of relokanti: as citizens of Russia, as family members of those who remain in Russia, and as migrants navigating life in Georgia. Drawing upon twenty in-depth interviews alongside secondary data, the research reveals that despite residing in a host country with greater democratic freedoms and possessing biographical characteristics often associated with political activism, relokanti deliberately refrain from engaging in political expression, even within the private sphere of family interactions. I conceptualize this strategic withdrawal from all transnational political action as silence after exit—a form of political non-engagement shaped by the indirect yet pervasive effects of the extraterritorial spillover of authoritarianism. Findings of this work contribute to the literature on diaspora and transnational political action by centering cases of political disengagement and underscoring the importance of incorporating constraint into our understanding of political life of migrants under authoritarian reach.",

          "title": "Who watches the watchmen? intersectional threat and public opinion about policing the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests",
          "authors": "Kevin Drakulich, Christian Law",
          "abstract": "When Americans protest the police, how should the police treat the protesters? Police exert social control on behalf of the state and have been implicated in the maintenance of inequalities, yet are also tasked with managing protests, even protests of the police. So, how do citizens feel about possible restrictions to their right to protest, a critical feature of a functional democracy? While the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 were largely peaceful, some Americans supported the use of repressive “law and order” responses. Amid simultaneous movements for racial equality (Black Lives Matter) and gendered equality (#MeToo), an intersectional threat perspective encourages us to consider the potentially unique reactions of people who perceive simultaneous threats to multiple privileged identities. We theorize that support for aggressive policing approaches to racial justice protests acts as a synchronized performance of race and gender, enforcing the symbolic boundaries that undergird structural inequalities. Specifically, we suspect that perceived threats to male privilege will also be relevant to these views, at least among those who also perceived threats to white privilege. Using data from the 2020 American National Election Study survey—shortly after the mass protests of the spring and summer of that year—we find a conditional relationship for perceived gender threat, which appears relevant to views of policing the Black Lives Matter protests only among those who also perceive threats to white privilege. We discuss implications for understanding public comprehension of other social phenomena, particularly during multiple overlapping civil rights movements.",

          "title": "Another elephant in the room? how energy-intensive lifestyles may undermine the fight against climate change",
          "authors": "Lazarus Adua, Brett Clark",
          "abstract": "Climate change represents a major threat to the world, yet policy responses to it have been tepid and ineffective. Recent dire warnings and more frequent climate-related extreme weather events have stirred greater interest in more assertive responses, mostly around two beloved “solutions or policy areas”—transitioning to renewable energy and energy efficiency improvement. This study investigates whether these solutions lessen carbon emissions. More crucially, it scrutinizes whether they are resilient against consumptive lifestyles, an elephant in the room often ignored by governmental decision-makers. Dynamic fixed effects modeling of cross-national longitudinal data shows renewable energies offer opportunities for reducing carbon emissions, but energy intensity prevents us from realizing their full environmental benefits. We find evidence in our analysis that energy intensity as well as other socioeconomic factors are suppressing the influence of renewable energies on carbon emissions. The analysis also shows that the relationship between national energy-intensity, which taps inefficiency, and carbon emissions is moderated by energy-intensive lifestyles (energy use per capita). This finding suggests reducing energy intensity may offer some reductions in carbon emissions, but such efforts must be paired with reductions in energy consumption per capita.",

          "authors": "Marissa E Thompson",
          "abstract": "How do individuals and groups frame their appeals to change official racial/ethnic categories and explain their perceptions of the underlying boundaries that such categories reflect? This article draws from the case of revisions to the 2030 U.S. census categories using the universe of the over 20,000 public comments submitted to the federal government in response to proposed changes. Using an integrated computational text analysis and qualitative approach, I find that three sets of strategies characterize the general deployment of racial frames across comments. The first describes the broader characteristics that are perceived to define a given category; the second grapples with the historical and contemporary nature of racial/ethnic boundaries; and the third situates the placement of a given group in the existing racial order. I then examine the use of these strategies in reference to the proposed Middle Eastern and North African category and to the existing Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino categories. Finally, I examine the resonance of particular frames and strategies by illustrating the extent to which they were submitted on behalf of organizations or duplicated widely by individual actors. Together, this study advances our broader understanding of the dynamic nature of racial/ethnic categories and the boundaries that they are perceived to represent.",

          "abstract": "Courts around the world are putting their data online, making information about caseloads, parties, and decisions available to the public. Yet, this data is far from complete, and often only reflects a portion of courts’ dockets. We offer and validate a set of tools for leveraging serialized bureaucratic data from courts to estimate the proportion of cases available to the public and the time courts take to make decisions. Using data from more than 3,000 courts in China, our methods allow us to assess patterns of missingness in court data across provinces and cities by type of case and to conduct the largest quantitative analysis to date on court delay in China. By providing an extensive validation of both new and existing tools for estimating missingness and delay, we provide a set of recommendations for researchers looking to augment incomplete bureaucratic data around the world.",

          "authors": "Canton Winer",
          "abstract": "Feminist scholars have written for decades about the radical potential, if not the necessity, of ungendering for resisting gender inequality. Yet much of this work has been theoretical, and other scholars have questioned whether ungendering is even possible. Drawing on interviews with 30 asexual individuals, the author presents empirical findings that lend support to the plausibility of ungendering. On the basis of these findings, the author introduces the concept of gender detachment , which refers to individually held notions that gender is irrelevant, unimportant, pointless, and/or overall not a helpful framework for understanding and defining the self. The author argues that the difficulty of navigating these feelings highlights gender, and not merely the gender binary, as a compulsory system of categorization. The author also argues that this finding highlights the need to theorize around compulsory gender . The author concludes by discussing gender detachment’s connections to and differences from the concepts of degendering, ungendering, undoing gender, redoing gender, nonbinary identification, and gender vertigo. The author also considers gender detachment’s potential for radical resistance to gender (and the inequality gender produces) and the potential complications in realizing that potential.",

          "abstract": "Filled with anti-immigrant and Islamophobic rhetoric and buoyed by overwhelming support from white evangelicals, Donald Trump’s campaign for the presidency shocked the world. Much media coverage and scholarship on Trump’s evangelical support implicitly bought into his populist myth of representing the “legitimate” people who ultimately forced the evangelical elite to come around to their point of view. However, little systematic research has been done investigating whether evangelical leaders changed their rhetoric on immigration and Islam following Trump’s rise to political power or if xenophobic rhetoric was already a feature of evangelical media. To address this question, the author collected a corpus of more than 45,000 articles from prominent online evangelical news Web sites and used text analysis techniques to analyze how evangelical opinion leaders discussed immigration and Islam. Evangelical opinion leaders were already using frames of threat and foreignness in their rhetoric around immigration and Islam even before Trump announced his candidacy for president, and there was little change in this rhetoric following his rise to power. These findings suggest that Trump did not instill xenophobic and Islamophobic views in his followers but instead tapped into ideas that were already prevalent in the evangelical subculture.",
