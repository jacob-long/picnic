          "authors": "Laura Acosta",
          "abstract": "Contrary to the classical sociological view that social conflict reinforces preexisting political divisions, this article argues that civil war can reinvent them. I examine this phenomenon through the evolution of civil wars in Colombia in the mid-twentieth century, a period initially marked by a Liberal–Conservative conflict that developed into a civil war between the state and communist guerrillas. Drawing on archival records, oral histories of civilians and combatants, and newspapers, I demonstrate that when one party invents an “imagined third”—an actor, external to the original conflict dyad, who lacks any connection to an actual military or political threat—to blame for the violence in civil war, a self-fulfilling logic turns the imagined third into a tangible enemy of the nation, thereby creating a new fault line. In Colombia, politicians’ baseless accusations and preemptive actions against Communists activated three mechanisms of fault line formation—enemy legitimation, boundary demarcation, and identity shift—that materialized the very revolutionary threats they claimed to prevent. This analytic framework of fault line formation in civil war opens new avenues for examining how political discourse can become self-fulfilling, how international threats are transformed into local enemies, and how wartime actors’ opportunities for action evolve—including the conditions necessary for sustained peace.",

          "title": "The Cultural Devaluation of Feminized Work: The Evolution of U.S. Occupational Prestige and Gender Typing in Linguistic Representations, 1900 to 2019",
          "authors": "Wenhao Jiang",
          "abstract": "Previous research on occupational devaluation typically evaluates the potential wage declines associated with a significant inflow of women into an occupation; results have been mixed. Few studies, however, examine the cultural mechanism central to the thesis, where an occupation’s symbolic value in multiple dimensions changes in response to the dynamics of its cultural association with women. This article proposes a new semantic approach to trace the devaluation process in U.S. culture, where occupation titles appear in scholarly and public discourses with varied semantic proximity to gender- and prestige-signaling phrases over time. Decade-specific occupation embedding (1900 to 2019) from 127 billion words of American English across genres and a novel fixed-effects estimator show a latent cultural bias against women’s work, such that an occupation’s general prestige and perceived potency (but not its moral standing) declines when it becomes increasingly stereotyped as female. The largest penalties are found in lower- and middle-wage occupations; most high-wage occupations, despite experiencing large increases in female share in recent years, are persistently stereotyped as male professions without a prestige loss. In total, the cultural mechanism of devaluation accounts for 22.4 to 25.9 percent of the observed negative link between occupations’ female typing and hourly wages.",

          "authors": "Edvard Nergård Larsen, Aleksander Å Madsen, Are Skeie Hermansen",
          "abstract": "How does the presence of immigrant coworkers shape the likelihood that minority employees stay or leave their jobs? This study uses linked employer–employee administrative data covering the entire Norwegian labor market to investigate how workplace immigrant concentration influences turnover among immigrants and their native-born children. Building on theories of organizational demography, we ask whether working alongside a higher share of immigrant-background coworkers fosters employee retention—consistent with mechanisms of social contact and homophily—or instead prompts workplace exit, as suggested by group threat and competition theories. Our findings reveal that greater representation of immigrant-background coworkers significantly reduces turnover among immigrants, especially when contact occurs within same-skill occupations. The exposure effects reducing the likelihood of workplace exit are also stronger when immigrant-background employees share the same national origin with their minority coworkers and when minorities are better represented among top earners in the organization. For children of immigrants, the effects of coworker composition are weaker, consistent with theories of assimilation and the weakening of ethnic boundaries across generations. Taken together, these results support social contact theories, which claim that a more inclusive work environment and coworker support in more ethnically diverse workplace contexts foster organizational attachment and reduce turnover among immigrant-background minority employees. However, minority employees’ increased retention in organizations with higher immigrant concentration may also reinforce patterns of ethnic workplace segregation.",

          "authors": "Ethan Fosse, Fabian T. Pfeffer",
          "abstract": "Over the past decade there has been a striking increase in the number of quantitative studies examining the effects of social mobility, with almost all based on the diagonal reference model (DRM). We make four main contributions to this rapidly expanding literature. First, we show that under plausible values of mobility effects, the DRM will, in many cases, implicitly force the underlying mobility linear effect toward zero. In addition, we show both mathematically and through simulations that the mobility effects estimated by the DRM are sensitive to the size and sign of the origin and destination linear effects, often in ways that are unlikely to be intuitive to applied researchers. This finding clarifies why, contrary to expectations, applied researchers have generally found mixed evidence of mobility effects. Second, we generalize the identification problem of conventional mobility effect models by showing that the DRM and related methods can be viewed as special cases of a bounding analysis, where identification is achieved by invoking extremely strong assumptions. Finally, and importantly, we present a new framework for the analysis of mobility tables based on the identification and estimation of joint parameter sets, introducing what we call the structural and dynamic inequality model. We show that this model is fully identified, relies on much weaker assumptions than conventional models of mobility effects, and can be treated both as a descriptive model and, if additional assumptions are invoked, as a causal model. We conclude with an agenda for further research on the consequences of socioeconomic mobility.",

          "abstract": "For causal effects of a binary treatment on a right-censored duration, the widely used proportional hazard contrasts are non-causal with unrealistic restrictions. This article proposes an alternative flexible causal approach, where we estimate the cumulative hazard, not the hazard itself, using an additive or “exponential-additive” specification with freely time-varying parameters. Our approach includes the proportional hazard as a highly special case that allows only monotonic survival probability ratios (SPR’s), while our approach allows any shape of SPR’s. An empirical analysis on recidivism using the duration until re-arrest after prison release on parole/probation is provided, where the SPR trajectory is not monotonic, but has an inverted-U shape over time.",

Drawing on harmonized administrative data, the authors document a strong positive association: regions with larger motherhood penalties tend to exhibit wider gender earnings gaps. This pattern holds across all Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics second-division regions, where a 1 percent increase in the motherhood penalty corresponds to a 0.3 percent higher gender earnings gap. The relationship is even stronger within countries, with the average association rising to 0.7 percent. These findings suggest that regional differences in gender earnings inequality are strongly associated with the magnitude of motherhood penalties.",
