          "authors": "Benjamin Rohr, John Levi Martin",
          "abstract": "Prevailing theories about the nature and development of the democratic party system fail to account for the important case of the United States. Using a novel dataset on legislators and roll call votes in the New York State Assembly after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, we show that, contrary to existing accounts, legislative parties had already formed at this early stage. Yet these parties did not arise from the translation of social cleavages such as economic or social class into political oppositions, as sociologists might expect, nor were they merely networks of powerful elites disconnected from the polity, as political scientists and historians have suggested. Instead, these parties coalesced around formal issues—structural questions like the procedures for election and appointment, questions whose answer would determine the rules of the game for future contests. Parties emerged, we argue, not because of an inherent need to adjudicate conflicts between sectors of the polity, but because of the organizational affordances of the modern democratic state. Our findings suggest the formation of party systems is an integral part of the formation of the modern state.",

          "title": "Internal displacement and post-conflict gender attitudes: evidence from northwestern Pakistan",
          "authors": "Yuichi Kubota",
          "abstract": "Despite the common understanding that armed civil conflict increases women’s vulnerability, scholarly debate suggests that women’s status in society improves after violence ends. This study sheds light on post-conflict institutional transformation using popular attitudes toward gender roles and relations. By focusing on the significantly overlooked displacement of nearly 5 million civilians in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, this study presents powerful new survey data painstakingly gathered to assess the effects of this social upheaval on people’s attitudes regarding gender equality. The results suggest that individuals who experience displacement express greater support for gender equality in the conflict’s aftermath than if they do not experience it. Wartime displacement not only disrupts civilian activity but also exposes people to an external society. By interacting with out-groups, the displaced learn and benefit from ideas about gender roles and relations that contrast with long-standing patriarchal norms. Although gender norms are often persistent in a cultural setting, the empirical evidence suggests that being an internally displaced person is an acute event for civilians to amend their prior views on gender roles and relations.",

          "authors": "Rodolfo Disi Pavlic, Rodrigo M Medel, Matías Bargsted, Nicolás M Somma",
          "abstract": "We examine the relationship between proximity to actively policed protest events and people’s willingness to justify violence against police forces. Focusing on the Chilean social uprising, a series of massive protests between 2019 and 2020, this study highlights the significant implications of law enforcement issues on government legitimacy and the potential for protest policing to escalate violence. To conduct our research, we use a difference-in-differences design that combines survey data with georeferenced data on protests that experienced active policing near survey respondents. Our results show that spatial and temporal proximity to such protests significantly increases people’s willingness to justify violence. Additionally, this effect is not uniform across all ideological groups. Exposure to protests with active policing strongly affects centrists, whereas it is negligible for leftists, rightists, and independents. Different robustness checks largely support a causal link between proximity to actively policed protests and justification of violence against the police. These insights contribute to our understanding of how mass mobilizations and state responses influence public attitudes, emphasizing the nuanced impact of protest policing on different ideological segments of society.",

          "authors": "Adrian Farner Rogne, Siri Frisli",
          "abstract": "The latter half of the 20th century was marked by a massive expansion of higher educational systems in many Western countries. This development provided greater educational opportunities, resulted in a marked increase in educational attainment, and has been attributed as an important factor behind increased intergenerational educational mobility. Most previous studies of these developments are based on analyses of aggregate trends in educational attainment and mobility and overlook the geographical dimension of educational expansions. The geographic location of colleges and the local availability of higher educational institutions may have had important impacts on local patterns of intergenerational educational mobility. We study the impacts of major educational expansion reforms that took place between 1969 and 1993 in Norway and resulted in a massive decentralization of higher educational opportunities. Combining recent developments in differences-in-differences methodology, detailed data on the establishment and upgrading of such institutions, and population-wide register data on social origins and educational attainment, we study the effects of the establishment and upgrading of local colleges on educational mobility. Results suggest that these improvements in local educational opportunities had little to no impact on intergenerational educational mobility locally. We discuss our findings in light of the Norwegian welfare state context.",

          "authors": "Michelle Jackson, Christof Brandtner",
          "abstract": "Explanations of socioeconomic inequalities in college enrollment focus on college readiness, financial constraints, and information deficits. We provide a cultural explanation of educational inequalities, arguing that disadvantaged students are deterred from applying to high-status colleges because of the shared cultural narratives employed by those colleges—a mechanism that we label “institutional exclusion.” Computational text analyses of college mission statements show that community colleges, for-profit colleges, and four-year colleges draw upon distinctively different cultural narratives. To gauge the causal effect of these narratives on student responses, we designed a survey experiment for a sample of high-school seniors. We find that the career-focused narratives of for-profit colleges are most appealing to disadvantaged students, whereas advantaged students prefer the post-materialist rhetoric of four-year colleges. We conclude that institutional exclusion should be included in sociological discussions of college inequalities and the promotion of diversity in organizations.",

          "abstract": "Linkages between surveys and administrative data provide an important opportunity for social and health research, but such linkages often require the informed consent of respondents. We use experimental data collection across five different samples to study how consent decisions are made. More reflective decision processes are associated with higher rates of consent, greater comprehension of the proposed data linkage, and greater confidence in the decision, but only about a third of respondents report using a reflective decision process. This suggests that the provision of additional information is unlikely to lead to significant improvements in informed consent.",

          "abstract": "This article proposes some new measures of intergenerational persistence based on the idea of characterizing the memory of origin in the stochastic process that links the socioeconomic classes of parents and children. We introduce “memory curves” for all future generations given any initial condition of class for a family dynasty, which reveal how initial conditions interact with the transition process between parents and children to create mobility and persistence. We also propose ways to aggregate information across different classes to produce overall characterizations of mobility in the population. To illustrate our measures, we estimate occupational “memory curves” using U.S. survey data. Our findings show that, on average, the memory of initial conditions dissipates largely within three generations, though there is meaningful heterogeneity in mobility rates across dynasties originating from different occupational classes.",

          "authors": "Yaqi Yuan",
          "abstract": "Assisted living facility and nursing home staff faced high virus exposure, long hours, and limited resources while caring for vulnerable residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to a turnover crisis, as many long-term care facility employees left due to burnout, safety concerns, and emotional exhaustion. Framed within emotional labor theory and social structural theories of emotions, this study examines the emotional responses of frontline and managerial staff in assisted living facilities (ALFs) during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the impact of high turnover rates. Based on qualitative interview data from semistructured Zoom and in-person interviews with 29 employees at “Harmony House” in Oregon, this study highlights the hierarchical nature of emotional experiences in the workplace among frontline workers, middle management staff, and administrators in ALFs, shaped by high turnover rates during the pandemic. The findings also show that ALF employees attributed turnover to different factors based on their organizational roles. Whereas administrators often attributed turnover to the pandemic or generational traits, frontline and middle management staff emphasized persistent issues, such as low pay, understaffing, and safety risks. These divergent perspectives showcase how institutional hierarchies shape emotional understandings of workplace challenges, advancing the literature on emotional labor and organizational dynamics in long-term care.",

          "title": "Gender Polarization and Sociodemographic Axes in Canada",
          "authors": "Tony Silva, Sophia Dimitrakopoulos, Emily Huddart",
          "abstract": "Although quantitative social scientists have examined how self-perceptions of masculinity and femininity vary by sociodemographic axes, gender polarization has rarely been studied. This concept captures gender subjectivities in ways that reflect how many individuals understand themselves as having a mixture of masculine and feminine characteristics, helping align survey measures with how gender theorists and qualitative scholars have examined gender. It is measured as the absolute value of the difference between self-rated masculinity and femininity. For example, if someone rated themselves as a 4 of 7 on masculinity and a 7 of 7 on femininity, their gender polarization value would be 3. In contrast, if someone rated themselves as a 1 of 7 on masculinity (the lowest value) and a 7 of 7 on femininity, their value would be 6. The authors examine this metric in a probability sample of Canadians. Gender polarization differed by political ideology, sexual identity, and age cohort for both women and men. For men only, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and rural or urban location were related to gender polarization. These results highlight how social and structural contexts both shape and constrain how individuals perceive themselves in gendered ways.",

          "abstract": "This study examines societal rejection of the rape myth that a woman’s “no” to sex often means “yes” using Flash Eurobarometer 544 data (N = 25,824) across EU member states. Our visualization reveals that women more strongly reject this myth than men in all countries, with significant cross-national variation in rejection levels for both genders. Notably, higher national gender equality correlates with greater rejection of the myth and smaller gender gaps in this rejection. Furthermore, countries with “only yes means yes” rape legislation tend to exhibit higher gender equality and reduced gender differences in rejecting the myth compared to those with force-based definitions. These findings underscore the link between gender equality, legal frameworks, and societal attitudes toward sexual consent, highlighting the importance of holistic policies addressing gender inequalities to combat rape culture.",

          "abstract": "State-centered Christian statism (CS) and society-centered religious traditionalism (RT) are two conservative religious nationalist ideologies that share Christian symbolisms but contain different attitudes about how the state and religion should interact; specifically, CS reflects the belief that Christianity needs to be the guiding ideology of the federal government, and RT mainly promotes the Christian ethos within civil society. We investigate whether these two ideologies predict different forms of religiosity. Analyzing the Baylor Religion Survey (Wave 6), we find that religious believers with stronger agreement with CS show a more self-oriented and petitionary religiosity, in which God is seen as especially interested in and responsive to them. And they tend to pray for divine assistance to meet their personal wants. In contrast, controlling for CS sentiment, believers with stronger RT agreement express a more praise-oriented and confessional religiosity, in which they feel personally accountable for their sins and routinely ask for forgiveness. RT believers also view God as more concerned with the well-being of the whole world and are less likely to ask for personal blessings. These findings further indicate that CS believers tend to express an individualized religiosity and that RT believers are more likely to spread faith and praise God.",

          "abstract": "School shooting scholars call for a comprehensive approach that can integrate idiosyncratic studies, solve definition dilemmas, and foster programmatic clarity. The authors argue that Newman and colleagues’ approach to rampage school shootings can be adapted to any subset of shootings. Using an original dataset, the authors assess constellation theory (CT)—Newman and colleagues’ comprehensive framework—and show how refined CT factors help define and explain rampage attacks amid broad shifts in gun appropriations, social media engagement, punitive school security, and adolescent mental health decline. The findings suggest that (1) duration, lethality, and shooter fatality distinguish rampage attacks as a subset; (2) shooter life histories display a majority of indicators across all CT factors, and the mean proportion of factor indicators is positively and significantly correlated with lethality; and (3) psychosocial support infrastructures represent inflection points in surveillance system failures that create time for other CT factors to gain salience in shooters’ biographical trajectories. This study provides insight into the mechanisms driving rampage shootings and develops Newman and colleagues’ approach as a generative analytic strategy for school shooting research.",

          "abstract": "How do class-advantaged individuals with more social capital fail to obtain greater economic capital than class-disadvantaged individuals with less? Although stratification scholars often assume that the class-advantaged convert their greater social capital into greater economic capital, social capital researchers regularly find no wage benefit from its possession or use. Drawing on the case of college students entering the midtier business labor market, this study uncovers how overlooked properties of fields contribute to this phenomenon. Fields that hide information about who can help, how to get ahead, and which jobs pay the most neutralize the class-advantaged’s social capital. In these fields, the class-advantaged do not know whom to ask for help, and without knowledge of how or where to get ahead, their connections often give them ineffective advice and lead them into low-paying as well as high-paying positions. By highlighting the role of hidden information, this study challenges assumptions about the straightforward conversion of social into economic capital and shows how the class-advantaged’s seeming advantages break down.",
