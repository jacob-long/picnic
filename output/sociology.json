          "title": "Care Labor and Family Income Inequality: How Childcare Costs Exacerbate Inequality among U.S. Families",
          "authors": "Pilar Gonalons-Pons, Ioana Marinescu",
          "abstract": "Care infrastructures are essential for supporting families and enabling women’s participation in the labor market, but they also have implications for family income inequality. This article examines access to childcare services in the United States as a case study. We propose that market-priced childcare systems generate inequalities in how births affect mothers’ contributions to family income, because they constrain post-birth labor supply for lower-income women more than for higher-income women, and aggravate family income inequality as a result. Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged with state-level childcare prices, we estimate individual fixed-effects regression models for the consequences of births on family income and its proximate determinants: mothers’ labor supply and earnings, and partners’ labor supply and earnings. We find that childcare prices increase post-birth earnings losses for mothers without college degrees, but not for mothers with college degrees, and these losses are not compensated for by increases in partners’ earnings or by income transfers. As a result, childcare costs exacerbate family income gaps between partnered women with and without a college degree by 34 percentage points.",

          "title": "Entering the mainstream economy? Workplace segregation and immigrant assimilation",
          "authors": "Mats Lillehagen, Are Skeie Hermansen",
          "abstract": "Why do foreign-born immigrant workers often concentrate in low-wage, minority-dense workplaces? Do immigrants’ native-born children—who typically acquire better language skills, education, and country-specific knowledge—experience improved access to workplaces in the mainstream economy? Using economy-wide linked employer–employee administrative data from Norway, we analyze both ethnic and economic workplace segregation across immigrant generations. We find that, on average, 32% of immigrants’ coworkers and 16% of second-generation immigrants’ coworkers have immigrant backgrounds, compared to 7% for natives. In terms of economic segregation, the average percentile rank of coworkers’ salaries is 36, 49, and 52 for immigrants, children of immigrants, and natives, respectively. A formal decomposition analysis shows that differences in employee, workplace, and residential location characteristics collectively explain 54–74% of ethnic and 79–84% of economic workplace segregation for immigrants and their children. Key factors driving this segregation in both immigrant generations include education, occupational attainment, industry of employment, having an immigrant manager, and the concentration of immigrant neighbors. This suggests that both skill-based sorting and network-related processes contribute to immigrant–native workplace segregation. However, children of immigrants’ improved access to less immigrant-dense and higher-paying workplaces, compared to immigrants, is primarily driven by differential skill-based sorting (i.e., higher education and shifts in occupation and industry placement). Our findings reveal a sharp decline in workplace segregation relative to natives as children of immigrants advance into the mainstream economy, highlighting the central role of assimilation in skill profiles for workplace integration across immigrant generations.",

          "title": "“Mom-and-Pop” Landlords and Regulatory Backlash: A Seattle Case Study",
          "authors": "Anna Reosti, Chris Hess, Courtney Allen, Kyle Crowder",
          "abstract": "Against the backdrop of an acute rental affordability crisis and a resurgent tenant’s rights movement, rental industry groups have frequently argued that tenant protection laws disproportionately harm “mom-and-pop” landlords and, by extension, the disadvantaged tenants they serve. The authors leverage a changing regulatory environment in Seattle to provide a rare empirical interrogation of these claims. This analysis of a novel set of consumer data linked with parcel records provides no evidence that tenant protection laws drove “mom-and-pop” landlords out of the rental market. Moreover, an analysis of a survey of almost 4,000 Seattle landlords suggests that “mom-and-pop” landlords use management practices that are largely similar to those used by landlords with larger rental portfolios. These findings run counter to pervasive political narratives regarding the detrimental effects of tenant protection regulations on the small-scale rental sector and bring needed attention to the repercussions of claims-making for stratification in the housing context.",

          "authors": "Marcel Raab, Florian Schulz",
          "abstract": "This visualization illustrates patterns of income pooling among German couples using longitudinal data from the German Family Panel (pairfam), examining variations across cohorts born in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and among different partnership types. The findings reveal that marriage is much more strongly associated with income pooling than cohabitation or living-apart-together arrangements. A generational shift is evident: Younger cohorts are less likely to pool finances, even within marriage. The visualization suggests increasing financial independence in intimate relationships over cohorts, reflecting broader societal shifts toward individualism.",

          "title": "U.S. and Canadian Higher Education Protests and University and Police Responses, 2012 to 2018",
          "authors": "Ellen Berrey, Alex Hanna, Nathan Kim, Kristen Bass",
          "abstract": "The authors describe protest patterns at U.S. and Canadian universities in the 2010s. The research draws on a new dataset, the Higher Ed Protest Event Dataset, which combines machine learning and sociological hand coding of 16,069 campus newspaper articles. The sample consists of 5,553 higher ed protests involving 584 universities and colleges between 2012 and 2018. The dataset also includes university and police responses to a subset of protests. The authors find that protest frequency is patterned by the academic calendar. The top issue in both U.S. and Canadian higher education protests was university administration and governance. The comparative analysis reveals distinctive patterns in other issues raised and protest intensity. In the United States, the periods of greatest protest activity were waves of mass mobilization across the country on often racialized issues with a national dimension: racist police violence, racially hostile campus climates, and Donald Trump’s presidency. In Canada, protest activity was most intense during provincial or local campaigns led by formal student organizations and unions on issues of economic security: public tuition, austerity, and labor conditions. Across both countries, university administrations and police usually avoided extensive intervention during protests. The findings contribute to social movements research through methodological innovations and new empirical insights on movements in higher education.",

          "title": "Visualizing the Housing Cost Burden of Migrants and Natives across the Income Distribution",
          "authors": "Nils Witte",
          "abstract": "A majority of German households are occupied by renters. There are indications of growing inequality through disproportional income increases among high-income households and disproportional rent increases among low-income households. On the basis of the German Socio-Economic Panel, the author examines rent-income ratios (RIRs) and differentiates between migrants and natives. How did RIRs develop between 1990 and 2020, and are there any differences across the distribution? There are three key findings. First, dynamics of RIRs suggest rising economic inequality among both migrants and natives. Second, although both groups grew more unequal over time, the inequality increase was stronger among migrants. Third, migrants generally faced steeper rent hikes than natives, which partly accounts for a higher rent burden among income-poor migrants. These descriptive findings point out avenues for systematic research of the increases in inequality related to rent and income dynamics and their ethnoracial stratification.",
