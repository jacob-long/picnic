          "title": "How Does Culture Matter for Attainment, and How Would We Know If It Did?",
          "authors": "David Brady, Aliza Luft, Ezra W. Zuckerman Sivan",
          "abstract": "In their 2022 ASR article, Horwitz, Matheny, Laryea, and Schnabel (HMLS 2022) argue that religious subculture significantly shapes educational stratification, emphasizing how Jewish subcultures, especially for young women, foster an education-enhancing “habitus and self-concept.” While commending their aim to identify “clear explanatory mechanisms” and avoid essentialist explanations, this Comment critiques HMLS’s methodology and conclusions, addressing the broader question: Can parental cultural socialization explain group-level differences in educational attainment? We identify four issues: mismeasurement of Jewish parentage, insufficient controls for social class, and two gaps in specifying and operationalizing cultural mechanisms. Re-analyzing the National Survey of Youth and Religion (NSYR), we show that HMLS’s findings remain stable after correcting Jewish parentage mismeasurement but shift substantially when better adjusting for social class. We argue that cultural explanations must meet two additional principles—portability and convertibility—to avoid lapsing into essentialism or reproducing “culture of poverty” narratives. These principles require that (a) social and cultural mechanisms function independently of group membership and be transferable across actors and fields, and (b) structural advantages and barriers are acknowledged and integrated. This Comment thus extends existing guidelines for analyzing the role of culture in stratification and offers a framework for identifying non-essentialist mechanisms driving group differences in attainment.",

The papers in the special issue involve four broad themes: the development of new statistics to characterize mobility, the exploration of methods to establish causal explanations, the enrichment of statistical models to better characterize heterogeneity in mobility across families, and the development and application of ways to employ machine learning tools to enrich mobility analysis. These papers demonstrate the excitement of the methodological frontier in mobility research.",

          "abstract": "Previous research shows that Muslim girls in Western societies are less likely to do sports than both Muslim boys and non-Muslims of either gender. But we know little about whether other leisure time activities also differ by religion and gender and whether these patterns change during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. In this data visualization, we use large-scale representative data from Germany to show how 13 leisure time activities of Muslim and non-Muslim boys and girls develop from adolescence to young adulthood. Muslim girls are more involved in housework than other youth but are least active in doing sports and other activities that involve mingling beyond the immediate peer group, such as going out or attending clubs. There are few differences in other activities, such as reading, watching TV, or visiting relatives. Moreover, Muslim girls start to stand out less as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood.",
