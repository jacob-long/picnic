          "title": "Institutional Decline and Resilient Belief: Understanding Secularization in Latin America",
          "authors": "Matthew Blanton",
          "abstract": "A large body of literature analyzes trends of religious decline across Western Europe and North America. Often rooted in secularization theory—the idea that modernization reduces religious beliefs and practice—this research lacks attention to global, comparative contexts. In this study, the author addresses that gap by examining religious trends spanning two decades across 17 Latin American countries to analyze changes in religious affiliation, church attendance, and religious importance. The author demonstrates that institutional religiosity, measured by affiliation and church attendance, is declining, whereas personal religiosity, measured by religious importance, remains resilient and is even increasing. This fragmented secularization is distinct from patterns observed in Western Europe and the United States. Further analyses highlight additional differences, showing that religious dimensions in Latin America are less tightly correlated and that the religiously unaffiliated maintain stronger religious beliefs and practices than their counterparts in the West. To account for this divergence, the author integrates insights from the neosecularization paradigm with Latin American theories of popular religiosity and lived religion. This synthesis provides a more precise framework for understanding secularization in Latin America and offers a model for applying secularization theory to non-Western contexts, in which modernization unfolds in diverse ways.",

          "title": "How the Student Loan Repayment Pause Increased Latinx Borrowers’ Agency and Diversified Their Spectrum of Emotions",
          "authors": "Daisy Verduzco Reyes, Melissa Quesada, Kimberly Garcia-Galvez",
          "abstract": "The coronavirus pandemic drastically reshaped how much of society functioned. Most of these changes were unfortunate in some way, but one change welcomed by many was the student loan repayment pause. This pause was enacted as relief given the pandemic’s effects on the economy and people’s financial standing. Approximately 35 million borrowers qualified and received, at least temporarily, not only some financial but also emotional respite from the heavy burden of debt. How was the repayment pause received emotionally by Latinx millennial borrowers? How did these borrowers feel before and then during the pause? Drawing on interviews from two waves of data collection—one in 2018 and another in 2022—the authors found an increased sense of agency among borrowers as well as an expanded spectrum of emotions, ranging from positive feelings of optimism to a more critical analysis of the student loan system during the repayment pause.",
