          "title": "Time and Climate Change: U.S. Media Representations of Climate Actions, Horizons, and Events (2000 to 2021)",
          "authors": "Oscar Stuhler, Iddo Tavory, Robin Wagner-Pacifici",
          "abstract": "Questions of temporality are at the heart of climate change discourse: Does one think of climate change primarily as an event happening in the present, or as something that will take place in the future? By when must we take action to prevent its worst consequences? This article presents the first large-scale assessment of the structure and evolution of temporalities expressed in U.S. media discussions on climate change (2000 to 2021). To do so, we developed a novel computational framework for detecting and interpreting temporal expressions in textual data. Our analyses yield three main findings: First, temporal horizons for climate change have continuously shrunk since 2000, stably targeting, on average, the year 2060. However, second, while anticipated effects are getting closer, horizons for the coordination of climate action have remained highly stable, averaging around 16 years into the future at any given time. Third, contrasting the stability of explicitly stated horizons, we find a sharply expanding discourse of urgency patterned by outbursts of urgency: sudden surges in calls for immediate action or warnings against climate change’s devastating consequences during events like the 2020 California wildfires. By uncovering this disjuncture of different forms of temporality, we illuminate a crucial aspect of the climate change debate, contribute to the sociological theory of events, and identify some of the conditions underlying climate inaction.",

          "title": "The Changing Role of Mothers’ Status in Children’s College Completion",
          "authors": "Christine R. Schwartz, Michael D. King",
          "abstract": "Despite vast changes in women’s status in society and in the home, we have little understanding of the changing role of mothers in shaping children’s life chances. Has mothers’ influence on their children’s educational outcomes grown alongside these shifts? Using data from three large nationally representative U.S. surveys, we find that the returns to mothers’ status—measured as their education, occupational status, and earnings—have remained relatively stable and similar to the returns to fathers’ status among children born from the 1930s to the 1980s, thus accounting for little of the observed increase in children’s college completion. This surprising continuity of the returns to mothers’ status aligns with past evidence of relatively stable intergenerational associations in the face of social change. But this does not mean nothing has changed. Our decomposition results show that increases in women’s education, occupational status, and earnings have meant that increased levels of mothers’ status account for more of the increase in children’s college completion than does fathers’ status among cohorts born since the 1960s. That continued increases in college completion have more to do with the rising status of mothers than fathers has been overlooked by previous research.",

          "authors": "Youngjoo Cha, Lena Hipp, Soocheol Cho",
          "abstract": "Before the pandemic, remote workers were often perceived as less committed than their in-office counterparts. Have these perceptions persisted in the postpandemic era of global remote work expansion? Does working remotely affect how people are viewed as parents and not just as workers? How do these relationships differ across cultural contexts with different work and parenting norms? We address these questions using original, preregistered survey experiments in three countries with distinct work cultures and gender norms: Germany, South Korea, and the United States. In all three countries, remote workers are perceived as less committed to work but as better parents. These effects, however, differ across countries in gender-specific ways: when working remotely, South Korean fathers face larger penalties in perceived work commitment than fathers in Germany, and South Korean mothers receive larger parental rewards than mothers in both Germany and the United States. These findings suggest that workers face competing pressures from work and family, and that remote work can produce distinctively gendered outcomes—drawing mothers into remote work while pushing fathers away from it. However, this pattern only occurs in cultural contexts where work and parenting norms are strongly gendered, such as South Korea.",

          "authors": "Eric W. Schoon",
          "abstract": "Researchers routinely face suspicion during fieldwork. This article presents findings from interviews with 34 ethnographers who were suspected of being spies while conducting fieldwork in Turkey. I find that the way the ethnographers experienced and responded to this suspicion depended on whether they reported being questioned about whether they were spies versus accused of spying. Questioning was interpreted as sense-making, and researchers reported several common strategies for addressing the suspicions they faced. Accusations, in contrast, were associated with threats and motivated the researchers to mitigate risks to themselves and their interlocutors. Engaging with scholarship on social cognition, high-risk fieldwork, and reflexivity, I discuss how my findings offer practical insights for navigating suspicion and risk during fieldwork—even in seemingly low-risk environments—and I make the case that interrogating how researchers react to suspicion can help them clarify their positionality and aid reflexivity.",

          "authors": "Cynthia Feliciano, Zhongze Wei, Maria Abascal, Wendy D. Roth",
          "abstract": "Although racial and class stereotypes are intertwined, few studies have examined the degree to which racial perceptions are linked to assumptions about social class. Among Latinos, racial self-identities often do not align with racial classifications by others, complicating debates about their place in the U.S. racial order. This study draws on unique survey data in which respondents classify the race, immigrant status, and social class of people in photographs who self-identify as Latino, Black, or White. In contrast to theories positing Latinos as a group in between Black and White Americans, findings show that self-identified White, Black and Latino observers alike tend to perceive Latinos as lower in socioeconomic standing than Black Americans. However, class perceptions of self-identified Latinos vary by their perceived race and immigrant status. This study suggests that ideas about the hierarchical positioning of racial groups at the macro-level, especially for Latinos, may not correspond to how socioeconomic stereotypes are experienced at the individual level, which vary by perceptions of race and immigrant status.",
