          "title": "The bodily scars of legal violence: local immigration enforcement, state immigrant policy, and health inequality",
          "authors": "Courtney E Boen, Nick Graetz, Atheendar Venkataramani, Robin Ortiz",
          "abstract": "Over the past three decades in the United States, a surge of federal, state, and local laws and policies has increased levels of immigration enforcement and eroded immigrant access to public services and benefits. While a large body of research documents the deleterious effects of these forms of legal violence for a range of immigrant outcomes like poverty, employment, and schooling, the health consequences of these sociopolitical shifts for aging adults remain to be better understood. Linking panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (2004–2016) (n = 18,259) to longitudinal data on county immigration enforcement and state immigrant policies, we estimate three-way fixed-effects models to examine how changes in immigration enforcement and policy shape physical and physiological health at the intersection of race-ethnicity and immigration status. Results show that as local immigration enforcement intensifies and state policy contexts become more hostile toward immigrants, foreign-born adults—especially Latinx immigrants—experience accelerated health decline. Like episodes of physical violence that can leave lacerations and damage—both visible and more concealed—our results provide evidence of the health harms of state-sanctioned violence: what we call bodily scars of legal violence. Taken together, this research shows how policies governing the surveillance and control of immigrants not only shape structures of racial domination and immigrant exclusion but the embodied health inequities that flow from them, with implications for understanding and redressing inequities in health and aging.",

          "title": "Occupational gender segregation: what can we learn from computer use trends?",
          "authors": "Efrat Herzberg-Druker",
          "abstract": "This study posits to an intricate interrelation between changes in occupational gender segregation (OGS) and the rise in computer use in the workplace in the United States. I posit that two contrasting mechanisms underpin this relation. Firstly, computerization has contributed to a more balanced gender distribution in certain professions, previously dominated by men, due to a decrease in physical tasks in occupations, thereby reducing OGS. Conversely, in other occupations, heightened computer use has increased Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) knowledge requirements, thus restricting women’s integration and reproducing OGS. My empirical analysis, utilizing fixed-effects regression models, lagged models, ordinary least squares (OLS) models, and mediation analysis on a comprehensive dataset of the United States Census, American Community Survey, and Occupational Information Network data, confirms a significant association between computer use and OGS. The physical attributes of occupations and their required STEM knowledge components emerge as critical factors. These contradictory mechanisms—one involving reduced physical demands and the other increased required STEM knowledge—ultimately maintain a stable OGS level.",
