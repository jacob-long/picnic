          "authors": "Rourke O’Brien, Manuel Schechtl, Zachary Parolin",
          "abstract": "Disparities in state and local government spending are key drivers of spatial inequality in social outcomes, including economic mobility. Yet beyond spending levels, the fiscal centralization of state and local governments—that is, the relative role of higher- versus lower-level governments in taxing, spending, and public employment—also differs substantially, traceable to place-specific founding circumstances and path dependent historical trajectories. In this study, we ask, in more centralized fiscal systems, is there less spatial inequality in the economic mobility outcomes of low-income children? To answer this, we construct a novel Fiscal Centralization Index for each state and each county using data from the U.S. Census of Governments. We then use place-based estimates of intergenerational economic mobility, provided by Opportunity Insights, to measure cross-census-tract variation in the mobility outcomes of children within each state and each county. We find that more centralized fiscal structures exhibit less spatial inequality in the economic mobility outcomes of low-income children, and this is driven by improving outcomes in lower-performing census tracts. Our findings motivate the fiscal sociology of place as a framework for revealing how historically conditioned fiscal systems are implicated in the production of place-based inequalities, with the potential to generate new insights and policy interventions.",

          "title": "The Labor of Distinction: Butlers, Service Work, and the Production of Elite Lifestyles",
          "authors": "Bryan Boyle, Dieter Vandebroeck",
          "abstract": "Elites appropriate labor that produces and reproduces distinct lifestyles. This article shows how the practice of this type of labor—what we term the “labor of distinction”—consists of four core dimensions: (1) curatorship, in the management of employers’ class symbols; (2) menialism, in freeing employers from “vulgar” practices; (3) Veblenian embodiment, in signaling employers’ status through bodily display; and (4) non-personship, in procuring social distance between laborer and employer, typically through concealment. Drawing from an “enactive” ethnography of the butler profession, where the lead author trained and worked as a butler in the UK, we illustrate the operation of all four of these dimensions and how they complement one another. By situating the butler in relation to other labor roles and occupations, we theorize a division of labor to outline how types of workers are differentially poised to serve elite distinction, and how elites with varying levels of purchasing power across geographic and historical contexts may incorporate labor in their distinction strategies. Our conceptualization comes at a time when the capacity for elites to employ this labor is growing and is, we argue, important to further understand elite symbolic power.",

          "authors": "Joya Misra",
          "abstract": "In her ASA presidential address, Misra calls for making solution-oriented, community-engaged, and participatory research more central in the discipline. She argues that solution-oriented work can strengthen the discipline, clarifying the promise and importance of sociology. She first discusses how sociologists engage in solution-oriented work that they communicate publicly. She then uses her collaborative work to suggest how to design research geared toward solving social problems. She emphasizes how feminist and decolonial methods that bring sociological researchers into collaborative and participatory partnerships with broader communities can develop transformative solutions, building communities of hope, justice, and joy. After discussing sociological approaches that empower communities, she emphasizes recognizing, valuing, and centering community-engaged research in the discipline.",

          "authors": "Timothy L O'Brien, David R Johnson",
          "abstract": "This article examines mechanisms related to lawmaker support for public policies based on scientific evidence and supportive of organized science. We propose that Republican lawmakers are more likely than Democrats to oppose these policies because Republicans are less likely than Democrats to base policy decisions on scientific authority and more likely than Democrats to base decisions on religious authority. We tested this hypothesis using data from a survey of state legislators from all 50 states (n = 941). Our structural equation model shows that compared to Democrats, Republicans’ policy decisions rely less on information from scientists and other experts and more on information from religious leaders. We also find evidence that lawmakers’ reliance on scientific and religious authority plays intermediary roles between their partisan identities and their attitudes about energy, vaccine, and biomedical research policies. Specifically, party differences in support for each kind of policy are associated with Democratic lawmakers’ greater reliance on science and Republicans’ greater reliance on religion. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for research on science, religion, politics, and policymaking.",

          "authors": "Chris Hess, Youngmin Yi, Gregory Sharp, Matt Hall",
          "abstract": "Research on neighborhood social organization and crime typically conceptualizes neighborhood change on the order of decades, even though the local social contexts that individuals experience change daily through mobility for work, errands and recreation. In this study, the authors analyze data from the Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey linked to the Census Transportation Planning Products to investigate whether within-day changes in neighborhood diversity are associated with an individual’s social cohesion and fear of crime. The authors find that individuals living in neighborhoods where diversity increases during the daytime tend to report more social cohesion and relatively less fear of crime. Importantly, these relationships are observed only among white respondents, with implications for whether processes of racialization in diverse neighborhood contexts account for this tendency. Results from this study highlight how the “mobility turn” within theories about neighborhood effects would benefit from considering how the contexts themselves change throughout the day.",

          "abstract": "This visualization presents trends in the estimated proportion of U.S. renter households in arrears and their perceived risk of eviction from August 2020 through June 2024 constructed using the Household Pulse Survey, a nationally representative repeated cross-sectional survey fielded by the U.S. Census Bureau. The proportion of renter households in arrears fell following the initial shock of the coronavirus pandemic and an increasing fraction of renters felt that eviction was unlikely. The proportion of renters perceiving some risk and high risk for eviction both generally fell over time. These patterns were evident for all demographic subgroups, but there were clear and persistent disparities. Black and Hispanic households reported higher rates of both rental arrears and perceived risk for eviction throughout the time period compared with White households. Households with children had higher rates of rental arrears and perceived eviction risk compared with households without children within each racial and ethnic demographic subgroup.",
