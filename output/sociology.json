          "title": "An imperfect match? gender and racial discrimination in hiring and applicant-job requirement matching as an unequal burden of proof",
          "authors": "Koji Chavez, Katherine Weisshaar, Tania Hutt",
          "abstract": "Discrimination in hiring screening decisions against Black men, Black women, and White women compared to White men has been well-documented in social science research, yet a fundamental aspect of the hiring process—the extent to which job applicants meet the job requirements—has not been clearly integrated into our understanding of hiring discrimination. In this paper, we develop an intersectional framework that conceptualizes applicant-job requirement matching as a form of “proof” that the applicant meets the evaluative standard for the job, and that the burden of proof is unequally distributed across job applicants’ combined gender and racial statuses. White men applicants, who align with the abstract evaluative standard for professional positions, benefit from assumed abilities even without evidence of matching job requirements, whereas Black men, Black women, and White women applicants must match job requirements to “prove” that they meet screening standards. We test this theory empirically with two original experimental studies: a nationally representative survey experiment and a correspondence audit study of accountants. We find that stereotyping and hiring screening discrimination varies across the applicant-job requirement match: discrimination is heightened when job applicants do not meet the requirements, and reduced when matched to requirements. The burden of proof through matching requirements therefore falls to Black men, Black women, and White women—and we find that Black women applicants experience unique outcomes due to their “intersectional invisibility.” This article contributes to our understanding of hiring discrimination and gender and racial inequality in the labor market.",

          "authors": "Jiayun Jin",
          "abstract": "This study addresses the complexities of midpoint and non-substantive responses, such as “Don’t Know,” in Likert scale surveys on gender attitudes. While existing research often assumes these responses are neutral or random, this study challenges that notion by applying the item response tree model to disentangle respondents’ attitudes from their response tendencies. Analysis of data from the Chinese General Social Survey shows that traditional gender attitudes are associated with a higher likelihood of such responses, indicating biases in conventional methods. After disentangling these elements, I reassemble them through latent profile analysis to examine the dominant configurations of gender attitudes and response tendencies. Five distinct profiles emerge: Passionate Egalitarians, Genuine Neutrals, Forthright Moderates, Evasive Traditionalists, and Unembellished Traditionalists. Passionate Egalitarians advocate strongly for gender equality, while Evasive Traditionalists use non-substantive responses to conceal traditional views. This study provides a refined approach to rating scale analysis, advancing both sociological methodology and gender studies.",

          "title": "Tag-Team Parenting: Trends in Work Schedule Synchronization among Families with Young Children",
          "authors": "Alejandra Ros Pilarz, Anna K. Walther",
          "abstract": "Tag-team parenting refers to parents who work nonoverlapping or desynchronized schedules and is likely driven by parents’ job demands as well as access to and preferences for nonparental childcare. Dual-earner parents with young children are more likely than other couples to work more desynchronized schedules. Yet little is known as to whether their propensity to work desynchronized schedules has changed over time given vast changes in maternal employment and the early care and education landscape over the past 30 years. Using a sample of dual-earner parents with young children from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the authors describe and decompose trends in parents’ work schedule synchronization to show whether, and why, tag-team parenting has changed over time in the United States. The results suggest that tag-team parenting declined by 17 percent to 26 percent between 1997 and 2019. However, these declines were concentrated among households with greater social and economic resources. Occupational upgrading among parents, increases in household income, and increases in the availability of publicly funded early education explained the greatest proportion of the decline in desynchronized schedules. These results point to the affordability of childcare and parental employment demands as key determinants of parents’ work schedule synchronization.",

          "authors": "Ian Carrillo, Annabel Ipsen",
          "abstract": "The authors examine the unique role that racism plays in guiding and structuring anti-environmental ideas and behaviors. They focus on the influence of reactionary colorblindness, which is a legal strategy that promotes race-neutral individuality and activates white resentment in seeking to reverse policies for racial equality. The authors ask, In what ways do anti-environmental policies harness, replicate, and repurpose the logic of reactionary colorblindness? They conduct a qualitative content analysis of a sample of the second Trump administration’s executive orders (EOs). In these EOs, the authors find that the administration draws on reactionary colorblindness as a tool to redefine discrimination and undermine environmental protection in three main ways: (1) the EOs justify eliminating environmental justice initiatives by claiming they confer group-based racial advantages that are antithetical to colorblind individuality; (2) the EOs label diversity, equity, and inclusion, environmental justice, and climate change programs as “forced discrimination” to rationalize policy dismantling; and (3) the EOs adopt a stance of ignorance toward environmental and climate science, thereby rejecting the rationale underlying policies that promote environmental and climate justice. The authors extend debates in environmental sociology and the sociology of race and ethnicity by analyzing how colorblindness and the racism of omission work in service of anti-environmentalism.",
