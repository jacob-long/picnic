          "title": "After DEI: A Different Future for Race, Work, and Policy",
          "authors": "Adia Harvey Wingfield",
          "abstract": "In the wake of organized backlash and federal opposition, many organizations are taking steps to downplay or dismantle their existing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programming. While there are some exceptions, many institutions have largely chosen to retreat from DEI rather than embrace it. This stance has prompted disputes over DEI’s effectiveness, shortcomings, and potential. In this address, I argue that debates over the merits of DEI miss the mark. In an increasingly diverse, multiracial society, the more important question is not whether DEI has value, but what will follow it. Organizational practices in the aftermath of DEI will have heightened significance as work becomes more automated and highly relational, thus producing new ways of maintaining (and challenging) racial hierarchies. To resolve the tension of how best to structure workplaces in an increasingly diverse, yet anti-DEI, climate, I consider various factors that precipitated attacks on DEI and suggest that rethinking policy orientations can help close racial gaps in rapidly changing workplaces. Reducing these disparities can help better equip companies to manage more diverse workforces, creating a more productive economy and maximizing worker potential.",

          "title": "Black–White inequality in earnings losses after job displacement, 1981–2020",
          "authors": "Joshua Choper",
          "abstract": "While social scientists have devoted significant effort to understanding racial economic inequalities, surprisingly little work has examined inequalities in how Black and White workers recover from job loss. Trends in racial inequalities after job loss have not been systematically examined since the mid-1990s, leaving open questions about how economic restructuring and business cycle fluctuations have shaped racial inequalities in post-displacement outcomes. In addition, extant research on racial inequalities in post-displacement outcomes has focused on inequalities among men. I use data from the 1984–2020 Displaced Workers Supplement to the Current Population Survey to offer the first historical accounting of racial inequalities in earnings changes after job displacement since the mid-1990s. Large racial inequalities in earnings losses are explained by Black workers’ relatively low levels of education, employment in vulnerable segments of the labor market, and disadvantage in finding new jobs, but also mitigated by White workers’ large earnings losses due to lost earnings advantages accumulated at their previous job. Among men, racial inequalities in post-displacement earnings increased substantially during the Great Recession, entirely due to unobserved differences between White and Black men. Using Heckman-corrected models, I demonstrate that standard ordinary least squares (OLS) models substantially underestimate racial inequalities in the effect of job displacement on earnings among men due to racial differences in workers’ likelihood of finding a new job—accounting for racial differences in selection into reemployment reveals significant racial disparities among men in the effect of displacement on earnings between 1981 and 2009.",

          "authors": "Christopher Bratt",
          "abstract": "Can aggregated composite scores be used to compare countries or other groups despite measurement non-invariance? We propose a pragmatic approach, emphasizing that measurement invariance is valuable but not strictly necessary for all such comparisons. For descriptive analyses of group differences, composite scores may outperform factor-analytic approaches, because they are more intuitive and can capture multiple dimensions. Using data from the European Social Survey (39 countries, 11 measurement occasions, 546,954 respondents), we examined social and political trust. Composite scores aggregated to the country level were practically indistinguishable from countries’ factor scores based on approximate measurement invariance testing. We conclude that composite scores can suffice for simple group comparisons, though their suitability depends on the data. They can, however, underestimate uncertainty, producing overly narrow confidence intervals. We further show that measurement invariance does not guarantee measurement equivalence. Finally, we highlight how researchers can leverage data even if measurement invariance fails.",

          "title": "Who Is Black? Black Americans on Multiraciality and Black Identity",
          "authors": "Raj A. Ghoshal",
          "abstract": "In his classic Who is Black? One Nation’s Definition , James Davis examined the construction of Blackness from the country’s roots through the close of the twentieth century. In this article the author extends Davis’s project by drawing on original survey data that examines present-day Black Americans’ own understandings of Black identity. The author also examines how self-classification as Black alone, Black-White, and Black-other relates to these measures, to open-ended descriptive self-identification, and to classifying oneself as “multiracial.” Black-alone and Black-in-combination respondents largely concur in how they assess the relevance of one’s self-identification and factors related to biological race conceptions when thinking about whether someone is Black. However, the groups diverge on what importance they give to others’ appraisals and cultural and experiential factors when assessing Black identity; they also differ in their own open-ended racial identifications. In contrast to concerns raised in some prior work, Black-alone respondents do not see multiraciality as disqualifying of Blackness. That the identity difference along which views of Black identity split is unrelated to the topics of the split is striking. The author argues that this Black-multiracial identity paradox may help illuminate how intragroup cohesion is possible alongside growing within-group diversity.",

          "abstract": "This visualization extends previous research reporting a positive effect of prenatal exposure of Democratic presidencies on the health outcomes of Black and White infants in the United States between 1971 and 2018. Using detailed information on race and ethnicity and new data for 2019 to 2024, the authors disaggregate birth outcome rates for Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian babies during a 36-year period between 1989 and 2024. They address three questions: (1) Do the earlier findings extend to this historical period? (2) Is there heterogeneity in effects across racial/ethnic minority groups? and (3) Do the findings for Whites and Blacks mask heterogenous effects by race and Hispanic ethnicity? The results indicate that presidential party effects persist in the recent period and extend to all four major racial and ethnic groups in the United States. All groups experienced better infant health outcomes under Democratic administrations, with the largest effects among non-Hispanic Black infants.",

          "title": "Counting Race, Miscounting Identity: The Census and Hispanic Racial Self-Identification",
          "authors": "Kyle E. Waldman",
          "abstract": "Scholarship posits that the state is the most powerful actor in “race-making” via its institutionalization of racial categories, especially through national censuses. Yet whether census ethnoracial categories correspond to experientially existing social groups crafted through everyday boundary making is an empirical question. When census categories misalign with micro-level boundaries, inferences drawn from census data may seriously misrepresent intergroup relations. Using unique, multidimensional data on self-classified Hispanics in the United States, the author estimates the degree and correlates of (mis)alignment between Hispanics’ racial self-classifications on a closed-ended, census-style race question and their racial self-identification on an open-ended question. The author finds substantial misalignment between racial self-classification and self-identification, with self-rated skin tone and reflected appraisal particularly important for white (mis)alignment and immigrant generation status strongly associated with the use of hyphenated American identifications. The author concludes that although the state exhibits “race-making” power, reliance on census race categories alone misrepresents Hispanics’ ethnoracial boundary making practices, distorting inferences about the larger U.S. racial structure. Including a Hispanic option on the census race question improves overlap between state and everyday racial categories, but a Hispanic racial self-identification is by no means a universal convention.",

          "title": "Delayed Legal Status Incorporation among Student Visa Holders",
          "authors": "A. Nicole Kreisberg, Jennifer Van Hook, Hannah Persaud",
          "abstract": "Student visa holders reflect a large and growing share of the higher educated immigrant population. Although historically considered legally protected, student visa holders’ current precarity raises important theoretical questions about their incorporation. Yet we know very little about student visa holders’ legal status trajectories over time, which is important if we are to understand their opportunities for social and economic incorporation. Using longitudinal data from the National Survey of College Graduates, and multidecrement life table methods, the authors find that half of foreign-born students remain in the United States after 10 years. Yet students have limited transitions to lawful permanent residence. Indian student visa holders are among the least likely to transition to permanent residence. The authors attribute this pattern of “delayed legal status incorporation” to immigration policies, which increase permanent residence wait times for individuals from high-sending countries such as India. More broadly, the authors argue that these results reflect a mismatch between the policy intentions of the “temporary” student visa program and students’ real intentions to stay in the United States long term. The authors discuss the implications of this mismatch for this growing share of young people who are in high demand in the high-skilled labor market, but who face limited pathways to permanent residence.",
