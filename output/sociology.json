          "authors": "Ken Chih-Yan Sun, Lijun Lin",
          "abstract": "Drawing on qualitative interviews with 51 Chinese migrants who live in the US but strive to support frail parents back home, this article analyzes the impact of China’s zero-COVID policy on transnational family caregiving. We argue that the restrictions sending states enforce on individuals’ movement across locales affect migrants’ negotiation of critical family life transitions in unexpectedly complex and challenging ways. This article offers the concept of “linked immobility” to examine migrants’ immobility in relation to their loved ones’ spatial and social constraints. Such linked immobility exposes migrants and their at-home parents to risks, uncertainties, and anxiety. Concurrently, many respondents confronted China’s multi-scalar immobility regime, either from afar by coordinating the care and resources their parents needed, or by braving the trip. Our findings advance the scholarships on transnational migration and immobility by making visible how migrants react to situations where mobility is highly desired but difficult to achieve.",

          "title": "Turning protest into power: how the Women’s March worked",
          "authors": "Jonathan Pinckney",
          "abstract": "How does protests’ size shape their electoral impact? Recent years have seen frequent, loosely coordinated public days of protest with historically unprecedented participation. Yet scholars and activists debate whether even massive protest size translates into electoral outcomes. Resolving this debate is difficult because protest participation is influenced by underlying political conditions, and thus any correlation between protest size and electoral results may be due to unobservable omitted variables. In this article, I conduct a rigorous test of the electoral impact of protest participation in a case that also allows for further insight into the mechanisms for protest’s impact: the 2017 Women’s March. I test the impact of the Women’s March on 2018 county-level election results using detailed geo-coded data on local marches’ location and participation. To address omitted variable bias, I employ an instrumental variables analysis, instrumenting march size with precipitation and temperature data. I find that the number of Women’s March participants had a significant positive effect on the 2018 Democratic party vote share. To understand why, I further test the impact of instrumented march participation on two other variables: the creation of “Indivisible” groups and donations to Democratic politicians. This analysis shows that larger Women’s Marches led to higher levels of sustained organizing and political donations. Rapidly organized, social media–based days of protest can impact elections through activating participants for future political action.",

          "title": "Competing social influence in contested diffusion: contention and the spread of the early reformation",
          "authors": "Sascha Becker, Yuan Hsiao, Steven Pfaff, Jared Rubin",
          "abstract": "The spread of radical institutional change does not often result from one-sided pro-innovation influence; countervailing influence networks in support of the status quo can suppress adoption. We develop a model of multiplex and competing network diffusion to describe how competing actors compete through multiple types of networks. Specifically, we hypothesize three types of contested diffusion: market competition, inoculation, and firefighting. To apply the contested-diffusion model to real data, we look at the contest between Martin Luther and Desiderius Erasmus, the two most influential intellectuals of early 16th-century Europe. In the early phase of the Reformation, these two figures utilized influence networks, affecting which cities in the Holy Roman Empire adopted reform. Using newly digitalized data on both leaders’ correspondence networks, their travels, the dispersion of their followers, and parallel processes of exchange among places through trade routes, we employ empirical tests of our theoretical model. We find that although Luther’s network is strongly associated with the spread of the Reformation, Erasmus’s network is associated with the stifling of the Reformation. This is consistent with a “firefighting” mechanism of contested diffusion, whereby the countervailing force suppresses innovations only after they have begun to spread.",

          "authors": "Oscar Stuhler, Cat Dang Ton, Etienne Ollion",
          "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) is quickly becoming a valuable tool for sociological research. Already, sociologists employ GenAI for tasks like classifying text and simulating human agents. We point to another major use case: the extraction of structured information from unstructured text. Information Extraction (IE) is an established branch of Natural Language Processing, but leveraging the affordances of this paradigm has thus far required familiarity with specialized models. GenAI changes this by allowing researchers to define their own IE tasks and execute them via targeted prompts. This article explores the potential of open-source large language models for IE by extracting and encoding biographical information (e.g., age, occupation, origin) from a corpus of newspaper obituaries. As we proceed, we discuss how sociologists can develop and evaluate prompt architectures for such tasks, turning codebooks into “promptbooks.” We also evaluate models of different sizes and prompting techniques. Our analysis showcases the potential of GenAI as a flexible and accessible tool for IE while also underscoring risks like non-random error patterns that can bias downstream analyses.",

          "authors": "Alexander Helbing, Ivar Krumpal",
          "abstract": "Social desirability bias is a problem in surveys collecting data on norm violations and compliance. If confronted with sensitive questions, respondents systematically underreport norm violations and overreport norm compliance. This leads to biased survey estimates and poor data quality. To improve the measurement of norm violations and compliance, the item count technique (ICT) has been developed. The ICT anonymizes the question-and-answer process. In their experimental survey ( n = 2,510), the authors use the ICT to study norm violations and compliance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe. More specifically, they estimate the prevalence of vaccination certificate falsification and self-isolation with COVID-19 symptoms. Estimates obtained using standard direct questioning (DQ; n = 1,006) are compared with ICT estimates ( n = 1,504). As a result, the authors find no significant difference between estimates of vaccination certificate falsification (4.8 percent with DQ vs. 4.5 percent with the ICT). At the same time, they find a significant difference between estimates of self-isolation with COVID-19 symptoms (87.7 percent with DQ vs. 76.0 percent with the ICT). Conventional survey measures based on DQ thus likely overestimate the extent of norm compliance in a pandemic such as COVID-19.",

          "abstract": "This study examines two questions: whether members of the public perceive discrepancies between economic data and their own assessments of economic conditions and how they explain discrepancies they recognize. Drawing on 78 interviews and 12 focus groups conducted with residents of three U.S. cities, the author finds an overwhelmingly common pattern of interpretation following a logic of double disconnect. People saw economic data as disconnected from reality and irrelevant to their lives. They also understood the ubiquity of these data in media discourse as evidence of elites’ and experts’ own disconnect from the concerns of ordinary citizens. This reasoning was not confined to conservatives or populists prone to institutional distrust but rather commonplace across respondents with varied political beliefs and partisan affiliations. These findings show that the ambiguous meaning of economic data, a factor unrelated to ideology or polarization, is a salient factor consolidating broad-based distrust in media discourse about the economy.",

          "authors": "Peter Valet, Patricia Böger, Jonas Lübker",
          "abstract": "This data visualization illustrates trends in income inequality within and across different contexts in Germany from 2010 to 2022. The authors examine four key contexts in which income inequalities predominantly arise: (1) the national level, (2) the industry level, (3) the occupational level, and (4) the firm level. Using large-scale official data on employee incomes in Germany, the authors compute contextual income inequalities and assess the impact of part-time work by calculating inequalities on the basis of both gross monthly and gross hourly incomes. The findings reveal considerable variation in income inequality across these contexts, with inequality consistently highest at the national level and progressively lower at the industry, occupation, and firm levels. Despite these differences, overall inequality trends remained relatively stable across contexts and income measures. These results have implications for the broader sociological framework on inequality, as they suggest that in Germany, within-firm inequality is not the primary driver of macro-level income inequality. Consequently, efforts to reduce overall income inequality should extend beyond the firm level and also address income disparities at the occupational and industry levels.",

The author examines disparities in the likelihood of holding a STEM degree among college graduates, considering the intersections of race/ethnicity, gender, and immigration status. The analyses reveal that immigrant men and women from all non-White racial/ethnic groups are equally or more likely than their U.S.-born White counterparts to hold a STEM degree. However, compared with the U.S.-born, race/ethnicity and gender disparities are more pronounced among immigrants, particularly the 1.25th generation: those who earned a college degree in the United States after completing K–12 education in their countries of birth. The findings of this study underscore the limitations of social interventions that have narrowly focused on U.S.-born individuals in efforts to foster a more diverse and inclusive STEM workforce.",

          "abstract": "The authors investigate the moderating role of three dimensions of economic hardship on the relationship between maternal nonstandard work schedules (working evening, nights, or weekends) and children’s behavioral and cognitive outcomes at age five in the United Kingdom. The literature on the relationship between nonstandard work and child development in early childhood has not taken into consideration the potentially important role of families’ economic circumstances. Economic circumstances may reduce or amplify the potential consequences of maternal nonstandard work schedules for young children. Using the Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative birth cohort from the United Kingdom, and residualized change models, the authors test associations between children’s cognitive and behavioral outcomes at age five from contemporaneous maternal nonstandard work schedules. Mothers who worked nonstandard schedules had more economic hardship relative to mothers working standard schedules. Nonstandard work schedules were related to higher internalizing behavior scores at age five. The authors examined if observed associations were moderated by income poverty, financial stress, and material hardship, separately, and found that the interaction of nonstandard work with higher levels of financial stress at age five was related to higher internalizing behavior scores. The results highlight a potentially challenging work-family interface in the context of working nonstandard schedules and experiencing economic hardship.",

          "abstract": "Care work, both paid and unpaid, has drawn attention from feminist scholars and activists regarding its devaluation and the growing shortage of workers, especially after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The authors examine plans to enter care work among more than 1 million high school students in the United States and 29 comparison Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, using data from five waves of the Program for International Student Assessment surveys spanning the period from 2000 to 2022. The authors develop theoretically motivated research questions that guide an examination of trends and determinants of adolescent expectations to enter care work. This is the first large-scale longitudinal and comparative study to track youth intentions to pursue care work. A persistent gender gap is evident in both the United States and comparison countries, with young women far outpacing their male counterparts in plans to pursue care work. The authors also find two key mismatches. First, more students plan to pursue care-related professions than there are labor market opportunities in these fields. Second, care professions requiring college credentials are oversubscribed, while noncollege care roles attract little interest. Within care-work fields, interest in medically related care work in the United States increased over the period from 2000 to 2018, while interest in the pursuit of careers in teaching declined.",

          "title": "Cause or Consequence? Evaluating the Evidence for Housing Instability as a Predictor of Adult Well-Being",
          "authors": "Brielle Bryan, Hope Harvey",
          "abstract": "Researchers and policymakers often suggest that housing instability harms well-being across multiple domains. But housing instability can be operationalized in various ways, and whether all forms are equally detrimental—and whether each form causes disadvantage or merely reflects it—is unknown. Using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 data, the authors advance theoretical and empirical understandings of housing instability in three ways. First, they document the prevalence and (lack of) overlap between multiple dimensions of instability. Second, using methods that carefully attend to selection, the authors investigate which forms of instability appear to affect employment, health, and family structure. Finally, they investigate disparities by race/ethnicity, gender, and class background. The findings are mixed. Some forms of instability appear consequential for some outcomes, but not all. The authors find some variation by race/ethnicity, gender, and class. They conclude that housing instability may be a mechanism of inequality, but not one that can be treated as monolithic.",

          "title": "We, Not Just I, Must Trust Doctors: Network Medical Trust and Health Care Utilization",
          "authors": "Tania Ravaei, Megan Bolton",
          "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated associations between social network characteristics and health care utilization. However, understanding the role of network- and individual-level factors together remains limited. We use the Person to Person Health Interview Study (2018–2020) to show network-level and individual-level predictors of two health care utilization measures: having a regular doctor (preventive care) and seeking medical services after an acute health care problem (reactive care). We explore preventive care among the full sample (N = 2,524) and reactive care among the subsample that reported a physical or mental health problem in the past year (n = 885). We measure medical trust as an individual-level characteristic (personal trust in physicians) and a network-level characteristic (average trust in physicians among social ties). Results show that higher medical trust in doctors within one’s network positively predicts both having a regular doctor and utilizing medical services after a health care problem, even after adjusting for known predictors of utilization. Our findings provide support that a network’s pro-medical culture matters beyond individual medical trust for health care utilization.",
