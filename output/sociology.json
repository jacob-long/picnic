          "title": "Invisible secularity: American theism beyond belief",
          "authors": "David Voas",
          "abstract": "It is often asserted that religion is changing rather than declining and that the usual indicators give a misleading impression of growing secularity. The evidence presented here suggests that on the contrary, social measures like affiliation and attendance may understate the weakening of personal religiosity. The apparent persistence of belief in God conceals erosion in its substance, strength, salience, and stability. The levels of religiosity and spirituality among the religiously unaffiliated are declining, notwithstanding the rapid expansion in their numbers. Moreover, belief has not just diminished among Americans who no longer belong to religious organizations: it is fading from one generation to the next among people who continue to belong. Americans are becoming less confident in the existence of God, less persuaded that God is active and judgmental, less inclined to see God as important, and less likely to express consistent conviction. Contrary to claims that apparent secularization masks enduring (if unorthodox) invisible religion, implicit religion, diffused religion, lived religion, and so on, the evidence shows that continuing religious involvement disguises waning religiosity. The research is based on six waves of the Baylor Religion Survey (2005–2021) in conjunction with the General Social Survey (1972–2022).",

          "title": "Conditional inequality and cooptive inclusion: property managers’ labor and the reproduction of inequalities in the market for rental housing",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Korver-Glenn",
          "abstract": "Occupational inequality, including occupational segregation and associated inequities in working conditions, is a key linchpin of structural racial, gender, and class inequalities among American workers. Building on this scholarship, I center workers who are intermediaries and develop the concept of conditional inequality, which signifies the mediating process by which intermediaries’ experiences of and reactions to structural inequities in work conditions affect the experiences and outcomes of other individuals within their purview. Specifically, I examine how marginalized intermediaries within a segregated profession—residential property management—experience their work conditions, how they react to these conditions, and how their strategies to minimize the burdens of these conditions affect others with whom they interact. Using 80 in-depth interviews and extensive ethnographic data gathered among multifamily managers and leasing consultants (almost all women of color) and renters (predominantly people of color), I demonstrate how managers experience little autonomy and acute, renter-oriented burdens in their work conditions. Managers adopted three strategies to minimize the harms of these conditions and, in so doing, generated financial and health consequences among renters. Finally, I explain cooptive inclusion—the process of White, male-dominated industries relying on marginalized people to enact policies that harm other marginalized people—and its implications for the perpetuation of intersectional capitalism.",

          "title": "Is the Welfare State Bad for Citizens’ Moral Character? Beliefs and Evidence",
          "authors": "Kimmo Eriksson, Brent Simpson",
          "abstract": "Conservative thinkers have long warned that the welfare state may weaken society’s moral fiber. But this claim has not been empirically examined. The authors link publicly available data on the sizes of welfare states with behavioral data from a recent study in which thousands of lost wallets were distributed in 40 countries to measure how often they were returned to their owners. A preregistered study ( n = 194) confirmed that U.S. Republicans perceive returning lost wallets as a good indicator of moral character and believe that people’s moral character is worse in countries where the welfare state is larger. Contrary to this belief, the linked data indicate a strong positive relationship between the size of welfare states and moral character: rates of returned wallets were higher in countries with historically large welfare states, net of economic prosperity and economic inequality. The authors conclude with tentative implications and suggestions for further work.",

          "title": "Weaponizing the Workplace: How Algorithmic Management Shaped Amazon’s Antiunion Campaign in Bessemer, Alabama",
          "authors": "Teke Wiggin",
          "abstract": "Scholarship on “algorithmic management” focuses on how employers use algorithms and digital devices to routinely control workers. It also looks at how workers resist this control. But how does algorithmic management affect the ability of employers to respond to collective action? The answer is important because algorithmic management is the “new contested terrain” of labor struggles. Drawing on 42 interviews with workers and court documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, the author examines Amazon’s antiunion campaign in Bessemer, Alabama. The findings reveal that employers can weaponize elements or effects of algorithmic management against unions via repurposing devices that algorithmically control workers, engaging in “algorithmic slack-cutting,” and exploiting patterns of social media activity encouraged by algorithmic management. These findings demonstrate that the labor process can shape counter-organizing opportunities for employers, not just organizing opportunities for workers. They also reveal that algorithmic management has upgraded the antiunion arsenal, while shedding light on other aspects of algorithmic management that have escaped notice. The discussion section presents a framework for researching how other workplace variables shape counter-organizing. The conclusion discusses implications for our understanding of workplace regimes and the future of labor control.",

          "authors": "Melissa A. Milkie, Liana C. Sayer, Kei Nomaguchi, Hope Xu Yan",
          "abstract": "Gender scholars have debated whether the recent movement toward a more equal division of domestic labor is stalling. Using a differential convergence perspective, the authors argue that examining which domestic tasks undergo gender convergence, whose changes narrow the gap, and why changes happen is critical for understanding gender inequalities in unpaid labor time. Using data from the 2003–2023 American Time Use Survey, the authors examine trends in total housework (including core and occasional housework), shopping, and childcare time. Results for married individuals indicate that the historically large gender gap in total housework time narrowed further this century, from a women-to-men ratio of 1.8:1 in 2003–2005 to 1.6:1 in 2022–2023. This shrinking of the gender gap was concentrated in traditionally feminine core housework (decreasing by 40 percent, from 4.2:1 to 2.5:1), particularly housecleaning and laundry. The gender difference in shopping time also narrowed, nearing parity. For childcare time, the gender gap shrunk from 2:1 to 1.8:1, though this change was not statistically significant. Decomposition analyses indicate that women’s reduced housework time was explained mainly by population compositional shifts, whereas men’s increased core housework time likely reflected behavioral or normative changes. With men taking on more female-typed domestic activities, the gendered norms associated with different forms of unpaid labor may be becoming redefined.",
