          "title": "Global Value Chains and Union Decline in Rich Democracies",
          "authors": "Matthew C. Mahutga, Manjing Gao, Roshan K. Pandian",
          "abstract": "This article reassesses the classic thesis linking the globalization of production to union decline. Our argument is three-fold. First, prior literature does not appreciate how the exchange conditions characterizing global value chain (GVC) relations between leading firms in rich democracies and supplier firms in less developed countries (LDCs) can undermine unionization through trade. Second, the worldwide entrenchment of GVCs as an organizational form over time, and cross-national variation in the strength and scope of two key labor market institutions (wage-coordination and Ghent systems), should moderate the effect of LDC trade on unionization. Third, trade with LDCs is endogenous in models of union decline, because high unionization often leads to offshoring. Empirically, we use an instrumental variable (IV) design and a panel dataset covering the longest historical period studied to date. IV estimates suggest that trade with LDCs reduces unionization in rich democracies; these estimates are nearly three times as large as results obtained by OLS, and they increase in size as GVCs entrench worldwide. Estimates also weaken in countries with highly coordinated wage-setting institutions and Ghent systems. Nevertheless, conditional effects and counterfactual histories suggest that GVCs cause union decline even in countries with the most union-friendly institutions, and were more important for union decline overall than either wage-coordination or Ghent systems.",

          "title": "Keeping the Family Fortune: How Bureaucratic Practices Preserve Elite Multigenerational Wealth",
          "authors": "Doron Shiffer-Sebba",
          "abstract": "How do wealthy families preserve their fortunes across generations? A historic peak in wealth inequality in the United States has inspired research on how economic elites benefit from markets, tax rates, and legal entities. However, the ongoing practices through which families maintain their fortunes across generations are less understood. Using six months of ethnographic observations at a wealth manager for the top 0.1 percent, as well as interviews with the manager’s clients and a wider sample of managers, I argue that wealthy families adopt what I call “bureaucratic practices”—activities like meetings, presentations, and signing documents—to preserve wealth intergenerationally. After erecting legal entities such as corporations, trusts, and foundations, wealth managers help wealthy families implement bureaucratic practices. These practices, which privilege bureaucratic form over substance, constitute a crucial behavioral layer atop the legal infrastructure, facilitating a greater degree of wealth preservation compared with using entities alone. Thus, preserving wealth at the top should be understood not merely as a set of discrete transfers from parents to children, but as an enduring multigenerational process of professional socialization that introduces new behaviors into family life.",

          "authors": "Neda Maghbouleh",
          "abstract": "Research on Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) populations in the United States has been shaped by a fundamental paradox: MENAs are statistically invisible in the administrative data infrastructure yet socially hypervisible in other domains. This review outlines key demographic characteristics of the MENA American population and argues that by addressing the invisibility/hypervisibility paradox through innovative research questions and methods, previous scholarship has advanced sociology in three areas: identity, racialization, and integration. As upcoming changes to federal race and ethnicity standards take effect, the invisibility/hypervisibility paradox may shift as sociologists more easily collect and analyze data about MENA Americans. However, this information may be misused, misinterpreted, or handled unethically without sufficient background context and responsibility to community members. Future research will require data disaggregation to explore intersectional and intragroup minority issues, examination of the evolving content and meaning of MENA panethnicity, and ongoing assessment of the MENA group's relative racial position.",

          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer, Felix Bader, Ingmar Ehler, Henning Best",
          "abstract": "Despite ongoing debates on environmental justice, the link between selective residential migration and the unequal exposure to environmental hazards remains underexplored. Previous research has often relied on spatially aggregated data and focused on single-country analyses, limiting our understanding of broader patterns. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2). We find that immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution at their place of residence. The overall disadvantage faced by immigrant minorities in England is three times as large as in Germany. Given that immigrant households start under initially higher levels of air pollution, one would expect convergence with non-immigrant populations over time due to residential moves. However, immigrants face a substantial penalty when moving. If native households started in similar neighborhoods as immigrants—the relevant counterfactual—they would experience higher gains from relocation. Socio-economic factors cannot explain these differences. The pattern holds in both England and Germany, although inequalities in residential mobility are more pronounced in England. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities, such as Bangladeshi, Caribbean, and African migrants in England and Turkish migrants in Germany, experience the largest environmental disadvantages.",

Although prior studies have often relied on binary thresholds such as 40 percent to define “high poverty” census tracts, the author highlights how immigrant-native inequality manifests across the full spectrum of tract poverty rates. In doing so, the author illuminates that inequality is most pronounced in tracts with poverty rates between 10 percent and 40 percent, where immigrants are overrepresented. However, inequality has decreased in recent decades as both groups have seen their distributions flatten. These temporal patterns may reflect demographic shifts in the composition of immigrants, as well as broader shifts in the spatial distribution of poverty. By visualizing the complete distribution of tract poverty rates, the author challenges conventional approaches to measuring neighborhood inequality and provides a richer understanding of residential contexts and immigrant incorporation.",
