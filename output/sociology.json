          "authors": "Berenike Firestone, Ruth Ditlmann, Oguzhan Turkoglu",
          "abstract": "Awareness of past atrocities is widely seen as critical for restoring justice and building resilient democracies. Cultural representations are often deployed by cultural elites to keep the past alive. Yet, we know little about how ordinary citizens respond to them. Through a survey experiment (n = 2198), we measured the effect of three different prototypical cultural representations of the Holocaust on intentions to commemorate the Holocaust, intentions to counter antisemitism, and attitudes towards minoritized groups. We find that all three forms demonstrate overall effectiveness in motivating individuals in support of commemoration and against antisemitism and improving their attitudes towards minoritized groups. We find heterogeneous treatment effects by party affiliation. For far-right supporters, reading about the story of an individual victim is particularly effective. For others, representations that center the sheer extent of atrocities or focus on symbolic justice efforts show a greater effect on action intentions. We repeated the survey with the same respondents three months later (November 2023), following the start of the Israel–Gaza war, and found that means and treatment effects remained overall stable despite the change in context. The results demonstrate the power of cultural representations of historical injustice for motivating people to take action and reducing their prejudice today.",

          "title": "Institutional Decline and Resilient Belief: Understanding Secularization in Latin America",
          "authors": "Matthew Blanton",
          "abstract": "A large body of literature analyzes trends of religious decline across Western Europe and North America. Often rooted in secularization theory—the idea that modernization reduces religious beliefs and practice—this research lacks attention to global, comparative contexts. In this study, the author addresses that gap by examining religious trends spanning two decades across 17 Latin American countries to analyze changes in religious affiliation, church attendance, and religious importance. The author demonstrates that institutional religiosity, measured by affiliation and church attendance, is declining, whereas personal religiosity, measured by religious importance, remains resilient and is even increasing. This fragmented secularization is distinct from patterns observed in Western Europe and the United States. Further analyses highlight additional differences, showing that religious dimensions in Latin America are less tightly correlated and that the religiously unaffiliated maintain stronger religious beliefs and practices than their counterparts in the West. To account for this divergence, the author integrates insights from the neosecularization paradigm with Latin American theories of popular religiosity and lived religion. This synthesis provides a more precise framework for understanding secularization in Latin America and offers a model for applying secularization theory to non-Western contexts, in which modernization unfolds in diverse ways.",

          "authors": "Daisy Verduzco Reyes, Melissa Quesada, Kimberly Garcia-Galvez",
          "abstract": "The coronavirus pandemic drastically reshaped how much of society functioned. Most of these changes were unfortunate in some way, but one change welcomed by many was the student loan repayment pause. This pause was enacted as relief given the pandemic’s effects on the economy and people’s financial standing. Approximately 35 million borrowers qualified and received, at least temporarily, not only some financial but also emotional respite from the heavy burden of debt. How was the repayment pause received emotionally by Latinx millennial borrowers? How did these borrowers feel before and then during the pause? Drawing on interviews from two waves of data collection—one in 2018 and another in 2022—the authors found an increased sense of agency among borrowers as well as an expanded spectrum of emotions, ranging from positive feelings of optimism to a more critical analysis of the student loan system during the repayment pause.",
