          "authors": "Daniel Scott Smith, Neha Nayak Kennard, Tianyu Du, Daniel A. McFarland",
          "abstract": "Tens of thousands of scientists contribute to peer review as journal editors and reviewers of the millions of manuscripts submitted every year. How do they decide what is quality work? What values do they apply in evaluating which science merits publication and which does not? How do they respond to dissensus and uncertainty? Who has the greatest influence over the final outcome? This study combines close reading with large language models to analyze 80,000 reviews of 28,000 accepted and rejected manuscripts in engineering and the life sciences. By following reviewers’ value judgments and editorial decisions, we come to a different view of how epistemic cultures are practiced in journal science. Instead of a consensual dialogue revealing salient norms, we find reviewers differently weigh (“commensurate”) their judgments to attribute value to works. Their pluralistic viewpoints elevate uncertainty about the work, and editors respond by aligning with the most negative of reviewers. Surprisingly, we observe engineers and life scientists find the same epistemic criteria are salient, valued, and influential, with novelty and accuracy being primary. These results underscore how contingency and uncertainty are structural features of STEM peer review and essential to its effectiveness and legitimacy.",

          "authors": "Ilana M. Horwitz, Kaylee T. Matheny, Krystal Laryea, Landon Schnabel",
          "abstract": "We respond to Brady, Luft, and Zuckerman Sivan’s critique of how religious subcultures—particularly Jewish upbringing—shape educational attainment. Their reanalysis, while differently specified, reinforces our central finding: adolescents with Jewish upbringing demonstrate higher rates of college completion and selective institution attendance. We defend our use of a multidimensional SES index—including income, education, and occupational prestige—grounded in stratification research, and we consider the theoretical and empirical utility of their proposed alternatives. Yet their replication overlooks the qualitative evidence central to our argument: the role of self-concept congruence, or the alignment between one’s identity and educational trajectory. Among girls with at least one Jewish parent, we find that attending a selective college is not simply an instrumental goal but part of who they envision themselves becoming. This congruence is shaped by a habitus rooted not only in social class but also in Jewish upbringing. In contrast, similarly positioned non-Jewish peers do not express the same identity-education alignment. We also respond to their concern that our work risks essentialism or reflects “culture of poverty” arguments. Our study explicitly avoids attributing educational outcomes to ascribed group identity. Instead, we identify clear, transferable mechanisms, including habitus and self-concept congruence, through which religious subcultures influence educational trajectories. These mechanisms are socially transmitted, shaped by family culture and broader structural contexts, and portable across groups and settings. By addressing these critiques, we contribute to debates about how culture shapes stratification without reducing outcomes to group-based determinism.",

          "abstract": "Who receives child custody—mother, father, or both—offers insight into family institutions and gender dynamics. Analyzing over 220,000 digitized divorce decrees from China’s patrilineal family system, this study reveals a paradox: despite mothers serving as primary caregivers, fathers more frequently obtain custody. Two institutional pillars of patrilineage explain this outcome. First, paternal grandparents commonly assume childcare responsibilities as fathers’ proxies, reducing mothers’ custody prospects. Second, fathers’ predominant ownership of the marital home creates additional barriers for mothers seeking custody. This paternal advantage intensifies in cases involving sons and in rural areas. Among families with multiple children, split custody arrangements predominate, typically allocating sons to fathers and daughters to mothers. These findings illuminate the interplay between family law, patrilineal tradition, and gender inequality.",

          "authors": "Lacee A Satcher",
          "abstract": "What does attachment to place look like in neighborhoods marked by disinvestment? Drawing on nineteen in-depth interviews with Black public housing residents of a predominantly Black, resource-scarce urban neighborhood, this study explores the affective, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions of place attachment, the factors that drive attachment, and its relation to residential mobility desires. Findings reveal that place attachment is shaped less by physical infrastructure than by social ties, meaningful activities, and shared experiences. Residents’ connections to place are complex, as explanations for mobility desires vary across feelings of duty, affection, frustration, and grief. While some residents desire to leave for better conditions, others exhibit strong sentimental connections that motivate them to stay. This study highlights place attachment as a socially embedded process, particularly in contexts of shared struggle and physical proximity, such as public housing. Findings challenge frameworks that interpret immobility solely as the result of structural constraint or mobility solely as escape, complicating deficit-based portrayals of urban Black life by foregrounding residents’ emotions, memory, and agency. These findings advance theoretical understandings of Black placemaking, residential decision-making, and urban inequality, demonstrating the relational and recursive nature of human-place bonds under conditions shaped by racial capitalism. Findings also underscore the need for housing policy that recognizes emotional attachments to place and the social infrastructures that sustain them.",

          "title": "The global rise in children’s attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder prevalence: a macro-sociological explanation",
          "authors": "Irem Tuncer-Ebetürk, Jessica Kim, Yasemin Nuhoğlu Soysal",
          "abstract": "In the past three decades, the global diagnosis rate of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has grown drastically. While existing sociological studies demonstrate the complexity of ADHD diagnoses and treatment in specific national contexts, their ability to explain ADHD’s global growth is limited. In this article, starting from a macro-sociological perspective and drawing on world society theory, we empirically investigate the prevalence of ADHD diagnosis rates across 135 countries from 1996 to 2019. We find that the increasing rates of ADHD diagnosis worldwide since the 1990s are linked to two interconnected global cultural processes: (1) the global rise and institutionalization of child-centered cultural perspectives and (2) the global diffusion of narratives that define ADHD as a health condition impairing children’s well-being and development. Our findings do not support alternative explanations such as a nation’s level of development (measured by GDP, poverty, democracy, and tertiary enrollment rates) or healthcare quality and universal access. These findings highlight the substantial influence of global conceptions of childhood and health on ADHD prevalence rates worldwide, while downplaying the importance of national conditions. We contribute to the existing sociological literature on ADHD in two key ways. First, by conducting the first cross-national, longitudinal study of ADHD worldwide we provide novel insights about ADHD prevalence at the world level while identifying the key global factors driving this trend. Second, in merging the existing ADHD literature with the analytical frameworks advanced by world society theory, we introduce a new conceptualization of ADHD as not only a medical disability but also a global cultural phenomenon and institutional priority.",
