          "title": "(Not) Getting What You Deserve: How Misrecognized Evaluators Reproduce Misrecognition in Peer Evaluations",
          "authors": "Mabel Abraham, Tristan L. Botelho, James T. Carter",
          "abstract": "In most evaluation systems—such as those governing the allocation of prestigious awards—the evaluator’s primary task is to reward the highest quality candidates. However, these systems are imperfect; top performers may not be acknowledged and thus be underrecognized, and low performers may receive unwarranted recognition and thus be overrecognized. An important feature of many evaluation systems is that people alternate between being candidates and being evaluators. How does experiencing misrecognition as a candidate affect how people subsequently evaluate others? We develop novel theory that underrecognition and overrecognition lead people to reproduce those experiences when they are evaluators. Across three studies—a quasi-natural experiment and two preregistered, multistage experiments, we find that underrecognized evaluators are less likely to grant recognition to others—even to the highest-performing candidates. Conversely, overrecognized evaluators are more likely to grant rewards to others—even to the lowest-performing candidates. Whereas underrecognized evaluator behavior is driven by individuals’ perceptions that their experience was unfair, overrecognized evaluator behavior is driven by the informational cues people glean on how to evaluate others. Thus, in evaluation processes where people oscillate between being the evaluated and being the evaluator, we show how and why seemingly innocuous initial inefficiencies are reproduced in subsequent evaluations.",

          "title": "Essentializing Merit: Disability and Exclusion in Elite Private School Admissions",
          "authors": "Estela B. Diaz, Lauren A. Rivera",
          "abstract": "Historically, elite schools have selected students in ways that reproduce advantages for dominant groups and exclude groups deemed undesirable. The specific outgroup in question has changed over time, but the underlying logic used to exclude these groups is often related to disability. Yet, disability as a social category has received minimal attention in discussions of elite reproduction. In this article, we draw on qualitative data collected from elite independent pre-K–12 schools to show that disability is indeed a salient basis of selection into elite educational environments, one that begins at the earliest moments of educational sorting: admission to elite early childhood programs. Through interviews with admissions personnel, we show that elite independent schools explicitly structure their admissions processes to identify—and exclude—children who are perceived as having or being at risk of developing any type of disability, regardless of impairment type or support needs. We argue that admissions practices at elite independent schools (1) serve as a form of social closure intended to restrict enrollment to young children perceived as able-bodied and neurotypical, and (2) represent a case of essentializing merit , in which elite gatekeepers construct merit as an intrinsic, rather than achieved, property of individuals.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the relationship between biography, chance, and persistence in accounting for the assembly of an American sociologist. It traces the accumulation of experiences involved in a research journey aimed at explanation of social behavior and institutional change. The process of discovery leading to a new theory may arise from serendipitous observations gained through fieldwork, while new combinations of ideas also emerge from social interactions with acquaintances, colleagues and friends. Cross-disciplinary intellectual trade offers rich opportunities for advances in the social and behavioral sciences.",

          "authors": "Aldon D. Morris",
          "abstract": "This article discusses how my lived experiences led me to become a sociologist studying the civil rights movement and the sociology of W. E. B. Du Bois. It explains my rejection of dominant movement theories and the formulation of my own social movement framework to explain the civil rights movement. It proceeds with my transition to studying the sociology of Du Bois. I cover the origins and substance of Du Boisian sociology. Finally, I conclude by addressing an attempted coup on Du Boisian sociology and defend the viability of this new sociological approach.",

          "authors": "Marta Ascherio, Carolina Aragão",
          "abstract": "In this study, the authors examine whether and how city-level socioeconomic and political context shape racial classification practices in U.S. Black-White families. The authors link IPUMS 2012–2022, American Community Survey population estimates, and presidential election voting estimates to create a dataset that has 19,907 children across 1,135 Public Use Microdata Areas. Results from multilevel multinomial logistic regression models show that although overall parents are most likely to classify their multiracial children as Black and White, parents are more likely to classify their children as a single race in certain sociopolitical contexts: compared with parents in wealthier areas, parents in disadvantaged areas are more likely to classify their children as only White. Compared with parents in predominantly Democratic areas, parents in predominantly Republican areas are more likely to classify their children as only Black. The authors argue that parents of Black-White children promote racial passing in a low-wage labor market, and armoring in anti-Black political contexts. These findings emphasize the salient role of socioeconomic and political context in the construction of race and contribute to ongoing debates on the future of race and ethnicity in the United States.",

          "authors": "Jessica L. Schachle-Gordon, Jonathan S. Coley, Daniel Tetteh",
          "abstract": "A growing number of states have passed laws that ban or restrict diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in higher education; however, little is known about how such laws affect the prevalence of DEI centers and student-of-color groups, which are often housed within DEI centers. Through logistic regression analyses of longitudinal data on DEI centers and student-of-color organizations across 1,756 U.S. colleges and universities, the authors find that anti-DEI laws are associated with schools losing DEI offices between 2020 and 2024. Yet schools in states with anti-DEI laws were more likely to gain Black, Latinx, and Native American groups and less likely to lose existing Black and Latinx student groups. Additionally, anti-DEI laws were not associated with gains or losses in Asian or Asian American student groups. Our study thus suggests that students are organizing to create new inclusive spaces in response to anti-DEI legislation.",
