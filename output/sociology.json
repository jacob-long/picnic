          "title": "Inequality and socio-economic divides in parental transfers to young adults in the United States",
          "authors": "Ginevra Floridi",
          "abstract": "Parental transfers of money and co-residence to young-adult children can serve as means of status reproduction. Yet, the relationship between inequality and socio-economic gaps in these forms of parental support has not been studied. Inequality may widen socio-economic differentials in monetary and co-residential transfers, potentially hindering social mobility. I test the association between income inequality and socio-economic divides in parental support to children aged 22–35 in the United States (U.S.), a context where the economic dependence of young adults has increased over decades of high or rising inequality. I link state-level inequality data to longitudinal data on 39,626 parent–child dyads from the Health and Retirement Study (1992–2018). Using state fixed-effects models I investigate how changes in income inequality within states relate to changes in wealth, income, and educational gradients in parental transfers over time. Socio-economic differences in the occurrence and amount of money transfers widen with inequality, as the probability of monetary support decreases among lower-class and lower-educated parents, while the amounts transferred increase among upper-class and higher-educated parents. Moreover, in times of higher inequality, co-residence is more strongly concentrated among lower-class, lower-educated parents. Previous research indicates that receiving money improves labor and housing market outcomes, while co-residence may restrict economic opportunities among young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds. In light of this, my findings suggest that rising U.S. inequality may hinder social mobility by shifting the socio-economic distribution of intergenerational support.",

          "authors": "Rajaa T. Alqahtani, James Moody, Naurah N. Alhemodi, Mohammed S. Alghamdi, Serene Alhajhussein",
          "abstract": "Smoking declines are uneven around the world, and we have few studies on the correlates of youth smoking in contexts like Saudi Arabia, where declines have been slowest. Using a broadly socio-ecological framework and network data, we report on one of the few studies to simultaneously examine peer, family, and school features associated with smoking in the Saudi context. We find strong and consistent peer and family associations with both occasional and regular smoking via direct modeling (level of peers/family that also smoke) and substantive interactions (lying to parents in the family domain, engaging in unsupervised youth-centric activities, or seeking popularity in the peer domain). Although our design precludes causal claims, our results are consistent with smoking initiation being driven by occasional use surrounding attempts to gain youth social status, whereas regular use depends on implicit family and peer acceptance.",

          "title": "Child Incarceration and Maternal Alcohol Use: Disentangling Within- and Between-Person Processes",
          "authors": "Kaylin Greene, Cody Warner",
          "abstract": "Having a child incarcerated can take a toll on the physical, psychological, and financial well-being of mothers. These factors could, in turn, affect behavioral outcomes of mothers, such as alcohol use patterns. Some mothers might drink to cope with the experience of having a child incarcerated, but others may reduce alcohol use for various reasons. Given these uncertainties, the authors examined the association between child incarceration and maternal alcohol consumption (i.e., any use, frequency, quantity, and binge drinking). Eight waves of nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort were linked with the National Longitudinal Survey Children and Young Adults ( n = 3,837 mothers; 678 had children incarcerated). Multilevel generalized linear regression models showed that compared with mothers with no child incarceration, mothers of ever-incarcerated children were more likely to binge drink and consume more drinks when drinking (between-person effects). In contrast, following child incarceration, women consumed alcohol less frequently and were less likely to binge drink than they were prior to experiencing child incarceration (within-person effects). Additional research should focus on mechanisms that explain these opposing associations to identify protective factors and institutional supports for women whose children have been incarcerated.",

          "abstract": "This article integrates scholarship on determinants of labor market transitions with the flexible modeling strategies available through machine learning. Leveraging population registers from Finland, this study analyzes how well we can predict (un)employment and for whom we can (not) predict. The study finds that the predictability of long-term (un)employment improves when using tree-based nonparametric models compared to logistic regression but that predictability varies substantially across outcome groups. None of the models predict very accurately for the unemployed net of baseline likelihood to be unemployed—a group that is well researched and often of interest when designing policies and interventions. Overall accuracy is driven by the employed while incorrectly predicting most of the unemployed. Additionally, the outcomes for individuals with low parental education are overall more difficult to predict than the outcomes for individuals with mid/high parental education, whereas predicting unemployment slightly improves among the low parental education group.",
