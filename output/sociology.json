          "authors": "Koji Chavez, Katherine Weisshaar, Tania Hutt",
          "abstract": "Discrimination in hiring screening decisions against Black men, Black women, and White women compared to White men has been well-documented in social science research, yet a fundamental aspect of the hiring process—the extent to which job applicants meet the job requirements—has not been clearly integrated into our understanding of hiring discrimination. In this paper, we develop an intersectional framework that conceptualizes applicant-job requirement matching as a form of “proof” that the applicant meets the evaluative standard for the job, and that the burden of proof is unequally distributed across job applicants’ combined gender and racial statuses. White men applicants, who align with the abstract evaluative standard for professional positions, benefit from assumed abilities even without evidence of matching job requirements, whereas Black men, Black women, and White women applicants must match job requirements to “prove” that they meet screening standards. We test this theory empirically with two original experimental studies: a nationally representative survey experiment and a correspondence audit study of accountants. We find that stereotyping and hiring screening discrimination varies across the applicant-job requirement match: discrimination is heightened when job applicants do not meet the requirements, and reduced when matched to requirements. The burden of proof through matching requirements therefore falls to Black men, Black women, and White women—and we find that Black women applicants experience unique outcomes due to their “intersectional invisibility.” This article contributes to our understanding of hiring discrimination and gender and racial inequality in the labor market.",

          "title": "Media Engagement and Avoidance: How Undocumented College Students Exert Agency",
          "authors": "Jenniffer C. Perez Lopez",
          "abstract": "Research has established that the media plays a significant role in nonimmigrant viewers’ perceptions and attitudes toward undocumented immigrants. However, limited scholarship has examined how 1.5-generation immigrant viewers may engage with media in an increasingly hostile immigration policy context. Drawing on 31 interviews with undocumented college students, the author examines how they engage with media and their feelings toward coverage on deportability, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and policy implementation. The findings reveal that undocumented college students are pushed to consider their potential deportability when they encounter media outlets mentioning detention centers, migration deaths, and other immigration enforcement tactics. Yet they can simultaneously benefit from engaging with media to inform themselves about policy developments, attitudes toward immigrant rights, and avoiding high-risk situations by understanding what immigration policies could do to them. Undocumented college students practice agency by either engaging with, curating usage, or avoiding certain traditional and social media platforms to avoid triggering thoughts about deportability. This research fills a crucial gap in media and deportability literature by revealing the differential ways in which undocumented college students’ legal status influences their agentic decision-making regarding traditional and social media.",

          "authors": "Sabine Krueger",
          "abstract": "This article examines gender differences in self-rated occupational prestige in Germany using two indicators: absolute self-ratings and a prestige deviation score that benchmarks self-ratings against societal prestige for the same occupation. Using nationally representative data from the Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung/Bundesanstalt für Arbeitsschutz und Arbeitsmedizin Employment Survey 2018 linked to Microcensus-based occupation measures, the author estimates multilevel models with individuals nested in detailed occupations and conducts Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions. Men report modestly but consistently higher prestige than women. For absolute prestige, the gap is accounted for largely by structural factors. By contrast, for the prestige deviation score, the gap aligns with an unexplained component in the decomposition, suggesting interpretation processes beyond measured structure. Wages, at both the individual and occupational levels, explain the largest share of the gap, while autonomy and perceived career advancement also raise self-ratings. Agreeableness shows a small positive association. Occupational gender composition follows a U-shaped pattern, with higher prestige in male- and female-dominated fields than in mixed ones. The results suggest that pay structures explain most observable differences in prestige self-ratings, while remaining disparities align with gendered interpretation processes.",
