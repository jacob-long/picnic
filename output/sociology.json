          "title": "How public benefits make citizens in Latino mixed-status families: self-efficacy, institutional engagement, and concerted citizenship cultivation",
          "authors": "Luis Edward Tenorio",
          "abstract": "Experiences with public benefits can shape recipients’ feelings (belonging) and enactment of citizenship (e.g., political, civic, or economic behaviors). However, we know less about how undocumented and lawful permanent resident (LPR) immigrants fit within this paradigm. This study, based on in-depth interviews with forty working-poor undocumented and LPR Latina immigrant mothers, reveals striking ways in which mothers described the meanings they attached to the benefits received and the social processes their experiences with benefit programs informed. Many mothers described an increased sense of self-efficacy as mothers and as immigrants, expanded notions of government responsiveness, and shifts in how they understood the citizenship (broadly conceived) of their children based on their experiences with benefits. This was even reported among mothers who used programs often seen as stigmatizing or who had challenges arise in petitioning for benefits. Moreover, mothers conveyed these meanings spurring legal, economic, and civic behavioral adaptations in their lives, deepening their engagement as citizens. They also described how the meanings derived from benefits use produced changes in their parenting practices, describing structuring their children’s time and engagement with institutions, as well as fostering reasoning skills and attitudes meant to benefit their children’s long-term integration. I term such practices concerted citizenship cultivation. For children with legal citizenship, concerted citizenship cultivation focused on developing comfort and entitlement within US institutions, socializing interactions with authority figures, and promoting expanded engagement in society. For children who lacked legal citizenship, concerted citizenship cultivation focused on developing positive identity and deepening engagement within protective institutions.",

          "title": "Equality takes work: a process to understand why women still do most of the household labor",
          "authors": "Inés Martínez Echagüe",
          "abstract": "In the United States, widespread support for gender egalitarianism in the household contrasts with the pattern that women continue to do more household labor than men in different-sex relationships. Existing scholarship has revealed the ways in which different-sex couples justify these unequal arrangements. However, we know little about why women do more labor even when they have egalitarian goals and few structural constraints. I address this question by examining whether and how couples attempt to achieve equality and why they so often fail. Data from 40 in-depth interviews with members of 20 cisgender, different-sex, college-educated couples show that, because unequal household labor patterns are so entrenched, having an egalitarian division of labor itself requires work. I theorize and provide evidence for a process I call “equality work,” the work of creating an egalitarian division of labor, which often falls on women. Equality work includes anticipating inequality, strategizing to avoid it, monitoring equality, speaking up about inequality, fixing unequal outcomes, and withholding work. When men don’t strive for equality, women preserve the relationship by doing the labor their partners do not and revising their ideals. Equality work helps us better understand why women do most of the household labor; paradoxically, doing less requires that women work as well. These findings suggest that women are not passively accepting unequal household arrangements but striving to change them.",

          "authors": "Xi Song, Xiang Zhou",
          "abstract": "Social mobility scholars have long been interested in estimating the effect of intergenerational mobility, typically measured by differences in the socioeconomic status between parents and offspring, on later-life outcomes of offspring. In a 2022 article “Heterogeneous Effects of Intergenerational Social Mobility: An Improved Method and New Evidence,” Luo proposes a new approach called the mobility contrast model (MCM) to define and estimate mobility effects. We argue that the MCM is inherently flawed due to its reliance on the coding scheme used for the categorical variables of social origin and destination. Specifically, when different coding schemes are applied, the estimands defined in the MCM bear distinct meanings, involve different but equally arbitrary constraints, and sometimes yield contradictory results. Moreover, regardless of the coding scheme, these estimands do not adequately capture the sociological concept of a mobility effect. To illustrate this, we reanalyze the Occupational Changes in a Generation Study data used in Luo’s study, highlighting the inconsistency of results when dummy coding versus effect coding schemes are used.",

          "abstract": "Using complete-count register data spanning three generations, we document spatial patterns in inter- and multi-generational mobility in Sweden. Across municipalities, grandfather–child correlations in education or earnings tend to be larger than the square of the parent–child correlations, suggesting that the latter understate status transmission in the long run. Yet, conventional parent–child correlations capture regional differences in long-run transmission and therefore remain useful for comparative purposes. We further find that the within-country association between mobility and income inequality (the “Great Gatsby Curve”) is at least as strong in the multi- as in the inter-generational case. Interpreting those patterns through the lens of a latent factor model, we find that regional differences in mobility primarily reflect variation in the transmission of latent advantages, rather than in how those advantages translate into observed outcomes.",

          "authors": "Haowen Zheng, Siwei Cheng",
          "abstract": "How well can individuals’ parental background and previous life experiences predict their mid-life socioeconomic status (SES) attainment? This question is central to stratification research, as a strong power of earlier experiences in predicting later-life outcomes signals substantial intra- or intergenerational status persistence, or put simply, social rigidity. Running machine learning models on panel data to predict outcomes that include hourly wage, total income, family income, and occupational status, we find that a large number (around 4,000) of predictors commonly used in the stratification literature improves the prediction of one’s life chances in middle to late adulthood by about 10 percent to 50 percent, compared with a null model that uses a simple mean of the outcome variable. The level of predictability depends on the specific outcome being analyzed, with labor market indicators like wages and occupational prestige being more predictable than broader socioeconomic measures such as overall personal and family income. Grouping a comprehensive list of predictors into four unique sets that cover family background, childhood and adolescence development, early labor market experiences, and early adulthood family formation, we find that including income, employment status, and occupational characteristics at early career significantly improves models’ prediction accuracy for mid-life SES attainment. We also illustrate the application of the predictive models to examine heterogeneity in predictability by race and gender and identify important variables through this data-driven exercise.",

          "authors": "Deirdre Bloome",
          "abstract": "Researchers concerned about intergenerational inequalities study absolute and relative mobility (e.g., whether people’s adult incomes exceed their parents’ incomes in dollars or ranks ). Absolute and relative mobility are connected, by definition. Yet, they are not equivalent. Indeed, they often diverge. To illuminate why, when, and for whom such divergence occurs—and why, when, and for whom convergence is possible—this article provides two frameworks for connecting absolute and relative mobility. One framework is formal and one is typological. Both frameworks center micro-level socioeconomic experiences across generations. Illustrative analyses employ these frameworks using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. Results suggest that divergent experiences, like upward absolute mobility despite downward relative mobility, may be more common among more advantaged social groups. Future researchers could use the two frameworks introduced here to further advance our understanding of how intergenerational inequalities evolve differently in absolute and relative terms.",

          "abstract": "Parents cite concerns about safety when making school-choice decisions; however, conceptions of school safety are both ambiguous and racialized. This research provides experimental evidence on the effect of school racial composition on parents’ perceptions of multiple dimensions of safety: socioemotional, violence, biological, and school order. Using a survey experiment in which respondents examine hypothetical school profiles with randomly varied school characteristics such as demographics and school quality, the authors find that White parents overall, across income and political spectra, and with differing endorsements of racial stereotypes, rate schools with predominantly Black, Latine, and Asian populations as socioemotionally unsafe, predominantly Black and Latine schools as violent and disorderly, and predominantly Black schools as biologically hazardous. The results illuminate how these racialized perceptions of multiple dimensions of school safety reinforce stigmatizing narratives of racialized schools that serve to exacerbate school segregation and the uneven distribution of educational resources across schools.",

On the 11th grade survey instrument, questions are offered on both educational aspirations and expectations, which is the first time since 1972 that both questions have been asked on a comparable longitudinal survey in the United States. The instrument then poses two questions that elicit probabilistic forecasts of future educational attainment, which have never been asked of high school students on such surveys. The empirical analysis in this article shows that the first two questions affirm the continuing relevance of the status socialization theory of educational attainment, and related empirical modeling that has been shaped by it, but the two new questions provide support for embracing more recent models that focus on belief formation and uncertainty.",

          "authors": "Noga Keidar, Daniel Silver",
          "abstract": "In the global arena of municipal policymaking, cities do not merely address local concerns but actively engage with other cities in a global relational space, referencing and being referenced by others. Within these networks, certain “model cities” emerge, linking urban transformation strategies to specific city experiences. Although much research focuses on the production of model cities—how they gain prominence and status—less attention has been given to the peer cities that reference them. The authors examine how model cities rise by analyzing “referential styles”: the ways cities express interest in one another. Drawing on urban sociology, cultural theory, and network analysis, the authors propose two propositions to explain the forces that influence referencing styles: the cultural domination proposition, which suggests that the characteristics of referenced cities shape how they are discussed, and the networks from culture proposition, which suggests that referencing cities’ attributes drive their interpretations. Using public art policy documents (1959–2020) from 26 major anglophone cities and computational techniques, the authors investigate the referential styles cities use to discuss one another. The authors find support for both propositions: although dominant cities determine where to look, it is often the attributes of referencing cities that determine how to look that shape the referencing style. These results suggest orienting policy-mobility research more toward the peer-network ecologies that actively construct urban meaning.",

The authors analyze data for a sample of 79 low- and middle-income nations using a two-stage fractional regression model to address the potential issue of endogeneity on the public payment for ecosystem services program measures. The authors find support for environmental state theory that higher levels of payments to users as part of public payment for ecosystem services programs correspond to less forest loss in low- and middle-income nations. The authors also find that a composite variable, which measures key characteristics that may enhance the effectiveness of public payment for ecosystem services programs, has a similar relationship with forest loss in low- and middle-income nations. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical, methodological, and policy implications of these findings.",
