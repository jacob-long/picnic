          "title": "An imperfect match? gender and racial discrimination in hiring and applicant-job requirement matching as an unequal burden of proof",
          "authors": "Koji Chavez, Katherine Weisshaar, Tania Hutt",
          "abstract": "Discrimination in hiring screening decisions against Black men, Black women, and White women compared to White men has been well-documented in social science research, yet a fundamental aspect of the hiring process—the extent to which job applicants meet the job requirements—has not been clearly integrated into our understanding of hiring discrimination. In this paper, we develop an intersectional framework that conceptualizes applicant-job requirement matching as a form of “proof” that the applicant meets the evaluative standard for the job, and that the burden of proof is unequally distributed across job applicants’ combined gender and racial statuses. White men applicants, who align with the abstract evaluative standard for professional positions, benefit from assumed abilities even without evidence of matching job requirements, whereas Black men, Black women, and White women applicants must match job requirements to “prove” that they meet screening standards. We test this theory empirically with two original experimental studies: a nationally representative survey experiment and a correspondence audit study of accountants. We find that stereotyping and hiring screening discrimination varies across the applicant-job requirement match: discrimination is heightened when job applicants do not meet the requirements, and reduced when matched to requirements. The burden of proof through matching requirements therefore falls to Black men, Black women, and White women—and we find that Black women applicants experience unique outcomes due to their “intersectional invisibility.” This article contributes to our understanding of hiring discrimination and gender and racial inequality in the labor market.",

          "authors": "Jiayun Jin",
          "abstract": "This study addresses the complexities of midpoint and non-substantive responses, such as “Don’t Know,” in Likert scale surveys on gender attitudes. While existing research often assumes these responses are neutral or random, this study challenges that notion by applying the item response tree model to disentangle respondents’ attitudes from their response tendencies. Analysis of data from the Chinese General Social Survey shows that traditional gender attitudes are associated with a higher likelihood of such responses, indicating biases in conventional methods. After disentangling these elements, I reassemble them through latent profile analysis to examine the dominant configurations of gender attitudes and response tendencies. Five distinct profiles emerge: Passionate Egalitarians, Genuine Neutrals, Forthright Moderates, Evasive Traditionalists, and Unembellished Traditionalists. Passionate Egalitarians advocate strongly for gender equality, while Evasive Traditionalists use non-substantive responses to conceal traditional views. This study provides a refined approach to rating scale analysis, advancing both sociological methodology and gender studies.",

          "authors": "Alejandra Ros Pilarz, Anna K. Walther",
          "abstract": "Tag-team parenting refers to parents who work nonoverlapping or desynchronized schedules and is likely driven by parents’ job demands as well as access to and preferences for nonparental childcare. Dual-earner parents with young children are more likely than other couples to work more desynchronized schedules. Yet little is known as to whether their propensity to work desynchronized schedules has changed over time given vast changes in maternal employment and the early care and education landscape over the past 30 years. Using a sample of dual-earner parents with young children from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the authors describe and decompose trends in parents’ work schedule synchronization to show whether, and why, tag-team parenting has changed over time in the United States. The results suggest that tag-team parenting declined by 17 percent to 26 percent between 1997 and 2019. However, these declines were concentrated among households with greater social and economic resources. Occupational upgrading among parents, increases in household income, and increases in the availability of publicly funded early education explained the greatest proportion of the decline in desynchronized schedules. These results point to the affordability of childcare and parental employment demands as key determinants of parents’ work schedule synchronization.",

          "title": "Media Engagement and Avoidance: How Undocumented College Students Exert Agency",
          "authors": "Jenniffer C. Perez Lopez",
          "abstract": "Research has established that the media plays a significant role in nonimmigrant viewers’ perceptions and attitudes toward undocumented immigrants. However, limited scholarship has examined how 1.5-generation immigrant viewers may engage with media in an increasingly hostile immigration policy context. Drawing on 31 interviews with undocumented college students, the author examines how they engage with media and their feelings toward coverage on deportability, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and policy implementation. The findings reveal that undocumented college students are pushed to consider their potential deportability when they encounter media outlets mentioning detention centers, migration deaths, and other immigration enforcement tactics. Yet they can simultaneously benefit from engaging with media to inform themselves about policy developments, attitudes toward immigrant rights, and avoiding high-risk situations by understanding what immigration policies could do to them. Undocumented college students practice agency by either engaging with, curating usage, or avoiding certain traditional and social media platforms to avoid triggering thoughts about deportability. This research fills a crucial gap in media and deportability literature by revealing the differential ways in which undocumented college students’ legal status influences their agentic decision-making regarding traditional and social media.",
