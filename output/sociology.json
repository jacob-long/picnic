          "authors": "Alec P Rhodes",
          "abstract": "Drawing on power resources theory and life course theories of cumulative advantage, this article examines the wealth returns to a unionized career. Using longitudinal data on the working lives of US Baby Boomers and comprehensive measures of wealth at midlife, I find that the average wealth returns to unionized careers are substantial, exceeding $130,000 for marketable wealth. The average returns to a unionized career are even larger when defined benefit pension ($378,000) and Social Security benefits ($361,000) are included in net worth. Higher cumulative lifetime earnings, enhanced job security, and greater access to employer-provided benefits partially account for the wealth returns to unionized careers. The wealth returns to unionized careers are concentrated among men, workers without a college degree, and those who worked in contexts where unions were more powerful. Results support arguments that labor market institutions bolster workers’ financial security by facilitating wealth accumulation.",

          "authors": "Monique D. A. Kelly",
          "abstract": "The author examines racial fluidity, defined as ambiguity around racial boundaries and shifting national identification patterns over time, in Jamaica. Using data from the 2010 to 2023 AmericasBarometer in Jamaica, the author explores how skin color and socioeconomic status (SES) influence Black or mixed self-identification and whether racial schemas have evolved. The results show that both skin color and SES are associated with racial identification. Over time, skin color ratings between Black and mixed-race individuals converged, suggesting increased fluidity between skin color and racial identity. Additionally, the relationship between SES and racial identification changed significantly across survey years. These findings (1) expand the study of racial fluidity to a majority African-descended society shaped by ideologies of racial mixing; (2) reframe the role of SES in racial identity through mestizoization or creolization rather than whitening; and (3) highlight intra-Black fluidity, whereby racial identity may diverge from skin color. Overall, the study illustrates how national racial formations shape the malleability of race.",

          "authors": "Anton Törnberg, Victoria Vallström",
          "abstract": "Climate change countermovements (CCCMs) play a central role in spreading misinformation and delaying policy action. Although most research has focused on the United States, less is known about CCCM networks in other national contexts. The authors analyze the Swedish online CCCM using social network analysis to (1) examine its structure and composition; (2) assess potential hierarchical influences, including how narratives flow from global think tanks to informal social media groups; and (3) identify distinct ideological groupings within the network. This exploratory analysis reveals four main communities, ranging from traditional climate-skeptic platforms to conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists. These alliances are asymmetric: although traditional climate-skeptic sites receive substantial attention from other groups, they link primarily to international sources and scientific content, serving as hubs that channel global CCCM discourse into Sweden. This asymmetric convergence highlights how climate denial is embedded within broader populist and far-right networks, not through ideological unity, but through shared antagonism. By mapping the structure and dynamics of the Swedish CCCM, the study underscores the transnational character of climate misinformation and its entanglement with domestic political currents.",

          "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated evidence of racial discrimination in public accommodations. Within urban nightclubs specifically, blacks experience racial discrimination when attempting to gain access, yet little is known about the treatment they receive once inside. To assess whether there is racial discrimination inside urban nightclubs, the authors sent black and white men testers to 30 nightclubs in Chicago to determine whether black men paid more for drinks than white men paid for the same drinks. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative data from our field tests, the authors found evidence that black men paid more for drinks on average than did white men and that nightclub staff members add fees to the cost of drinks for black men but not for white men. The authors contribute to the literature by demonstrating specifically how the diffusion of racial discrimination can affect black consumers at multiple points in the same service encounter.",
