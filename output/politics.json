          "title": "Resistance, Law, and the Limits of the Disobedience Framework",
          "authors": "ÇİĞDEM ÇIDAM",
          "abstract": "In the last decade, many scholars have sought to overcome the shortcomings of the reified conception of civil disobedience that was developed in the 1970s by offering alternative conceptions of (un)civil disobedience. The “disobedience framework” is now so predominant that it is almost unthinkable to refer to any protest involving an alleged infraction of official rules as anything other than disobedience. I argue that this overstretching of “disobedience” rests on the misleading assumption that “intentional lawbreaking” occurs in an uncontested political/legal space; it also ignores that, in certain contexts, activists insist on the legality of their protests even when they defy official orders. Examining how feminist activists in Turkey offer alternative interpretations of existing laws to challenge the legality of protest bans, I demonstrate that folding such protests into the disobedience framework silences protesters, erases their narratives of resistance, and adopts the state’s perspective on the “illegality” of their actions.",

          "title": "Ecological Personhood: A Bridging Approach",
          "authors": "MÓNICA BRITO VIEIRA, SEAN FLEMING",
          "abstract": "Aotearoa New Zealand’s recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal person in 2017 has generated a lively debate. While advocates argue that ascribing personhood to natural entities is a powerful tool for redressing historical injustices against Indigenous peoples and for protecting the environment, critics argue that it is incompatible with Western legal and political systems. In this article, we use Thomas Hobbes’s theory of personhood to develop a novel account of ecological personhood. Hobbes explains how natural entities can be empowered to speak and act through authorized representatives, much as states, corporations, and wards do. Our Hobbesian account has three main payoffs. First, it offers a bridge between different legal orders and ontologies of nature. Second, it explains how “ecoship” is normatively different from corporate personhood and guardianship. Third, it highlights both the transformative potential of ecological persons and the ways in which they can be coopted and subverted.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how racial identity affects legislative responsiveness in Mexico using an email-based audit experiment. Emails from simulated Indigenous, Mestiza, and European-White constituents were sent to all 626 federal legislators to test whether perceived identity shapes replies and their quality. Contrary to expectations, Indigenous-named constituents received significantly higher response rates that were more personalized and helpful than their European-White counterparts, while Mestiza-named constituents showed no significant differences in response rates. We found no coalition-based differences, though power was limited, and responsiveness declined in districts with larger Indigenous populations, revealing how national inclusion norms may be moderated by local demographic and political dynamics.",

          "authors": "Zachary Markovich",
          "abstract": "Existing approaches to conducting inference about the Local Average Treatment Effect or LATE require assumptions that are considered tenuous in many applied settings. In particular, Instrumental Variable techniques require monotonicity and the exclusion restriction while principal score methods rest on some form of the principal ignorability assumption. This paper provides new results showing that an estimator within the class of principal score methods allows conservative inference about the LATE without invoking such assumptions. I term this estimator the Compliance Probability Weighting estimator and show that, under very mild assumptions, it provides an asymptotically conservative estimator for the LATE. I apply this estimator to a recent survey experiment and provide evidence of a stronger effect for the subset of compliers than the original authors had uncovered.",

          "authors": "Gustavo Diaz, Erin Rossiter",
          "abstract": "In experimental social science, precise treatment effect estimation is of utmost importance, and researchers can make design choices to increase precision. Specifically, block-randomized and pre-post designs are promoted as effective means to increase precision. However, implementing these designs requires pre-treatment covariates, and collecting this information may decrease sample sizes, which in and of itself harms precision. Therefore, despite the literature’s recommendation to use block-randomized and pre-post designs, it remains unclear when to expect these designs to increase precision in applied settings. We use real-world data to demonstrate a counterintuitive result: precision gains from block-randomized or pre-post designs can withstand significant sample loss that may arise during implementation. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating researchers’ practical concerns into existing experimental design advice.",

          "abstract": "Clionadh Raleigh, Roudabeh Kishi, and Andrew Linke recently compared their own Armed Conflict Location and Events Dataset (ACLED) to three other conflict event datasets in Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications. In this article, we investigate their claims about what drives differences between the two researcher led projects the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and ACLED. In the process, we address some general issues that arise in event data collection, including the importance of stable definitions, how demands on sourcing varies with the type of data collected, and how strategies for dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity impact the data. Contrary to the claims made in the target article, the differences between ACLED and UCDP in the cases put forth by the authors are not primarily due to differences in sourcing or inclusion thresholds. Analyzing the same cases, we show that most of the differences are due to auxiliary coding rules, standards for source evaluation and misrepresentations of UCDP data in the original article.",
