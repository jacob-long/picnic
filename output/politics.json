          "authors": "Beatrice Magistro, Sophie Borwein, R. Michael Alvarez, Bart Bonikowski, Peter John Loewen",
          "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping labor markets and sparking political debates. Like economic globalization, AI developments promise benefits, including job creation and lower prices, but also costs such as job displacement, raising crucial questions about public perceptions. Will AI, like globalization, challenge existing paradigms and trigger a backlash? Leveraging a conjoint experiment with 6,000 respondents from the United States and Canada, we examine public opinion toward offshoring and generative AI, focusing on the multidimensional trade‐offs between job and price changes. Across all scenarios, respondents are equally or more sensitive to price changes than employment shifts. AI is favored over offshoring, especially among Democrats, highlighting an emerging partisan divide in the United States. Republicans and Canadians show more varied support, indicating AI is not immune to opposition. By focusing on the microfoundations of opinion formation, we identify scenarios that may trigger or temper protectionist stances.",

          "authors": "Gechun Lin",
          "abstract": "In many settings, scholars wish to estimate the similarity of political texts. However, the most commonly used methods in political science struggle to identify when two texts convey the same meaning as they rely too heavily on identifying words that appear in both documents. This limitation is especially salient when the underlying documents are short, an increasingly prevalent form of textual data in modern political research. Building on recent advances in computer science, I introduce to political science cross‐encoders for precise estimates of semantic similarity in short texts. Scholars can use either off‐the‐shelf versions or build a customized model. I illustrate this approach in three examples applied to social messages generated in a telephone game, news headlines about US Supreme Court decisions, and Facebook posts from members of Congress. I show that cross‐encoders, which utilize pair‐ level embeddings, offer superior performance across tasks relative to word‐based and sentence‐level embedding approaches.",

          "authors": "Shane P. Singh",
          "abstract": "Equal turnout fosters equal representation. As such, researchers have long sought to understand what causes gender differences in voter participation. I argue that compulsory voting increases men's turnout relative to that of women. This is because men are particularly receptive to external incentives, while women are more intrinsically motivated. Within Brazil and across countries, I use administrative data to show that compulsory voting increases men's turnout most. I also argue that, due to social desirability bias, nonvoting women are most likely to claim to have participated under mandatory voting. With comparisons of official and reported turnout, I demonstrate compulsory voting increases women's turnout overreporting relative to that of men. By increasing men's relative turnout, compulsory voting could introduce or accentuate representational disparities in favor of men, and this potentiality can be obscured by survey data.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes the anticolonial worldmaking of postcolonial Indonesia's first president Sukarno, during Guided Democracy (1959–1965). Using worldmaking as a conceptual interface, the article offers three interconnected interventions. First, Sukarno's range of anticolonial activity allows for a conceptual advance by revealing three dimensions of worldmaking: discursive, institutional, and dramaturgical. This typology works towards arresting worldmaking's conceptual overextension without sacrificing its generative character. Second, it integrates Southeast Asian trajectories of worldmaking into scholarly discussion of anticolonial political thought. Contrary to other anticolonial figures, Sukarno's worldmaking revolved around a postcolonial vision of global order outside the United Nations. By analyzing Sukarno's contextually specific vision of the relationship between international organizations and decolonization, this article underscores the importance of sensitivity to situated understandings of anticolonialism. Third, this article reorients Sukarno scholarship by inter alia resituating him within the Third World. The article closes by laying out some contradictions of Sukarno's anticolonial worldmaking project.",

          "authors": "Shmuel Nili",
          "abstract": "Politicians and philosophers alike have warned that the spread of anti‐migrant bigotry in the Western world requires a tragic trade‐off regarding immigration policy: Although millions of asylum‐seekers might be owed admission to Western democracies, there are many cases where they nonetheless ought to be denied entry, because their admission is overly likely to increase the electoral appeal of extreme rightwing figures and parties, thus endangering the host country's liberal democracy. This article scrutinizes this influential view, by juxtaposing electorally driven migration policy with electorally driven military strikes abroad. If turning millions of asylum‐seekers away can be tragically appropriate as a means of thwarting the electoral rise of the extreme right, why cannot the same be true for military strikes overseas that might harm a far smaller number of innocent outsiders? I examine what—if anything—explains the difference between these two cases.",

          "abstract": "While an abundance of scholarly work investigates how economic shocks influence the political behavior of affected individuals, we know much less about their collective effects. Exploiting the sudden onset of a plant disease epidemic in Puglia, Italy—where the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa devastated centuries-old olive groves—we explore the collective effects of economic shocks. By combining quantitative difference-in-differences analysis of municipal data with a novel case selection strategy for qualitative fieldwork, we document the hardship caused by the outbreak, and estimate a 2.2-percentage-point increase in far-right vote share. We show that preexisting public service deprivation moderates the shock’s political consequences through a community narrative of state neglect. These findings highlight that preexisting community conditions shape the political consequences of economic shocks, and that plant disease epidemics—which are becoming more prevalent due to climate change—have important political effects.",

          "abstract": "Do insurgents help or hinder survival of the targets of genocide? A common view in political science holds that insurgents’ presence attracts state violence against civilians. In contrast to this, I use multiple archival collections on WWI and WWII military personnel, Holocaust victims’ records, and testimonies of survivors and rescuers to show that insurgent presence in fact decreased local numbers of Holocaust victims. To ensure that the relationship is causal, I use an instrumental variable exploiting the exogenous number of WWI military deaths, which increased insurgent enlistment in WWII. Case studies of mechanisms reveal that individual insurgents helped the Jews mainly out of “moral” motivations, by using tactics they had developed to fight the incumbent. By zooming out of times of increased counterinsurgency and studying the specific needs of genocide targets, this article nuances existing literature and points to an overlooked source of variation in genocide survival.",

          "abstract": "Our understanding of state development—a term that encompasses both state formation and state building—has grown significantly in the last two decades. In this review, I outline the foundations of the literature and identify major conceptual and analytical advancements since the early 2000s, including the development of capacity investment models, the notion of intermediate institutions, and the emphasis on political agency. This review builds on research employing diverse methodologies, draws on examples from advanced economies and developing countries, and is intended for both novice and experienced readers. After taking stock of the state of the field, I discuss and reflect upon three avenues for further research—the big unknowns: Do civil wars make or break the state? How do economic openness and international hierarchy shape the incentives and opportunities for state building? And what are the perils that highly capable states pose for liberal rights and democratic governance?",

          "abstract": "In the first decades of the twentieth century, the gap in age-adjusted mortality rates between people living in Republican and Democratic counties expanded; people in Democratic counties started living longer. This paper argues that political partisanship poses a direct problem for ameliorating these trends: trust and adherence in one’s personal doctor (including on non-COVID-19 related care) – once a non-partisan issue – now divides Democrats (more trustful) and Republicans (less trustful). We argue that this divide is largely a consequence of partisan conflict surrounding COVID-19 that spilled over and created a partisan cleavage in people’s trust in their own personal doctor. We then present experimental evidence that sharing a political background with your medical provider increases willingness to seek care. The doctor-patient relationship is essential for combating some of society’s most pressing problems; understanding how partisanship shapes this relationship is vital.",

          "abstract": "Across the world, women continue to be underrepresented in parliaments. As gatekeepers to candidate lists, party leaders are in a pivotal position to promote gender balance. But do party elites consider women’s underrepresentation when deciding who to nominate? Leveraging a large-scale conjoint experiment with 1,389 party elites in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, we find that the more underrepresented women are in candidate lists, the better the chances of women aspirants. Awareness of women’s underrepresentation influences selectors for whom promoting gender equality may be a less crystallized priority: centrists and men. Women’s underrepresentation also reinforces preferences for women aspirants among those for whom gender equality may be a core value (left-wing and women selectors) but does not affect those for whom opposing gender equality may bring electoral advantages (right-wing party elites). Our findings shed light on the potential role that signalling underrepresentation may have on party elites’ selection of women aspirants.",

          "abstract": "Public sector worker absence has been cited as a reason for the poor performance of public services. This paper argues that the differential attention politicians pay to public services over their tenure cycle can explain levels of absenteeism. Using the case of teachers in India, teachers and politicians are embedded in a dynamic principal-agent relationship that allows for absenteeism when electoral incentives are not salient and results in increased accountability when they are. I constructed a panel of all schools across India between 2006 and 2018, employed an event study design, and found that teacher absenteeism decreases the year before an election and is higher the year after an election. I found inconsistent effects in the private sector, lending support for a channel of political control in the public sector. Political interference has an effect on bureaucratic performance, and relationships between public sector workers and politicians can ameliorate absenteeism.",

Drawing on the knowledge of about 1,000 country experts, we estimate the size and main geographical location of regime support coalitions and key opposition actors. We also map the social basis of regime support coalitions and opponents, using a 14-category scheme covering various social groups. These data provide a unique quantitative history of the social underpinnings of regimes in the modern era. Using them, we show and discuss the broadening of support coalitions over time, especially in autocracies, the rise of major urban groups, and the relative decline of rural elites in politics, globally.",

          "authors": "Kristina Bakkær Simonsen, Tobias Widmann",
          "abstract": "Political communication on immigration is often highly moralized, with parties making claims to fundamental beliefs about right and wrong. Yet, what drives parties to use this rhetoric remains unexplored. Contributing to research on parties’ positional shifts on immigration, this study examines their strategic use of moral language in immigration discourse. To this end, we develop multilingual moral dictionaries to analyze parliamentary immigration speeches from eight Western democracies over six decades. While party-level factors do not explain moral language use, increased elite polarization on the issue is associated with greater moralization among all parties. Qualitative analysis shows that moral language is used overwhelmingly to attack political opponents, highlighting its divisive nature. These findings serve as a corrective to the notion that extreme, anti-immigrant, opposition parties are the main drivers of the moralization of immigration; instead, the broader political climate crucially shapes party incentives to (de)moralize.",

          "authors": "EMANUELA LOMBARDO, PALOMA CARAVANTES, SILVIA DÍAZ FERNÁNDEZ",
          "abstract": "Democracy and gender equality are increasingly contested in European parliamentary contexts, with the rise of political parties and movements that oppose feminist politics and the rights of women, LGBTI* and racialised people. Existing literature exploring far‐right and anti‐gender actors in institutional settings has focused on their discourse and impact on parliamentary politics and governments. Yet, limited attention has been paid to the feminist responses articulated in parliamentary contexts that face active opposition to gender and LGBTI* equality. This article addresses this gap by analysing feminist parliamentary responses to such opposition, and the factors that enable and constrain these responses, by undertaking a multi‐level comparison between the Catalan Parliament (2021–2024) and the Spanish Parliament (2019–2023), based on content analysis of 21 parliamentary debates and 42 in‐depth interviews. We argue that the capacity of parliaments to respond to anti‐gender, far‐right opposition to gender, racial and LGBTI* equality is structured by macro‐, meso‐ and micro‐level enabling and constraining factors that include the state of democracy and its legacies, state structure, the constellation of anti‐gender and pro‐equality forces, the institutionalisation of equality, and the role of critical actors. By identifying a range of feminist strategies employed in the Spanish and Catalan parliamentary contexts – including ‘knowledge’, ‘coalition‐building’, ‘rule‐making’ and ‘everyday pragmatic engagement’ – this article contributes to developing the emerging scholarly field of feminist institutional responses to anti‐gender politics, thereby advancing the theory of feminist institutionalism, state feminism and anti‐gender politics in parliamentary contexts.",

The impact of immigration on public support for welfare and redistribution has received considerable scholarly attention, but we know much less about how welfare policies shape citizens' views about immigration. We focus on two mechanisms: an instrumental channel and a values‐based approach. Our empirical strategy is two‐pronged. Hierarchical models leveraging variation in immigration attitudes and welfare generosity both between countries and over time (2002–2019) suggest that more comprehensive welfare regimes are associated with more positive views of immigrants. Furthermore, a regression discontinuity design drawing on a natural experiment in Denmark reveals that hostility towards immigrants increased following the announcement of a welfare retrenchment reform. Together, these analyses shed light on how the welfare state influences immigration attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Studies of contentious politics have extensively examined the impacts of protest repression on mobilization, but the implications of repression on economic phenomena have received little attention. This study contributes to the literature by examining the impact of protest repression on business activism. Business activism refers to businesses taking a public stance on controversial social-political issues, a subject that has been understudied in academic research. We examine the effect of protest repression on business activism through the case of the “yellow economy circle” since the 2019 Anti-ELAB Movement in Hong Kong, in which some businesses publicly took a pro-movement stance by labeling themselves as “yellow businesses.” Utilizing a novel dataset containing geographical information about pro-movement “yellow restaurants,” we find that constituencies that experienced tear gas had a higher proportion of yellow restaurants. We provide two explanations for the causal effect, one from the financial-profit perspective and the other from the socio-psychological perspective. The effect of protest repression was more pronounced in constituencies with a higher proportion of pro-movement residents, supporting the financial-profit explanation that protest repression causes business activism when businesses find it profitable to attract political consumers.",

          "authors": "Joseph A. Wagoner, Moussa Diarra, Barbara Barbieri, Matteo Antonini",
          "abstract": "Religious nationalism occurs when people combine their religious beliefs with their attitudes about national politics and identity. Scholars have examined how religious nationalism predicts various sociopolitical attitudes; yet less attention has been dedicated to examining the predictors of this ideology. We report studies exploring the possibility that different images of God predict religious nationalism. Analyses of Waves I ( N = 1076) and II ( N = 1099) of the Baylor Religion Surveys found that US Christians harbor different images of God (benevolent, authoritarian, engaged, and angry) and that believing in a God that is benevolent, angry, and engaged predicted stronger religious nationalism. We partially replicate these findings in a preregistered study using US and Italian Christians ( N = 465). Stronger religious nationalism predicted a conspiracy mentality and more xenophobia across both contexts. The findings suggest that different images of God can predispose people to harbor an ideology of religious nationalism.",

          "authors": "Gaëlle Marinthe, Alice Kasper, Romain Veillé, Fanny Lalot",
          "abstract": "Past research has highlighted the central role of ideology and political values in collective action. This research aims to determine whether, in addition to political ideology , political extremism can promote collective action. Arguing that political extremism may promote political activism per se, independently of its ideological content, we hypothesized an asymmetric U‐shaped relationship between political ideology and collective action, with emotions (anger, fear, and hope) acting as mediators. We conducted two studies in the context of two real‐world social movements in France. Study 1 ( N = 1386) examined collective action against COVID‐19 restrictions, a movement that defended typical right‐wing values. Study 2 ( N = 418) examined collective action against pension reform, a movement that defended values typical of the left. In both studies, we found that the congruent political ideology (right‐wing in Study 1 and left‐wing in Study 2) and political extremism were both associated with greater intentions (Studies 1 and 2) and greater participation (Study 2) in collective action. Anger partially mediated the relationship between political extremism and collective action in both studies. Overall, our results call for considering political extremism in addition to the left/right dimension of political ideology in order to better understand engagement in collective action.",

          "title": "The political is personal: Evidence that self‐other “multiculturalism” normative misalignment affects individual wellbeing",
          "authors": "Mia Cotan Utomo, Luisa Batalha, Emina Subasic, Katherine Reynolds",
          "abstract": "There is much debate about how best to approach ethnocultural diversity in increasingly plural societies. Sustainable co‐existence of different group interests presents an ongoing challenge. In Australia, for example, discussion continues about the merits of multiculturalism (promotion of diversity and recognition of minority rights) versus assimilation (dampening of diversity through conformity to the dominant ethnoculture). The current research examines the impact of these political forces on both minority and majority group members. Can these debates and ideologies get under the skin, so to speak, and affect people's sense of place in society and consequently their wellbeing? A key concept in this research is the degree of (mis)alignment between personal ideology on the one hand and the social normative ideology on the other. Limited research to date has explored the impact of ideological differences on individual functioning. We explore the impact of ideological misalignment in two separate studies using different methodologies (i.e., cross‐sectional N = 195 and experimental N = 96). The results suggest that, for both ethnic minority and majority group members, misalignment reduces sense of belonging in mainstream society, which in turn hinders wellbeing. This was only part of the picture, however, as we find that misalignment can also indirectly lead to positive wellbeing. We argue that this occurs when misaligned individuals are able to find an alternative context for subgroup belonging. Altogether, this research highlights how social normative factors can powerfully impact individual functioning. As a theoretical framework, the social identity perspective provides valuable insights into why and how this occurs. This research is the first to investigate the wellbeing consequence of political misalignment with a focus on cultural diversity. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of the findings, acknowledging research limitations, and providing directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Two studies examined the impact of authoritys positions on intentions for inter‐group contact. In Study 1, a conjoint experiment with 1000 participants revealed that discouragement from government, business and church authorities strongly decreased intentions for contact with immigrants. Conversely, encouragement had a positive but weaker effect. Additionally, indirect support signaled by policies supportive versus non‐supportive of immigrants increased contact intentions. Study 2, a natural field experiment with a large dataset ( N = 12,489), demonstrated that the entry of a far‐right party into the German federal parliament reduced majority Germans' intentions for intergroup contact with refugees. Overall, these findings underscore the crucial role of authorities in shaping intergroup contact intentions and emphasize their importance in psychological research on prejudice.",

          "authors": "Ala Alrababah, Marine Casalis, Daniel Masterson, Dominik Hangartner, Stefan Wehrli, Jeremy Weinstein",
          "abstract": "Panel surveys and phone-based data collection are essential for survey research and are often used together due to the practical advantages of conducting repeated interviews over the phone. These tools are particularly critical for research in dynamic or high-risk settings, as highlighted by researchers’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, preventing high attrition is a major challenge in panel surveys. Current solutions in political science focus on statistical fixes to address attrition ex-post but often overlook a preferable solution: minimizing attrition in the first place. Building on a review of political science panel studies and established best practices, we propose a framework to reduce attrition and introduce an online platform to facilitate the logistics of survey implementation. The web application semi-automates survey call scheduling and enumerator workflows, helping to reduce panel attrition, improve data quality, and minimize enumerator errors. Using this framework in a panel study of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, we maintained participant retention at 63 percent four and a half years after the baseline survey. We provide guidelines for researchers to report panel studies transparently and describe their designs in detail.",

          "abstract": "Anti-LGBTQ+ narratives are deployed by extremist groups with contrasting ideologies, from Jihadis to right-wing extremists and QAnon to Incels (involuntary celibates). Using these different movements as case studies, this article highlights the convergence of ideologically conflicting extremist organizations around antiqueer sentiment. Given the enhanced vulnerability of LGBTQ+ populations, fueled by politically charged rhetoric, this article makes an appeal for more research to explore and analyze narratives through a scholarly lens and link queer issues to current debates in the study of terrorism and political violence. Research should focus on the experiences of queer populations within conflicts abroad and experiences of domestic extremism in the United States. Without adequate attention given to the experiences of LGBTQ+ victims, it is impossible to develop protocols for trauma-informed care for vulnerable populations.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a new concept, constitutional loyalty, which we define as the importance citizens ascribe to their government’s compliance with constitutional rules. Its measurement across countries is challenging due to differences in context, history, and culture. We overcome this challenge by exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic as a setting in which societies around the world face unfamiliar and similar public health challenges, inducing governments to adopt comparable, yet legally untested policies. Based on novel data from a global online survey collected between 2021 and 2022, we show that citizens’ support for COVID-19 mitigation policies declines if a court signals doubts about their constitutionality. We further demonstrate that this effect of constitutional loyalty depends on citizens’ characteristics, such as their confidence in the courts and their moral convictions.",
