          "abstract": "US state legislatures are critical policymaking institutions that are increasingly polarized, yet data and measurement limitations have prevented researchers from understanding how state legislative elections contribute to this polarization. To address this gap, we construct new measures of candidate ideology based on campaign contributions and roll‐call votes, and we use them to offer the first systematic study of the relationship between candidate ideology and electoral outcomes in primary and general elections in state legislatures, 2000–2022. We find that the set of people running for state legislature has polarized substantially in recent decades. More‐moderate candidates enjoy a meaningful advantage in contested general elections, but that advantage has declined somewhat in recent years. At the same time, more‐extreme candidates are favored in contested primary elections. These new measures and data will allow researchers to build on these basic findings to understand how elections function in lower information, lower salience environments like American state legislatures.",

          "abstract": "Political parties' rhetorical strategies play a crucial role in shaping public opinion and electoral outcomes. To gain insight into what kind of arguments parties present to the public, and under what conditions, we develop a model of argumentation where parties compete to persuade voters before engaging in platform competition. Our model allows us to explore when parties present arguments that highlight the strengths of their ideological positions, as opposed to those that expose the weaknesses of their opponents'; when parties try to persuade voters on the same or on different dimensions; and when parties tacitly collude on an dimension, neither truly attempting to change voters' preferences.",

          "abstract": "Measurement is the weak link between theory and empirical test. Complex concepts such as ideology, identity, and legitimacy are difficult to measure; yet, without measurement that matches theoretical constructs, careful empirical studies may not be testing that which they had intended. Item response theory (IRT) models offer promise by producing transparent and improvable measures of latent factors thought to underlie behavior. Unfortunately, those factors have no intrinsic substantive interpretations. Prior solutions to the substantive interpretation problem require exogenous information about the units, such as legislators or survey respondents, which make up the data; limit analysis to one latent factor; and/or are difficult to generalize. We propose and validate a solution, IRT-M, that produces multiple, potentially correlated, generalizable, latent dimensions, each with substantive meaning that the analyst specifies before analysis to match theoretical concepts. We offer an R package and step-by-step instructions in its use, via an application to survey data.",

          "authors": "Theres Matthieß, Petra Vodová, Fraser McMillan",
          "abstract": "Pledge fulfilment studies frequently anticipate that party control of a given ministry increases the chance campaign promises within that brief will be enacted. However, existing evidence is mixed, and few studies have looked beyond ministers’ partisan affiliation. It stands to reason that other personal and political characteristics may influence ministers’ ability and motivation to pursue manifesto commitments from within government. Following the ministerial selection and survival literature, which shows that certain characteristics are prioritized by parties, in this paper we investigate the effect of ministers’ previous political and policy-relevant professional experience on the fulfilment of election pledges within their competence. We test these by combining existing election pledge data with information on ministers’ characteristics in five institutionally distinct, small-to-medium sized democracies: Austria, Canada, Czechia, Slovakia and Sweden. We demonstrate that prior ministerial experience enhances ministers’ capacity to deliver on party policy, but that other characteristics have varying effects cross-nationally.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines European Radical Right Parties’ (RRPs) positions on China using 209 roll-call votes from the VoteWatch Europe Dataset. While previous research suggests RRPs focus on economic issues, this study finds their interest lies in foreign and security matters. RRPs exhibit strong voting cohesion on “Support for Democratic Values” and “International Relations and Sanctions,” but are divided on “Trade and Economic Investment” and do not demonstrate a consistent voting pattern on “Global Cooperation and Development.” Overall, RRPs maintain a somewhat neutral to somewhat negative position, adopting a cherry-picking approach driven more by interests than ideology. Discrepancies between their rhetoric and voting behavior reveal a complex relationship with China, highlighting the need for further comparative studies on their social media discourse and legislative actions.",

          "authors": "Felicia Riethmüller, Simon T Franzmann",
          "abstract": "Social group appeals are a crucial but often overlooked aspect of party competition. Challenger parties differ from dominant parties not only in their issue entrepreneurship and anti-establishment rhetoric, but also in how they approach social groups. Whereas dominant parties can and must use their policy record when appealing to groups rhetorically, challenger parties compensate for their lack of policy influence and long-lasting group ties by using more symbolic group-based appeals, creating affective affiliations with voters while avoiding accountability or dividing their potential base. Similarly, they are more inclined to use negative group-based appeals. Using a most-similar-systems design and a new dataset of 15,460 tweets from German subnational parties, our main finding is that dominant parties, particularly those having held the prime minister’s office, favour policy-based group appeals, while challengers rely more on symbolic appeals. However, differences in appeal strategies diminish during campaign times. Our findings underline the importance of group-based appeals for mainstream-challenger competition.",

          "abstract": "Since the Brexit referendum, two novel political identities, Leaver and Remainer, have gained political salience in the United Kingdom. Some work contends that Leavers and Remainers display great animus toward one another in ways similar to affective polarization (dislike of opposing partisans). However, it remains unclear whether the dislike is as deep as partisan affective polarization and whether these identities are still relevant several years after Brexit. Additionally, it is not known whether Brexit‐related animus is based more on in‐group favoritism or out‐group dislike. Using a survey experiment paradigm to assess different levels of prejudice (based on pre‐registered hypotheses), we find clear prejudice based on Brexit identity in 2019 that is almost unchanged in 2023. Both in‐group favoritism and out‐group animus appear to drive these tendencies, but out‐group animus's effects are more robust. Leavers and Remainers have different motivations for different manifestations of prejudice, but each displays both tendencies at times.",

          "abstract": "The demand for trans people's institutional rights and the approval of the Trans Law (Law 04/3023) has polarized the feminist movement in Spain. In this contentious context, our studies examined the relationship between feminist identity and support for, or opposition to, trans rights among the University community. Two correlational studies (Study 1a = 317; Study 1b = 323) conducted before the law's passage provided opposing results regarding the association between feminist identity and support for trans rights. Building upon these findings, two experimental studies (Study 2 N = 415; Study 3 N = 405) exposed ciswomen to cooperation or conflict narratives and examined their impact on reactive threat, zero‐sum beliefs, and support for pro‐trans or anti‐trans collective actions. Conflict narratives increased reactive threat and zero‐sum beliefs, leading to more anti‐trans and fewer pro‐trans actions. Additionally, a direct positive link was observed between feminist identification and support for pro‐trans actions, while a negative association was found with reactionary actions (opposite for ideological threat). Based on these findings, we propose a series of win‐win strategies to support trans rights and promote peacebuilding and inclusivity in Spanish universities without triggering threat or zero‐sum beliefs in ciswomen.",

          "abstract": "Governments shape policy outcomes using two distinct mechanisms: rules and discretion. A simple decomposition strategy is proposed for distinguishing between these policymaking mechanisms on income inequality in the American states from 1986 to 2020. This analytical strategy is easily applicable to other policy settings. The statistical evidence, for the most part, that income inequality observed in the American states is generally unaffected by both TELs and partisan control of state governments—the lone exception being unified Republican state governments operating under a TEL. The decomposition evidence, however, shows that this is primarily the result of discretionary policymaking differences among partisan governments. This study underscores the importance of disentangling policy mechanisms that jointly occur when evaluating the consequences of government policymaking authority.",

          "abstract": "Using county-level voting data from the 2008 presidential election in New York State, we find evidence that durable cultural factors influence voting behavior. After controlling for contemporaneous socio-economic factors, our econometric models imply that antebellum votes—the 1860 vote for Lincoln and an 1846 referendum on black suffrage—have statistically significant predictive power for the 2008 vote for Barack Obama. Antebellum support for emancipation and the rights of blacks in New York emerged primarily in ‘Yankee’ counties founded by migrants from New England, the descendants of English Puritans. In contrast, so-called ‘Yorker’ counties founded by the Dutch or other groups were less amenable to reforms promoting racial equality. Our estimates indicate that differences in antebellum cultural factors predict an additional Obama vote of 2 − 4% points. This correlation of factors dated some 150 years apart suggests persistence of culture in voting behavior, and the consistency of moral expression in this voting behavior lends support to the ethical voter hypothesis.",
