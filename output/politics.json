          "authors": "Steven Klein, Ethan Porter",
          "abstract": "Sceptics charge that ordinary citizens are not competent enough to sustain democracy. We challenge this assessment on empirical and theoretical grounds. Theoretically, we provide a new typology for assessing citizen competence. We distinguish the democratic values of reliability, accountability, and inclusive equality, mapping the different competencies implied by each. Empirically, we show that recent research, focused primarily on Americans but with some analogues in other regions, significantly undercuts common worries about citizen competence. We then delineate a solutions-oriented, theoretically-informed approach to studying citizen competence, one which would focus more on systemic rather than individual-level interventions.",

          "authors": "Ahmed Hamza, Ko Maeda",
          "abstract": "In contrast to existing binary conceptualizations of ethnic parties, which often depend on arbitrary thresholds and/or expert judgments, we propose a survey-based continuous scale to measure the extent to which a party receives balanced or unbalanced support from a country’s ethnic groups. We present a dataset of ethnicization scores for 409 parties across 24 countries and use examples from Slovak, Israeli, and American political parties to illustrate the utility of our measure. Our proposed method is straightforward to implement and will be valuable for a wide range of future research on ethnic politics.",

          "abstract": "The sentiment expressed in a legislator’s speech is informative. However, extracting legislators’ sentiment requires human-annotated data. Instead, we propose exploiting closing debates on a bill in Japan, where legislators in effect label their speech as either pro or con. We utilize debate speeches as the training dataset, fine-tune a pretrained model, and calculate the sentiment scores of other speeches. We show that the more senior the opposition members are, the more negative their sentiment. Additionally, we show that opposition members become more negative as the next election approaches. We also demonstrate that legislators’ sentiments can be used to predict their behaviors by using the case in which government members rebelled in the historic vote of no confidence in 1993.",

          "authors": "Austin M. Mitchell, Kana Inata, Masaaki Higashijima",
          "abstract": "Why do some protests succeed at obtaining accommodation but other protests are repressed? The content of demands varies widely across protest events although prior research has not accounted for how the demands of protest movements influence outcomes. We construct a theoretical model to study how different types of protest demands impact whether a dictator accommodates or represses. The model explains that income levels of protesters influence the content of their demands, which in turn affect protest mobilization and effectiveness. Lower income classes join economic protests that dictators more often accommodate, but higher income classes join political protests that dictators tend to repress. The model also shows that dictators may be unable to deter limited protests from becoming mass mobilization events, even when there is no uncertainty in the strategic environment. We discuss how the argument explains patterns of protest and repression with illustrative cases across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.",

          "authors": "Xing Chen, Xiaoxiao Shen",
          "abstract": "Depression is a growing concern worldwide, yet its impact on political trust remains underexplored. Using a nationally representative panel survey from China, we find a robust negative association between depressive symptoms and political trust. This effect is amplified by perceptions of inequality, as individuals who see society as unfair are more likely to blame the government for their hardship. The effect is pronounced among potentially volatile groups like unemployed young males, whose tendency to externalize stress can translate distrust into social unrest. Crucially, the effect is also significant among groups traditionally considered better off such as public sector employees, who face intense pressures of ideological conformity in the workplace. This widespread “silent suffering” highlights a critical psychological pathway through which poor mental health, an increasingly pressing issue, can intensify social discontent and weaken regime stability.",
