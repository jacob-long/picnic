          "authors": "Elaine Yao",
          "abstract": "Negotiating factional conflict is crucial to successful coordination: Political parties, rebel alliances, and authoritarian elites must all overcome internal disagreements to survive and achieve collective aims. Actors in these situations sometimes employ hardball tactics to block outcomes they dislike, but at the risk of causing coordination failure. Using a dynamic bargaining model, I explore how the threat and usage of these tactics impact coordination. In the model, two players who prefer different reforms must jointly agree on one to overturn a mutually unfavorable status quo. Neither knows the other's willingness to compromise—whether they prefer the status quo over their less‐preferred outcome. Players who are willing to compromise delay hardball, balancing incentives to preempt the opponent against the benefit of waiting to gather more information. Finally, I identify factors that incentivize players to exercise caution, thereby reducing the incidence of avoidable miscoordination, which results when players preemptively rule out possible compromises.",

          "title": "Vote buying and local public goods provision: Substitutes or complements?",
          "authors": "Jeevan Baniya, Stephen A. Meserve, Daniel Pemstein, Brigitte Seim",
          "abstract": "We seek to better understand the demand side of vote buying: the conditions under which voters participate in, eschew, tolerate, or punish the exchange of targeted material benefits for votes. We ask whether voters perceive vote buying as substituting for local public goods provision in office, or whether they think that candidates who buy votes will excel at securing local public goods. Voters who place great value on future public goods may opt out of vote buying if they believe they are substitutes and punish vote‐buying candidates at the polls. We explore these issues in a nationwide survey in Nepal. Multiple survey experiments provide evidence that Nepali voters perceive vote buying and local public goods provision as substitutes. Voters who hold this view also express a preference for candidates who do not engage in vote buying, implying they prioritize public goods provision, although this latter result is not causally identified.",

          "abstract": "Why do individuals participate in civil conflict? Materialist explanations have dominated quantitative scholarship on the causes and conduct of civil wars. Yet, a substantial body of qualitative, historical, and ethnographic evidence suggests that nonmaterial, ideological motives contribute to individuals' decision to enter combat and their battlefield performance. We bridge these two perspectives by developing a model of civil war recruitment where potential fighters trade off ideological and material incentives to enlist. More ideologically committed individuals are (i) more willing to sacrifice income to enlist, (ii) more likely to exert greater effort in combat and accordingly are assigned to riskier tasks, and (iii) less responsive to changes in enlistment costs. Using detailed biographical data on members of the British Battalion of the Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War, we find support for all three implications. Individuals indeed trade off economic and ideological incentives to participate and perform in conflict.",

          "abstract": "This article summarizes recent scholarship on racial capitalism with an eye toward highlighting the opportunities the lens poses for the field of American political economy. It reviews the origins and evolution of the construct as well as its contemporary developments and critiques. It highlights three areas of generative dialogue between scholarship working at the intersection of racial capitalism and American political economy: first, surrounding the value of studying the political economy through a relational lens; second, involving how mid-range theoretical tools can generate more insights into specific institutional constraints and questions of agency, contingency, and change; and third, how deeper engagement between the two can productively reorient assessments of inequality in American democracy.",

          "abstract": "Do border closures affect political attitudes? While a large body of research has discussed the effects of the COVID‐19 pandemic on nationalism and outgroup hostility, much less is known about how one of the main policy responses to stop the virus, closing the national borders, has impacted political attitudes. We argue that the sudden and unprecedented closures of national borders in the COVID‐19 crisis decreased EU support and increased hostility towards immigrants. These closures signalled that people from across the border are a threat to public health and showed little trust in European governance. We have collected fine‐grained regional data on COVID‐19‐related border closures in Germany that we matched with survey data from the German Socio‐Economic Panel. We rely on a difference‐in‐differences design to estimate the causal effect of closed borders on European identity and outgroup hostility. While we find that border closures decrease EU support and increase hostility towards immigrants, these effects fade away relatively quickly. Hence, our study suggests that border closures have only limited impact on political attitudes. Our findings have important implications for the growing literature on border politics in the EU and elsewhere.",

          "authors": "JAKOB KASPER, GIJS SCHUMACHER, BERT N. BAKKER",
          "abstract": "Measuring affective polarization, defined as the liking for one's political ingroup and the dislike for political outgroups, poses methodological challenges in multiparty systems: evaluations of seven, 13 or even more parties in a survey are costly, time‐consuming and demanding. Some studies therefore use subsets of parties to create brief affective polarization measures. However, it is unclear how this affects the construct and predictive validity of these brief measures, potentially causing problematic inferences. Across 39 countries (), we demonstrate that brief measures that include ratings of only three to five parties can maintain acceptable validity, as illustrated by strong correlations with full measures and consistent associations with political correlates. The construct and predictive validity of brief measures are best when selecting a set of large, ideologically diverse parties. We provide specific recommendations for the effective measurement of affective polarization in different multiparty systems.",

          "abstract": "In recent history, the participation of far-right and far-left parties in government coalition has become quite a frequent occurrence in Europe. While much important work has been done analyzing the myriad effects of this quickening trend, one aspect of their participation remains unclear: what effect, if any, does serving in coalition government have on the party itself? There are clearly many pressures exerted on these politicians post-transition to governor, as factions often develop between those who wish to maintain their radical ideology and rhetoric, and those who instead feel a need to moderate and focus on competent governance. For a variety of strategic reasons, I argue in the aggregate we see far-right and far-left parties moderate while in office. I analyze European party manifestos and find robust evidence of post-coalition moderation. Party manifestos written by these parties in the aftermath of serving as a coalition partner tend to be much more moderate ideologically than manifestos published at any other point in time.",

          "authors": "Annika Björkdahl, Sofia Cognini",
          "abstract": "In the past years, anti-genderism has become a growing force in politics. The word ‘gender’ has become an empty signifier to attack queer and feminist agendas, sexual and reproductive rights but also gender studies scholars and courses. Social media, particularly Twitter stands out in the spread of anti-genderism despite its 280-character limit. Using political netnography and feminist critical discourse analysis, this article maps and analyses discursive patterns in the anti-gender tweets by Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, the two faces of Italian right-wing politics. Applying a Foucauldian theoretical framework on power and knowledge, this article identifies ways of exercising epistemic power, as well as three discursive patterns associated with Salvini’s and Meloni’s anti-genderism, namely, appeals to the traditional family and the protection of children, whataboutism, and femonationalism. The theoretically informed analysis of the politicians’ tweets contributes to a deeper understanding of the Italian anti-gender movement and the relations between power and political language.",

          "authors": "André Luis Leite de Figueirêdo Sales",
          "abstract": "While global discontent with democracy has reached its highest rates since 1995, there is no consensus on what is causing so much democratic backsliding. In Brazil, scholars discussing how to reinvigorate citizens's trust in democratic systems emphasize the need for an understanding of political representation to include issues such as recognition, inclusion, and a thorough assessment of institutional affordances provided by the available instruments for mediation of conflictive political interests. Meanwhile, grassroots activists are exploring the space between civil society and the state to reshape political representation through collective candidacies and mandates. The former refers to organized groups of four or more activists campaigning together for a single seat in government office. The latter involves legislative seats run collaboratively by groups committed to sharing their representative power with their constituents during their term in office. Using abductive reasoning to discuss secondary data and review literature, the paper argues that: (a) growing dissatisfaction with democracy stems from a perceived decline in the ability of its established mechanisms to equitably aggregate and negotiate citizens' diverse interests; (b) power‐sharing, civic imaginaries, trust, mistrust, distrust, and interests are key psychopolitical elements that simultaneously inform citizens' skepticism about democratic institutions and are mobilized to rebuild these mechanisms. Presenting these experiments as products of the Brazilian political system's affordances and highlighting their relevance for creating accountable and inclusive institutions, the paper encourages political psychologists to apply their interdisciplinary tools to study democratic innovations emerging at the intersection of theory and practice.",

          "abstract": "This research explores how individual status positions and changes within an economic game influence attributional biases and support for redistribution. Across three studies, participants were assigned roles as losers, winners, or observers of the game. In a pilot study, losers perceived the game as less fair, attributed others' failures more to external factors, and showed greater support for social game policies than winners. Two follow‐up studies replicated some of these findings and examined the additional effects of status changes, such as moving from loser to winner or vice versa. Contrary to expectations, transitioning from a winner to a loser did not reduce attributional biases or increase support for social policies. Notably, shifting from a loser to a winner position actually strengthened these biases. Consistent with our predictions, participants in stable conditions, like winner–winner or observer–observer, perceived the game as the most fair, while those in the loser–loser condition viewed it as the least fair. These findings highlight how status positions and changes influence perceptions of fairness and support for redistribution, with implications for understanding the psychological mechanisms behind attributional biases and policy support.",

          "authors": "Alexander Langenkamp, Alexander Schmidt‐Catran, Janosch Schobin",
          "abstract": "In recent years, many Western democracies have experienced increased political polarization, eroding social cohesion and, in some cases, heightened fear of violence among the general population. Simultaneously, surveys have found high rates of loneliness in modern societies and that it appears to have an impact on hypervigilance to social threats. This paper links and extends both lines of literature and investigates whether loneliness influences citizens' perceptions of the state of society, namely the presence of societal conflicts and fear of the failure of social institutions. Analyzing cross‐national data from the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), the paper shows that loneliness is associated with high levels of perceived social conflict. A subsequent analysis of panel data confirms that rising loneliness is positively associated with increasing fear of social unrest and failure of social institutions, which supports the idea that loneliness does cause an elevated sense of social conflict and insecurity. In conclusion, we extend the “hypervigilance to social threats” hypothesis of loneliness and argue that loneliness causes universal hypervigilance for social and societal threats.",

          "authors": "Mason Burns, Elizabeth Ray",
          "abstract": "We investigated the hypothesis that the effects of objective and subjective socioeconomic status on Americans' economic and political attitudes are curvilinear in nature, with middle‐status Americans being more economically conservative and more opposed to welfare than linear trends suggest. Across five studies ( N = 9307), including data from Pew Research Data and the International Social Survey Programme, we consistently found that middle‐status participants opposed welfare programs and reported being more economically conservative than linear trends indicated, such that middle‐status Americans appeared more similar to high‐status Americans than previously considered. These results indicate curvilinear effects of status and suggest that middle‐status Americans may be overlooked in research focusing on linear effects of status on political and economic attitudes. Discussion surrounds the potential explanations for these curvilinear effects and the implications of these effects on economic and political outcomes as well as research on related topics.",

          "authors": "Marius Frenken, Roland Imhoff",
          "abstract": "In Western democracies, commentators have noted an unprecedented diversity in protest movements opposing ecological and health regulations, including traditional right‐wing authoritarians alongside conspiracy and spiritual believers. Some of these beliefs appear to be incompatible with one another, since authoritarianism is a hallmark of (extreme) right‐wing movements, while spirituality is typically expected to be more prevalent in liberal alternative milieus. This research aims to examine the co‐occurrence of these attitudes and their connection to the endorsement of illegal and violent protests. The study employed Latent Profile Analyses and moderated regressions on four extensive quota‐based datasets from Germany (total N = 8202), demonstrating that while most participants did not adhere to any of these beliefs, they often co‐occurred. Each of these beliefs was found to independently predict support for illegal and violent protests, even when controlling for anger. The findings suggest that political authoritarianism, conspiracy beliefs, and spirituality can exhibit a high degree of alignment in Western democracies. Moreover, the study discusses the potential implications of these beliefs as a threat to the democratic system, positing that they could legitimize violent protests.",

          "authors": "Kim Backström, Alexandru Cernat, Rasmus Sirén, Peter Söderlund",
          "abstract": "Voters’ issue preferences are key determinants of vote choice, making it essential to reduce measurement error in responses to issue questions in surveys. This study uses a MultiTrait MultiError approach to assess the data quality of issue questions by separating four sources of variation: trait, acquiescence, method, and random error. The questions generally achieved moderate data quality, with 76% on average representing valid variance. Random error made up the largest proportion of error (23%). Error due to method and acquiescence was small. We found that 5-point scales are generally better than 11-point scales, while answers by respondents with lower political sophistication achieved lower data quality. The findings indicate a need to focus on decreasing random error when studying issue positions.",
