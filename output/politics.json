          "authors": "Sean Farhang, Gregory J. Wawro, Michael E. Sobel",
          "abstract": "We study the relationship between trial judge attributes and monetary outcomes in cases brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We define an estimand, the average feature comparison (AFC), that addresses whether or not a case outcome would differ were it assigned to a judge of one type as opposed to another—here male versus female, White versus non‐White, or Republican versus Democratic appointee. We develop a framework for estimating the AFC that takes into consideration which judges are eligible to be randomly assigned to given cases. We find the probability a case results in nonzero relief is greater if that case were assigned to a non‐White judge than to a White judge, but the relief amount is not. For gender (party), we do not find evidence that the monetary outcome of a case would be different if it was assigned to a male (Democrat) rather than a female (Republican) judge.",

          "authors": "Devin Judge‐Lord, Eleanor Neff Powell, Justin Grimmer",
          "abstract": "When elected officials gain power, do they use it to provide more constituent service or affect policy? The answer informs debates over how legislator capacity, term limits, and institutional positions affect legislator behavior. We distinguish two countervailing effects of increased institutional power: shifting priorities and increased capacity. To assess how institutional power shapes behavior, we assemble a massive new database of 611,239 legislator requests to a near census of federal departments, agencies, and subagencies between 2007 and 2020. We find that legislators prioritize policy work as they gain institutional power (e.g., become a committee chair) but simultaneously maintain their levels of constituency service. Moreover, when a new legislator replaces an experienced legislator, the district receives less constituency service and less policy work. Rather than long‐serving and powerful elected officials diverting attention from constituents, their increased capacity enables them to maintain levels of constituency service, even as they prioritize policy work.",

          "authors": "Lena Maria Schaffer, Gabriele Spilker",
          "abstract": "Existing literature posits that attitudes toward immigration are shaped by the impact of migrants on native workers' wages and employment, as well as by various other material, cultural, and social concerns. However, empirically disentangling these influences can be challenging. By taking advantage of the fact that different types of labor migrants, namely either taking residence and working in a country or commuting over an international border, equally affect labor market competition but have different cultural and social implications, we strive to identify the effect of labor migration on attitudes toward migration. We empirically investigate this phenomenon using two experiments embedded within a representative survey in Switzerland, one priming and one conjoint experiment. Results robustly show that natives evaluate resident foreigners more positively than cross‐border commuters and that levels of exposure and fairness aspects explain this preference.",

          "abstract": "Why are some countries more successful at advancing the clean energy transition than others? Existing research, centered on industrialized democracies, often frames international collective action against domestic distributive explanations. This review synthesizes many previous comparative and international explanations in a credibility framework that clarifies when governments can reduce opposition and create climate coalitions. Applying it to both developed and developing countries reveals how institutions, state capacity, and global constraints jointly shape decarbonization trajectories and suggests a new research agenda for the political economy of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Participatory institutions often aim to yield information useful to policymakers, whether about public preferences, problems, or solutions. But how can large numbers of public contributions be processed into interpretable and actionable information outputs? As theorists and practitioners increasingly call for participatory institutions to operate at larger scales, often enabled by new technologies, this challenge only becomes more important. This article reviews recent work on participatory institutions in order to develop several insights: ( a ) that there are different types of information that policymakers may aim to learn and that are relevant to different policy stages; ( b ) that information must be effectively processed in order to be interpretable and actionable for policymakers; ( c ) that there are different types of information processing, depending on the specificity and novelty of the information outputs that policymakers aim to learn; and ( d ) that there are different ways in which this processing can be delegated, whether to experts, ordinary people, or automated algorithms. Better recognizing these differences will help both researchers and practitioners better understand the potential and the limitations of participatory institutions in different settings and with different goals.",

          "title": "Three Is a Crowd: Information and Electoral Coordination in Argentina",
          "authors": "Adrián Lucardi, Agustín Vallejo, Germán Feierherd",
          "abstract": "Successful coordination around a Duvergerian equilibrium requires accurate and consistent information about parties’ expected electoral support. In practice, such information is often unreliable and rarely available at the local level, thus hindering voters’ coordination. In this paper, we leverage Argentina’s Open, Mandatory, and Simultaneous Primary Elections as a large-scale survey of voter preferences. Using data from 135 municipalities in the province of Buenos Aires (2011–23), we show that a narrower margin between the top-two placed parties in the primary increases both turnout and the proportion of positive votes in the general election, while decreasing electoral fragmentation. We further show that the second-placed party in the primary is substantially more likely to win the election than the third-placed one. Also consistent with theory, these effects are more pronounced (a) in concurrent elections; (b) in smaller municipalities; and (c) when the second-placed party is closer to the first-placed one.",

          "authors": "Ida Bæk Hjermitslev, Markus Wagner",
          "abstract": "Research on affective polarization has largely focused on partisanship as the source of political social identities. However, identities also form around ideological divisions such as liberal/conservative or left/right, particularly in contexts where ideological divisions are more permanent than parties. In this paper, we study ideological identities and how they influence interpersonal affect. In our survey ( n = 2152), conducted in Germany, many individuals declare ideological identities, and these are of similar strength as partisan identities. We also run a conjoint survey experiment where respondents evaluate individuals with varying personal characteristics and, crucially, see varying amounts of information: only ideological affiliation, or also partisanship, policy stances, and/or political interest. We find that ideological affiliation matters for how respondents evaluate individuals, even when extensive additional information is present. However, ideology is slightly less relevant than partisanship, while policy stances are privileged over both. Our findings imply that we should broaden our lens in studying affective polarization to encompass political identities beyond partisanship.",

          "authors": "Lucas Geese, Chantal Sullivan-Thomsett",
          "abstract": "Many affluent democracies have pledged to achieve ‘net zero’ greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century. Achieving these targets would denote important national contributions to the international goal of keeping global warming ‘well below’ 2°C as agreed in the 2015 Paris agreement. Yet pursuing the necessary long-term decarbonisation policies influencing individuals’ everyday lives will require a considerable and enduring level of political leadership. But what enables or constrains politicians to perform such leadership? To date, little is known about the factors influencing politicians’ willingness to advocate for decarbonisation measures in the short-term for the long-term gain of climate change mitigation. This study draws on rare data of consumers’ carbon footprints, parliamentary speechmaking, and qualitative elite interviews in a mixed-methods research design to study how the intensity of constituents’ consumption-based carbon emissions influences the decarbonisation-focused behaviour of members of parliament (MPs) in the UK. Our quantitative findings reveal that MPs pay considerably less attention to decarbonisation issues when they represent carbon-intense constituencies. Moreover, this effect is particularly pronounced for Conservative MPs and amplified in marginal seats. The qualitative interview evidence helps to contextualise these quantitative findings, suggesting that MPs consider the decarbonisation of lifestyles a crucial political challenge and that their electoral considerations and party-political contexts play an important role in how they handle this challenge. Overall, our study draws a sobering picture of politicians’ willingness to sacrifice short-term electoral gains for the long-term prospect of net zero, especially for those MPs representing constituencies that could make high-impact contributions to nationwide emission cuts.",

Contrasting sanctions’ costs with other costs – Covid-19 costs and costs imposed on target countries – has no additional effect.",

          "abstract": "New parties have emerged across European democracies, forcing established parties to develop strategies to campaign against them. But how do supporters want their established parties to respond to these new parties? Using survey experiments in 14 European countries, we examine how party supporters react to responses their preferred parties might take to the rise of a hypothetical new party. Our results primarily highlight that voters care about substantive representation. They endorse accommodative responses towards a new party offering a policy they agree with. Thus, the extent to which party responses bind supporters to established parties is highly contingent on the distribution of policy positions among their supporters. Often, established parties must walk a precarious tightrope, balancing the need for unity with some degree of tolerance for dissent. Hence, our results explain why parties accommodate the position of new parties, despite recent evidence that doing so can be electorally detrimental.",

          "abstract": "The article examines the impact of the recent crises – the Eurozone crisis, the refugee crisis, Brexit, COVID-19, and the war in Ukraine – on the structuration of party competition in six Northwestern European countries. Situating the multiple crises in a long-term perspective on the transformation of party systems, we emphasize their reinforcing effect on the structuring capacity of the new cultural divide. In some countries, this divide and its main driving forces have become so powerful in transforming the political space that we observe an emerging multi-polar pattern of party configurations. This pattern is characterized by a green new left opposed to the populist radical right on the new cultural dimension. In contrast, the center-left and the center-right, despite converging, still oppose each other on the economic dimension. Empirically, the article examines election campaigns in Austria, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, drawing on the original PolDem relational content analysis of mass media coverage published before national elections from the 1970s up to 2022.",

          "abstract": "Far-right communication often portrays a division between ‘the people’ and perceived antagonists, potentially fuelling intergroup tensions. A pivotal element is the politicisation of religion: in Christian-shaped regions, far-right parties invoke Christianity as part of Western identity – despite their weak religious ties and growing secularisation. This paradox raises questions about religion’s function in far-right discourse. I argue that far-right parties systematically use a conservative reading of Christianity as a demarcation tool – marking not only Islam but also cultural liberalism as incompatible with a Christian-framed ingroup. Using parliamentary data from Europe, I conduct automated text classification to identify religious markers and their co-occurrence with inclusionary–exclusionary rhetoric across countries and over time. Results reveal group-specific framing, distinct patterns of religious invocation compared to other parties, and links of these patterns to events. This study demonstrates how Christian narratives serve as rhetorical resources for boundary construction, challenging the cohesion of even secularised societies.",

Answering this question, the paper serves a dual purpose within this special issue of Party Politics : (i) introducing the PolDem election dataset used throughout the issue, and (ii) analyzing its convergence with the widely used Manifesto Project data. The newly released PolDem dataset, based on a relational content analysis of newspaper articles published during national election campaigns, covers 15 European countries and 111 campaigns. Focusing on four broad issue domains (economic, cultural, European integration, and political issues) across countries from Northwestern, Southern, and Central-Eastern Europe, the results demonstrate strong convergence in issue positions, except for in political issues related to democracy and corruption. However, the datasets differ significantly in issue salience, especially for less salient, noneconomic issues, niche parties and in less polarized contexts.",

          "abstract": "Is the mainstream news coverage of politics contributing to the legitimization and normalization of the radical right? To answer this question, we focus on two countries (Portugal and Spain) where Radical Right Parties (RRPs) emerged late and developed very quickly. A longitudinal dataset (2015–2024) of newspaper articles was employed to assess the salience of VOX and Chega , their leaders, and four core issues of the radical-right, before and after they first entered the national parliament. A major theoretical expectation was that parliamentary entrance might bolster the media salience of these parties and their leaders vis-à-vis other new political parties. While we find that Chega does indeed receive more media attention than other comparable parties, especially during election times, no such pattern can be detected for VOX. Concerning attention given to leaders, measured as salience and personalization index, we confirm that André Ventura, leader of Chega is given disproportionate attention, while that is not the case for VOX’s Santiago Abascal. Concerning issues, our findings indicate that although notable cross-national differences in media coverage persist, several key issues were already prominent before 2019 (consistent with the agenda-setting expectation) and may have helped advance the radical-right agenda in both Portugal and Spain.",

          "abstract": "Political science is a field rich in multimodal information sources, from televised debates to parliamentary briefings. This paper bridges a gap between computer and political science in multimodal data analysis using audio. The adoption of multimodal analyses in political science (e.g., video/audio with text-as-data approaches) has been relatively slow due to unequal distribution of computational power and skills needed. We provide solutions to challenges encountered when analyzing audio, advancing the potential for multimodal data analysis in political science. Using a dataset of all televised U.S. presidential debates from 1960 to 2020, we focus on three features encountered when analyzing audio data: low-level descriptors (LLDs), such as pitch or energy; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs); and audio embeddings/encodings, like Wav2Vec. We showcase four applications: (a) forced alignment of audio text using MFCCs, time-stamping transcripts, and speaker information; (b) speech characterization using LLDs; (c) custom-made classification models with audio embeddings and MFCCs; and (d) emotional recognition models using Wav2Vec for classification of discrete emotions and their valence-arousal dominance. We provide explanations to help understand how these features can be applied for different political research questions and advice on vigilance to naive interpretation, for both experienced researchers and those who want to start working with audio.",

          "abstract": "Across industries, workers, and the general public, activity by and support for labor unions seems to be increasing, alongside falling membership and legislative losses. How do we make sense of these seemingly contradictory parallel trends? In four studies ( N = 996), we find that support for unions is high in the United States. However, we find that support varies based on both individual‐ and group‐level factors. Specifically, conservatism and system‐justifying ideologies are negatively related to union support, whereas structural attributions for poverty are positively related to union support. We also find left–right ideological differences in union support; conservatives are less likely to support unions overall (but are relatively more supportive of police unions) compared to liberals. In contrast, liberals are more supportive of labor unions more generally than conservatives, and are more likely to support teachers' unions than police unions. Overall, support for unions is high but not generalized; worldviews, ideology, and type of labor differentiate that support.",

In three studies (total N = 4144), we demonstrate that (1) national collective narcissism independently predicts higher need for chaos and anti‐establishment orientation, (2) non‐narcissistic ingroup satisfaction independently predicts lower levels of both contrarian orientations, (3) grandiose narcissism independently predicts higher need for chaos but not anti‐establishment orientation, and (4) vulnerable narcissism independently predicts higher levels of both outcomes. We provide evidence for these relationships in cross‐sectional regression analyses and in panel analyses that examine within‐person construct changes from before to after the 2023 Polish election and better account for time‐invariant confounders. Together, these findings suggest contrarian orientations may reflect a (frustrated) narcissistic demand to be recognized as better than others, both collectively and individually.",

Little is known about whether gender shapes how political elites evaluate potential coalition allies. I theorize that politicians prefer women as coalition partners for their perceived qualities, such as consensus building, trustworthiness, and governance abilities, making them a less threatening option for politicians’ aspirations. Conducting an original conjoint experiment with 979 Spanish mayors, I find that mayors, especially those on the center and left, prefer to form coalition governments with parties led by women. The analysis of the mechanisms suggests that women leaders are perceived as easier to communicate and more competent to govern. These findings suggest that gendered perceptions and stereotypes may play a role in elite decision-making and shaping coalition preferences.",

While these findings have concerning implications for democratic representation, the magnitude and sources of so-called “conservative over-estimation” are poorly understood. We show that a novel approach to measuring politicians’ perceptions—which asks politicians to draw the distribution of their constituents’ preferences, rather than provide a point estimate—clarifies the magnitude and causes of conservative over-estimation. While the vast majority of politicians exhibit a conservative bias, our “perceived-distribution” task cuts the size of this bias in half. Moreover, psychological projection counterbalances conservative over-estimation among left-wing politicians but reinforces it among right-wing politicians. Our results raise questions about existing accounts of elite misperceptions and help to identify the psychological causes of conservative over-estimation.",

Consequently, Länder cabinets are compelled to reallocate spending in response to fiscal stress. This study is the first to systematically investigate budgetary trade-offs between policy sectors in the German states. It examines how declining revenues and rising interest payments alter the composition of subnational budgets and whether political parties pursue distinct spending priorities under fiscal pressure. To explicitly model budgetary trade-offs, the analysis employs compositional dependent variables and applies seemingly unrelated regressions to a comprehensive panel dataset. The findings show that fiscal deterioration crowds out investment in infrastructure, universities and research. In turn, spending on school-based education, domestic security, and social protection gains in relative importance. Yet parties matter under austerity. Bourgeois governments seek to preserve public investment, whereas left-wing majorities prioritise social policies, including early childhood education and care. By combining a theory-driven approach with innovative methodology, the article advances our understanding of how policymakers adapt to financial constraints in a federal setting with limited fiscal autonomy. It contributes to broader debates on public finance, party politics, and policy prioritisation under austerity.",
