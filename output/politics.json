          "authors": "SEAN INGHAM",
          "abstract": "Some scholars argue that democratic stability requires political elites to practice forbearance : roughly speaking, “restraint in deploying their institutional prerogatives” (Levitsky and Ziblatt, How Democracies Die , 2018). The article proposes a novel conception of forbearance as a mechanism of democratic stability. According to this view, public officials exercise forbearance when they refrain from actions of uncertain legitimacy, actions that, while in fact compatible with democracy’s constitutive rules, are not commonly known to be. The argument is that such actions, by provoking divergent reactions among citizens, create uncertainty about the extent to which others are willing to resist breaches of democracy’s rules. This uncertainty undermines their ability to coordinate responses to genuine abuses of power in the future. The article concludes with observations about the normative implications of the theory, introducing the concept of the “Democrat’s Dilemma” to illustrate the difficulties of knowing when democrats ought to practice forbearance.",

          "authors": "JAVIER OSORIO, SUSAN BREWER-OSORIO",
          "abstract": "What explains the demand and supply of criminal governance? Contrary to traditional explanations of criminal governance as top-down control, this study integrates bottom-up demands for assistance and top-down supply of aid and coercion. We argue that the demand for criminal governance stems from civilians’ drive to satisfy their primary necessities, while security concerns motivate criminals to supply governance to prevent civilian resistance. The theory focuses on three main factors: economic difficulties, articulation/resistance capacity, and government response. The empirical strategy uses multiple list experiments conducted in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. On the demand side, results indicate that economic difficulties and civilian articulation capacity shape the demand for criminal aid. On the supply side, criminals largely neglect people’s economic needs. When criminals help, they do it for cheap and to neutralize potential civilian resistance or to compete against the state. However, when economic conditions worsen, criminals revert to imposing lockdowns.",

          "abstract": "Systematized information on the background of policymakers across long time-periods and all geographical regions of the world remains limited. In this article, we introduce Paths to Power (PtP), a new dataset on the educational, occupational, and social background of cabinet members. PtP contains detailed individual-level data – whenever identifiable – on 44,789 cabinet members across 141 countries in the period 1966-2021. This comprehensive dataset will be of relevance to numerous scholars (and others) interested in understanding politics and recent political history, and it enables a wide variety of new, empirically founded insights. We first present how the data is created and then discuss data quality and limitations. Next, we show how PtP is useful for researchers in diverse fields, including comparative politics, political sociology, gender studies, public administration, and international relations.",

          "abstract": "How does right-wing terrorism affect electoral support for populist radical right parties (PRRPs)? Recent research has produced contrary answers to this question. We argue that only high-intensity attacks, whose motives and targets mirror PRRPs’ nativist agenda, are likely to generate a media backlash that dampens electoral support for PRRPs. We test this argument by combining high-frequency survey and social media data with a natural and survey experimental design. We find that right-wing terror reduced support for the radical right party Alternative für Deutschland after one of the most intense nativist attacks in recent German history. An analysis of all ninety-eight fatal right-wing attacks in Germany between 1990 and 2020 supports our argument. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how political violence triggers partisan detachment and have important implications for media responsibility in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.",

          "abstract": "Voters are frustrated by the influence of money in politics. They cannot be certain whether politicians follow the money or the will of the people. Disclosing side income may therefore serve as a means to increase trust in politicians. To investigate whether this mechanism works, we analyze data from a vignette survey experiment on parliamentarians’ side jobs with respondents from seven European countries ( N $ \\approx $ 14,100). Our results show that compared to parliamentarians who are unwilling to disclose their side income, transparent parliamentarians, even those with especially high extra-parliamentary earnings, are seen as more trustworthy and electable. We also find that voters rely on the combined information of the number and type of side jobs (companies versus public interest groups) when evaluating non-transparent parliamentarians. Furthermore, voters’ income, education level, and ideological leaning moderate their perceptions of (non-)transparent parliamentarians. Overall, our findings suggest that politicians’ disclosure of side income benefits representative democracy.",

As social media platforms have become increasingly important for political communication, these questions have gained prominence in the literature on both party politics and social media politics. In this paper, we contribute to these discussions by introducing a new dataset on the social media activity of 498 political parties across 37 countries on four platforms, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, from account creation to the end of 2023. The dataset provides rich aggregated data on posting volume and timing, enabling the study of long-term patterns in platform adoption, communicative patterns, and parties’ online activity. The paper presents the data, provides descriptive and inferential findings on how political parties engage with social media, and outlines several research avenues enabled by this dataset.",

          "authors": "Anthony English, Kesi Mahendran",
          "abstract": "This article offers a novel quasi‐experimental method over two studies for exploring how individuals can navigate politically polarizing discussions to sustain dialogue. Study one ( N = 28) involved in‐person, stimulus‐led interviews in England and Scotland to understand the dialogical political positions being adopted on the UK's post‐Brexit European relationships. Study two ( N = 10) created quasi‐experimental participant pairings on shared political positions before introducing a researcher‐led polarizing rupture to explore how individuals navigate challenging political discussions. These positions and projected polarizing issues are understood via a dialogue sustainment theoretical model, which focuses on: (1) Internalized—social representations of the political issues, (2) Interactive—the political positions adopted during discourse, and (3) Dimensional—the temporal/spatial focus of the interaction. Results show a triad of influences determine how pairs independently sustained dialogue: (1) Shared core positions in the first stages of discourse, (2) Shared‐affective responses to the polarizing issue, and (3) Adopted “distancing” positions to navigate the vexed issue and sustain dialogue. This article considers the implications of this alternative method as a first step for political psychologists in exploring dialogue sustainment in politically polarizing contexts.",

          "authors": "Christopher D. Johnston, David J. Ciuk, Jesse Lopez",
          "abstract": "What drives ideological and partisan divisions in contemporary American politics? An influential line of research suggests they are rooted in disagreement about the nature of morality. While the left uses principles of care and fairness in moral judgment, the right considers loyalty, authority, and sanctity to be additional morally relevant values. This creates a “moral empathy gap” that makes it difficult for people to understand the perspective of their political opponents and fosters intolerance and gridlock. Evidence for moral disagreement between the left and right rests largely on a survey measure with significant limitations—the moral foundations questionnaire. We review the methodological issues associated with this measure and use two alternative strategies to examine moral disagreement in American politics. Across six distinct empirical tests with U.S. adults, we find that moral differences between the left and right are smaller than what is measured with the moral foundations questionnaire.",

By analyzing references in leading political science journals from 1990 to 2024, we reveal a notable shift: a decline in book references (52% to 28%) and a corresponding increase in journal article references (40% to 65%). These findings have important implications for students, the discipline, research libraries, and academia, particularly in tenure and promotion evaluations. They also raise concerns about the depth of analyses and increased specialization at the expense of broader synthesis.",

We utilize public choice theory to explore how emigration can affect origin country economic freedom through voice and exit via absence, diaspora, prospect, and return channels. We then estimate the association between accumulated emigrant stocks and the subsequent changes in economic freedom and the association between contemporaneous emigrant flows and changes in economic freedom and investigate how these associations vary by emigrant skill. We find that for all skill levels, larger emigrant stocks are consistently positively associated with larger subsequent improvements in economic freedom but that at high levels of emigrant stocks these improvements diminish.",

          "abstract": "This study examines whether firms that engage in political activity have greater market concentration. Drawing on public choice theory, we argue that firms pursue political connections to obtain favorable policies that create barriers to entry and weaken competition. Using both univariate and multivariate tests, we find that lobbying firms exhibit market concentration levels that are 7.4% to 10.5% higher than those of non-lobbying firms. These results are robust to the inclusion of year and industry fixed effects, as well as a wide set of firm-specific controls. We further show that firms contributing to political action committees (PACs) display greater market concentration, regardless of party affiliation. The effect is strongest when contributions are directed toward winning candidates. To strengthen causal inference, we conduct a series of difference-in-difference tests around the guilty plea of lobbyist Jack Abramoff, which has been used in the literature as an exogenous negative shock to the pecuniary benefits associated with lobbying activity. We find that lobbying firms experience a significant decline in market concentration, relative to non-lobbying firms, around the event. Together, these findings provide evidence that political activity can causally shape competitive outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Recent work on power sharing and civil conflicts in ethnically divided societies emphasizes the crucial distinction between mandates and their implementation. Formal power-sharing rules reduce the risk of armed conflict, but power-sharing practices mediate this effect. Political scientists frequently categorize proportional electoral rules (PR) as part of the broader class of power-sharing institutions, which should induce power-sharing practices, and in turn reduce the likelihood of intrastate armed conflict. Empirical evidence for this claim is indirect at best. Using mediation analysis, we assess whether PR rules or executive power-sharing institutions (or their combination) engender elite power sharing in ethnically divided societies and reduce the risk of ethnic intrastate conflict. Using different datasets, we find no evidence for a positive effect of PR on power-sharing practices, and some weak evidence that PR reduces intrastate conflict through other mechanisms. Recommendations of PR to ethnically divided societies or post-conflict environments as means to foster inclusion and thus reduce conflict should be reconsidered.",
