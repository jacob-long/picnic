          "authors": "Gechun Lin",
          "abstract": "In many settings, scholars wish to estimate the similarity of political texts. However, the most commonly used methods in political science struggle to identify when two texts convey the same meaning as they rely too heavily on identifying words that appear in both documents. This limitation is especially salient when the underlying documents are short, an increasingly prevalent form of textual data in modern political research. Building on recent advances in computer science, I introduce to political science cross‐encoders for precise estimates of semantic similarity in short texts. Scholars can use either off‐the‐shelf versions or build a customized model. I illustrate this approach in three examples applied to social messages generated in a telephone game, news headlines about US Supreme Court decisions, and Facebook posts from members of Congress. I show that cross‐encoders, which utilize pair‐ level embeddings, offer superior performance across tasks relative to word‐based and sentence‐level embedding approaches.",

          "title": "Political Emancipation and Modern Jewish National Identity",
          "authors": "CARLES BOIX",
          "abstract": "Following the rise of liberalism and nationalism during the nineteenth century, Jewish national identity varied across countries. While Western European and American Jews mainly came to think of themselves as nationals of their country of citizenship, a growing number of Eastern European Jews claimed to be a separate nation with a legitimate claim to self-government. Comparing the evolution of Jewish identities across North America and Europe and leveraging a regression discontinuity design based on the differential treatment of Polish and Russian Jews under Tsarism, I find that their divergent national identities responded to the extent to which Jews were politically emancipated in the country where they lived over the long century that followed the Atlantic Revolutions. Social and economic modernization played a weaker role, suggesting the need to think about national identity formation as endogenous to political and constitutional transformations marking the birth of the contemporary era.",

          "abstract": "Do insurgents help or hinder survival of the targets of genocide? A common view in political science holds that insurgents’ presence attracts state violence against civilians. In contrast to this, I use multiple archival collections on WWI and WWII military personnel, Holocaust victims’ records, and testimonies of survivors and rescuers to show that insurgent presence in fact decreased local numbers of Holocaust victims. To ensure that the relationship is causal, I use an instrumental variable exploiting the exogenous number of WWI military deaths, which increased insurgent enlistment in WWII. Case studies of mechanisms reveal that individual insurgents helped the Jews mainly out of “moral” motivations, by using tactics they had developed to fight the incumbent. By zooming out of times of increased counterinsurgency and studying the specific needs of genocide targets, this article nuances existing literature and points to an overlooked source of variation in genocide survival.",

          "abstract": "Gender influences who has access to power, how leaders behave and are received within institutions, and how institutions are perceived. This review examines gender dynamics in the executive branch, focusing on presidents and prime ministers and their cabinets. We analyze four key areas: access to power, policy priorities, gendered leadership styles, and citizens’ responses. We argue that, despite progress, women remain underrepresented in executive roles, especially as chief executives. Women sometimes bring unique policy interests and leadership styles to the office, but strategic career incentives and institutional constraints shape both men's and women's behavior as leaders. Finally, women's presence in executive positions sends signals about the government, as well as about who is fit to govern and participate in politics. In sum, this review highlights the importance of understanding and addressing these gendered dynamics to move closer to gender equality in the highest levels of political leadership.",

          "authors": "Neil A. O’Brian, Thomas Bradley Kent",
          "abstract": "In the first decades of the twentieth century, the gap in age-adjusted mortality rates between people living in Republican and Democratic counties expanded; people in Democratic counties started living longer. This paper argues that political partisanship poses a direct problem for ameliorating these trends: trust and adherence in one’s personal doctor (including on non-COVID-19 related care) – once a non-partisan issue – now divides Democrats (more trustful) and Republicans (less trustful). We argue that this divide is largely a consequence of partisan conflict surrounding COVID-19 that spilled over and created a partisan cleavage in people’s trust in their own personal doctor. We then present experimental evidence that sharing a political background with your medical provider increases willingness to seek care. The doctor-patient relationship is essential for combating some of society’s most pressing problems; understanding how partisanship shapes this relationship is vital.",

          "authors": "Derek Da Huo, Shen Yang",
          "abstract": "Studies of contentious politics have extensively examined the impacts of protest repression on mobilization, but the implications of repression on economic phenomena have received little attention. This study contributes to the literature by examining the impact of protest repression on business activism. Business activism refers to businesses taking a public stance on controversial social-political issues, a subject that has been understudied in academic research. We examine the effect of protest repression on business activism through the case of the “yellow economy circle” since the 2019 Anti-ELAB Movement in Hong Kong, in which some businesses publicly took a pro-movement stance by labeling themselves as “yellow businesses.” Utilizing a novel dataset containing geographical information about pro-movement “yellow restaurants,” we find that constituencies that experienced tear gas had a higher proportion of yellow restaurants. We provide two explanations for the causal effect, one from the financial-profit perspective and the other from the socio-psychological perspective. The effect of protest repression was more pronounced in constituencies with a higher proportion of pro-movement residents, supporting the financial-profit explanation that protest repression causes business activism when businesses find it profitable to attract political consumers.",

          "abstract": "Do mass mobilizations drive social change? This paper explores this question by studying how the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd’s death influenced the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Using rainfall as an instrument for protest participation and complementary difference-in-differences analyses, we show that protest activity significantly increased Democratic vote share in affected coun- ties. Our research makes three key contributions. First, we show causal evidence for the effect of one of the largest protest movements ever recorded on electoral out- comes. Second, we provide evidence of novel temporal dynamics: while protests ini- tially triggered a conservative backlash, they ultimately generated progressive shifts in voting behavior. Third, we identify mechanisms driving these effects, showing that rather than merely mobilizing existing Democratic voters, protests substantively shifted political preferences and beliefs about racial inequality.",

This research note introduces new data developed from a narcoblog —a citizen journalism website—on more than 450 criminal organizations operating in Mexico between 2009 and 2020. I use the data to test prominent theories of fragmentation, providing suggestive evidence that drug war policies contributed to a more complex conflict: kingpin removals were correlated with the emergence of smaller groups; profit opportunities (in this case, fuel theft) then attracted these organizations to new territories. This research contributes to our understanding of criminal control and informs debates over violence reduction policies.",

One of the longest-standing gaps in the literature has been the lack of work that was pioneered by Ken Sherrill: research that centers LGBTQ+ people and politics as subjects, rather than objects, of study. Here I make the case for sustained scholarly attention to LGBTQ+ political behavior and discuss how quantitative empirical research in this vein is more feasible than ever before. I then provide an example of what is possible today with analyses of the 2022 Cooperative Election Study (CES), a large representative sample survey (complete case N = 45,240; LGBTQ+ N = 5,213) that includes questions about respondents’ sexual and gender identities. The analyses reveal several discoveries about LGBTQ+ people’s political behavior and lived experiences, including that they are no more politically engaged than the typical American, are in much poorer health than any other group, and belying stereotypes, are not of higher socioeconomic status than other Americans. A spatial representation of groups’ positions on the US political landscape shows that LGBTQ+ people are relatively distant from other groups, indicating that they may struggle to find natural coalition partners because of lack of shared interests.",

Given the enhanced vulnerability of LGBTQ+ populations, fueled by politically charged rhetoric, this article makes an appeal for more research to explore and analyze narratives through a scholarly lens and link queer issues to current debates in the study of terrorism and political violence. Research should focus on the experiences of queer populations within conflicts abroad and experiences of domestic extremism in the United States.
