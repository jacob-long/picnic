          "authors": "ÇİĞDEM ÇIDAM",
          "abstract": "In the last decade, many scholars have sought to overcome the shortcomings of the reified conception of civil disobedience that was developed in the 1970s by offering alternative conceptions of (un)civil disobedience. The “disobedience framework” is now so predominant that it is almost unthinkable to refer to any protest involving an alleged infraction of official rules as anything other than disobedience. I argue that this overstretching of “disobedience” rests on the misleading assumption that “intentional lawbreaking” occurs in an uncontested political/legal space; it also ignores that, in certain contexts, activists insist on the legality of their protests even when they defy official orders. Examining how feminist activists in Turkey offer alternative interpretations of existing laws to challenge the legality of protest bans, I demonstrate that folding such protests into the disobedience framework silences protesters, erases their narratives of resistance, and adopts the state’s perspective on the “illegality” of their actions.",

          "title": "Ecological Personhood: A Bridging Approach",
          "authors": "MÓNICA BRITO VIEIRA, SEAN FLEMING",
          "abstract": "Aotearoa New Zealand’s recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal person in 2017 has generated a lively debate. While advocates argue that ascribing personhood to natural entities is a powerful tool for redressing historical injustices against Indigenous peoples and for protecting the environment, critics argue that it is incompatible with Western legal and political systems. In this article, we use Thomas Hobbes’s theory of personhood to develop a novel account of ecological personhood. Hobbes explains how natural entities can be empowered to speak and act through authorized representatives, much as states, corporations, and wards do. Our Hobbesian account has three main payoffs. First, it offers a bridge between different legal orders and ontologies of nature. Second, it explains how “ecoship” is normatively different from corporate personhood and guardianship. Third, it highlights both the transformative potential of ecological persons and the ways in which they can be coopted and subverted.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how racial identity affects legislative responsiveness in Mexico using an email-based audit experiment. Emails from simulated Indigenous, Mestiza, and European-White constituents were sent to all 626 federal legislators to test whether perceived identity shapes replies and their quality. Contrary to expectations, Indigenous-named constituents received significantly higher response rates that were more personalized and helpful than their European-White counterparts, while Mestiza-named constituents showed no significant differences in response rates. We found no coalition-based differences, though power was limited, and responsiveness declined in districts with larger Indigenous populations, revealing how national inclusion norms may be moderated by local demographic and political dynamics.",

          "title": "A Waste of Time? Partisan Deliberative Bias as a Barrier to Political Crosstalk",
          "authors": "Bryan McLaughlin, Nathaniel Geiger, Pedro H. P. Rocha",
          "abstract": "Americans are increasingly unwilling to talk about politics with out-partisans. One potential barrier to such cross-cutting partisan conversations may be partisans’ tendency to stereotype out-partisans as lacking the deliberative traits necessary to have a productive conversation (i.e., partisan deliberative bias ). Here, three studies examine the presence of partisan deliberative bias, its relationship to cross-cutting political talk, and potential pathways to reducing partisan deliberative bias. Study 1 (two-wave panel; Wave-2 N = 695) provides evidence that partisans perceive out-partisans possess less deliberative traits than in-partisans and these perceptions are related to reduced cross-cutting political talk (at Time 2). Study 2 (experimental; N = 417) provides evidence that exposing individuals to more examples of out-partisans who display deliberative traits (vs. anti-deliberative traits) leads to increased perceptions that out-partisans possess deliberative traits, which is associated with greater willingness to engage in a political conversation. Study 3 (experimental; N = 825) provides evidence that a deliberative bias-correcting intervention can reduce stereotypes about out-party members’ deliberative traits. Further, findings from an alternative model that includes in-group favoritism suggest that perceptions of deliberative traits are significantly related to cross-cutting political talk even when accounting for affective polarization. Findings across all three studies are similar for Republican and Democratic participants. Taken holistically, these results highlight the prevalence of partisan deliberative bias, suggest that such bias reduces cross-cutting conversations, and provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to address this bias.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how public support for due process in corruption investigations is affected by partisan biases. Using a survey experiment conducted with a representative sample of Portuguese voters, it finds that voters' support for legally enshrined due process rights is conditional on their partisan alignment with the corruption suspects. Specifically, respondents exhibit greater support for due process protections for in‐party than for out‐party suspects, with out‐party derogation prevailing. By focusing on public attitudes towards legal fairness and horizontal accountability, these results expand our understanding of the role of partisan loyalties in accountability for corruption beyond their better‐known role in electoral processes.",

          "abstract": "Clionadh Raleigh, Roudabeh Kishi, and Andrew Linke recently compared their own Armed Conflict Location and Events Dataset (ACLED) to three other conflict event datasets in Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications. In this article, we investigate their claims about what drives differences between the two researcher led projects the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and ACLED. In the process, we address some general issues that arise in event data collection, including the importance of stable definitions, how demands on sourcing varies with the type of data collected, and how strategies for dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity impact the data. Contrary to the claims made in the target article, the differences between ACLED and UCDP in the cases put forth by the authors are not primarily due to differences in sourcing or inclusion thresholds. Analyzing the same cases, we show that most of the differences are due to auxiliary coding rules, standards for source evaluation and misrepresentations of UCDP data in the original article.",
