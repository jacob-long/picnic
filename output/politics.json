          "authors": "Laia Balcells, Elsa Voytas",
          "abstract": "In divided societies, can museums contribute to healing and recovery? While efforts to memorialize past violence typically aim to promote tolerance and reconciliation, remembering could exacerbate divisions in recovering societies where the past is deeply contested. We examine a transitional justice museum exhibit in Northern Ireland. We combine evidence from nearly 1,400 participants across focus groups, a field experiment at the Troubles and Beyond exhibit in the Ulster Museum, and a survey that randomly exposed respondents to exhibit materials. Our findings indicate that although individuals experience strong emotional responses to the exhibit materials, these emotions do not correspond to shifts in perceptions of past violent conflict or preferences for addressing it. These results may reflect the balanced curation of the museum exhibit, which avoids imposing a singular narrative. While this approach prevents further polarization, it also limits the potential for fostering social cohesion.",

          "title": "The populist spiral: How populist rhetoric spreads within party systems",
          "authors": "Vlad Surdea-Hernea",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates whether populism, independent of its substantive policy correlates, diffuses within party systems as a rhetorical strategy. Building on theories of political contagion, I argue that populism’s simplicity and flexibility make it an attractive tool for parties seeking to mobilize voters, disrupt competitors, and respond to systemic pressures. Using the V-Party dataset, which provides expert-coded estimates of populist rhetoric across a global sample of parties, I construct a leave-one-out (LOO) Index to capture systemic populist signals. Time-series cross-sectional regression models with fixed effects reveal that higher levels of systemic populism significantly increase the likelihood of parties adopting populist rhetoric in subsequent electoral cycles. The effect is most pronounced for anti-elitism and people-centrism, while pluralistic norms and non-violence remain stable. Right-leaning parties exhibit stronger responsiveness, reflecting the natural alignment between populist themes and conservative platforms.",

          "authors": "Zachary Markovich",
          "abstract": "Existing approaches to conducting inference about the Local Average Treatment Effect or LATE require assumptions that are considered tenuous in many applied settings. In particular, Instrumental Variable techniques require monotonicity and the exclusion restriction while principal score methods rest on some form of the principal ignorability assumption. This paper provides new results showing that an estimator within the class of principal score methods allows conservative inference about the LATE without invoking such assumptions. I term this estimator the Compliance Probability Weighting estimator and show that, under very mild assumptions, it provides an asymptotically conservative estimator for the LATE. I apply this estimator to a recent survey experiment and provide evidence of a stronger effect for the subset of compliers than the original authors had uncovered.",

          "title": "Measuring the Quality of Answers in Political Q&amp;As with Large Language Models",
          "authors": "R. Michael Alvarez, Jacob Morrier",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a new approach for measuring the quality of answers in political question-and-answer sessions. We assess the quality of an answer based on how easily and accurately it can be recognized among a random set of candidate answers given the question’s text. This measure reflects the answer’s relevance and depth of engagement with the question. Drawing a parallel with semantic search, we can implement this approach by training a language model on the corpus of observed questions and answers without additional human-labeled data. We showcase and validate our methodology within the context of the Question Period in the Canadian House of Commons. Our analysis reveals that while some answers only have a weak semantic connection to questions, suggesting some evasion or obfuscation, they are generally at least moderately relevant, far exceeding what we would expect from random replies. We also find meaningful correlations between the quality of answers and the party affiliation of the members of Parliament asking the questions.",

          "title": "Balancing Precision and Retention in Experimental Design",
          "authors": "Gustavo Diaz, Erin Rossiter",
          "abstract": "In experimental social science, precise treatment effect estimation is of utmost importance, and researchers can make design choices to increase precision. Specifically, block-randomized and pre-post designs are promoted as effective means to increase precision. However, implementing these designs requires pre-treatment covariates, and collecting this information may decrease sample sizes, which in and of itself harms precision. Therefore, despite the literature’s recommendation to use block-randomized and pre-post designs, it remains unclear when to expect these designs to increase precision in applied settings. We use real-world data to demonstrate a counterintuitive result: precision gains from block-randomized or pre-post designs can withstand significant sample loss that may arise during implementation. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating researchers’ practical concerns into existing experimental design advice.",

          "authors": "Claudia Zúñiga, Karina Navarro, Rodrigo A. Asún, Jacqueline Espinosa‐Ibacache, José Isla",
          "abstract": "Since the Chilean social outburst in 2019, the country has experienced a process of political polarization and radicalization. The social support and participation in violent, disruptive, and radical protests rapidly increased, particularly among young individuals. However, in 2022, a rapid deradicalization process took place and ended with the constitutional proposal derived from the social outburst being rejected. Nowadays, national surveys reveal that the support for radical and violent protests decreased, and the support for police repression (earlier severely criticized) increased. This rapid and unprecedented process of radicalization and deradicalization invites the exploration and identification of the factors associated with the deradicalization of opinions in young people. With this view, we will conduct qualitative research using semi‐structured interviews with a sample of male and female young adults that radicalized their opinions due to the outbreak in 2019 and changed their minds later on.",
