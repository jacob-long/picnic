          "authors": "VINCENT HEDDESHEIMER, HANNO HILBIG, ERIK VOETEN",
          "abstract": "Green transition policies set long-term targets to reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants, posing a threat to workers in polluting occupations and communities reliant on them. Can far-right parties attract voters who anticipate losing from the green transition? We explore this in Germany, which has ambitious green policies and a large workforce in polluting occupations. The far-right AfD started campaigning as the only party opposing green transition policies in 2016. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show AfD support increased more in counties with larger shares of employment in polluting occupations once the AfD adopted an anti-green platform in 2016. A panel survey demonstrates that individuals in these occupations also shifted toward the AfD. Probing mechanisms, we find that far-right support may stem from shifting perceptions of social stigma and lower status. Our results highlight the need for a new research agenda on backlash against the normative dimension of the green transition.",

          "authors": "ELSA VOYTAS",
          "abstract": "Can material reparations change political participation? To examine whether material reparations can increase political engagement among survivors of state violence, I use content analysis of survivor testimonies, interviews, and plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of reparations approval for surviving victims of the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. After being approved for reparations, survivors are more likely to register to vote compared to those not yet enrolled in the reparations program. I present evidence that the symbolic value of reparations payments holds particular significance for survivors and suggest that the transitional justice experience provides an opportunity for them to revise their views of the state. These findings indicate that in post-violence contexts, policy experiences can be a consequential determinant of future political behavior, potentially expanding electoral engagement as societies move toward building peace and consolidating democracy.",

          "authors": "Mary Sanford, Silvia Pianta, Nicolas Schmid, Giorgio Musto",
          "abstract": "With ambitious action required to achieve global climate mitigation goals, climate change has become increasingly salient in the political arena. This article presents a dataset of climate change salience in 1,792 political manifestos of 620 political parties across different party families in forty-five OECD, European, and South American countries from 1990 to 2022. Importantly, our measure uniquely isolates climate change salience, avoiding the conflation with general environmental and sustainability content found in other work. Exploiting recent advances in supervised machine learning, we developed the dataset by fine-tuning a pre-trained multilingual transformer with human coding, employing a resource-efficient and replicable pipeline for multilingual text classification that can serve as a template for similar tasks. The dataset unlocks new avenues of research on the political discourse of climate change, on the role of parties in climate policy making, and on the political economy of climate change. We make the model and the dataset available to the research community.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the conditions under which subnational concerns shape public assessments of international climate governance. In line with existing literature, we maintain that costly policy adjustments fuel negative views of international co-operation in policy-exposed regions. At the same time, we argue that the more resentful relations are with the national center of politics, the more sympathetic these regions are to international institutions and global governance. Based on geographically targeted survey data from the United Kingdom, we find that fossil fuel-intensive regions with strong, institutionalized regional politics have more positive assessments of international climate co-operation than structurally similar regions where regional political institutions are less pronounced. The findings show that regional politics characteristics are key for understanding climate policy beliefs among citizens that bear the brunt of adjustments to international climate agreements.",

          "authors": "Juha Ylisalo, Theres Matthieß, Katrin Praprotnik, Laurenz Ennser-Jedenastik",
          "abstract": "Theories of representative democracy emphasize the importance of electoral pledges for informed voting and government accountability. Recent studies have highlighted citizens’ tendency to impose electoral punishments when parties fail to fulfill their pledges. However, conditions under which citizens consider non-fulfillment acceptable have received little attention. Specifically, multiparty government makes it less likely that an individual party fulfills its pledges, but whether citizens take such obstacles into account when evaluating the acceptability of non-fulfillment has remained largely untested. We theorize that both the coalition negotiation context and the negotiation outcome influence citizens’ evaluations. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two vignette experiments in Finland and Germany. The results revealed that, regardless of their opinion about the substance of a pledge, voters were more accepting of unfulfilled pledges when party or coalition characteristics created obstacles to fulfillment. The findings suggest that voters possess a nuanced understanding of the constraints of coalition government.",

          "authors": "Kit Rickard, Giovanni Hollenweger, Sigrid Weber, Kristin M. Bakke",
          "abstract": "In some divided societies, identity-based groups engage in ‘contentious rituals’, such as public parades or commemorative events, to cultivate the group’s collective social memory and build solidarity. We examine whether and how such rituals perpetuate group divisions in post-conflict societies, drawing on evidence from a case study of parading in Northern Ireland. Every year, contentious parades in this post-conflict society have the potential to raise tensions between the two major communities, Catholics and Protestants. Using a mixed-methods design, we show that parades in Northern Ireland are detrimental to intergroup attitudes. Our research design relies on compiling geolocated data on over 55,000 parades (2002–22), analyses of both nationally representative longitudinal surveys (2003–19) and an original survey fielded in 2022, and insights from qualitative fieldwork conducted during the height of the parading season in 2023.",

          "abstract": "Can monuments to victims of authoritarian regimes promote more tolerant societies? We look into the case of Stolpersteine, small memorials commemorating victims of the Nazi regime in Germany. Unlike other monuments, Stolpersteine are dedicated to specific individuals who were victims of Nazi violence. In a pre-registered survey experiment, we showed treated individuals pictures of the stones. Our results show that exposure to Stolpersteine strongly increased negative emotions and reduced positive ones. The results on attitudinal and quasi-behavioral outcomes are mixed, likely driven by ceiling effects. We find a positive effect on tolerance toward the only minority group that faces low tolerance in the control group. However, there is no statistically significant effect for other groups.",

          "abstract": "The partisan gap in economic perceptions flipped unusually dramatically after the 2024 U.S. presidential election: following the Republican victory, Democrats (Republicans) suddenly rated the economy much more negatively (positively). Was the resulting partisan difference a case of expressive responding, wherein surveys exaggerate partisan bias in measures of economic perceptions? In April 2025, I fielded a panel survey experiment that asked survey respondents to guess then-unpublished measures of economic growth, inflation, and unemployment in the current month or quarter (Prolific, N = 2,831). Randomly selected respondents were offered $2 per correct answer. Partisan bias did not shrink as a result, suggesting genuine differences in economic perceptions. Two measures of response effort (response time and looking up answers) increase, suggesting that misreporting does not fully explain the effects of pay-for-correct treatments.",

          "abstract": "In this study, I examine the extent to which voters apply consistent moral and democratic standards to political misinformation, and how these standards interact with perceived misinformation in the campaign. Drawing on an original survey experiment during the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, I randomly assigned respondents to read one of ten fact-checked misleading statements made by either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in a nationally televised debate. I found that individuals were more likely to justify, excuse, and downplay the democratic harm of misinformation when it came from their preferred candidate. While this tendency was evident across both partisan groups, the tendency to downplay the democratic harm of co-partisan misinformation was particularly noticeable among Trump supporters. Moreover, the main effect was stronger among respondents who perceived misinformation as widespread during the campaign. Finally, I demonstrate that willingness to accept misinformation varies by policy area, with greater justification for misleading statements on immigration, abortion and gun rights among Trump supporters, and trade and tax among Harris supporters. These findings highlight how partisan loyalty can distort moral judgment and underscore the challenges misinformation poses for democratic accountability.",

          "authors": "Ali Çarkoğlu, Yasushi Hazama",
          "abstract": "This study examines the changing impact of economic and security performance evaluations on support for the incumbent president during the 2023 Turkish election campaign, contributing to the literature on economic voting and electoral strategies in hybrid regimes. Using a three-wave panel survey, we find that the effects of these evaluations fluctuate throughout the campaign. Four months before the elections, economic evaluations had a stronger impact on support for Erdoğan than security evaluations. However, 1 month before the elections, security evaluations became more influential. Six weeks after the elections, security compared to economic evaluations remained more significant than economic evaluations, though the gap narrowed. This temporal change coincides with shifts diagnosed in the literature attributed to Erdoğan’s strategic emphasis on security over economic challenges. The findings suggest that incumbents in competitive authoritarian regimes can use their privileged policy tools, such as media access, to shift the campaign agenda towards favorable issues, even during economic downturns, to survive the unfavorable performance conditions.",

This research examined how emotion dysregulation—a difficulty in managing one's emotional experiences—relates to national narcissism, an inflated belief in the unparalleled greatness of one's nation, often driven by psychological shortcomings. Across three cross‐sectional studies conducted among British ( N = 473), American ( N = 444), and Polish ( N = 633) participants, we found that deficiencies in emotion regulation were consistently linked to higher national narcissism. Importantly, national narcissism partially accounted for the link between emotion dysregulation and conspiracy beliefs. These results extend prior work by illuminating the emotional underpinnings of national narcissism and demonstrating how individual emotional challenges resonate within broader social phenomena.",

However, our understanding of the factors that shape citizens' perceptions of these principles remains limited. We proposed that conspiracy beliefs are negatively related to distributive perceptions and tested these relationships in four studies. Study 1 analyzed a global dataset (90,837 participants; 68 societies) and identified a negative relationship between conspiracy beliefs and meritocracy perceptions. Study 2a (preregistered; N = 403; US) and Study 2b (preregistered; N = 788; China) manipulated conspiracy beliefs in societal settings. Conspiracy beliefs consistently reduced perceptions of meritocracy, perceived equality, and need principles. Study 3 (preregistered; N = 403) replicated these results in a hypothetical organizational setting. These findings suggest that conspiracy beliefs reduce citizens' perceived fairness of resource allocations across different distributive justice rules.",

          "abstract": "Fostering contact across political camps is crucial to combat affective polarization and to sustain healthy democratic discourse. Researchers therefore have become increasingly interested in better understanding the factors that promote or hamper political exchange. The present research contributes to this goal by introducing WEDO, a new measure to assess the willingness to engage with differently minded others based on behavioral preferences in hypothetical scenarios. This measure integrates the advantages of topic‐specific assessment, fine‐grained response, and economical administration. Across four studies ( N = 1215) conducted in diverse sociopolitical contexts, we examine WEDO's associations with conceptually related variables. Our findings indicate that WEDO is linked to various individual characteristics (e.g., analytic thinking, intellectual humility) and further predicts behavior in a selective exposure task. Overall, WEDO offers a nuanced tool for understanding how personal characteristics, situational factors, and sociopolitical contexts influence individuals' openness to political discourse.",

The findings reveal that increased female representation had a positive impact on women’s belief that they should have equal access to political office, with no evidence of backlash among male respondents.

          "abstract": "Recent work on power sharing and civil conflicts in ethnically divided societies emphasizes the crucial distinction between mandates and their implementation. Formal power-sharing rules reduce the risk of armed conflict, but power-sharing practices mediate this effect. Political scientists frequently categorize proportional electoral rules (PR) as part of the broader class of power-sharing institutions, which should induce power-sharing practices, and in turn reduce the likelihood of intrastate armed conflict. Empirical evidence for this claim is indirect at best. Using mediation analysis, we assess whether PR rules or executive power-sharing institutions (or their combination) engender elite power sharing in ethnically divided societies and reduce the risk of ethnic intrastate conflict. Using different datasets, we find no evidence for a positive effect of PR on power-sharing practices, and some weak evidence that PR reduces intrastate conflict through other mechanisms. Recommendations of PR to ethnically divided societies or post-conflict environments as means to foster inclusion and thus reduce conflict should be reconsidered.",
