          "abstract": "Estimation at fine levels of aggregation is necessary, to better describe society. Small area estimation model-based approaches that combine sparse survey data with rich data from auxiliary sources have been proven useful to improve the reliability of estimates for small domains. Considered here is a scenario where small area model-based estimates, produced at a given aggregation level, need to be disaggregated to better describe the social structure at finer levels. For this scenario, an allocation method was developed to implement the disaggregation, overcoming challenges associated with data availability and model development at such fine levels. The method is applied to adult literacy and numeracy estimation at the county-by-group-level, using data from the U.S. Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies. In this application, the groups are defined in terms of age or education.",

          "authors": "Stephen Jessee, Neil Malhotra, Maya Sen",
          "abstract": "As political issues have increased in complexity, public opinion researchers increasingly ask respondents about sophisticated political topics that may require substantive knowledge and analytic skills, raising concerns about survey satisficing. In this note, we examine the correlates of one manifestation of this kind of satisficing—response order effects, or when respondents are more likely to pick the top response options from a list. We do this by analyzing randomized response order experiments embedded in surveys conducted across three years, where 6,291 respondents provided their opinion on 40 complex issues before the Supreme Court. We find an overall response order effect of 2.8 percentage points with substantial heterogeneity related to both question length and respondent knowledge. These factors also interact with one another; among the most sensitive subpopulation—low-knowledge respondents answering long questions—the predicted response order effect was 17.4 percentage points. On the other hand, question complexity and respondent education did not moderate response order effects. Our practical advice for researchers asking about complex issues is that they should focus on being brief, rather than using extra words to make the language simpler.",

          "authors": "Mridha Md. Shiblee Noman, Md. Sayeed Al-Zaman",
          "abstract": "The intersection of politics and religion in India has gained significant scholarly attention, particularly since the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) rise to power in 2014. The increasing impact of social media on Indian politics has intensified this concern. However, it is yet to be fully explored how social media was used for religiopolitical purposes during the Indian election in 2024. We computationally analyzed 3082 Facebook posts using BERTopic, word embedding, and cluster analysis to understand how politicians, political candidates, political organizations, and political parties intertwined religion and politics during the 2024 Lok Sabha election. We identified the presence of religiopolitical propaganda, primarily aimed at reviving and recreating Hindu nationalist history and targeting religious minorities, mainly Muslims. The major topics of the posts included ideological legacy, political landscape, party and leadership, celebrations, crime and justice, local politics and governance, politicized demographic trends, public engagements, spiritual and philosophical themes, and the misrepresented reservation issue. The interconnectedness of these issues suggests that the BJP and its allies concentrated on religious matters, from Hindu–Muslim debates to reservations for Muslims and the inauguration of Hindu temples. Data from non-political entities, such as influencers, as well as cross-platform analysis from Twitter and YouTube, can extend and enrich these insights.",
