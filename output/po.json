          "title": "AI Chatbots in Political Campaigns: A Practical Experience in the EU’s 2024 Parliament Elections",
          "authors": "Davide Tosi, Marco Chiappa, Dario Pizzul",
          "abstract": "As the application of artificial intelligence in various domains and sectors grows, politics—especially political communication—is no exception. However, academic considerations on the topic remain limited, partly due to its novelty. To contribute to the ongoing discussions at the intersection of AI and political campaigns, this research report presents the development and use of an AI chatbot employed by an Italian candidate during the 2024 European Parliament elections. The aim of this work is to engage with the technical aspects of the tool’s development and implementation by outlining the challenges and strategies involved in creating an AI chatbot that supports a political campaign using OpenAI APIs. Furthermore, this report offers reflections on the role of AI in politics and communication, focusing on the concepts of intermediation and participation, also addressing issues of compliance and trustworthiness of these new AI tools.",
