          "abstract": "The increasing reliance on non-probability samples, including administrative data, big data, and surveys with selective non-response, has brought the issue of selection bias to the forefront of applied research and official statistics production. This study investigates selection bias in the context of flash estimates, focusing on their application in short-term economic indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product and the Consumer Price Index. Leveraging prominent theoretical frameworks for modeling selection bias, we develop and evaluate a series of estimators that incorporate information from a fully-observed lagged target variable, current auxiliary variables, or combined data sources. Through simulations and a case study using turnover (i.e., revenue) data from Statistics Netherlands, we assess these estimators across diverse scenarios, including variations in variable distribution, selectivity levels, and correlations between auxiliary and target variables. Results indicate that estimators combining lagged and current auxiliary information provide more consistent results than those relying on a single data source. Additionally, estimators based on combined data sources perform relatively well under high selectivity and non-normal target distributions. These findings provide practical and easily implementable tools to address selection bias in non-probability samples, enhancing the reliability and timeliness of official statistics.",

          "authors": "Jun Zhang, Li Chen, Dongqing Xu",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the role of social media influencers (SMIs) in shaping public perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. It specifically examines how perceptions of CSR normative legitimacy interact with SMI credibility to influence public support for CSR efforts through public-serving motives and positive moral emotions. An online survey of 491 U.S. participants measured the impact of CSR normative legitimacy on public-serving motives and positive moral emotions, which subsequently influence CSR-supportive behaviors. SMI credibility, assessed through trustworthiness, attractiveness, and expertise, was examined as a potential moderator in this relationship. The results show that CSR normative legitimacy significantly enhances public-serving motives and positive moral emotions, leading to greater public support for CSR initiatives. SMI credibility, particularly trustworthiness and attractiveness, moderates this relationship, amplifying the positive effects of CSR normative legitimacy.",
