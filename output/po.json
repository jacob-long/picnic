          "title": "Are Natives Collar-Blind? Migration Flows and Attitudes Toward Immigration",
          "authors": "Lenka Dražanová, Jérôme Gonnot",
          "abstract": "This article investigates how regional-level immigration of different origins and educational backgrounds predicts individual policy preferences across Western European countries between 2010 and 2020. Combining data from the European Social Survey and the European Union Labour Force Survey, we examine how changes in net migration affect support for restrictive immigration policies. We find that short-term increases in non-European immigration within a given region are associated with more restrictive migration policy views among natives, regardless of immigrants' education levels. Attitudes toward immigration are also relatively more negatively affected among natives with financial difficulties when immigrants are not tertiary educated, but not when those immigrants have a tertiary education. Our findings suggest that while origin-based heuristics dominate public responses to immigration, natives are not entirely blind to immigrants' educational attainment.",

          "title": "Multilingual Hierarchical Classification of Job Advertisements for Job Vacancy Statistics",
          "authors": "Maciej Beręsewicz, Marek Wydmuch, Herman Cherniaiev, Robert Pater",
          "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to develop a multilingual classifier and conditional probability estimator of occupation codes for online job advertisements in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) extended with the Polish Classification of Occupations and Specializations (KZiS), which is analogous to the European Classification of Occupations. In this paper, we utilize a range of data sources, including a novel one, namely the Central Job Offers Database, which is a register of all vacancies submitted to Public Employment Offices. Their staff members code the vacancies according to the ISCO and KZiS. A hierarchical multi-class classifier has been developed based on the transformer architecture. The classifier begins by encoding the jobs found in advertisements to the widest 1-digit occupational group, and then narrows the assignment to a 6-digit occupation code. We show that incorporation of the hierarchical structure of occupations improves prediction accuracy by 1 to 2 percentage points, particularly for the hand-coded online job advertisements. Finally, a bilingual (Polish and English) and multilingual (twenty-four languages) model is developed based on data translated using closed and open-source software. The open-source software is provided for the benefit of the official statistics community, with a particular focus on international comparability.",

          "authors": "Morgan S Earp, Lauren M Rossen, Sarah E Forrest, Trent D Buskirk",
          "abstract": "Accurate measurement is critical for the assessment of health outcomes and behaviors across population subgroups. Estimated differences in the prevalence of a given health outcome or risk factor can be affected by whether the outcomes are measured or self-reported. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which contains both measured and self-reported health information, we used conditional linear regression trees (CLRT) to assess differential measurement error across several chronic health conditions and risk factors, where measurement error is defined as differences between self-reported and measured (e.g., gold standard or objective) health outcomes or behaviors. Using data on four health conditions/behaviors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and current smoking) from NHANES (2015 through March 2020), we assessed differences between self-reported and measured outcomes by various sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, health insurance, and poverty). We used CLRTs via the “rpms” package in R to identify demographic subgroups with larger differences between self-reported and measured health conditions/behaviors. Identifying subgroups where measurement error may be larger or smaller could help inform future work on improving the estimation of the prevalence of chronic conditions and health behaviors.",

          "authors": "Taewoo Kang, Kjerstin Thorson, Tai-Quan Peng, Dan Hiaeshutter-Rice, Sanguk Lee, Stuart Soroka",
          "abstract": "This study attempts to advance automated content analysis from consensus-oriented to coordination-oriented practices, thereby embracing diverse coding outputs and exploring the dynamics among differential perspectives. As an exploratory investigation, we evaluate six GPT-4o configurations to analyze sentiment in Fox News and MSNBC transcripts on Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign. By assessing each model’s alignment with partisan perspectives, we explore how partisan selective processing can be identified in LLM-Assisted Content Analysis (LACA). The findings indicate that LLM-based partisan perspective simulations reflect politically polarized standpoints across partisan groups, revealing a pronounced divergence in sentiment analysis between Democrat-aligned and Republican-aligned persona models. This pattern is evident in intercoder-reliability metrics, which are higher among same-partisan than cross-partisan persona model pairs. Results also suggest that LLM partisan simulations exhibit stronger ideological biases when analyzing politically congruent content. This approach enhances the nuanced understanding of LLM outputs and advances the integrity of AI-driven social science research and may also enable simulations of real-world implications.",
