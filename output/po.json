          "authors": "Danit Shalev, Teresa K Naab, Yariv Tsfati",
          "abstract": "Based on a sample collected in Israel (N = 1,414), the current study describes the discrepancies between measures of retrospective and repeated in situ self-reports for exposure to audio-visual news broadcasts on TV, news websites, and social media. It tests the influence of the amount of news broadcast exposure, habitual news use at certain times of the day, and user demographics on the discrepancies between the measures. Results show that people significantly under-report TV news exposure and over-report watching the news on social media in retrospect. More heavy news users tend to under-report exposure in retrospect compared to aggregated in situ values. Daytime news users tend to over-report social media news exposure in retrospect.",

          "title": "Personality Traits and Individual Attitudes Toward Transitional Justice: Evidence From Taiwan",
          "authors": "Wei-Ting Tsai, Ching-Hsing Wang",
          "abstract": "This study aims to empirically examine individual attitudes toward transitional justice (TJ), especially focusing on how the Big Five personality traits influence individual perceptions of TJ. Using the original survey data collected in Taiwan, this study finds that personality traits exert some influence on different aspects of attitudes toward TJ. Among the 5 personality traits, openness to experience has a more significant and consistent effect on individual attitudes toward TJ. People with higher levels of openness to experience tend to support most TJ measures. Besides, the results from the experimental design reveal that different narratives of TJ would affect individual support for TJ. Overall, this study provides the theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for a psychological explanation of individual attitudes toward TJ and makes some significant contributions to the study of TJ.",

          "title": "Trust in Election Polls. The Role of the Source Institution and the Results of the Poll",
          "authors": "Ádám Stefkovics, Dömötör Gere",
          "abstract": "Opinion polls about voting intentions provide important information for citizens in shaping their own political attitudes. Nevertheless, opinion polls are only useful for democracies if people trust their results. This study aims to decompose trust in poll results by focusing on two factors that may shape trust level: the source polling institution and the results of the poll. In survey experiments embedded in an online and a phone survey in Hungary, respondents were presented with two hypothetical poll reports and were asked to assess how much they trusted them. We varied the source institution (6 levels) and whether the results were realistic or not realistic. The results show that despite the highly politicized research environment in Hungary, the research institution did not play a role in general or among people with different political views. In turn, accuracy was a strong positive predictor of trust in the phone survey, but we found traces of motivated reasoning, partially depending on political sophistication. We conclude that trust processes are complex, with source credibility not always determining trust, but individual political motivations consistently shaping perceptions.",

          "title": "When Cleaning Data Introduces Bias: A Critical Examination of Post-Hoc Methods in Detecting Insufficient Effort Responding",
          "authors": "Melissa Dan Wang, Leifeng Xiao, Xuan Zang",
          "abstract": "Insufficient Effort Responding (IER) threatens the integrity of survey data, affecting the validity of subsequent analyses. Various post-hoc methods have been developed to detect and eliminate questionable responses, but these methods risk under-detecting IER and over-detecting legitimate responses, introducing analysis biases. This study assessed six such methods—longstring, individual response variability, Mahalanobis distance, psychometric synonym, Standardized Log-likelihood, and Guttman error—as well as their combined application, under diverse conditions. The findings revealed that, in some scenarios, these methods performed no better than random guessing in identifying IER. Further, the performance of combination strategies was merely moderate, falling between the best and worst-performing methods. Alarmingly, excluding responses identified as low-effort often distorted statistical and psychometric estimates more severely than including them. These results underscore the imperative for researchers to judiciously apply IER detection techniques and critically evaluate their effects on data quality.",

          "title": "Forecasting Civil Unrest in South Africa Using Social Media Data: A Hybrid Machine Learning Approach",
          "authors": "Rejoice Chitengu, Silas Formunyuy Verkijika, Kelibone Eva Mamabolo",
          "abstract": "Civil unrest, encompassing protests and riots, is an increasing global concern, with incidents rising at an alarming rate, a trend that has been observed in South Africa over the years. This issue is particularly pronounced in today’s social media era, where platforms like ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) serve as powerful tools for mobilization. This raises the question: What factors drive civil unrest, and how can machine learning, using social media data, be employed to forecast such events? In response, this study had as objective to develop a hybrid machine learning model to forecast protest and riot events in South Africa using Twitter data. Employing the CRISP-DM methodology, data was collected from Twitter for the period between 2019 and 2024, resulting in 18,487 curated tweets, with associated ground truth data extracted from the ACLED database. Using this data, a hybrid model combining Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) networks with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classification and regression tasks was developed to forecast civil unrest in South Africa. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used for model explainability. The proposed model outperformed the base model, achieving an R-squared value of 33% for protests and 23% for riots in regression, along with classification accuracies of 92% for protests and 86.2% for riots. SHAP results indicated that the key predictors of unrest included sentiment-related features, tweet engagement features, regional factors, the day of the week, public holidays, and the topics being discussed. This study demonstrates the value of a hybrid model in forecasting civil unrest events and identifies key features that stakeholders can use to target their efforts more precisely in addressing civil unrest, ensuring resources are allocated where they are needed most. The study concludes with a discussion of valuable insights for stakeholders on how to leverage social media data to predict and mitigate civil unrest.",

          "title": "A Practical Guide and Case Study on How to Instruct LLMs for Automated Coding During Content Analysis",
          "authors": "Mike Farjam, Hendrik Meyer, Meike Lohkamp",
          "abstract": "This paper provides a practical example and guide on how to augment or replace human coders with Large Language Models (LLMs) during content analysis. We demonstrate this by replicating and extending an influential study on environmental communication. Our setup, running locally on consumer-grade hardware, makes it feasible for university researchers operating within typical computational and legal constraints. We validate the LLM’s performance by replicating the original study’s codings, scaling the analysis to cover a tenfold increase in articles, and extending the LLM’s application to a comparable German-language corpus, comparing these results to human expert coders. We offer guidelines for instructing LLMs, validating output, and handling multilingual coding, presenting a replicable framework for future research. This paper is intended to systematically guide other researchers when integrating LLMs into their workflows, ensuring reliable and scalable coding practices. We demonstrate several advantages of LLMs as coders, including cost-effective multilingual coding, overcoming the limitations of small-sample content analysis, and improving both the replicability and transparency of the coding process.",
