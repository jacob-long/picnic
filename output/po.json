          "authors": "Michael Barber, Brandice Canes-Wrone, Joshua Clinton, Greg Huber",
          "abstract": "Roe vs. Wade (1973) recognized a constitutional right to abortion under various circumstances and, in doing so, facilitated a political environment in which politicians could endorse more restrictive abortion policies that Roe prohibited. Indeed, many states enacted “trigger” laws that would only carry the force of law if Roe were overturned. The Supreme Court in Dobbs vs. Jackson (2022) removed the constitutional right to abortion, ending a situation in which this type of position taking lacked policy consequences and creating an environment in Republican-led states where many policies seemingly contrast with public opinion. To investigate potential sources of support for a variety of types of restrictions, we analyze an original survey of over 7,500 verified donors, 1,500 affluent individuals, and 1,000 members of the general public conducted in 2019–2020. The most extreme restrictions, such as bans with no rape exception, are not popular with Republicans in the aggregate from any of the three groups—Republican donors, affluent individuals, or voters—but they are supported by the small and potentially influential group of highly religious Republicans who report that abortion is one of their most important issues.",

          "title": "Ladies’ Choice: Intersectional Linked Fate and Public Opinion Toward Women of Color in Politics",
          "authors": "Joyce H Nguy, Alexandria J Davis, Nathan K Chan",
          "abstract": "This article seeks to understand the public opinion formation among women of color in America. How do identity-based factors, such as linked fate with women of color (WoC), shape political evaluations? Expanding on social identity theory and intersectionality frameworks, we investigate the political influences of WoC identification and WoC intersectional linked fate. We argue that intersectional linked fate represents a deeper sense of shared experiences and interconnected outcomes across race and gender, making this both a conceptually distinct construct and a politically consequential extension of WoC identity. Further, we theorize that women of color’s perceptions of intersectional linked fate drive their cross-racial support for real-world WoC in politics. We analyze data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey to test how intersectional linked fate correlates with evaluations of prominent WoC political figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Michelle Obama among Black, Latina, and Asian American women. Our findings reveal that intersectional linked fate has a stronger and more consistent influence on these political evaluations than either WoC identity or racial linked fate, fostering solidarity and support for WoC politicians across racial boundaries. The results highlight the critical role of intersectional linked fate in shaping public opinion with important implications for understanding future elections, especially as candidates, politics, and the electorate continue to diversify in the United States.",

          "title": "Do Personality Traits Predict Voter Attitudes When Politics Is Structured Around Conflict? Lessons from Israel",
          "authors": "Naama Rivlin-Angert, Alon Yakter, Lior Sheffer",
          "abstract": "The relationship between personality traits and political attitudes has been studied extensively. However, existing accounts largely study personality’s links to liberal-conservative divisions on social and economic issues. We know far less about its attitudinal influences when politics is organized around other issue domains, particularly ethnonational conflicts. Addressing this gap, we examine the relationship between the Big Five personality traits, policy preferences, and political orientation in Israel, where the main ideological cleavage involves the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Using original survey data, we find that the known relationships with social and economic attitudes operate only partly and more weakly in this context. Unlike these domains, conflict-related preferences in Israel correlate primarily with greater conscientiousness, largely through authoritarian tendencies. General Left-Right orientations mimic this relationship, reflecting conflict-related views rather than social or economic inclinations. These findings expand the scope of current debates about personality and political attitudes and underscore the importance of national ideological contexts for future research.",

          "authors": "Calvert W Jones, Jocelyn Sage Mitchell",
          "abstract": "Survey research is growing, yet research on data quality continues to rely mainly on samples from the United States and Europe. To contribute, we test for interviewer gender effects on men in the Middle East and North Africa, where studies of data quality are particularly scarce. Theoretically, we focus on the implications of less gender-egalitarian contexts for response tendencies. For questions about politics and government, we find that men respondents tend to provide more socially desirable responses to men interviewers, offering “safer” and more pro-regime answers. Yet, for questions that touch on their own social status, such as self-reported income and religiosity, they appear to offer more socially desirable responses to women interviewers. The findings strengthen the case for comparative investigations of data quality, and highlight the value of contextual knowledge about politics and gender relations.",

          "authors": "Chiara Respi, Marco Gui, Gaetano Scaduto, Miriam Serini, Dario Pizzul, Tiziano Gerosa, Christoph Lutz",
          "abstract": "Prior research on digital inequality has highlighted the role of sociocultural resources in shaping Internet beneficial use patterns by positively impacting on online literacy. Research on privacy protection online has—at the same time—shown the emergence of a “privacy cynicism,” where concerns about privacy fail to translate into protective actions. This study investigates how education level impacts privacy protection behavior through these two different mediation paths. Using unique data from a sample of 3,156 Italian Internet users, structural equation modeling (SEM) is employed to analyze the linkages between education level, privacy literacy, privacy cynicism, and protective behaviors. Contrary to expectations, the results reveal a moderate negative impact of education level on privacy protection behaviors. This total effect is the results of two different paths exerting opposite effects on protection behaviors. While a higher education correlates with increased privacy literacy, this competence does not translate into proactive protective actions. Surprisingly, individuals with higher privacy literacy exhibit even lower levels of protection behavior, contributing to a negative indirect effect of education on privacy protection. On the other side, the indirect effect of education on behaviors through privacy cynicism operates consistently with the digital inequality framework, partially compensating the negative effect through literacy. An interpretation of privacy protection as an exception within the digital inequality framework is proposed.",

          "abstract": "With the growing prevalence and accessibility of AI companions, contemporary women are forming relationships with virtual partners. It is important to examine the relational, social, and gender-related implications of this phenomenon. Our research sheds light on the complex power dynamics in young urban Chinese women’s engagements with the AI partner Replika. By analyzing 342 relevant posts from an online chatbot community, guided by Foucault’s concept of power, we uncover inherent and actively exercised power dynamics in three typical user-bot relational pairings: customer-product, human-machine, and woman-man/woman-woman. Following the Foucauldian theories, we analyzed the interplay of truth, desire, knowledge, and power. We discovered three specific neoliberal subjectivities that both free and constrain female users in their engagement with Replika. While these female users challenge traditional gender norms through erotic roleplays with Replika, Generative AI introduces potential risks of sexual harassment and gender bias channeled from the extensive online world through AI partners to individual users.",
