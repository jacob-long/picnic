          "title": "Synthetic Census Microdata Generation: A Comparative Study of Synthesis Methods Examining the Trade-Off Between Disclosure Risk and Utility",
          "authors": "Claire Little, Richard Allmendinger, Mark Elliot",
          "abstract": "There is growing interest in synthetic data generation as a means of allowing access to useful data whilst preserving confidentiality. In particular, synthetic microdata generation could allow increased access to census and administrative data. An accurate understanding of the comparative performance of current synthetic data generators, in terms of the resulting data utility and disclosure risk for synthetic microdata, is important in allowing data owners to make informed decisions about the choice of method and parameter settings to use. Synthesizing microdata can present challenges as the data typically contains predominantly categorical variables that standard statistical methods may struggle to process. In this paper we present the first in-depth evaluation of four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators originating from the statistical (synthpop, DataSynthesizer) and deep learning (CTGAN, TVAE) communities and each capable of dealing with microdata. We use four real census microdatasets (Canada, Fiji, Rwanda, UK) to systematically validate and compare the synthetic data generators and their parameter settings in terms of the utility and disclosure risk of the resulting synthetic data using statistical metrics and the risk-utility map for visualization. Our analysis shows that the performance of the synthetic data generators considered depends on their parameter settings and the dataset.",

          "authors": "David A Marker, Charity Hilton, Jacob Zelko, Jon Duke, Deborah Rolka, Rachel Kaufmann, Richard Boyd",
          "abstract": "Government statistical offices worldwide are under pressure to produce statistics rapidly and for more detailed geographies, to compete with unofficial estimates available from web-based big data sources or from private companies. Commonly suggested sources of improved health information are electronic health records and medical claims data. These data sources are collectively known as real-world data (RWD) because they are generated from routine health care processes, and they are available for millions of patients. It is clear that RWD can provide estimates that are more timely and less expensive to produce—but a key question is whether or not they are very accurate. To test this, we took advantage of a unique health data source that includes a full range of sociodemographic variables and compared estimates using all of those potential weighting variables versus estimates derived when only age and sex are available for weighting (as is common with most RWD sources). We show that not accounting for other variables can produce misleading and quite inaccurate health estimates.",

          "title": "Why People Accept Mental Health-Related Misinformation: Role of Social Media Metrics in Users’ Information Processing",
          "authors": "Shiyi Zhang, Huiyu Zhou, Yimei Zhu",
          "abstract": "Drawing on dual-process theories, this study aims to investigate the factors associated with social media users’ acceptance of mental health-related misinformation (MHRM). We conducted a case study of Chinese microblogging Weibo on conversations that emerged following a publicised celebrity suicide of South Korean superstar Sulli. This incident sparked an extensive discussion on mental health issues as Sulli was reported to have suffered from depression prior to her death. Whilst previous studies on users’ information acceptance mainly adopted survey methods, our study employs a mixed-method approach (i.e. computational data collection method, content analysis and statistical analysis), which opens up new directions to utilise secondary social media data. We identified MHRM from the discussions on Weibo and labelled the responses to the misinformation as whether they indicate an acceptance of the MHRM. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the associations of receivers’ acceptance of MHRM with its information features (e.g. number of likes) and information sources (e.g. gender). Inconsistent with previous studies, our findings suggest that MHRM is less likely to be accepted when published by male users, underscoring the context-specific nature of heuristic cues. This study also revealed some novel findings, such as MHRM with more pictures or with more words is less likely to be accepted. A theoretical model was proposed based on the findings, which highlights the importance of heuristic cues and individuals’ pre-existing knowledge in information processing.",
