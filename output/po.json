          "title": "Bias Correction in Multiple Systems Estimation",
          "authors": "Daan B. Zult, Peter G. M. van der Heijden, Bart F. M. Bakker",
          "abstract": "If part of a population is hidden but two or more samples are available that each cover parts of this population, multiple systems estimation can be applied to estimate the size of this population. A problem is that these estimates suffer from finite-sample bias that can be substantial in case of a small sample or a small population size. This problem was recognized by Chapman, who derived his essentially unbiased Chapman-estimator for two samples. Because more than two samples may be required to correct for sample dependence, we propose a Generalized Chapman-estimator that can be applied with any number of samples. In a Monte Carlo experiment, this new estimator shows hardly any bias and has smaller standard errors than competing bias-reduced estimators. It is also compared to the usual maximum likelihood estimates for the case of estimating the number of homeless people in the Netherlands, where it shows notably different outcomes.",

          "authors": "Daniel Auer, Markus Freitag",
          "abstract": "We argue that threat-induced anger is not a universal driver of populist attitudes and waning political support. Instead, we hypothesize that anger erodes democracy-relevant political attitudes only when a threat affects citizens’ norms and only when blame for said threat is attributed to the domestic political system. We corroborate our hypotheses using data from a unique survey experiment conducted in Germany in 2022, in which we vary the level of responsibility attribution and threat noxiousness by exposing respondents to different threats that were salient during the field phase. The results indicate that citizens differentiate whom they hold accountable, such that it is not necessarily the quality of the threat but the quality of the political response to the threat that determines the future of democracy.",

          "title": "Did Trump’s Indictments Rally His Base? Evidence from the Counterfactual Format",
          "authors": "Soubhik Barari, Alexander Coppock, Matthew H Graham, Zoe Padgett",
          "abstract": "In the task of assessing how sudden, significant events causally affect public opinion, political pollsters often ask respondents how the event affected their attitudes and beliefs. We study the case of former President Donald Trump’s federal indictment for allegedly mishandling classified documents using two methods of retrospective causal inference. The commonly used change format asks respondents to state directly how the event affected their attitudes: Republicans say the event increased their support of Trump, while Democrats say the opposite. Like previous work, we argue that the change format exhibits a form of bias known as response substitution. The alternative counterfactual format is plausibly free of this source of error and asks respondents to imagine what their attitudes and beliefs would have been if the event had not happened. Using this method, Republican primary voters report that the indictment increased their belief that Trump mishandled documents (+2.5 pp) and decreased their intention to vote for him in the primaries (−1.6 pp). We argue that the counterfactual format is particularly valuable for studying the effects of highly salient news events like the Trump indictment on public opinion.",
