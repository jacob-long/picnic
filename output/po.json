          "title": "On the Use of Proxy Variables in Statistical Matching Under Complex Sampling Designs",
          "authors": "Daniela Marella, Vincenzina Vitale",
          "abstract": "Statistical matching aims to combine samples drawn from the same population, where each sample contains information only on some of the variables of interest. The lack of joint observations produces uncertainty about the data-generating model. The paper is devoted to the study of uncertainty in statistical matching for complex sample surveys when a proxy variable is only available in one sample. Such a variable can be used both to verify the conditional independence assumption and to provide a set of plausible estimates of the distribution of variables not jointly observed when such an assumption is not satisfied. Finally, a simulation study is performed and an application to integrate objective and subjective well-being measures is provided.",

          "title": "Voice and Value: How Elected Officials Evaluate Online and Offline Constituent Feedback",
          "authors": "Nathan Lee, Kaiping Chen, William Marble, Curtis Bram",
          "abstract": "Social media has made it easier than ever for citizens to voice their opinion to their elected representatives. However, officials may infer that constituents who write to them via low-effort online mediums care less about the issues than those who communicate in person. To test how policymakers evaluate messages from constituents, we fielded a national survey of local US policymakers to examine responsiveness to different types of messages. Our findings indicate that online communication presents a double-edged sword: while it lowers the effort needed for constituents to communicate, officials discount information conveyed through social media. We examine this trade-off using an embedded conjoint experiment. Our results suggest that a social media message would have to be sent by more than 47 constituents for it to exceed the value of a single face-to-face meeting. These findings illustrate that, all else equal, in-person meetings likely remain the most persuasive form of grassroots communication. However, using social media can be an effective choice to the extent that it facilitates a large increase in overall levels of constituent engagement.",

          "authors": "Matthew Barnfield, Joseph Phillips, Florian Stoeckel, Benjamin Lyons, Paula Szewach, Jack Thompson, Vittorio Mérola, Sabrina Stöckli, Jason Reifler",
          "abstract": "Quantitative forecasts have become increasingly prominent as tools for aiding public understanding of sociopolitical trends. But how much, and what, do people learn from quantitative forecasts? In this note, we show through a preregistered survey experiment that real forecasts of the 2022 French presidential election significantly affect expectations of the election result. The direction of that effect hinges on how the forecast is presented. Voters become more accurate and precise in their predictions of each candidate’s vote share when given forecast information in the form of projected vote share. Forecasts presented as numerical probabilities make such expectations less accurate and less precise. When combined, the effects of both forms on vote share expectations tend to cancel out, but jointly boost voters’ ability to identify likely winners. Our findings have implications for the public communication of quantitative information.",

          "title": "Less Partisan but No More Competent: Expressive Responding and Fact-Opinion Discernment",
          "authors": "Matthew H Graham, Omer Yair",
          "abstract": "Research suggests that partisanship interferes with people’s ability to distinguish between factually verifiable statements and opinion statements. We investigate the degree to which observed partisan bias in fact-opinion discernment is due to expressive responding: partisans may claim that congenial opinions are facts, and that uncongenial facts are opinions, because they want to express their partisan attitude toward the statement. Four experiments (total N = 10,614) show that expressive responding substantially inflates measured partisan differences in fact/opinion classifications, by more than 50 percent in the United States and about 30 percent in Israel. Despite this, we find little evidence that our treatments increased the proportion of correct classifications. In other words, although expressive responding makes people look more partisan than they really are, it does not lead surveys to underestimate the average person’s ability to distinguish fact from opinion. These results are compatible because of a rarely noted implication of expressive responding theory: when the correct answer is party congenial, expressive responding makes people look more competent than they really are. Notably, expressive responding emerged despite the survey instrument’s instructions not to respond in this manner. This suggests that approaches that rely on instructions or requests may be too weak to eliminate expressive responding.",
