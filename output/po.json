          "authors": "Naomi Diz-Rosales, María José Lombardía, Domingo Morales",
          "abstract": "Using a two-fold Fay-Herriot model with random intercepts and random regression coefficients, we develop area-level predictors for poverty proportions and propose both analytic and bootstrap-based estimators for the mean squared error. Model parameters are estimated via residual maximum likelihood, and empirical best linear unbiased predictors are used for random effects. To assess the performance of the estimation algorithm, predictors, and mean squared error estimators, we conduct simulation studies. The proposed methodology is applied to data from the 2022 Spanish Living Conditions Survey to estimate poverty proportions at the provincial level, disaggregated by gender and age group. This study offers a robust and innovative framework for small-area estimation, enabling detailed poverty mapping with accurate estimates and reliable uncertainty measures.",

          "authors": "Dvir Yogev",
          "abstract": "American public opinion has shifted away from tough-on-crime policies, yet the conditions for supporting progressive reform on the ballot remain unclear. This study develops a theory of voting behavior in prosecutor elections. I utilized the recall of a progressive prosecutor to examine voters’ revealed preferences in a pivotal crime and justice politics setting. I show that the correct response to voters requires attention to legal reform’s intensive and extensive margins. Despite the media narratives, I argue that voters favor reforming the intensity of the criminal legal system; voters support reducing outcomes’ harshness but not limiting the scope of prosecuted behavior. This research also indicates that moral concerns drive support for decreasing the intensive margin, while opposition to changing the extensive margin is rooted in the desire to maintain deterrence. Politicians who intend to end mass incarceration should focus on reducing the criminal legal system’s intensive margin to gain political approval.",

          "authors": "Wen Zeng, Chandni Kumar, Sinong Zhou, Donggyu Kim, Aimei Yang, Dmitri Williams",
          "abstract": "This study investigates networked social influence in Sky: Children of the Light , a social multiplayer online game. Drawing on survey responses ( n = 9,254) and in-game data from over 660,000 players, we use an innovative graph-based machine learning approach to quantify how individuals influence others’ playtime, and regression analyses to test predictors from the COM-B model. Results show that Capability enhances influence, although excessive task focus correlates negatively with social impact; Opportunity emerges as the strongest predictor, with active social interactions significantly boosting influence; and Motivation varies by playstyle, with socializers and competitors demonstrating greater influence than narrative-focused players. By applying the COM-B model in a digital gaming context, this research highlights behavioral dimensions of player influence and employs a novel metric for quantifying interpersonal influence. These findings suggest practical implications for game design, particularly by highlighting how social interaction opportunities and different player motivations shape influence within communities.",

          "title": "From Search to Separation: Digital Behavioral Decoupling and the Predictive Power of Google Trends for Divorce Outcomes Across Four Western Nations",
          "authors": "Emre Can Kuran, Umut Kuran",
          "abstract": "Digital search platforms enable real-time observation of relationship distress through behavioral traces. This study tests whether Google Trends predicts official divorce rates in the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom from 2009 to 2023. We introduce Digital Behavioral Decoupling, in which online distress signals diverge from legal outcomes as divorce shifts from an institutional procedure to an emotionally mediated digital phenomenon. Methods include unit root tests, cointegration analysis, Granger causality, spectral coherence, and rolling-origin nowcasting. Search queries are grouped into pre-divorce (cognitive distress), during-divorce (procedural action), and post-divorce (emotional recovery) phases. Results show 62.5% of terms lead divorce rates by 1–2 years, yet only 8.3% remain significant after False Discovery Rate correction. The Netherlands demonstrates 100% forecast improvements beyond autoregressive models (DM 2.87–3.43, p &lt; 0.02) across all search terms, from early relationship therapy queries through procedural and post-divorce searches, indicating systematic capture of the entire divorce pathway. Germany shows intermediate results with 33% forecast success beyond autoregressive benchmarks (DM 2.40–2.81) limited to problem-recognition terms, suggesting episodic crisis-driven engagement. The United States and United Kingdom show no forecast gains beyond autoregressive models despite high search volumes, consistent with information saturation in normalized divorce cultures. Lead-lag relationships are frequency-specific, concentrated at 3–5 year periodicities. Findings link family sociology with affective computing and provide a replicable toolkit for tracking relationship dissolution in algorithmically curated information environments.",
