          "title": "How Does Noise Protection Affect the Accuracy of Life Expectancy and Other Demographic Indicators?",
          "authors": "Fabian Bach",
          "abstract": "New and efficient methods based on noise addition to protect the confidentiality in population statistics have been developed, tested, and applied in census production by various members of the European Statistical System over the past years. Basic demographic statistics—such as population stocks, live births and deaths by age, sex, and region—may be protected in a similar way, but also form the raw input to calculate various demographic indicators. This paper analyzes the impact on the accuracy of some selected indicators, namely fertility and mortality rates and life expectancies, under the assumption that the raw input counts are protected with a generic noise method with fixed variance parameter, by comparing the size of noise uncertainties with intrinsic statistical uncertainties using a Poisson model. As a by-product, we derive and validate numerically a closed analytical expression for the variance of life expectancies in a certain class of calculation models as a function of the variance of input mortality data. This expression also allows to calculate analytically the statistical uncertainty of life expectancies using the mentioned Poisson model for the input death counts.",

          "title": "Controlling Acquiescent Response Style Through Negated Versus Polar Opposite Items: Design Considerations for Balancing Measurement Scales",
          "authors": "Fernanda Alvarado-Leiton, Sunghee Lee, Rachel E Davis",
          "abstract": "Acquiescent response style (ARS) is the tendency to agree with measurement items regardless of their content. ARS tends to differ across cultures, making it particularly relevant for cross-cultural research, as it may disrupt cross-cultural comparability. Balanced measurement scales include items written in different directions of the measured construct and are hypothesized to be a remedy for undesirable effects of ARS. This study examined the effect on measurement properties of three scale balancing approaches in a cross-cultural research setting: (i) unbalanced scales; (ii) scale balancing with negated items where some of the items were written with a negation, such as “no” or “not”; and (iii) scale balancing that introduce items written with polar opposite terms (e.g. “unhappy” as the opposite of “satisfied”) that reversed the item direction without using negations. This study examined these approaches on four well-being measurement scales, originally unbalanced, that used an Agree-Disagree Likert response scale. Participants were recruited to a Web survey from three groups: U.S. non-Hispanic whites (n = 1,200, interviewed in English), U.S. Hispanics (n = 1,200, interviewed in English), and Mexicans (n = 1,200, interviewed in Spanish). Respondents were randomly assigned to one scale-balancing conditions for well-being measures. Balanced scales outperformed unbalanced scales for convergent validity, with higher correlations observed between scale scores and validation measures. Between negated and polar opposite balancing, no statistical differences were observed in factorial model fit, reliability, or convergent validity. This study supports that, when designed carefully, balanced measurement scales may be effective for addressing ARS and improving measurement properties over unbalanced scales.",

          "authors": "Tao Fan, Hao Wang, Tobias Hodel",
          "abstract": "The emergence and advancement of new technologies present promising opportunities for data-driven research in the Digital Humanities (DH). As an innovative intersection of quantum computing and humanities data, Quantum Humanities (QH) holds significant research potential. However, current studies related to QH remain scarce with limited applications involving quantum deep learning, and its feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency on humanities data need in-depth exploration. To address this gap, this paper takes the role type recognition of painted faces of Beijing Opera as a case study. Several classical and competitive quantum deep learning–based and classical deep learning–based models (e.g., quantum convolutional neural networks and classical convolutional neural networks) are selected for comparison on the public image dataset Painted Faces of Beijing Opera digitized from books. Extensive empirical experimental results demonstrate that quantum deep learning–based models are of certain advantages and hold promising prospects in applied DH practices.",

          "authors": "Nafisa Nowshin, Kelsy Kretschmer, Glencora Borradaile",
          "abstract": "The Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022 reversed 50 years of precedent by allowing states to formulate their own abortion policies. This resetting of abortion policy created a new raft of opportunities and threats across the states for both pro-life and pro-choice supporters. In this study, we aim to analyze how public discourse around abortion responded to this changed political context. Using a dataset of 288,325 abortion-related Tweets posted in 2022, we examine public reaction to Dobbs using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. We categorize Tweets by abortion stance (pro-choice and pro-life ) and geo-political context by state groups ( protected, restricted, and unsettled based on abortion access policy). Our temporal analysis shows that while both pro-choice and pro-life Twitter activity spiked after both the leaked draft in May 2022 and the final decision, only pro-choice discussions maintained a heightened level of engagement over time. Analyzing the discussion frames among the Tweets reveals that pro-choice users emphasized a wider range of arguments that varied by state context, while pro-life Tweets were generally unresponsive to state context. Our findings indicate that the new threats and opportunities had uneven effects within pro-life and pro-choice public discourse.",

          "authors": "Terri L. Towner, Caroline Muñoz",
          "abstract": "This study investigates which members of the 118th U.S. Congress adopt and use Threads and TikTok, and what political, demographic, and constituency-level characteristics explain this variation. Grounded in diffusion of innovation theory, we ask: What factors predict the adoption and use of these emerging platforms? We compiled original data on all members of Congress ( N = 535) by collecting social media account information from official congressional websites and manually verifying platform presence. Adoption was measured as a binary variable, and usage as the number of posts made through November 2023. Using probit and OLS regression models, we tested predictors including party affiliation, age, race, leadership status, and prior digital engagement. The empirical analyses reveal that Democrats and younger legislators are more likely to adopt Threads and TikTok. Prior digital engagement consistently predicts usage on both platforms. Notably, racial identity plays a critical role: non-white members are more likely to adopt and use TikTok, while white members are more likely to use Threads. This study offers the first empirical analysis of congressional adoption and usage of Threads and TikTok. Our findings demonstrate that platform choice is shaped by identity, institutional context, and political strategy. These findings offer new insights into the determinants of early platform adoption among U.S. congress members and the importance of aligning communication choices with constituent behavior and platform culture.",

          "authors": "Justin Bonest Phillips, Timothy B. Gravelle, Andrea Carson, Mathew D. Marques",
          "abstract": "Unlike past studies that examine whether fact-checking can counter conspiratorial belief, we reverse the lens to investigate if fact-checking itself prompts conspiracy belief. Our study occurs in the days immediately preceding the 2024 US election. Shortly thereafter, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg abandoned Facebook’s third-party program altogether, arguing fact-checkers “have destroyed more trust than they have created.” We provide timely insight into fact-checking concerns using a preregistered online survey-based experiment of US Facebook users’ ( n = 2,409), randomly assigned to view either a generic Facebook fact-check (treatment) or a Facebook login screen. Results show no overall effects of third-party fact-checking on users’ propensity for conspiratorial beliefs. However, when individuals with high conspiracy mentality and strong conservative identification encounter a fact-check, they are more likely to endorse Facebook-related conspiracy beliefs. We also observe a three-way interaction among political independents with high and low conspiracy beliefs, where fact-checking potentially triggers or reduces such beliefs.",

          "authors": "Paul Muya, Tabitha Onyinge",
          "abstract": "This study examines the impact of performatives and evolving social media typology in shaping political activism among Kenya’s Generation Z (Gen Z) movement during the 2024 anti-tax law protests. The study addresses the questions of the role of performatives and how social media has revolutionised their production, reproduction, and consumption in political activism in Kenya. Based on qualitative content analysis and critical discourse analysis, the study employed purposive sampling of a collection of digital artefacts, including memes, protest songs, TikTok videos, graffiti-inspired art, and Twitter threads, which were drawn from the #RejectFinanceBill2024 campaign. Analytical categories were derived from literature on performative activism, postcolonial media theory, and digital political communication. The findings suggest that Kenya’s Gen Z activists adopted a highly performative mode of social media resistance, blending entertainment with activism. The content of performatives was found to function not only as expressive tools but also as mechanisms for mobilising support, challenging state narratives, and asserting digital visibility. Social media was found to circumvent traditional media gatekeeping, amplifying the voices of the marginalised, and fostering an enlightened political culture. The study identifies a cyclic loop of production and reproduction of performatives, reinforcing African people’s communal identity formation and resistance posturing. Findings highlight how Gen Z’s social media use is reshaping civic engagement in the postcolonial public sphere. The study advances theoretical understanding of how visual and performative content is democratising political discourse, disrupting power hierarchies, and deepening participatory governance in the Global South. This study contributes to the body of literature on digital media and political communication by illuminating the intersection of social movement, culture, aesthetics, and performativities in resistance. These insights are particularly relevant for scholars and practitioners interested in digital media use, activism, political communication, and youth-led social movements.",

          "authors": "Conor Gaughan, Alexandru Cernat, Rachel Gibson, Marta Cantijoch, Riza Batista-Navarro",
          "abstract": "Survey research is entering a new era which centres on its linkage with other forms of digitally generated data such as social media. Many suggest that this can help to address existing weaknesses in self-report surveys such as non-response and measurement bias. However, to link a participant’s survey responses to their social media data, consent from the participant is required. Previous studies have shown that consent to linkage is typically low and selective. This paper expands on the existing literature by comparing Twitter (now X) usage and consent to survey linkage across five national contexts. Testing the effects of several sociodemographic and attitudinal predictors in the US, the UK, France, Germany and Poland, our study finds that overall consent rates vary significantly by age, political attention, privacy concern, trust in social media companies and frequency of political posting on Twitter/X. However, our results also confirm that variable effects differ significantly between nations, suggesting a moderating cultural influence. Within-country variation in the US between 2020 and 2024 is also present, indicating that effects are not necessarily fixed over time. These findings dictate the need for caution when conducting substantive comparisons across countries and time when using social media data.",

          "authors": "Yuri Kasahara, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, Anis Yazidi, Pedro G. Lind",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics of anti-Muslim hate speech within Norwegian social media during the period between 2010 and 2021. Using a dataset of more than one million comments from Twitter and Facebook, we developed a custom hate speech classifier trained on an annotated corpus of 3,277 comments in Norwegian language. We identify that despite representing a small share of the total comments, hate speech content has increased over time. In an effort to understand the social network characteristics of hate speech content, we delve deeper into Twitter conversations as we can more easily identify how this content is spread. We develop network metrics to assess the prevalence, distribution, and diffusion of hateful content. The findings reveal that regardless of the number of users or tweets in a conversation, the volume of hateful content tends to remain constant. Furthermore, a small fraction of users contribute disproportionately to the dissemination of hate speech, with most conversations being limited in participant diversity. These results contribute to the growing field of computational social science by offering a novel methodology for studying hate speech in under-resourced languages and suggesting that mitigating hate speech may be possible through targeted network interventions rather than content removal alone.",
