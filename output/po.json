          "abstract": "The paper presents methodology to generate experimental small area estimates (SAE) of poverty in four West African countries: Chad, Guinea, Mali, and Niger. Due to the absence of recent census data in the four countries, household level survey data are integrated with grid-level geospatial data, which are used as covariates in model-based estimation. Leveraging geospatial data enables reporting of poverty estimates more frequently at disaggregated administrative levels and makes estimation feasible in areas for which survey data are not available. The paper leverages the availability of a recent census in Burkina Faso for evaluation purposes. Estimates obtained with the same survey instruments and candidate geospatial covariates as the other four countries are compared against estimates obtained using recent census data and an empirical best predictor under a unit level model. For Burkina Faso, estimates obtained using geospatial data are highly correlated with the census-based ones in sampled areas but moderately correlated in non-sampled areas. The results demonstrate that in the absence of recent census data, small area estimation with publicly available geospatial covariates is feasible, can lead to large efficiency improvements compared to direct estimation, and improve the timeliness of small area estimates.",

          "title": "People, Platforms, and Places: The Conditional Effects of Psychological Distances on Livestream Viewership",
          "authors": "Zhang Hao Goh, Minzheng Hou, Edson C. Tandoc",
          "abstract": "Reducing the social distance between livestreamers and viewers is known to enhance viewership as well as generate desirable psychosocial and economic outcomes. However, apart from the social dimension, scholars have not explored other distance dimensions that may induce the same benefits. Leveraging the construal level theory, the current study explicates the concept of distance in the form of three different perceived psychological distance dimensions (i.e., perceived response latency, heterophily, and spatialization) to examine how it can induce viewership in the context of livestreaming. A survey conducted in Singapore ( n = 401) found that the effect of perceived heterophily affecting viewership in livestream was moderated by viewers’ chronic construal tendencies, demonstrating a construal fit. The current study provides insights into how chronic differences in viewers’ construal can influence viewership.",
