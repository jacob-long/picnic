          "title": "In Likert Scale, Is Ticking Options Consecutively at Two Ends Equally Problematic as Ticking in the Middle?",
          "authors": "Melissa Dan Wang, Kit-Tai Hau",
          "abstract": "The popularity of self-report surveys brings to light the issue of insufficient effort responding (IER), where participants lack motivation to respond thoughtfully, thereby compromising data quality. A prevalent form of IER, known as straightlining, occurs when participants consistently select the same response for multiple items, leading to potentially biased outcomes. Typically, researchers apply a uniform threshold criterion across all response options (e.g., nine consecutive identical answers in any option are considered problematic). Considering the diverse or near-normal distribution patterns in questionnaire responses, employing varied thresholds for different options may be more appropriate. This study utilized both simulated data and real, large-scale international survey data to examine the likelihood of straightlining as IER across various options. The findings revealed that legitimate straightlining (non-IER) was more common at the extremes than in the middle options. Moreover, the study highlights the significant risks of incorrectly categorizing non-IER straightlining as IER without corroborating evidence. In conclusion, our results question the conventional approaches to eliminating straightlining, including (a) the application of a uniform cutoff value across different options or adopting stricter criteria for middle options and (b) the direct removal of straightlining as IER without additional verification.",

          "title": "Estimation of Discontinuities from the Introduction of Tablet Based Data Collection on the International Passenger Survey",
          "authors": "Paul A. Smith, Jan van den Brakel, Giles Horsfield",
          "abstract": "The International Passenger Survey (IPS) is undertaken by the Office for National Statistics to measure tourism flows and tourist expenditure, and international migration. It is interviewer-administered, and the questionnaire instrument was changed in 2017 to 2018 from a paper questionnaire (completed by the interviewer) to an electronic questionnaire administered with a tablet. For operational reasons no parallel run was possible, but the new questionnaire was rolled out progressively to sampling locations. This phased introduction supported the estimation of the effects of the new questionnaire on the main outputs from the survey. We describe initial simulations designed to estimate the power of the phased introduction approach to detect important difference in the IPS outputs, and analyses of the survey estimates at different stages up to the end of 2019 using state-space models, to estimate the discontinuities in the survey outputs. We make an assessment of the effectiveness of the overall approach.",
