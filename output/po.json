          "authors": "Taesim Kim",
          "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, it has been argued that the pandemic has negative aspects related not only to public health but also to democracy. While various crises have been shown to undermine citizens’ attitudes toward democracy, the pandemic, characterized by viral risk, likely showed distinct patterns in democratic attitudes compared to previous crises. In this study, I argue that the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative aspects for democracy were not evident in citizens’ satisfaction with democracy but were more significantly evident in their attitudes toward democratic norms and principles. Data collected in South Korea between 2020 and 2024 show that, while citizens’ perceptions of viral risk are not significantly associated with their satisfaction with democracy, positive evaluations of the government’s capacity in handling COVID-19 are tied to an increase in satisfaction. However, higher perceived viral risk levels and greater government capacity evaluations are associated with stronger support for stringent policy measures that violate democratic norms and principles. Finally, the reduction in perceived viral risk does not correlate with changes in attitudes toward stringent policy measures. Therefore, the pandemic’s negative implications for attitudes toward democratic norms and principles have the potential to linger long-term in post-pandemic politics.",

          "authors": "Olivia Ståhl",
          "abstract": "Statistics Sweden employs a unique approach to higher-level aggregation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In the Swedish method, so-called “long-term links” are used to incorporate contemporaneous weight information into the index with a two-year lag. We compare this approach to the more standard method used for the European Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), as well as to a long-term link variation of the HICP methodology. Our main focus is on year-on-year rates of change. This is motivated by the fact that, while long-term links by construction should improve the measurement of price change over longer time periods, effects on year-on-year inflation are less clear. In a simulation study performed on Swedish data, inflation rates are evaluated against a common benchmark measure. Several types of decompositions are also derived to help further explain differences and similarities between the methods.",

          "abstract": "Absences are inescapable in data. Data collection always focuses on some elements while occluding others. Yet, how absences are considered and recorded within data infrastructures markedly transforms the inferences that can be made. Tracing a genealogy from early databases to contemporary AI datasets, this paper explores how data infrastructures have grappled with the inherent incompleteness of data. Specifically, I uncover a tension between a desire for certainty and acknowledging partiality at the foundation of data science that continues to pervade contemporary AI datasets. Drawing on archival studies and sociological perspectives, I argue that data science must embrace uncertainty by recognizing the “ghosts in the data”—the uncounted, the unrepresented, and the silenced—and how their absence shapes the outcomes of automated systems.",

          "title": "Unblackboxing How Sociotemporalities Inform AI Accountability: The Case of Targeted Advertising",
          "authors": "Faranak Hardcastle, Kathryn Henne, Jenna Imad Harb, Ashlin Lee, John Noel Viana, Susan Halford",
          "abstract": "In recent years, numerous accountability interventions have been introduced to address the harms and inequalities associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Early efforts concentrated on transparency and explainability, often operationalized as technical fixes intended to “open the black box” and render algorithmic processes more intelligible. However, sociological research has revealed the limitations of these interventions, particularly their narrow focus on the technical and operational dimensions of AI. In response, sociologists have broadened the scope of “unblackboxing” to include the sociomaterialities of AI, or the social, political, and environmental relations that both shape and are shaped by AI technologies and their infrastructures. This article extends this agenda by focusing on sociotemporalities: the narratives and structures of time that shape both AI systems and the interventions meant to improve their accountability. We re-analyze interviews from a retrospective study of transparency in targeted advertising, a domain long associated with concerns about privacy, discrimination and opaque practices. Drawing on the sociology of time, and especially the sociology of the future, we examine the sociotemporalities that actively shaped the development of targeted advertising technologies at the time and influenced key informants’ thinking about approaches to improve accountability. Our analysis suggests that sociotemporalities exerted a structuring influence on how “appropriate” accountability interventions were imagined and enacted, ultimately shaping the emergent present of targeted advertising. We discuss the application of such an approach in the context of emerging AI technologies and AI accountability interventions. We conclude by arguing that expanding unblackboxing to include sociotemporal as well as sociomaterial dimensions can help open new pathways for designing and implementing more practical, effective, and context-specific AI accountability interventions.",

          "title": "Campaign Deepfakes and Affective Polarization: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Campaigns in Shaping Voter Attitudes",
          "authors": "Taberez Ahmed Neyazi, Tan Khai Ee, Ozan Kuru",
          "abstract": "Does exposure to news about out-party campaigns’ increasing use of deepfakes further increase polarization among partisans, and how does this impact vary among different evaluations of political coalitions, parties, and leaders? What role does approval for candidates’ usage of AI play as a moderator in this relationship? This paper examines these questions using data from a survey experiment ( N = 1627), in which each respondent exposed to a news story that varied in their coverage of the growing deployment of AI-powered deepfakes during the 2024 India’s national election campaigns. The findings indicate that exposure to news about out-party campaigns’ use of deepfakes did not polarize attitudes towards coalitions, parties, and leaders. In contrast, approval for candidates’ use of AI was negatively associated with polarization towards coalitions, parties, and leaders, but this did not moderate the experimental effects: respondents who approved of candidates’ AI usage and saw a news article about out-party use of deepfakes were not more polarized toward either coalitions, parties or leaders. This study not only extends the understanding of AI’s role in campaigns by examining its complex effects on affective polarization, but it also broadens empirical research into the impact of deepfakes by focusing on the non-Western context of India, thereby offering new theoretical insights into how technological advancements intersect with political behaviors and attitudes.",

          "authors": "Ines Boeckxstaens, Janneke M. Schokkenbroek, Maxine Noë, Lara Schreurs",
          "abstract": "While social media’s positivity bias has been linked to various well-being implications, little is known about how it relates to young adults’ romantic cognitions and outcomes. This study explores the associations between perceived exposure to positively-biased romantic social media content and relationship satisfaction, as well as fear of being single (FOBS). A cross-sectional survey ( N = 605) was administered and a separate model was tested for young adults in a committed relationship for the outcome relationship satisfaction and for single young adults for the outcome FOBS, by using Structural Equation Modeling. Both models considered romantic partner expectations as a mediator and tested gender and social comparison orientation (SCO) as moderators. Perceived exposure to positively-biased portrayals was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction. There was no link with FOBS. For young adults in a committed relationship, higher partner expectations related positively to relationship satisfaction but were not predicted by exposure to positively-biased portrayals. For singles, exposure to such content did predict higher partner expectations but this did not, in turn, relate to FOBS. Also no significant moderation effects were found for gender and SCO. Our findings highlight the nuanced ways in which the positivity bias can relate to romantic outcomes and underscore the value of authenticity on social media.",
