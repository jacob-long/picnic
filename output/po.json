          "abstract": "Lengthy web surveys can be burdensome for respondents to complete in a single session. This study experimentally examines the effects of different app-based surveys, some of which use a modular design, on perceived burden, breakoffs, and indicators of satisficing behaviors. Participants (n = 664) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) a browser-based web survey (control group), (2) an app-based survey, (3) a modular app dividing the survey into seven parts, and (4) a sequential modular app releasing modules at 48-hour intervals. Our findings indicate that administering surveys via apps can reduce the perceived burden of the survey task and improve response quality. Additionally, we find weak evidence that releasing modules individually over time can further enhance response quality, although this approach results in increased breakoffs between modules. The implications of these findings for the use of research apps and modular surveys are discussed.",
