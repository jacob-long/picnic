          "title": "Intergroup Hostility in the Public Sphere: Systematizing the Rising Concern for Affective Polarization Beyond Partisan Lines",
          "authors": "Andrés Shoai",
          "abstract": "Initially conceived to describe a phenomenon between political parties, the concept of affective polarization is increasingly extrapolated to analyze relationships among other identity groups. This reflects a long-standing interest in intergroup relations within public opinion studies and calls for a broad theoretical framework that considers many ingroup/outgroup categorizations as potential disruptors of public sphere processes. By implementing a comprehensive and systematic review of peer-reviewed research on affective polarization (N = 458), we find that nearly one-third of publications extend the concept beyond political parties to encompass divides such as opinion-based, ideological, racial, territorial, and religious identities. After identifying key points of convergence and divergence between interparty and beyond-party research, we conducted a metatheoretical analysis of works that go beyond parties (N = 142) to classify the social groups potentially subject to affective polarization, the factors influencing the public salience of such identities, and the predominant observation methods and measurements. The results support a more dynamic understanding of identity salience in the public sphere and highlight challenges related to terminology and methodological compatibility across different approaches. Overall, the study reveals a growing interest in various forms of intergroup hostility that connects to broader contemporary concerns about democratic values.",

          "title": "Attitudes of Qatari Nationals Toward Expatriates",
          "authors": "Buthaina Al-Khelaifi, Lina Bader, Engi Elmaghraby, John Lee Holmes, Fahmida Naheen, Abdoulaye Diop",
          "abstract": "Since December 2010, when Qatar won the bid to host the FIFA World Cup 2022, scholars’ interests have mainly focused on the treatment of migrant workers whose skills and expertise are essential for Qatar's development. However, scholars also need to study nationals’ perspectives vis-à-vis expatriate workers and their impact on Qatar's social and economic landscape. In 2020, the Social and Economic Survey Institute partially replicated a 2012 survey that used a split-sample technique to explore Qataris’ attitudes toward high-skilled and low-skilled expatriates. As in the 2012 study, most Qataris perceived the number of migrant workers to be high. However, unlike the previous study, some citizens also indicated a need to increase certain groups of expatriates to support economic growth. Some important variables measured in the study, such as traffic congestion and openness to new cultures, showed statistically significant changes over the nearly decade-long period. Given the rarity of studies exploring nationals’ views toward expatriates, this replication provides unique insights into how these perspectives evolve alongside societal needs. Moreover, monitoring these trends assists policymakers in fostering a balanced economic and social environment.",

          "title": "Clustering Public Perceptions of Democracy and Exploring Their Relationships With Political Regimes",
          "authors": "Kamil Błaszczyński, Paweł Nowakowski",
          "abstract": "Classifications of democracy perceptions play an important role in political science, enabling the prediction or understanding of socio-political developments. The paper examines perceptions of democracy among citizens worldwide and scrutinizes how these perceptions interrelate with specific political regimes. To attain a comprehensive understanding of democracy perceptions, we utilized data from World Value Survey databases. The study encompassed the opinions of 113,929 respondents from 27 countries over three study waves (2005–2022). Through the k-means cluster analysis, we identified three primary perception types: (1) social liberals, (2) stabilizers, and (3) non-essentialists. We found that the social liberal perception was strongly associated with full-democratic regimes, while stabilizers and non-essentialist perceptions were more linked to flawed democracy, hybrid, and authoritarian regimes. Based on the obtained results, theoretical and methodological considerations were discussed for future public opinion studies.",

          "title": "Conceptualizing, Assessing, and Improving the Quality of Digital Behavioral Data",
          "authors": "Bernd Weiß, Heinz Leitgöb, Claudia Wagner",
          "abstract": "The spread of modern digital technologies, such as social media online platforms, digital marketplaces, smartphones, and wearables, is increasingly shifting social, political, economic, cultural, and physiological processes into the digital space. Social actors using these technologies (directly and indirectly) leave a multitude of digital traces in many areas of life that sum up an enormous amount of data about human behavior and attitudes. This new data type, which we refer to as “digital behavioral data” (DBD), encompasses digital observations of human and algorithmic behavior, which are, amongst others, recorded by online platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, or the World Wide Web) or sensors (e.g., smartphones, RFID sensors, satellites, or street view cameras). However, studying these social phenomena requires data that meets specific quality standards. While data quality frameworks—such as the Total Survey Error framework—have a long-standing tradition survey research, the scientific use of DBD introduces several entirely new challenges related to data quality. For example, most DBD are not generated for research purposes but are a side product of our daily activities. Hence, the data generation process is not based on elaborate research designs, which in turn may have profound implications for the validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of DBD. Furthermore, many forms of DBD lack well-established data models, measurement (error) theories, quality standards, and evaluation criteria. Therefore, this special issue addresses (i) the conceptualization of DBD quality, methodological innovations for its (ii) assessment, and (iii) improvement as well as their sophisticated empirical application.",

          "title": "Welcome to the Brave New World: Lay Definitions of AI at Work and in Daily Life",
          "authors": "Wenbo Li, Shuning Lu, Shan Xu, Xia Zheng",
          "abstract": "This study investigates individuals’ lay definitions—naïve mental representations—of artificial intelligence (AI). Two national surveys in the United States explored lay definitions of AI in the workplace (Study 1) and in everyday life (Study 2) using both open- and closed-ended questions. Open-ended responses were analyzed with natural language processing, and quantitative survey data identified factors associated with these definitions. Results show that conceptions of AI differed by context: workers emphasized efficiency and automation in the workplace, while the general public linked AI to diverse everyday technologies. Across both groups, conceptions remained nuanced yet limited. Sociodemographic factors and personality traits were related to sentiments expressed in definitions, and greater trust in AI predicted more positive sentiments. These findings underscore the need for targeted training and education to foster a more comprehensive public understanding of what AI is and what it can do across different contexts.",

          "title": "Research on False Information Detection Based on Herd Behavior From a Social Network Perspective",
          "authors": "Tianya Cao, Shuang Li, Junjie Jia",
          "abstract": "As social networks become ubiquitous, the rapid dissemination of false information poses a substantial threat to societal stability and public welfare. Although sociological and psychological studies have confirmed the significant role of herd behavior in the spread of false information, traditional detection methods struggle to address the dual challenges posed by decentralized communication modes and artificial intelligence-generated content, as they often overlook the psychological mechanisms at play within groups. This study proposes a multidimensional false information detection model, termed HBD-Net, based on herd behavior, to explore innovative methods for false information detection through the lens of herd behavior propagation mechanisms in social networks. By integrating multidimensional information such as the influence of opinion leaders, popular comments, and friends’ experiences, we construct a robust false information detection model. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance on both the PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets, particularly excelling on the GossipCop dataset with an accuracy of 93.11%, significantly outperforming other baseline models.",
