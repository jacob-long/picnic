          "title": "The COVID-19 Shock Through the Lens of the Spanish Sales Daily Data: Modeling and Seasonal Adjustment Challenges",
          "authors": "Ángel Cuevas, Enrique M. Quilis",
          "abstract": "We explore the impact of the COVID-19 shock on a very high frequency indicator: the Spanish daily sales data compiled by the Tax Agency. Firstly, we present a detailed list of the issues related to its modeling, its decomposition (trend, seasonality, and irregularity) and its final seasonal adjustment, which requires a set of deterministic factors linked mostly to calendar effects. Then, we assess the impact of the COVID-19 shock on these tasks. This assessment provides a timely perspective on the evolution of the shock and the challenges that it posed for modeling and seasonal adjustment, clearly related to its unusual and extreme features. The aim of the paper is eminently empirical and dominated by the need to square the unprecedented shock with the available methods and software in a computing environment centered on the R programming language. The methodology draws heavily on a structural approach and it is currently in use by the Tax Agency to compile and disseminate its daily sales data.",

          "title": "Does Varying the Order of Sexual Orientation Response Categories Change Population Estimates? Findings from a Nationally Representative Study of U.S. Adults",
          "authors": "Christopher Hansen, Leah M Christian, Erin Fordyce, Bryn David",
          "abstract": "Conventional wisdom for general population research suggests that nominal response categories be ordered by population prevalence. Current best practice in sexual orientation measurement represents an exception, with lesbian or gay recommended as the first response category, followed by the second, but most selected category, straight, that is, not lesbian or gay. Although prior research has shown that there can be differences in response distributions by response ordering, there has been a dearth of empirical work to investigate the potential of such context effects in sexual orientation measurement. To address this gap, we surveyed U.S. adults aged 18+ in 2022 using a nationally representative, probability-based household panel (n = 2,099) where panelists were asked “Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?” with response categories lesbian or gay; straight, that is, not lesbian or gay; bisexual; something else; and I don’t know the answer. Panelists were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The control group was asked the standard ordering lesbian or gay followed by straight, that is, not lesbian or gay. The treatment group was asked straight, that is, not lesbian or gay followed by lesbian or gay. The order of the remaining responses was the same for both groups. Results do not show a significant relationship between response order and sexual orientation but suggest additional research with a larger sample would be useful. Compared to the lesbian/gay first group, the straight first group showed a significant decrease in proportion for don’t know responses. Differences in proportions for the remaining responses were not significant. Young adulthood was predictive of don’t know responses in both groups, indicating that don’t know responses may capture sexual fluidity, change, or uncertainty in addition to potential satisficing. Findings demonstrate that reordering response categories by population prevalence may improve data quality by decreasing item nonresponse.",

          "title": "Nationalist Erosion after Protest and Repression",
          "authors": "Scott Desposato, Cal Zurich, Jason Y Wu",
          "abstract": "The leaders of authoritarian regimes often invoke nationalist themes to garner support from their populations. However, negative experiences with the regime may effectively inoculate individuals against nationalist campaigns, reducing the ability of the regime to sway public opinion. In this paper, we study the long-term effects of mobilization and repression on nationalist attitudes. We exploit a discontinuity in exposure to a student movement, by comparing alumni who were in college and on campus during the movement with alumni who only enrolled after the movement was suppressed. We find that alumni who were in college during the movement are substantially less nationalistic than those who enrolled shortly thereafter. Our findings are consistent across a range of specifications and show that exposure to mass mobilization and state repression is associated with lower support for nationalism. These differences are observable more than twenty-five years later, despite sustained state censorship.",
