          "title": "Media Visibility and Information-Seeking: Analyzing the Impact of News Coverage on Wikipedia Pageviews of Estonian MPs (2015–2023)",
          "authors": "Tatiana Lupacheva",
          "abstract": "The news media are a primary but limited source of political information for voters. This article examines how the media coverage of members of parliament (MPs) prompts people to seek more information about MPs—an important element of voters’ political knowledge and democratic accountability. I use all available online content from four major Estonian newspapers during 2015–2023 ( ∼ 140,000 articles) and pre-trained transformer models to classify the sentiment and policy issues of news articles that mention MPs. I match media data with MPs’ Wikipedia pageviews on a daily basis over two legislative terms. First, the results show that media visibility of MPs is associated with more views of their Wikipedia page on the same day. Second, news articles with negative sentiment have a greater impact on information-seeking than those with a positive or neutral tone. Third, the impact of MPs' media appearances on information-seeking is dependent on the policy context as well as party affiliation. The findings have implications for understanding the consequences of political communication and democratic representation in the digital age.",

          "title": "AI’s Sociological Era",
          "authors": "Jenny L. Davis, Mona Sloane",
          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a social structure cloaked in technical blackboxes and polarizing narratives. Sociology is the study of society from a structural perspective, delineating the interplays between individuals, organizations, institutions, and cultures. Sociology’s disciplinary lens is necessary to understand AI’s infrastructural force, reflecting and shaping politics, economies, knowledge, and interpersonal spheres. Yet to date, the field of AI research has been dominated by computer science and engineering, underutilizing the explanatory power of sociological theories and methods honed by the discipline over more than a century. Building on a collection of papers that illustrate AI as both a product and driver of social patterns and processes, we demonstrate that the diffusion of AI necessitates sociological analyses now more than ever, positioning sociology at the forefront of AI studies’ next era.",

          "title": "Using Artificial Intelligence to Generate Visual Vignettes in Factorial Survey Experiments",
          "authors": "Nicole Schwitter",
          "abstract": "Factorial survey experiments are widely used in the social sciences to study decision-making and attitudes through controlled, experimentally manipulated scenarios – typically presented as text. While textual vignettes offer flexibility and ease of use, they often lack realism and may limit participant engagement. This article explores how generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to create customisable images for visual vignettes. It demonstrates techniques for producing and selectively editing images, highlighting their potential to address the demands of experimental social science research, while it also acknowledges key challenges, including ethical considerations, biases inherent in AI tools, and technical limitations. The article showcases potential applications of AI-generated images in social science research and draws on a pretest with human participants to present evidence on how AI-generated images are perceived and interpreted. By critically evaluating both opportunities and challenges, this article provides researchers with practical guidance on integrating AI-generated visuals into factorial survey experiments, enhancing methodological approaches in the social sciences.",

          "title": "Incivility in Reddit’s Top Political and News Subreddits: Prevalence, Moderation, and Engagement",
          "authors": "Chris J. Vargo, Tobias Hopp",
          "abstract": "We examine incivility across twenty high-traffic political and news subreddits to test how platform governance and social identity cues relate to on-platform discourse and participation. Building on theories of democratic communication and incivility, platform affordances and moderation, and uses-and-gratifications/network externalities, we specify how decentralized community rules and explicit in-group orientations could shape both the prevalence of uncivil language and patterns of engagement. We analyze a year-long, random sample of submissions and comments scored with established computational measures of incivility, and we link these scores to subreddit-level rule regimes and identity signaling. By distinguishing interpersonal impoliteness from democratic norm violations and by evaluating moderation complexity at the community level, this work clarifies when and how community governance relates to discourse quality and participation dynamics on Reddit. Findings inform ongoing debates about the efficacy of hybrid, human-centered moderation and the role of explicit identity norms in large online communities.",
