          "abstract": "In multi-day diary surveys, participants decide daily whether to continue. The day-level nonresponse can introduce nonresponse errors, and underreporting tends to increase over the data collection period. To address these problems, we propose an adjustment by either the construction of person-day level survey weights or multiple imputation (MI). This study used data from the US National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) and focused on four key outcomes in this survey: the occurrence and expenditure of daily food-at-home (FAH) and food-away-from-home (FAFH) events reported by individuals. We employed logistic regression models and conditional inference trees to predict daily response propensities and used the inverse of predicted response propensity as an adjustment factor for the existing FoodAPS household weights. As an alternative, we conducted MI for the key outcome variables using chained equations and fit zero-inflated imputation models for counts and semi-continuous variables to allow bounds and subset restrictions. The results show that raw estimates for the key variables are consistently smaller than those produced by any weighting or imputation techniques, indicating that some form of adjustment is necessary. Person-day level weights and MI show varying impacts across outcome variables, with MI offering a modest efficiency gain. We also performed a sensitivity analysis that employs an alternative definition of missingness, which yielded different MI estimates. This study offers valuable insights into addressing nonresponse errors in multi-day diary surveys and contributes to methodological approaches for conducting innovative weighting and imputation with complex data structures.",

          "authors": "Marcus L Nascimento, Kelly C M GonÇalves",
          "abstract": "This article presents a Bayesian multiple-output quantile regression for complex survey data under informative sampling. Our approach relies on the asymmetric Laplace distributional assumption. From the location-scale mixture representation of this distribution, we introduce an Expectation–Maximization algorithm that provides a less computationally intensive alternative to the commonly used Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. Our developments are mainly motivated by the joint analysis of growth indexes for Brazilian children under five.",

          "authors": "Vanessa McNealis, Christian Léger",
          "abstract": "This article introduces smoothed pseudo-population bootstrap methods for the purposes of mean-squared error estimation and for constructing confidence intervals for finite population quantiles. In an independent and identically distributed context, it has been shown that resampling from a smoothed estimate of the distribution function instead of the usual empirical distribution function can improve the convergence rate of the bootstrap mean-squared error estimator of a sample quantile. We extend the smoothed bootstrap to the survey sampling framework by implementing it in pseudo-population bootstrap methods for high entropy, single-stage survey designs, such as simple random sampling without replacement, Poisson sampling, and randomized systematic proportional-to-size sampling. Given a kernel function and a bandwidth, it consists of smoothing the pseudo-population from which bootstrap samples are drawn using the original sampling design. Given that the implementation of the proposed algorithms requires the specification of the bandwidth, we develop a plug-in selection method along with a grid search selection method based on a bootstrap estimate of the mean squared error. Simulation results suggest that the smoothed approach offers improved efficiency compared to the standard pseudo-population bootstrap for estimating the uncertainty of a quantile estimator, together with mixed results regarding confidence interval coverage.",

          "title": "Sexism as a Predictor of Political Attitudes and Voting Behavior: A Systematic Review",
          "authors": "Michał Gulczyński",
          "abstract": "The election of Donald Trump in 2016 inspired sudden interest in the association between voters’ sexism and voting behavior. Existing research shows that sexism may be a stronger predictor of political attitudes and voting behavior than a voter’s gender. To what extent do the findings from the US presidential elections apply to other contexts and research questions? To answer this question, we present a systematic review of studies focusing on sexism as a predictor of political attitudes and voting behavior. In two databases (Scopus and Web of Science), we identify 97 relevant studies, including 42 on the 2016 US presidential elections. The review shows that particularly modern and hostile sexism played a role in Trump’s election. However, few other research questions have been answered with similar certainty. Our review discovers gaps in the literature and proposes further directions for this growing research field. To enable future comparative research, we discuss best practices for measuring sexism and show the variety of ways in which sexism is operationalized.",

          "title": "From Social Proximity to Policy Preferences: Contact with Drug Market Participants and Citizens’ Attitudes Toward Drug Policy",
          "authors": "Daniel Zizumbo-Colunga, Pamela Ruiz Flores López",
          "abstract": "The negative externalities of the global “war on drugs”—including violence, militarization, mass incarceration, and human rights violations—have sparked an intense debate over drug prohibition and legalization. Public opinion, particularly in regions most affected by drug-related violence, plays a pivotal role in shaping policy decisions, as it can either reinforce the status quo or push policymakers toward reform. In this context, it remains unclear whether citizens’ proximity to drug market participants gives them a clearer understanding of the threats of drug trafficking and abuse, swaying them toward prohibitionist positions, or—as we argue—promotes perspective-taking and fosters greater support for legalization. Using previously underanalyzed data from 18 countries and three waves of the Latinobarómetro, we examine the effect of contact on citizens’ drug policy preferences in Latin America, one of the regions most affected by drug violence. To derive generalized inferences, we use pooled models with fixed effects. To address measurement and simultaneity concerns, we employ year-specific and lagged hierarchical linear models. Across all specifications, contact is consistently associated with greater support for drug legalization. Our findings challenge the notion that personal contact with drug market participants fosters prohibitive attitudes and alleviate fears that legalizing drugs—and thus increasing consumer and non-consumer contact—could trigger significant public backlash. This study contributes to intergroup contact theory by extending its application to the understudied domain of drug policy and offering new insights into how social and environmental factors shape public opinion.",

          "title": "Measuring Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys of Americans",
          "authors": "Joshua J Dyck, Jack Santucci",
          "abstract": "How should we measure “pure” or “true” independents? For years, the respective item required a respondent to volunteer that answer. Recent surveys have moved toward presenting it explicitly. Those that do produce estimates of pure independents that are much larger than in past surveys. We present evidence of this phenomenon across multiple surveys and ask: Are self-administered surveys overcounting independents, or are traditional live-interviewer surveys undercounting independents? We answer that question by comparing live-interview and self-administered samples from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies, by undertaking tests to rule out mode effects (including an experiment), and by seeing which question wording correlates more strongly with measures of latent ideology, vote choice, and ratings of the parties. Our findings suggest that surveys that include an explicit response option, allowing Americans to self-identify easily as “(pure) independent,” offer a more precise measurement of the concept of party identification. This has implications for the study of independents, as well as for discussions about polarization and party-system dealignment.",

          "title": "Filtering out the Opposition: How Cross-Cutting Discussions Increase Unfriending Through Political Corrections and Insults in Spain and Germany",
          "authors": "Manuel Goyanes, Beatriz Jordá",
          "abstract": "Social media platforms offer ample opportunities for dialogue between both sides of the political spectrum. However, prior research suggests that users sometimes unfriend dissenting voices. While some studies argue that unfriending may lead to homogeneous information environments and potentially to heightened polarization, others indicate that users unfriend to preserve a manageable level of diversity. This study contributes to this literature by examining how cross-cutting discussion is directly and indirectly associated to unfriending through two types of behaviors: being politically corrected, a positive interaction linked to democratic, civic dynamics; and being insulted, a hostile behavior and prominent aspect of online incivility. The findings, based on two cross-sectional surveys conducted in Spain and Germany, showed that cross-cutting discussion is associated to unfriending directly and indirectly through being politically corrected and being insulted for political reasons. We also found no statistically significant differences in the two indirect effects in both countries. Taken together, our findings emphasize that users actively shield themselves from opposing views regardless of whether interactions are deemed as constructive (corrections) or hostile (insults).",
