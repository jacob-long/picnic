          "authors": "Matthew J Clement, Matthew Karam",
          "abstract": "Nonresponse bias is a pervasive issue in surveys of people, affecting data quality across the social sciences. Such bias arises when the propensity to respond to a survey varies with the outcome variable, resulting in data that are missing not at random (MNAR). Repeated attempt models (RAMs) leverage information in nonresponses by survey subjects to estimate an outcome variable when data are MNAR. Here, we discuss parallels between RAMs and ecological occupancy models, which also use repeat surveys to account for imperfect detection of animal species during surveys. We describe a few likelihoods for RAMs, and we use simulations to evaluate the small sample performance of a RAM with a binary outcome. We also identify the optimal number of repeat surveys to complete, given different probabilities of response. Finally, we apply a RAM to surveys of deer hunters in Arizona, USA. Simulations indicated that RAMs generated unbiased estimates of a binary outcome for a variety of parameter values, but performance broke down when response probabilities or sample sizes were too low. We found that the optimal number of repeat surveys varied from about 4 to 20, depending on parameter values, but RAMs are likely inappropriate when data are missing at random. Our analysis of deer hunter data using a RAM produced plausible estimates of deer harvest. Relative to the RAM, a propensity model over-estimated deer harvest by 36–129 percent. A RAM could be extended to address unmodeled variation in response probabilities, inaccurate responses, and changes in outcome variables through time. We suggest that RAMs could be broadly useful for many natural resource and social science applications.",

          "authors": "Taewoo Kang, Kjerstin Thorson, Tai-Quan Peng, Dan Hiaeshutter-Rice, Sanguk Lee, Stuart Soroka",
          "abstract": "This study attempts to advance automated content analysis from consensus-oriented to coordination-oriented practices, thereby embracing diverse coding outputs and exploring the dynamics among differential perspectives. As an exploratory investigation, we evaluate six GPT-4o configurations to analyze sentiment in Fox News and MSNBC transcripts on Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign. By assessing each model’s alignment with partisan perspectives, we explore how partisan selective processing can be identified in LLM-Assisted Content Analysis (LACA). The findings indicate that LLM-based partisan perspective simulations reflect politically polarized standpoints across partisan groups, revealing a pronounced divergence in sentiment analysis between Democrat-aligned and Republican-aligned persona models. This pattern is evident in intercoder-reliability metrics, which are higher among same-partisan than cross-partisan persona model pairs. Results also suggest that LLM partisan simulations exhibit stronger ideological biases when analyzing politically congruent content. This approach enhances the nuanced understanding of LLM outputs and advances the integrity of AI-driven social science research and may also enable simulations of real-world implications.",

          "authors": "Daniel Karell, Matthew Shu, Thomas Davidson, Keitaro Okura",
          "abstract": "Many people now use AI chatbots to obtain summaries of complex topics, yet we know little about how this affects knowledge acquisition, including how the effects might vary across different groups of people. We conducted two experiments comparing how well people recalled factual information after reading AI-generated or human-written historical summaries. Participants who read AI-generated summaries scored significantly higher on knowledge tests than those who read expert-written blog posts (Study 1) or Wikipedia articles (Study 2). These improvements were present regardless of whether readers knew the content was AI-generated or if the AI summaries were politically biased. Moreover, AI summaries improved recall across various demographic groups, including gender, race, income, education, and digital literacy levels. This suggets that using AI tools for everyday factual queries does not create new knowledge inequalities but could still amplify existing ones through differential access. Our findings indicate that the increasingly routine use of AI for information-seeking could enhance factual learning, with implications for education policy and addressing inequality.",
