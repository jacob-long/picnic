          "title": "Bias Correction in Multiple Systems Estimation",
          "authors": "Daan B. Zult, Peter G. M. van der Heijden, Bart F. M. Bakker",
          "abstract": "If part of a population is hidden but two or more samples are available that each cover parts of this population, multiple systems estimation can be applied to estimate the size of this population. A problem is that these estimates suffer from finite-sample bias that can be substantial in case of a small sample or a small population size. This problem was recognized by Chapman, who derived his essentially unbiased Chapman-estimator for two samples. Because more than two samples may be required to correct for sample dependence, we propose a Generalized Chapman-estimator that can be applied with any number of samples. In a Monte Carlo experiment, this new estimator shows hardly any bias and has smaller standard errors than competing bias-reduced estimators. It is also compared to the usual maximum likelihood estimates for the case of estimating the number of homeless people in the Netherlands, where it shows notably different outcomes.",

          "title": "Comparison of Approaches for Variance Estimation with Application to a Survey on Discrimination",
          "authors": "María Guadarrama Sanz, Jean-Yves Bienvenue, Guillaume Chauvet",
          "abstract": "Usually, Statistical Institutes and Research Centers present the results of surveys in a “standardized” way, that is, the estimator of the parameter of interest and the associated measure of accuracy. This implies the calculation of the variance of the estimator, which is typically done in two possible ways: analytically or with replication methods. The analytic way requires the availability of the information of auxiliary variables used in the methodological plan of the survey, both at the sample level for the design variables, and at the respondent level for the variables involved in the treatment of non-response. Unfortunately, these variables are often not available in the final survey dataset, and the variance might therefore be miscalculated. Replication methods, which fully integrate the methodological plan applied into the survey, may be considered as good alternatives to this approach. This paper uses real data from the survey on “Racism and Ethno-racial Discrimination” carried out in Luxembourg in 2021, to compute and compare analytic variance estimators and bootstrap variance estimators. For this survey, both the linearization and the rescaled bootstrap lead to similar results, but the ultimate cluster variance estimator can be substantially biased. This suggests that the rescaled bootstrap may be a relevant approach.",

          "authors": "Soubhik Barari, Alexander Coppock, Matthew H Graham, Zoe Padgett",
          "abstract": "In the task of assessing how sudden, significant events causally affect public opinion, political pollsters often ask respondents how the event affected their attitudes and beliefs. We study the case of former President Donald Trump’s federal indictment for allegedly mishandling classified documents using two methods of retrospective causal inference. The commonly used change format asks respondents to state directly how the event affected their attitudes: Republicans say the event increased their support of Trump, while Democrats say the opposite. Like previous work, we argue that the change format exhibits a form of bias known as response substitution. The alternative counterfactual format is plausibly free of this source of error and asks respondents to imagine what their attitudes and beliefs would have been if the event had not happened. Using this method, Republican primary voters report that the indictment increased their belief that Trump mishandled documents (+2.5 pp) and decreased their intention to vote for him in the primaries (−1.6 pp). We argue that the counterfactual format is particularly valuable for studying the effects of highly salient news events like the Trump indictment on public opinion.",

          "title": "Anything but Politics: Connectedness in Networked Social Groups for Addressing Prejudice",
          "authors": "Brandon C. Bouchillon",
          "abstract": "Research indicates that prejudice has been growing in America. Citizens feel increasingly threatened by immigrants, and hate crimes against immigrant groups have risen. Declining interpersonal contact has also made it more difficult to address prejudice directly. This study examines whether nonpolitical social media groups can foster connections that reduce prejudice. These groups allow users to connect on the basis of shared interests, enabling diverse individuals to form close relationships which may improve attitudes toward immigrants. Using a national web survey matched to U.S. Census percentages for sex, race, ethnicity, age, and region of residence ( N = 1500), along with a two-wave panel conducted over six weeks ( N = 752), results indicate that blatant prejudice is more prevalent than subtle prejudice. Respondents were more likely to feel threatened by immigrants than to withhold positive emotions from them. As a remedy, social connectedness in nonpolitical groups was associated with diminished blatant prejudice and lower levels of global prejudice, a measure that includes both subtle and blatant components. Findings suggest that feeling connected with different people remotely can improve attitudes toward racial and ethnic diversity, helping individuals feel less threatened by immigrants and less prejudiced overall.",
