          "title": "The Direction and Meaning of Left-Right in Postcommunist Societies",
          "authors": "Ruth Dassonneville, Ian McAllister",
          "abstract": "Positioning on the left-right scale is often regarded as a heuristic that enables citizens to reduce the information costs involved in navigating the political world. Questions arise as to how citizens acquire it in former communist countries and what shapes their position on the left-right continuum. We address these questions using aggregate-level data from the 1990s to 2022 and survey data from 2002 to 2022. From the aggregate data, we find that citizens in postcommunist countries are consistently less likely than those in established democracies to adopt a left-right identification and this has not changed over time. From the survey data, we find no evidence that postcommunist citizens are coming to use left-right—socially, attitudinally, or via partisanship—in the same way as their counterparts in the established democracies.",

          "title": "The Impact of Increased Learning Opportunities on Political Knowledge: Evidence From Repeated Cross-Sectional Surveys in Finland in 2008 and 2020",
          "authors": "Lauri Rapeli",
          "abstract": "In the last 15 years, opportunities for political learning have increased in a way that lacks comparison in recent history. Technological advances have made political content constantly accessible online to most people in Western societies. What effect has this had on political knowledge? This study uses a repeated cross-sectional survey design from Finland, with surveys from 2008 (n = 1,020) and 2020 (n = 1,097). This interval captures the most intense growth period in online news content. By using the same sampling procedures to ensure similar representation of the Finnish adult population at the 2 time points, interviewing methods, and survey, the 2 surveys provide a rare opportunity to compare knowledge scores measured in face-to-face interviews while ensuring that the findings are not driven by methodological choices. The findings show a small increase in knowledge between 2008 and 2020. Young, low-educated and low-income respondents demonstrate relatively higher knowledge in 2020 compared with 2008, suggesting that increased political learning opportunities have contributed to a slight equalization between high-and low-knowledge groups. Political interest has become a stronger predictor of knowledge. Overall, the results offer a more encouraging interpretation of the development of political knowledge among democratic publics than many recent studies.",
