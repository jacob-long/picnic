          "authors": "Christian Pieter Hoffmann, Daniel Bendahan Bitton, Alexander Godulla",
          "abstract": "Previous research has highlighted that encounters with deepfakes induce uncertainty, skepticism, and mistrust among audiences. In this study, we relate perceived deepfake exposure to media cynicism. Deepfakes shake users’ sense of reality, increasing a need to rely on epistemic authorities, such as journalistic media, while raising fears of manipulation. Based on uncertainty management theory, we propose that two “epistemic virtues” moderate the relationship between deepfake exposure and media cynicism: self-efficacy and intellectual humility. In a survey of 1421 German internet users, we find that perceived deepfake exposure positively relates to media cynicism. Intellectual humility does not dampen this relationship. Deepfake detection self-efficacy may be more harmful than helpful in preventing media cynicism. We discuss these findings in the context of research indicating that users tend to overestimate their ability to detect deepfakes and the challenges the novel deepfake technology poses to audience trust in a digital information ecosystem.",

          "authors": "Xintong Yao, Yipeng Xi",
          "abstract": "This study examined the impact of anthropomorphic traits in large language model (LLM) chatbots on users’ perceptions of humanness and their associated anxiety. Drawing on dehumanization theory, the research investigated how human nature and human uniqueness traits influenced AI-related anxiety through perceptions of humanness in various interaction contexts. A survey of 1000 LLM chatbot users in China, analyzed using validated structural equation modeling, revealed that emotional and moral traits, such as empathy and morality, were positively correlated with perceptions of humanness, which in turn reduced AI anxiety. In contrast, cognitive traits like competence and rationality alleviated anxiety but did not contribute to perceptions of humanness. This study offered valuable theoretical and practical insights into how humans defined and responded to machine personhood in the age of advanced AI.",
