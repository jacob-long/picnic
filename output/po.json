          "abstract": "Digital media constitute a key space for the negotiation of public opinion. Despite long-standing research on public opinion climates on digital media, little theory exists that considers their emergence and discursive dynamics. In this article, we conceptualize public opinion negotiations in a digital media ecosystem as a discursive process aimed at delimiting the latitude of normatively acceptable opinions. Building upon theoretical work on predigital media, we distill five enduring aspects to characterize digitally mediated public opinion negotiations as (a) the public expression of (b) normative opinions upon public issues by (c) positioned speakers, resulting in (d) the public negotiation of acceptable stances (e) within digitally mediated public arenas governed by institutional and sociotechnical media logics. Discussing how digital media shape this discursive process, we propose a theory of public opinion negotiations in a digital media ecosystem, flagging operational implications for the empirical study of public opinion processes on digital media.",

          "authors": "Eyal Rubinson, Gal Bitton-Alayof",
          "abstract": "Do electoral outcomes influence public support for the winning candidate's policy agenda? While voters are often assumed to evaluate candidates based on policy alignment, research suggests that partisan identity frequently overrides rational assessment. However, the extent to which the identity of the electoral winner legitimizes policy positions—particularly in the domain of foreign policy—remains underexplored. This research note leverages the 2024 U.S. presidential election as a natural experiment, using a preregistered two-wave panel survey to assess whether electoral victory influences public perceptions of the winning candidate's platform. Results reveal a moderate “winner effect”: Democratic voters exhibited an increase in support for Trump's foreign policy positions postelection, while support for Harris declined, even among her base. Nevertheless, winner effects produced shifts in foreign policy preferences commensurate with those on a highly salient domestic issue, challenging assumptions about greater volatility in foreign policy. Furthermore, preelection candidate support conditioned postelection stability, with winning-party supporters maintaining greater consistency. While electoral victories enhance the perceived legitimacy of the winner's platform, partisan identity remains the primary constraint, limiting large-scale ideological realignment.",

          "title": "Support for Technocratic and Authoritarian Governance in Times of Crisis: The Role of Trust and COVID-19 Concerns",
          "authors": "Silvia Russo, Fanny Lalot, Michele Roccato",
          "abstract": "There is a dearth of research into the combined effect of political trust and societal concern on preferences for different models of governance. Using a quota sample of the Italian adult population surveyed in October 2021 (N = 1,151), we conducted two moderated regressions to predict the support for technocratic and authoritarian governance as a function of trust in epistemic and nonpartisan institutions, health and economic concerns, and their interactions. Consistent with a distrustful complacency hypothesis, which predicts an interactive effect of trust and concern, support for technocratic governance was the lowest among participants who had low trust in epistemic institutions and were not concerned about the health consequences of COVID-19. In addition, support for authoritarian governance was the lowest among those who had high trust in nonpartisan institutions and were not concerned about the economic consequences of COVID-19. This study therefore expands the distrustful complacency hypothesis, applying it for the first time to governance preferences and thus adding to the literature on trust in institutions. We discuss limitations, strengths, and possible developments.",

          "authors": "Santiago Gómez-Echeverry, Arnout Van Delden, Ton De Waal, Dimitris Pavlopoulos, Reinoud Stoel",
          "abstract": "The increasing reliance on non-probability samples, including administrative data, big data, and surveys with selective non-response, has brought the issue of selection bias to the forefront of applied research and official statistics production. This study investigates selection bias in the context of flash estimates, focusing on their application in short-term economic indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product and the Consumer Price Index. Leveraging prominent theoretical frameworks for modeling selection bias, we develop and evaluate a series of estimators that incorporate information from a fully-observed lagged target variable, current auxiliary variables, or combined data sources. Through simulations and a case study using turnover (i.e., revenue) data from Statistics Netherlands, we assess these estimators across diverse scenarios, including variations in variable distribution, selectivity levels, and correlations between auxiliary and target variables. Results indicate that estimators combining lagged and current auxiliary information provide more consistent results than those relying on a single data source. Additionally, estimators based on combined data sources perform relatively well under high selectivity and non-normal target distributions. These findings provide practical and easily implementable tools to address selection bias in non-probability samples, enhancing the reliability and timeliness of official statistics.",

          "authors": "Jun Zhang, Li Chen, Dongqing Xu",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the role of social media influencers (SMIs) in shaping public perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. It specifically examines how perceptions of CSR normative legitimacy interact with SMI credibility to influence public support for CSR efforts through public-serving motives and positive moral emotions. An online survey of 491 U.S. participants measured the impact of CSR normative legitimacy on public-serving motives and positive moral emotions, which subsequently influence CSR-supportive behaviors. SMI credibility, assessed through trustworthiness, attractiveness, and expertise, was examined as a potential moderator in this relationship. The results show that CSR normative legitimacy significantly enhances public-serving motives and positive moral emotions, leading to greater public support for CSR initiatives. SMI credibility, particularly trustworthiness and attractiveness, moderates this relationship, amplifying the positive effects of CSR normative legitimacy.",
