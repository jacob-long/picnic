          "authors": "Taesim Kim",
          "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, it has been argued that the pandemic has negative aspects related not only to public health but also to democracy. While various crises have been shown to undermine citizens’ attitudes toward democracy, the pandemic, characterized by viral risk, likely showed distinct patterns in democratic attitudes compared to previous crises. In this study, I argue that the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative aspects for democracy were not evident in citizens’ satisfaction with democracy but were more significantly evident in their attitudes toward democratic norms and principles. Data collected in South Korea between 2020 and 2024 show that, while citizens’ perceptions of viral risk are not significantly associated with their satisfaction with democracy, positive evaluations of the government’s capacity in handling COVID-19 are tied to an increase in satisfaction. However, higher perceived viral risk levels and greater government capacity evaluations are associated with stronger support for stringent policy measures that violate democratic norms and principles. Finally, the reduction in perceived viral risk does not correlate with changes in attitudes toward stringent policy measures. Therefore, the pandemic’s negative implications for attitudes toward democratic norms and principles have the potential to linger long-term in post-pandemic politics.",

          "abstract": "Understanding and modeling mortality patterns, especially differences in mortality rates between populations, is vital for demographic analysis and public health planning. We compare three statistical models within the age-period framework to examine differences in death counts. The models are based on the double Poisson, bivariate Poisson, and Skellam distributions, each of which provides unique strengths in capturing underlying mortality trends. Focusing on mortality data from 1960 to 2015, we analyze the two leading causes of death in Italy, which exhibit significant temporal and age-related variations. Our results reveal that the Skellam distribution offers superior accuracy and simplicity in capturing mortality differentials. These findings highlight the potential of the Skellam distribution for analyzing mortality gaps effectively.",

          "authors": "Rafael C. Alvarado",
          "abstract": "This essay introduces and develops the concept of imitative intelligence implied by Turing’s foundational work on machine intelligence and connects it to the current generation AI agents based on large language models. Based on a close reading of Turing’s writings on machine intelligence, from the 1938 paper on the entscheidungsproblem to the 1950 paper on the imitation game, the Turing test is found to be more than an operational convenience; it reflects an implicit theory of the imitative and social nature of intelligence that informs his entire project of intelligent machine design. Moreover, the proported shortcomings of the Turing test—its reliance on language and emphasis on culture—turn out to be foundational to the success of LLM-based AI agents today. It is suggested that the design and regulation these agents is usefully framed by the perspective of the concept of imitative intelligence is inherited by them.",

          "authors": "Annie Waldherr, Nicola Righetti, Ryan J. Gallagher, Kira Klinger, Daniela Stoltenberg, Sagar Kumar, Dominic Ridley, Brooke Foucault Welles",
          "abstract": "The deaths of Black victims of police brutality, such as George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Sandra Bland, and Philando Castile, have become focusing events and symbols for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, catalyzing wide-spread public attention to racial injustice. While prior studies on hashtag activism predominantly focus on single and widely known cases, less is understood about why some incidents draw massive public attention while others do not. Addressing this gap, our study investigates the factors influencing the likelihood and size of public attention on Twitter (now X) following extrajudicial police killings. We analyzed 1.5 million tweets in response to 795 police killings between January 1, 2015, and December 8, 2016, in the United States. By examining cases on all scales, from unnoticed to prominent, we provide large-scale empirical evidence on disparities in public attention to police killings and their victims. Results indicate two distinct processes in the emergence of focusing events: While victims’ attributes such as race, age, and gender increased likelihood of receiving any attention (thresholding), variables of context and social construction were related to overall wave size (focusing).",

          "abstract": "Absences are inescapable in data. Data collection always focuses on some elements while occluding others. Yet, how absences are considered and recorded within data infrastructures markedly transforms the inferences that can be made. Tracing a genealogy from early databases to contemporary AI datasets, this paper explores how data infrastructures have grappled with the inherent incompleteness of data. Specifically, I uncover a tension between a desire for certainty and acknowledging partiality at the foundation of data science that continues to pervade contemporary AI datasets. Drawing on archival studies and sociological perspectives, I argue that data science must embrace uncertainty by recognizing the “ghosts in the data”—the uncounted, the unrepresented, and the silenced—and how their absence shapes the outcomes of automated systems.",

          "title": "Unblackboxing How Sociotemporalities Inform AI Accountability: The Case of Targeted Advertising",
          "authors": "Faranak Hardcastle, Kathryn Henne, Jenna Imad Harb, Ashlin Lee, John Noel Viana, Susan Halford",
          "abstract": "In recent years, numerous accountability interventions have been introduced to address the harms and inequalities associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Early efforts concentrated on transparency and explainability, often operationalized as technical fixes intended to “open the black box” and render algorithmic processes more intelligible. However, sociological research has revealed the limitations of these interventions, particularly their narrow focus on the technical and operational dimensions of AI. In response, sociologists have broadened the scope of “unblackboxing” to include the sociomaterialities of AI, or the social, political, and environmental relations that both shape and are shaped by AI technologies and their infrastructures. This article extends this agenda by focusing on sociotemporalities: the narratives and structures of time that shape both AI systems and the interventions meant to improve their accountability. We re-analyze interviews from a retrospective study of transparency in targeted advertising, a domain long associated with concerns about privacy, discrimination and opaque practices. Drawing on the sociology of time, and especially the sociology of the future, we examine the sociotemporalities that actively shaped the development of targeted advertising technologies at the time and influenced key informants’ thinking about approaches to improve accountability. Our analysis suggests that sociotemporalities exerted a structuring influence on how “appropriate” accountability interventions were imagined and enacted, ultimately shaping the emergent present of targeted advertising. We discuss the application of such an approach in the context of emerging AI technologies and AI accountability interventions. We conclude by arguing that expanding unblackboxing to include sociotemporal as well as sociomaterial dimensions can help open new pathways for designing and implementing more practical, effective, and context-specific AI accountability interventions.",

          "authors": "Taberez Ahmed Neyazi, Tan Khai Ee, Ozan Kuru",
          "abstract": "Does exposure to news about out-party campaigns’ increasing use of deepfakes further increase polarization among partisans, and how does this impact vary among different evaluations of political coalitions, parties, and leaders? What role does approval for candidates’ usage of AI play as a moderator in this relationship? This paper examines these questions using data from a survey experiment ( N = 1627), in which each respondent exposed to a news story that varied in their coverage of the growing deployment of AI-powered deepfakes during the 2024 India’s national election campaigns. The findings indicate that exposure to news about out-party campaigns’ use of deepfakes did not polarize attitudes towards coalitions, parties, and leaders. In contrast, approval for candidates’ use of AI was negatively associated with polarization towards coalitions, parties, and leaders, but this did not moderate the experimental effects: respondents who approved of candidates’ AI usage and saw a news article about out-party use of deepfakes were not more polarized toward either coalitions, parties or leaders. This study not only extends the understanding of AI’s role in campaigns by examining its complex effects on affective polarization, but it also broadens empirical research into the impact of deepfakes by focusing on the non-Western context of India, thereby offering new theoretical insights into how technological advancements intersect with political behaviors and attitudes.",
