          "authors": "Stephen Jessee, Neil Malhotra, Maya Sen",
          "abstract": "As political issues have increased in complexity, public opinion researchers increasingly ask respondents about sophisticated political topics that may require substantive knowledge and analytic skills, raising concerns about survey satisficing. In this note, we examine the correlates of one manifestation of this kind of satisficing—response order effects, or when respondents are more likely to pick the top response options from a list. We do this by analyzing randomized response order experiments embedded in surveys conducted across three years, where 6,291 respondents provided their opinion on 40 complex issues before the Supreme Court. We find an overall response order effect of 2.8 percentage points with substantial heterogeneity related to both question length and respondent knowledge. These factors also interact with one another; among the most sensitive subpopulation—low-knowledge respondents answering long questions—the predicted response order effect was 17.4 percentage points. On the other hand, question complexity and respondent education did not moderate response order effects. Our practical advice for researchers asking about complex issues is that they should focus on being brief, rather than using extra words to make the language simpler.",

          "authors": "Mridha Md. Shiblee Noman, Md. Sayeed Al-Zaman",
          "abstract": "The intersection of politics and religion in India has gained significant scholarly attention, particularly since the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) rise to power in 2014. The increasing impact of social media on Indian politics has intensified this concern. However, it is yet to be fully explored how social media was used for religiopolitical purposes during the Indian election in 2024. We computationally analyzed 3082 Facebook posts using BERTopic, word embedding, and cluster analysis to understand how politicians, political candidates, political organizations, and political parties intertwined religion and politics during the 2024 Lok Sabha election. We identified the presence of religiopolitical propaganda, primarily aimed at reviving and recreating Hindu nationalist history and targeting religious minorities, mainly Muslims. The major topics of the posts included ideological legacy, political landscape, party and leadership, celebrations, crime and justice, local politics and governance, politicized demographic trends, public engagements, spiritual and philosophical themes, and the misrepresented reservation issue. The interconnectedness of these issues suggests that the BJP and its allies concentrated on religious matters, from Hindu–Muslim debates to reservations for Muslims and the inauguration of Hindu temples. Data from non-political entities, such as influencers, as well as cross-platform analysis from Twitter and YouTube, can extend and enrich these insights.",

          "title": "AI Chatbots in Political Campaigns: A Practical Experience in the EU’s 2024 Parliament Elections",
          "authors": "Davide Tosi, Marco Chiappa, Dario Pizzul",
          "abstract": "As the application of artificial intelligence in various domains and sectors grows, politics—especially political communication—is no exception. However, academic considerations on the topic remain limited, partly due to its novelty. To contribute to the ongoing discussions at the intersection of AI and political campaigns, this research report presents the development and use of an AI chatbot employed by an Italian candidate during the 2024 European Parliament elections. The aim of this work is to engage with the technical aspects of the tool’s development and implementation by outlining the challenges and strategies involved in creating an AI chatbot that supports a political campaign using OpenAI APIs. Furthermore, this report offers reflections on the role of AI in politics and communication, focusing on the concepts of intermediation and participation, also addressing issues of compliance and trustworthiness of these new AI tools.",
