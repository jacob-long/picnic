          "authors": "Joshua Claassen, Jan Karem HÖhne, Jessica Kuhlmann",
          "abstract": "Web surveys frequently include so-called “final comment questions” (FCQs) to provide respondents the opportunity to express their experiences with the survey in general and its questions in particular. A comprehensive analysis of FCQs to enhance survey and question design is often impeded by high item nonresponse and low answer quality in the form of short and uninterpretable answers. In this article, we therefore investigate what respondent and FCQ characteristics influence the provision and quality of answers to FCQs. For this purpose, we conducted two web survey studies in two German online panels. The first study (N = 874) experimentally varied the visual design of the FCQ (“one multi-line answer box” vs. “ten single-line answer boxes”). The second study (N = 1,001) experimentally varied the answer format of the FCQ (“request for a text answer” vs. “request for a voice answer”). The results reveal that answer provision is influenced by respondent characteristics (e.g. age and survey interest), while answer quality is mostly influenced by FCQ characteristics (e.g. request for a voice answer). Overall, this article provides both survey researchers and practitioners with empirically informed FCQ design recommendations to improve the quality of future web surveys.",

          "title": "No Introduction Necessary: Face-Saving Answer Options Outperform Preambles in Reducing Social Desirability Bias",
          "authors": "Emma Zaal, John Hoeks, Yfke Ongena",
          "abstract": "Social Desirability Bias (SDB), providing a favorable image of oneself in self-reports, is a persistent problem in survey research on sensitive topics. However, face-saving approaches appear promising in discouraging SDB. Specifically, face-saving survey item formulations aim to reduce the threat of judgment for norm-violations, thereby fostering a safer context for self-disclosure. This experimental study examined the use of face-saving to elicit more truthful responses to yes/no questions using a quota sample representative of the Dutch population. We included face-saving preambles that excused for or normalized sensitive behaviors (e.g., “It can easily happen that the limit for legal driving is exceeded when consuming alcohol”). We also included face-saving response options using degrees of truth (“occasionally”) or justifications for norm transgressions (e.g., “only when there was no other option”). There were three objectives. First, the design included a replication of a face-saving study regarding COVID-19, where we assessed the efficacy of a condition that combined a face-saving preamble with face-saving answer options (N = 303) against a control condition without any face-saving elements (N = 284). Second, we extended the replication’s design by including conditions to measure the effects of offering face-saving preambles (N = 281) and offering face-saving answer options in isolation (N = 283). Third, we investigated the effectiveness of face-saving using novel operationalizations on additional topics, including sustainability and responsible driving. The replication confirmed the effectiveness of the combined face-saving strategy. The extension that included all conditions (Ntotal = 1,151) revealed that offering face-saving answer options reduced SDB significantly, up to 23 percent. There was no main effect of including a preamble, nor was there an interaction effect of the two manipulations. These findings highlight the critical role that face-saving response options might play in improving the accuracy of self-reported data, while calling into question the usefulness of including face-saving preambles.",

          "abstract": "Existing scholarship suggests that Americans generally support progressive redistribution. However, whether ideological differences exist in views on the progressivity of social programs’ policy designs remains ambiguous. Using a conjoint experiment, I investigate how the progressivity of social programs’ distributional outcomes and tax sources impacts Americans’ social policy support. I find differences and similarities in the effects of progressive social policy designs on different ideological subgroups. Compared to conservatives, liberals are more supportive of social programs having progressive distributional results or tax sources and less supportive of social policies featuring regressive distributional consequences or tax sources. However, both liberals and conservatives prefer progressive social programs over those with regressive designs. This study helps explain the public’s preferences for social policies with progressive designs.",

          "authors": "Ian G Anson, Carolyn Forestiere",
          "abstract": "The rise of the “religious nones” has garnered significant interest among journalists and scholars. Whereas very few people reported that they were not affiliated with an established religious tradition just 20 years ago, currently as many as 30 percent of Americans claim no religion when asked their religious preference on public opinion surveys. This seismic shift in the religious composition of the country precipitates important questions about the attitudes, group identity, and political participation of religious nones in response to contemporary issues. In this paper, we present the results of a novel survey experiment (N = 1,013) designed to determine if issue and identity cues increase religious nones’ sense of group identification, group consciousness, linked fate, and willingness to engage in political behavior. We leverage a unique large-scale sample of nonreligious Americans to facilitate these tests. Our results suggest that relevant political messaging does little to activate collective identification or political engagement among the nonreligious. Our findings have important implications for the future of American politics, even as the number of religiously unaffiliated people continues to grow.",

          "authors": "Nicholas Pangakis",
          "abstract": "Politicians and media outlets often emphasize a distinction between migrants fleeing their home country for reasons linked to violence and migrants leaving to pursue economic opportunity. Americans are expected to be less welcoming towards immigrants who are perceived to be seeking economic opportunity relative to immigrants escaping violence. Using a national survey experiment, I test the hypothesis that violence and economic threats equally increase support for immigration when migrants face risks that force them to leave their home country. When harsh economic conditions are made clear, I find that Americans are more open to accepting immigrants fleeing economic deprivation than previously anticipated. While my results show that Americans are willing to prioritize immigrants facing poverty, I find minimal evidence that these favorable attitudes extend toward other protective immigration policies.",

          "authors": "Wanli Liu, Xuequn Wang, Yibai Li",
          "abstract": "With generative artificial intelligence’s (GenAI) growing popularity, individuals are increasingly using it when searching for election-related information. This scenario raises concerns that GenAI usage may result in widespread dissemination of misinformation, given its ability to generate seemingly authentic information. Nevertheless, despite the importance of Gen AI, few researchers have examined how individuals use this tool to search for election-related information. This study aims to assess how GenAI’s perceived system (i.e., accessibility and integration) and information quality (i.e., completeness, accuracy, and neutrality) impact its usage. Focusing on the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we conducted a two-wave survey and data was collected from 364 Americans. Participants were found to have a favorable attitude overall toward GenAI. Further, accuracy and neutrality were positively associated with GenAI usage. A fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis was also conducted to identify different configurations of perceived system and information quality that led to high GenAI usage. Analyzing the qualitative responses further confirmed the results. This study contributes to the literature on the role of GenAI during elections, providing a nuanced understanding of how dimensions of GenAI’s perceived system and information quality impact individuals’ GenAI usage. The findings have significant practical implications for dealing with the (mis)information generated by GenAI.",
