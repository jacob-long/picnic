          "title": "How Does Noise Protection Affect the Accuracy of Life Expectancy and Other Demographic Indicators?",
          "authors": "Fabian Bach",
          "abstract": "New and efficient methods based on noise addition to protect the confidentiality in population statistics have been developed, tested, and applied in census production by various members of the European Statistical System over the past years. Basic demographic statistics—such as population stocks, live births and deaths by age, sex, and region—may be protected in a similar way, but also form the raw input to calculate various demographic indicators. This paper analyzes the impact on the accuracy of some selected indicators, namely fertility and mortality rates and life expectancies, under the assumption that the raw input counts are protected with a generic noise method with fixed variance parameter, by comparing the size of noise uncertainties with intrinsic statistical uncertainties using a Poisson model. As a by-product, we derive and validate numerically a closed analytical expression for the variance of life expectancies in a certain class of calculation models as a function of the variance of input mortality data. This expression also allows to calculate analytically the statistical uncertainty of life expectancies using the mentioned Poisson model for the input death counts.",

          "title": "Toward a Principled Workflow for Prevalence Mapping Using Household Survey Data",
          "authors": "Qianyu Dong, Yunhan Wu, Zehang Richard Li, Jon Wakefield",
          "abstract": "Understanding the prevalence of key demographic and health indicators in small geographic areas and domains is of global interest, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where vital registration data is sparse and household surveys are the primary source of information. Recent advances in computation and the increasing availability of spatially detailed datasets have led to much progress in sophisticated statistical modeling of prevalence. As a result, high-resolution prevalence maps for many indicators are routinely produced in the literature. However, statistical and practical guidance for producing prevalence maps in LMICs has been largely lacking. In particular, advice in choosing and evaluating models and interpreting results is needed, especially when data is limited. Software and analysis tools are also usually inaccessible to researchers in low-resource settings to conduct their own analysis or reproduce findings in the literature. In this paper, we propose a general workflow for prevalence mapping using household survey data. We consider all stages of the analysis pipeline, with particular emphasis on model choice and interpretation. We illustrate the proposed workflow using a case study mapping the proportion of pregnant women who had at least four antenatal care visits in Kenya. The workflow is implemented using the R package surveyPrev, and all reproducible code is provided in the Supplementary Materials. It can be readily extended to a wide range of indicators.",

          "title": "States of Abortion Talk: Social Media Responses to Threats and Opportunities Post-Dobbs",
          "authors": "Nafisa Nowshin, Kelsy Kretschmer, Glencora Borradaile",
          "abstract": "The Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022 reversed 50 years of precedent by allowing states to formulate their own abortion policies. This resetting of abortion policy created a new raft of opportunities and threats across the states for both pro-life and pro-choice supporters. In this study, we aim to analyze how public discourse around abortion responded to this changed political context. Using a dataset of 288,325 abortion-related Tweets posted in 2022, we examine public reaction to Dobbs using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. We categorize Tweets by abortion stance (pro-choice and pro-life ) and geo-political context by state groups ( protected, restricted, and unsettled based on abortion access policy). Our temporal analysis shows that while both pro-choice and pro-life Twitter activity spiked after both the leaked draft in May 2022 and the final decision, only pro-choice discussions maintained a heightened level of engagement over time. Analyzing the discussion frames among the Tweets reveals that pro-choice users emphasized a wider range of arguments that varied by state context, while pro-life Tweets were generally unresponsive to state context. Our findings indicate that the new threats and opportunities had uneven effects within pro-life and pro-choice public discourse.",

          "title": "New Media, Meme Culture and Political Satire: The Role of Performative Art in Political Activism in Kenya",
          "authors": "Paul Muya, Tabitha Onyinge",
          "abstract": "This study examines the impact of performatives and evolving social media typology in shaping political activism among Kenya’s Generation Z (Gen Z) movement during the 2024 anti-tax law protests. The study addresses the questions of the role of performatives and how social media has revolutionised their production, reproduction, and consumption in political activism in Kenya. Based on qualitative content analysis and critical discourse analysis, the study employed purposive sampling of a collection of digital artefacts, including memes, protest songs, TikTok videos, graffiti-inspired art, and Twitter threads, which were drawn from the #RejectFinanceBill2024 campaign. Analytical categories were derived from literature on performative activism, postcolonial media theory, and digital political communication. The findings suggest that Kenya’s Gen Z activists adopted a highly performative mode of social media resistance, blending entertainment with activism. The content of performatives was found to function not only as expressive tools but also as mechanisms for mobilising support, challenging state narratives, and asserting digital visibility. Social media was found to circumvent traditional media gatekeeping, amplifying the voices of the marginalised, and fostering an enlightened political culture. The study identifies a cyclic loop of production and reproduction of performatives, reinforcing African people’s communal identity formation and resistance posturing. Findings highlight how Gen Z’s social media use is reshaping civic engagement in the postcolonial public sphere. The study advances theoretical understanding of how visual and performative content is democratising political discourse, disrupting power hierarchies, and deepening participatory governance in the Global South. This study contributes to the body of literature on digital media and political communication by illuminating the intersection of social movement, culture, aesthetics, and performativities in resistance. These insights are particularly relevant for scholars and practitioners interested in digital media use, activism, political communication, and youth-led social movements.",

          "authors": "Conor Gaughan, Alexandru Cernat, Rachel Gibson, Marta Cantijoch, Riza Batista-Navarro",
          "abstract": "Survey research is entering a new era which centres on its linkage with other forms of digitally generated data such as social media. Many suggest that this can help to address existing weaknesses in self-report surveys such as non-response and measurement bias. However, to link a participant’s survey responses to their social media data, consent from the participant is required. Previous studies have shown that consent to linkage is typically low and selective. This paper expands on the existing literature by comparing Twitter (now X) usage and consent to survey linkage across five national contexts. Testing the effects of several sociodemographic and attitudinal predictors in the US, the UK, France, Germany and Poland, our study finds that overall consent rates vary significantly by age, political attention, privacy concern, trust in social media companies and frequency of political posting on Twitter/X. However, our results also confirm that variable effects differ significantly between nations, suggesting a moderating cultural influence. Within-country variation in the US between 2020 and 2024 is also present, indicating that effects are not necessarily fixed over time. These findings dictate the need for caution when conducting substantive comparisons across countries and time when using social media data.",
