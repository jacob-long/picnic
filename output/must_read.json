    "authors": "Shin Haeng Lee, Daseul Oh",
    "abstract": "YouTube’s multilayered ecology enables K-pop virality to evolve from grassroots remix to corporate-driven promotion; however, how the meso-level interplay between gatekeepers and memes shapes user engagement remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we applied an integrated media consumption/choice theoretical approach and a rhizome perspective to commenter-overlap networks for four COVID-era hits— Rollin’ , After LIKE , Attention , and Event Horizon. We then estimated exponential random graph models to contrast top-down promotion with bottom-up sharing. Three key findings emerged. First, mid-tier channels act as decisive brokers. Situated between entertainment mega-channels and grassroots creators, they fuse otherwise disconnected subnetworks, a capacity that scales with event magnitude and drives mass virality. Second, meme genres foster engagement, but do so homophilously: commenter overlaps concentrate within the same meme type, confirming that memes are catalysts of participatory rather than top-down, diffusion. Third, traffic is asymmetrical: links probabilities rise when users move from memes to mid-tier channels, but not vice versa, indicating that meme communities pull attention inward rather than gatekeepers pushing it outward. The results show that K-pop visibility is continuously negotiated between platform-level concentration anchored by elite hubs and rhizomatic diversification orchestrated by meme-driven mid-tier actors. By refining political-economy accounts of algorithmic dominance, the study offers empirical evidence for policy aimed at safeguarding cultural diversity within platform-dominated music industries.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the applicability of regularized regression in family science by focusing on fathers’ psychological well-being as an applied example. Using cross-sectional survey data from 277 U.S. fathers, we compared Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with Ridge, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and Elastic Net in regularized regression to evaluate how diverse familial factors—including father involvement, father role identity, parenting competency, parent–child relationships, coparenting relationships, and work–family conflict—concurrently predict fathers’ well-being. Results indicated that while the three regularized approaches produced similar overall performance, they provided advantages over OLS by reducing overfitting, improving generalizability, and enhancing interpretability. We also compared the analysis results of the three approaches in terms of the prediction accuracy and interpretability. The findings reveal how regularized regression can highlight key factors, such as father involvement, coparenting, and parenting competency. This study also illustrates how regularized regression complements traditional regression in family science by addressing multicollinearity, reducing overfitting, and supporting feature selection. These results highlight the potential of computational approaches such as machine learning to strengthen both theory and practice in family research.",

    "authors": "Ta’Les Love, Sonya Dal Cin, Apryl Williams",
    "abstract": "Skin tone discrimination—or colorism—is an additional marginalization barrier that People of Color must navigate. Black women, especially those with darker complexions, are often discursively constructed as the antithesis to Western beauty standards—standards that commonly prioritize White femininity as the beauty benchmark. Studies on the beauty influencer economy reveal that Black women remain at a disadvantage in the beauty hierarchy. This study uses a survey experiment to explore how skin tone impacts perceptions of attractiveness and competence among viewers of digital beauty content. Surveying African Americans ( N = 576), primarily Black Women ( n = 524), we found that beauty influencers with darker skin tones are rated as less attractive and less competent. Participants also revealed that they would be less likely to click on the videos of darker skinned beauty influencers in comparison to influencers with lighter brown and medium brown skin tones. These results suggest that, among Black women viewers, preferences for beauty content is skin tone dependent. Because view counts are a significant metric in influencer marketability, viewing disparities along the lines of skin tone have the potential to widen the gap among Black influencers, creating disproportionate opportunities for success within an already marginalized population.",

Analyses involve a thousand original hateful posts and the subsequent posts by the same posters ( N = 1,227,756 posts) on Gab—a platform particularly hospitable to hate messaging—and Likes, Dislikes, and written replies from other users that affirmed or negated the initial hate posts. Likes and affirming replies were commonplace, whereas Dislikes and negation replies were rare. Getting Likes and affirming replies decreased subsequent toxicity in the short term, as did getting no responses whatsoever. Getting Dislikes increased the hatefulness of users’ next original post and their posts over the next 3 months. Results challenge both the social approval theory of online hate and the need-threat approach to effects of responses to social media hate posting.",

    "abstract": "Although AI-driven fact-checking has been extensively applied on social media, it is unclear whether presenting AI rather than humans (e.g. social media platform administrators) as a fact-checker will affect people’s credibility perceptions of misinformation. Furthermore, most studies on machine heuristics have mainly focused on the positive machine heuristic and neglected the negative machine heuristic. In this study, a between-subjects online experiment was conducted to address these gaps in knowledge. The results show that presenting AI rather than platform administrators as fact-checkers indirectly led participants to perceive false short-form health videos as more credible via the mediation of the negative machine heuristic rather than the positive machine heuristic. In addition, among participants who initially held a stronger belief in misinformation, the fact-checking provided by AI (vs administrator) generated even more negative machine heuristic, which further led them to perceive the false videos as more credible.",

    "authors": "Ryan McGrady",
    "abstract": "This study examines two decades of user blocking on the English Wikipedia to understand how a volunteer-run, non-profit platform has adapted its content moderation practices in response to increasing visibility amid declining participation. Analyzing more than 20 million block log entries from 2004 to 2024, the study identifies shifts in block frequency, duration, and stated rationales. A significant increase in preemptive, automated blocking of open proxies since 2020 accounts for most block activity, but excluding these reveals a broader trend toward longer blocks and vaguer rationales such as “disruption.” These patterns suggest that volunteers are scaling labor through automation and normative adjustment, trading openness for efficiency and stability. Wikipedia’s blocking trends help to contextualize governance pressures on volunteer-run knowledge platforms.",

By contrast, we find more positive responses for solution-focused frames, but lower levels of engagement.

Using network psychometrics on responses from 71,922 individuals in 68 countries, we model trust as an interconnected community system of attitudes and beliefs. Sincerity emerges as the most central node, linking perceptions of competence, integrity, and goodwill. This dynamic structure challenges reflective latent models and emphasizes trust as a product of message framing and credibility cues. Our findings inform science communication theory by reframing trust as an emergent network and offer practical guidance for communicators seeking to design inclusive, trust-enhancing strategies across diverse sociocultural contexts.",

    "authors": "Lanabi La Lova",
    "abstract": "This study investigates Russian television coverage of Ukraine between 2009 and 2019, drawing on a dataset of over 2.3 million news episodes from eight major television networks and one news agency (Interfax), including both state-controlled and relatively independent outlets. Combining natural language processing techniques with a quasi-experimental design, the analysis traces changes in content patterns over time. The results provide strong evidence consistent with the first hypothesis: following a state-enforced management change at RBC TV in 2016, the network increased the share of news coverage primarily focused on Ukraine by up to 40 percent, depending on the assumed treatment date. Evidence for the second hypothesis—which posits that RBC’s reporting would become more similar to state-controlled outlets—remains only partial. Cosine similarity analysis shows that RBC’s content became more similar to several state-controlled outlets while diverging from relatively independent TV Rain (Dozhd). Sentiment-polarity analysis indicates that RBC’s coverage became modestly more negative after the takeover. These findings suggest that content changes following institutional intervention may reflect increased alignment with state-linked narratives while preserving outlet-specific variation. The study contributes to research on media alignment in autocratic contexts by analyzing a single-case pattern and highlights both the potential and limitations of computational text analysis in examining large-scale trends in state media coverage.",

In Study 1, we analyzed the activities of 26,992 users on X (Twitter), identifying a preference among supporters of Erdogan, the incumbent president, for earthquake‐related conspiracy theories. In Study 2, face‐to‐face interviews with a nationally representative sample of 3568 individuals showed a correlation between the endorsement of these theories and increased support for Erdogan and his coalition, independent of other variables. These findings highlighted the significant role conspiracy theories that can play in bolstering authority and shaping electoral outcomes.",

    "authors": "Matthew J Clement, Matthew Karam",
    "abstract": "Nonresponse bias is a pervasive issue in surveys of people, affecting data quality across the social sciences. Such bias arises when the propensity to respond to a survey varies with the outcome variable, resulting in data that are missing not at random (MNAR). Repeated attempt models (RAMs) leverage information in nonresponses by survey subjects to estimate an outcome variable when data are MNAR. Here, we discuss parallels between RAMs and ecological occupancy models, which also use repeat surveys to account for imperfect detection of animal species during surveys. We describe a few likelihoods for RAMs, and we use simulations to evaluate the small sample performance of a RAM with a binary outcome. We also identify the optimal number of repeat surveys to complete, given different probabilities of response. Finally, we apply a RAM to surveys of deer hunters in Arizona, USA. Simulations indicated that RAMs generated unbiased estimates of a binary outcome for a variety of parameter values, but performance broke down when response probabilities or sample sizes were too low. We found that the optimal number of repeat surveys varied from about 4 to 20, depending on parameter values, but RAMs are likely inappropriate when data are missing at random. Our analysis of deer hunter data using a RAM produced plausible estimates of deer harvest. Relative to the RAM, a propensity model over-estimated deer harvest by 36–129 percent. A RAM could be extended to address unmodeled variation in response probabilities, inaccurate responses, and changes in outcome variables through time. We suggest that RAMs could be broadly useful for many natural resource and social science applications.",

We combined these data with demographic background variables and previously collected data on political views and values, to provide a detailed description of the identity of online news commenters in comparison to non-commenters. Our results show that the group of commenters contain more men (55%), and the age group of 45–54 years old has the largest share of commenters (18% for men, 13% for women). Furthermore, we found little to no differences for education levels, income, location, political preferences, and cultural background, suggesting that there is no striking overrepresentation of specific groups among online commenters in general. However, when looking at the profiles of online commenters as a function of the topic and platform of discussion, differences start to emerge for gender, age, and education levels. We found no differences related to age and gender distributions for those with a higher commenting frequency, but a higher frequency does go hand in hand with more support for national populist and far-right political parties and a lower confidence in political parties.",

    "abstract": "Many people now use AI chatbots to obtain summaries of complex topics, yet we know little about how this affects knowledge acquisition, including how the effects might vary across different groups of people. We conducted two experiments comparing how well people recalled factual information after reading AI-generated or human-written historical summaries. Participants who read AI-generated summaries scored significantly higher on knowledge tests than those who read expert-written blog posts (Study 1) or Wikipedia articles (Study 2). These improvements were present regardless of whether readers knew the content was AI-generated or if the AI summaries were politically biased. Moreover, AI summaries improved recall across various demographic groups, including gender, race, income, education, and digital literacy levels. This suggets that using AI tools for everyday factual queries does not create new knowledge inequalities but could still amplify existing ones through differential access. Our findings indicate that the increasingly routine use of AI for information-seeking could enhance factual learning, with implications for education policy and addressing inequality.",

    "abstract": "Time-series data have become ubiquitous in psychological research, allowing us to study detailed within-person dynamics and their heterogeneity across persons. Vector autoregressive (VAR) models have become a popular choice as a first approximation of these dynamics. The VAR model for each person and heterogeneity across persons can be jointly modeled using a hierarchical model that treats heterogeneity as a latent distribution. Currently, the most popular choice for this is the multilevel VAR model, which models heterogeneity across persons as quantitative variation through a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Here, we discuss an alternative, the latent class VAR model, which models heterogeneity as qualitative variation using a number of discrete clusters. While this model has been introduced before, it has not been readily accessible to researchers. Here we address this issue by providing an accessible introduction to latent class VAR models; a simulation evaluating how well this model can be estimated in situations resembling applied research; introducing a new R package ClusterVAR , which provides easy-to-use functions to estimate the model; and providing a fully reproducible tutorial on modeling emotion dynamics, which walks the reader through all steps of estimating, analyzing, and interpreting latent class VAR models.",

    "abstract": "Sociologists and others have studied whether democracies are becoming more ideologically polarized over climate change. However, research has yet to investigate if a newer form of division—affective polarization, or citizens’ hostility toward opposing party members—shapes major polluters’ carbon (CO 2 ) emissions. Building on the Advocacy Coalition Framework, integrated with neo-institutional and stakeholder perspectives, we argue that high levels of affective polarization enable power plants to emit greenhouse gases at a higher rate than those operating in less polarized contexts. To test our argument, we analyze a novel dataset of over 20,000 power plants in 92 democratic countries. Controlling for conventional predictors of emissions, we find that power plants in democracies marked by high affective polarization emit CO 2 at significantly higher rates. Also, in contexts of heightened interparty hostility, government-owned power stations emit more carbon, climate policies are less effective at curbing plants’ emissions, and plants pollute more where strong political constraints susceptible to gridlock are in place. These results are robust across different modeling specifications, suggesting that partisan animosity likely creates institutional conditions that insulate power plants from stakeholder and regulatory pressure, thereby undermining democracies’ ability to limit emissions from some of the world’s largest carbon polluters.",
