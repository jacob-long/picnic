    "abstract": "With the proliferation of (deep)fake news, individuals will increasingly find it difficult to discern whether content is created by human journalists or artificial intelligence. A two-wave online experiment investigated the carryover effects of news authentication during the initial (deep)fake news exposure on responses to subsequent (deep)fake news. Participants encountered celebrity (deep)fake news in text and video formats on social media. The results showed that the difficulty induced by news authentication lowered self-confidence in truth discernment, which, in turn, decreased the perceived credibility and engagement intentions toward subsequent unrelated fake news of the same modality."

    "abstract": "Multiple crises have marked the formative years of young adults. These crises heightened the need for information while also creating a large audience for misinformation. This article highlights digital resilience in four countries (the US, the UK, France, and Canada) and across different age groups, using a survey conducted in February 2021 at the apex of a series of crises. Based on a sample of 6,000 respondents, the two youngest age groups are more likely to use fact-checking websites, verify suspicious information, and report misinformation to social media platforms. These practices reflect digital resilience. In terms of cross-national differences, respondents from the US have higher use of fact-checking sites, which can be explained by the structural availability of these websites, which tend to focus on American content. In line with theories about uncertainty avoidance, respondents from France have higher rates of verification of suspicious information. Canada is distinctive in its low rates of misinformation reporting to social media platforms. While much of the scholarship has focused on political ideology as shaping engagement with misinformation, this study highlights generational differences, cultural differences, digital literacy programming, structural opportunities, and regulatory frameworks that may shape practices related to digital resilience."

Since the General Data Protection Regulation took effect, DDPs have found application in research. While the literature on the value of DDPs primarily points toward scaling and validating aggregate-level data, their potential to illuminate complex user–media relationships within datafied environments at the micro-level appears underexplored. Drawing from recent conceptualizations of the “data mirror,” which captures the feedback loops between users and digital media, this article provides theoretical grounding and practical guidelines for “mirroring” DDPs to users. Based on exercises with 64 participants, we articulate through an illustrative case study how DDPs can serve as prompts, contexts, and reflections, revealing reflexive strategies users employ to curate information flows on algorithmic platforms like Instagram. In addition, we introduce an open-source web application to operationalize DDPs as data mirrors for non-technical researchers."

Experimentation is widespread (88%), yet workflow integration remains uneven.

    "abstract": "This article investigates the digital afterlives of lynching, how its memory is invoked, refracted, and contested on Twitter. Drawing on a hybrid methodological approach that combines computational analysis of tweet corpora with interpretive readings, the research examines how histories of racial violence circulate within the algorithmically mediated space. While lynching remains a central symbol of anti-Black terror in the United States, its meaning in public discourse has become increasingly unstable. On Twitter, lynching is deployed as a historical referent, a metaphor, political claim, and rhetorical provocation, thereby surfacing in divergent frames. We theorize this instability as frictional memory: a dynamic of circulation under constraint, operating through temporal traction (mnemonic pivots that attach past to present), semantic abrasion (collisions that produce drift, contestation, and repair), and visibility routing (platform-mediated asymmetries of attention). This framework shows how histories of racial violence are not simply recalled online but continually reconfigured in digital architectures."

Drawing on an online survey representative of the adult Danish population ( N = 1,518), the study distinguishes between users of left-wing and right-wing alternative media and reveals a remarkable difference: The former only have lower trust in (purportedly) right-leaning mainstream media whereas the latter have lower trust in mainstream media regardless of their ideological leanings, indicating more all-encompassing lower trust. While the users have relatively lower news trust than the rest of the population, their trust is still fairly high in absolute terms. I conclude with a discussion of potential explanations for the left/right difference and of the democratic implications of the findings in and beyond the Danish media context."

The study employed a survey approach, collecting data from 4089 scientists affiliated with German universities and research institutions. Trust in journalism was measured across five dimensions: appropriate topic selection, accurate representation, proper fact selection, fair assessment, and desirable impact. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between dissatisfaction with pandemic-era media coverage, trust in journalism, and scientists’ willingness to engage in science communication. Results show that scientists’ trust in news media is generally limited and varies across media types. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated distrust, particularly in media outlets expected to maintain high standards, such as national newspapers and public broadcasters. Trust in journalism proved central in mediating dissatisfaction and engagement, highlighting that distrust may reduce scientists’ media involvement and, in turn, weaken public trust in science."

    "abstract": "Digital platforms have facilitated body-positive discourses that challenge appearance norms, yet these often intertwine with postfeminist elements, creating paradoxes that both resist and reinforce hegemonic ideals. By deploying computationally assisted critical thematic analysis across 1915 #RejectBodyAnxiety posts on RedNote, this study reveals both the breadth —the full variety of user-generated discursive elements and their articulation patterns—and the depth —the discursive meanings configured through these articulations, of this feminist digital activism site. The findings show that body-positivity discourses under #RejectBodyAnxiety are profoundly reconfigured through their articulation with localized postfeminist formations and platform-mediated empowering mechanisms, reframing body positivity as ideal positivity —a postfeminist discourse that refines hegemonic beauty ideals by shedding their extreme traits ( Selective Subversion ) and making them appear attainable ( Tactical Conformity ), thereby transforming them into seemingly positive forms. While fostering empowerment, this discourse risks new exclusions, marginalizing some women and intensifying postfeminist contradictions. Tracing these sensibilities through social media, the study highlights their new forms in non-Western contexts and underscores the need to address emerging discourses in body image promotion."

    "abstract": "This study argues that in China’s digital sphere, online misogyny functions less as a gateway to extremism and more as a structural hub for systemic discontent. Drawing on opportunity structure theory, our mixed-methods approach combines computational analysis of posts from Baidu Tieba ( n = 91,026) with in-depth interviews ( n = 27). We find that “Gendered Insults” exhibits the highest betweenness centrality, acting as a structural bridge connecting disparate frustrations. Women-targeting topics are both speakable and resonant within the community, anchored by a self-deprecating “sewer mouse” masculinity that navigates opportunity structures. Interviews reveal that when political opportunity structures remain closed while discursive and mediated (legacy platform) opportunities stay relatively accessible, misogyny becomes a functional language for channeling widespread socioeconomic anxieties. We conclude that in this context, misogyny operates not as a starting point for radicalization but as a core organizing principle for the socially disillusioned. This suggests that divergent structural conditions produce different mechanisms."

Measuring these differences in opinion using traditional methods, such as opinion polls, can be costly and provides only a snapshot of sentiment at a given time. Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) may offer a real-time tool for assessing opinions to explore the relationship between differing viewpoints about the pandemic and how these differences impact the occurrence and severity of disease burden. Utilizing an open-source data set of 1.75 million keyword-selected X (Twitter) posts, updated weekly from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, along with publicly available COVID-19 case and death counts and county-level data on election outcomes from the 2020 election, we analyzed how the volume of tweets on the X (Twitter) platform related to COVID-19 has changed over time and how patterns of use vary across the partisan divide. We discovered that Democratic-leaning counties exhibited higher X (Twitter) volume associated with COVID-19 topics compared to Republican-leaning counties in response to changes in case or death rates. In addition, we found a higher proportion of tweets in urban counties compared to rural ones."

This study presents findings from a field experiment conducted during Taiwan’s 2020 general election, assessing the impact of The China Times, a Beijing-backed media conglomerate, on voter behavior and attitudes. The experiment incentivized participants to engage in sustained consumption of real-time news from this outlet in the weeks leading up to the election. Results from a panel survey linked to individual-level web-tracking data reveal that exposure to The China Times sways voters in favor of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). These effects, however, are primarily driven by nonpartisan and PRC-friendly voters. To the extent that I find effects among PRC-skeptics, they show evidence of backfiring. As Beijing’s media co-optation extends beyond Taiwan, my findings have broader implications for understanding the effectiveness and limitations of authoritarian influence operations."

    "abstract": "Political news consumption is highly uneven today: few people consume from news outlets directly, while many encounter news incidentally through social media and aggregators. Because outlets depend on direct consumers for revenue, they respond primarily to this core audience’s preferences. Several contemporary styles of news coverage—which emphasize partisan conflict, employ specialized jargon, engage in predictive analysis, and use clickbait language—are attractive to core consumers, but may also make news less accessible for others. In a pre-registered survey experiment ( n = 2,233), I show that, relative to a public interest style that prioritizes key information about policy and democratic norms, typical news styles weaken post-exposure recall of key news information—that is, they are under-informative. Recall penalties are especially severe for those with lower baseline political engagement, yet still affect highly engaged consumers as well. This study shows that contemporary approaches to news coverage broadly under-serve the public by inhibiting political learning."

Our analysis distinguishes major sources of bias and clarifies the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

We further demonstrate that the classifier generalizes out of distribution across two applications. Although the empirical setting is domain-specific, the approach offers a scalable method for expert-driven text coding applicable to other areas of political inquiry."

Building on prior studies by Barber and Pope (2019, 2024) regarding Donald Trump's impact on people's policy preferences during his 2017–2021 presidency, we examine whether this influence persists soon after Trump's first presidential tenure concludes in late 2021 through a survey experiment. We also assess the influence of a second external cue that has gained attention due to the growing role of social media in political processes: a close friend, who might also serve as a relevant figure for policy position formation. We find that Trump's liberal cues shift Republican preferences in a liberal direction, while close friend cues show diverse patterns, including some backlash effects where individuals adopt positions opposite to conservative friend advocacy. These effects vary with individuals' party identification, political knowledge, and social conformity levels. Individual characteristics moderate political elite influence, while peer influence operates through reactance mechanisms rather than conformity, revealing that social networks shape opinions through more complex pathways than commonly theorized."

    "abstract": "Americans’ trust in scientists has been stable and high, relative to other political and social institutions, for the last half century (Krause, Brossard, and Scheufele 2019). Yet, underlying this stability lies a dramatic change such that a partisan gap has emerged, with Democrats exhibiting substantially more trust than Republicans. Fifty years ago, Republicans in fact exhibited more relative trust in scientists. This article explains this continuity and change. First, we demonstrate that the demographic correlates of trust in scientists have been remarkably stable for more than a half century: women, Black, rural, religious, non-college educated, and lower/working-class individuals exhibit less trust than their counterparts. Second, we show that the partisan relationship with trust in scientists has flipped (over that same time period) as low-trusting demographic strata shifted partisan allegiances. This is particularly the case when it comes to education and religiosity. Concomitant with the emergent partisan gap is a massive perceptual gap among Democrats, who perceive a partisan divide more than double its actual size. Democrats vastly underestimate Republicans’ trust in scientists. The enduring demographic basis of trust in scientists provides an opportunity to bridge partisan divides by addressing demographic inequities in the practice and application of science."

    "abstract": "This study examines how elite figures shape polarisation on Twitter/X through the interplay of content, structure, and engagement strategy. Drawing on data from nine globally influential users (2010–2021), the research integrates natural language processing, network analysis, and causal modelling to test five hypotheses grounded in social identity, agenda-setting, and two-step flow theories. Entity co-occurrence networks reveal that polarised discourse forms denser, more clustered networks than non-polarised content, indicating tighter semantic cohesion around socially and politically charged entities. Thematic and sentiment analyses show that posts addressing non-core topics – particularly those concerning social justice, environmental sustainability, philanthropy, and global welfare – are nearly five times more likely to be polarised than core professional themes. Negative emotional tone further amplifies this effect, while higher tweet-to-retweet ratios reduce polarisation, underscoring the moderating role of original content production. A user-level mediation analysis tested whether topical diversity transmits the effect of follower scale on polarisation but found no significant indirect pathway, suggesting that larger audiences do not necessarily foster communicative moderation. The findings advance understanding of elite discourse by linking structural and thematic polarisation to behavioural mechanisms of engagement. Theoretically, the study bridges social identity, agenda-setting, and two-step flow frameworks to explain how elites balance audience alignment and expressive risk. Practically, it highlights how emphasising original content, inclusive framing, and professional identity consistency can mitigate divisive online dynamics and foster more cohesive digital publics. To support transparency and reproducibility, the dataset and analytical code are made publicly available."

    "abstract": "The introduction of ChatGPT—an artificial-intelligence (AI) chatbot capable of text recognition and generation—has been transformative for numerous academic research communities, including psychology. We propose using ChatGPT to reduce researchers’ cognitive load and time spent creating text materials for psychological studies (e.g., vignettes). We present examples of ChatGPT-generated text materials for relationship-science ( N = 60) and social-cognition ( N = 67) studies and provide evidence of their effectiveness. Furthermore, we discuss ethical considerations and make recommendations related to using text materials generated by ChatGPT or similar AI tools. We end with a brief discussion of the importance of this work and encourage others to leverage AI in the field of psychology."

    "abstract": "Extant work has identified two discursive forms of racism: overt and covert. While both forms have received attention in scholarly work, research on covert racism has been limited. Its subtle and context-specific nature has made it difficult to systematically identify covert racism in text, especially in large corpora. In this article, we first propose a theoretically driven and generalizable process to identify and classify covert and overt racism in text. This process allows researchers to construct coding schemes and build labeled datasets. We use the resulting dataset to train XLM-RoBERTa, a cross-lingual large language model (LLM) for supervised classification with a cutting-edge contextual understanding of text. We show that XLM-R and XLM-R-Racismo, our pretrained model, outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in classifying racism in large corpora. We illustrate our approach using a corpus of tweets relating to the Ecuadorian indígena community between 2018 and 2021."

    "abstract": "Analyzing social change requires detecting patterns of continuity and difference over time. While time-series clustering offers a valuable approach, existing techniques are often limited by assuming fixed cluster definitions and static assignments of entities to clusters. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified framework of temporal clustering methods that allows for both dynamic cluster definitions and the transition of entities between clusters, generalizing and extending previous work. We also provide new algorithms for this dynamic clustering that optimize global objectives, with optional constraints on the transitions of entities across clusters. This framework expands the methodological toolkit for analyzing social change, and we provide guidelines for its application. We illustrate our approach with three case studies: polarization of social and political attitudes across U.S. states; cross-national cultural change; and the evolution of neighborhood business patterns. We conclude with directions for further research."
