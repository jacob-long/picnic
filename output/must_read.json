    "abstract": "Despite an upsurge in social media studies, little is known about how cabinet ministers balance their multiple professional roles—as ministry heads, cabinet members, and party politicians—on social media platforms. In this article, we first develop an analytical framework, grounded in the principal–agent theory and earlier research on political communication, that differentiates between cabinet ministers’ different communicative roles as well as different communicative purposes on social media. Second, we add to the growing literature on government communication and social media by applying this framework to analyze Norwegian cabinet ministers’ social media communication. The data is based on a manual content analysis of 1,062 Facebook posts and an expansion of this data using machine learning to cover all the Facebook communication of all ministers from the Solberg cabinet (2013–2021). Based on almost 20,000 posts, the results indicate that social media caters to ministers’ needs both as party politicians and as heads of ministries, as Norwegian cabinet ministers use social media in two key ways: to inform as ministry heads and to brand themselves as party politicians. Further, we find that private self-personalization increases audience engagement. The results suggest that social media accentuates the party-political dimension of the cabinet minister’s role, thereby indicating potential consequences for government communication, cabinet unity, and decision-making that warrant further exploration."

    "abstract": "In a digitally connected world, the perceived expectation to always stay available via mobile messenger services places unique demands on users. This paper addresses the question of how and when so-called availability pressure leads to variations in messenger users’ well-/ill-being. Drawing on the Integrative Model of Mobile Media Use and Need Experiences, it conceptualizes the satisfaction versus frustration of fundamental needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) as mediators and the health-promoting personality trait mindfulness as a moderator. This model was tested across a 7-day-long diary study ( N = 229) and a 2-factorial online experiment ( N = 166). Both pre-registered studies are in line with the model's assumption that availability pressure can lead to specific need experiences, which in turn predict different facets of well-/ill-being. Although we identified limited moderating effects, being mindful (Study 1) and cultivating mindfulness (Study 2) were positively related to need satisfaction and well-being and negatively related to need frustration and ill-being. This highlights the complex consequences of availability pressure and the importance of individual coping mechanisms. Future research should refine theoretical models like the Integrative Model of Mobile Media Use and Need Experiences and explore additional health-promoting personality traits to better understand digital well-being in the era of mobile connectivity."

In this study, we attempt to provide a broad systemic analysis of fandom, using a survey of 4874 fans who use the fan fiction posting site, Archive of Our Own. Through our analysis, we examine the interplay of fan identity with their practices: what type of romantic content fans prefer and which platforms fans prefer to use. We find that both romantic content and platform preference are shaped by fans’ identities, which provides important insights into broad patterns of how identity impacts behavior among fan fiction writers and readers across fandoms."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates change in international migrants’ political attitudes. It theorizes a novel attitudinal typology distinguishing polity‐specific attitudes influenced by national contexts and transnational attitudes forged by migratory experience. It applies the typology to four dimensions of political competition in contemporary Europe: redistribution, homosexuality, European integration, and immigration. The paper tests the new theory using cross‐sectional and panel data spanning nearly 380,000 observations from 104 sending and 28 destination countries. It introduces a new strategy to model cross‐classified hierarchical data, addresses issues inherent to group comparison, and pioneers two empirical inquiries into migrants’ self‐selection. The results show that migration prompts the acculturation of polity‐specific attitudes and the cosmopolitanization of transnational attitudes. Migrants adopt their host countries’ attitudes toward redistribution and homosexuality while developing a uniquely liberal outlook on European integration and immigration. These findings carry major implications for our understanding of attitudinal change and the dimensionality of the ideological space."

    "abstract": "Scholars increasingly conceptualize populism by whether politicians use people-centric and anti-elite appeals that pit a homogeneous people against a corrupt elite. These appeals reflect “thin” ideology because they offer no programmatic content and thus politicians must pair these appeals with more substantive positions, termed their “host” (or thick) ideology, which often consists of nativism on the right (e.g., espousing anti-immigrant positions) and socialism on the left (e.g., prioritizing redistribution). An emerging literature has thus sought to estimate whether populists garner support due to their thin ideology or their substantive host ideology. To date, no research has validated whether populism treatments (1) truly operationalize populist thin ideology, and (2) do so without manipulating host ideology. Results from three conjoint validation experiments fielded in both the United States and the United Kingdom show that thin ideology treatments successfully manipulate the underlying concepts but caution that some operationalizations also affect perceptions of host ideology."

    "abstract": "This article constructs an approach to analyzing longitudinal panel data which combines topological data analysis (TDA) and generative AI applied to graph neural networks (GNNs). TDA is deployed to identify and analyze unobserved topological heterogeneities of a dataset. TDA-extracted information is quantified into a set of measures, called functional principal components. These measures are used to analyze the data in four ways. First, the measures are construed as moderators of the data and their statistical effects are estimated through a Bayesian framework. Second, the measures are used as factors to classify the data into topological classes using generative AI applied to GNNs constructed by transforming the data into graphs. The classification uncovers patterns in the data which are otherwise not accessible through statistical approaches. Third, the measures are used as factors that condition the extraction of latent variables of the data through a deployment of a generative AI model. Fourth, the measures are used as labels for classifying the graphs into classes used to offer a GNN-based effective dimensionality reduction of the original data. The article uses a portion of the militarized international disputes (MIDs) dataset (from 1946 to 2010) as a running example to briefly illustrate its ideas and steps."

    "abstract": "The relationship between populist attitudes and ideological orientations remains an area of considerable academic interest, yet much is still unknown about the ideological inclinations associated with populist attitudes. While many scholars acknowledge the link between populist attitudes and political ideology, existing studies often treat this relationship as either a given or a peripheral concern. This paper represents an initial exploration into the association between populist attitudes and political ideology. Utilizing data from the fifth wave (2016–2021) of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, which encompasses 43 countries and 52 elections, this study aims to uncover how this relationship manifests cross-nationally. By employing a variety of rigorous methodological models, including the Generalized Additive Model, our results reveal a nonlinear relationship between populist attitudes and political ideology. Specifically, we find that political ideology and populist attitudes exhibit a U-shaped nonlinear relationship and that ideological extremism and populist attitudes demonstrate an exponential nonlinear relationship. These findings emphasize the nuanced interplay between ideological positions and populist attitudes, providing a deeper understanding of how they intersect."

However, the possibility of social desirability biases (SDBs) raises doubts about whether such instruments capture sincere attitudes. We search for evidence of SDB in measures of democratic attitudes in three studies. The first two leverage variations in survey mode (self-completion vs. face-to-face) in the European Social Survey’s Democracy module, drawing on evidence that interviewer absence encourages voicing socially undesirable opinions. The third uses a double-list experiment to estimate the prevalence of an anti-democratic attitude. Using data from as many as 24 European countries, we find no evidence that SDB inflates survey measures of democratic attitudes. These results contribute to our understanding of democratic attitudes and to methodological toolkit for interested scholars."

Utilizing data from the 2024 American National Election Studies pre-election survey, the analysis highlights political knowledge's dual roles—as both a potential catalyst for partisan animosity and a critical resource promoting democratic stability. Consistent with recent research, more politically knowledgeable individuals tend to express intensified negative feelings toward opposing political parties, and this tendency is particularly pronounced among individuals who attach less importance to their partisan identity. In the meantime, increased political knowledge is also significantly associated with reduced condonation of political violence, particularly among those who perceive their partisan identity as highly central to their self-concept. These findings highlight the dual-edged, context-dependent nature of political knowledge, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of its implications in contemporary democratic societies."

This study examines whether media literacy can effectively combat health misinformation by influencing key stages of the misinformation process: initial credibility discernment, sharing decisions, and response to corrections. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in China with 693 respondents, assessing their ability to discern misinformation (using both mean-rating difference and receiver operating characteristic–based methods), willingness to share information, and continued belief in misinformation after corrections. Results indicated that higher media literacy was associated with better credibility discernment of health information. Media literacy did not significantly associate with sharing discernment; however, respondents with higher media literacy scores exhibited a stronger continued influence effect. Additionally, participants with greater credibility discernment were more discerning in sharing information, although neither discernment index was related to the magnitude of the continued influence effect. These findings highlight a double-edged sword: while media literacy enhances the recognition of false information, it may also engender confidence that makes individuals less receptive to valid corrections. Interventions aiming to combat health misinformation should account for both the beneficial and potentially counterproductive effects of media literacy. The widespread dissemination of health misinformation on the Internet has a detrimental effect on people's lives."

This study investigates the relationship between selective and incidental exposure and political tolerance in the United States. Findings reveal that frequent selective exposure on social media is associated with lower political tolerance. In contrast, frequent incidental exposure is linked to higher political tolerance. Notably, political network diversity on social media serves as a moderator for incidental exposure, as its positive relationship with political tolerance is observed only among individuals with highly diverse political networks. However, it does not moderate for selective exposure. These findings suggest that two distinct forms of social media exposure are associated with dual patterns, indicating that while selective exposure is linked to a lack of political acceptance, incidental exposure—particularly when occurring within politically diverse social media networks—is associated with increased political tolerance. We conclude by discussing the (un)democratic implications of these findings."

    "abstract": "As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) companions become increasingly integrated into users’ social lives, concerns have arisen regarding the potential for abuse of these artificial agents. Some scholars have further suggested that such abusive behaviors toward GenAI may eventually spill over into human interpersonal contexts. Guided by the Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM), this study investigated how Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism predict emotionally abusive behavior toward GenAI companions. A dyadic design was employed, collecting parallel reports from both human users (self-reports) and their GenAI companions (GenAI assessments) among 1041 participants (632 females; average age = 25.10 years) recruited from an online human–GenAI relationship community. Results demonstrated that psychopathy and sadism were consistent predictors of GenAI abuse across both reporting perspectives, whereas narcissism exhibited a stable negative association with abuse. In contrast, Machiavellianism predicted GenAI abuse only through GenAI assessments, but not self-reports. Theoretically, our findings extend RAM to human–AI relationships, demonstrating that personality traits vary in how accurately they can be judged in GenAI contexts. Practically, the results highlight that individuals high in certain Dark Tetrad traits—specifically psychopathy and sadism—represent personality-driven high-risk groups, providing insights for practitioners in education and technology to develop interventions or safeguards aimed at mitigating abusive behavior toward GenAI companions."

In this tutorial, we discuss the best practices of model specification for longitudinal dyadic multilevel modeling, providing a practical guide to specifying (and respecifying) random effects with both theoretical and practical considerations in mind. We begin by defining random effects in the context of repeated-measures dyadic data and address common issues such as nonconvergence. Then, using two models—the dyadic growth-curve and the stability and influence model—we demonstrate how to apply these guidelines in both SAS and R. The dyadic growth-curve model provides a straightforward example, whereas the stability and influence model illustrates common challenges when dealing with complex random-effect structures and convergence issues. In the first exercise, we explain how to customize the variance-covariance matrix for these analyses in SAS. In the second exercise, we adapt these analyses for R and discuss how to implement the sum-and-difference approach for indistinguishable dyads. We conclude with a discussion of alternative models and go over the utility of data simulation during study design, helping readers plan and select the best approach for their research."

Study 1 ( N = 896) manipulated White privilege salience and the opportunity to express outrage before measuring donations to a racial justice organization. Reminders of racial privilege increased White collective guilt, and donations among White U.S. participants low (but not high) in justice sensitivity. However, the opportunity to express outrage at another’s prejudicial behavior negated privilege-induced reparative action. A second preregistered study ( N = 1344) found this effect only when outrage was directed at a racialized (vs. non-racialized) injustice. A third preregistered study ( N = 1133) replicated the effects using a more controlled manipulation of outrage expression and more ecologically valid outcomes. Findings suggest that salient racial privilege may motivate some White Americans to address systemic racism, but expressing outrage at another’s bigotry may undermine this process."

Yet shared method biases—which may greatly inflate associations between measures—are rarely accounted for during measurement validation or hypothesis testing. To examine how method biases can affect relationship research, we embarked on the ironic exploration of a new construct— Pseudo —comprised of irrelevant relationship evaluations (e.g., “My relationship has very good Saturn”). Pseudo was moderately associated with common relationship measures (e.g., satisfaction, commitment) and predicted those measures 3 weeks later. Results of a dyadic longitudinal study suggested that Pseudo taps into method biases, particularly sentiment override (i.e., people’s tendency to project their global relationship sentiments onto every relationship evaluation). We conclude that psychometric standards must be sufficiently rigorous to distinguish genuine constructs and associations from methodological artifacts that can otherwise pose a serious validity threat."

Understanding the conditions that make interviewer variance more likely to occur is essential in tackling sources of bias. Earlier evidence suggests that certain features of the survey instrument provide more ground for interviewer influence. For instance, attitudinal, sensitive, complex or open-ended questions invite more interviewer variance. In this article, we aim to validate earlier results, previously derived from single-country studies, by using the large cross-national sample of the European Social Survey (ESS). We compare 29,330 intra-interviewer correlations derived from 984 survey questions from 28 countries using data from 10 waves of the ESS. The questions were manually coded based on several characteristics. These features of survey questions were then used as predictors of intraclass correlations (ICCs) in multilevel models. The results show that question characteristics account for a significant portion of the variation in ICCs, with certain types, such as attitude and non-factual questions, items appearing later in the survey, and those using showcards, being especially susceptible to interviewer effects. Our findings have important implications for both interviewer training and questionnaire design."

Here we develop a one-shot learning task to investigate whether humans and LLMs encode tree-structured constituents within sentences. Participants (total N = 372, native Chinese or English speakers, and bilingual in Chinese and English) and LLMs (for example, ChatGPT) were asked to infer which words should be deleted from a sentence. Both groups tend to delete constituents, instead of non-constituent word strings, following rules specific to Chinese and English, respectively. The results cannot be explained by models that rely only on word properties and word positions. Crucially, based on word strings deleted by either humans or LLMs, the underlying constituency tree structure can be successfully reconstructed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that latent tree-structured sentence representations emerge in both humans and LLMs."

    "abstract": "The transmission of communicable diseases in human populations is known to be modulated by behavioral patterns. However, detailed characterizations of how population-level behaviors change over time during multiple disease outbreaks and spatial resolutions are still not widely available. We used data from 431,211 survey responses collected in the United States, between April 2020 and June 2022, to provide a description of how human behaviors fluctuated during the first 2 y of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis suggests that at the national and state levels, people’s adherence to recommendations to avoid contact with others (a preventive behavior) was highest early in the pandemic but gradually—and linearly—decreased over time. Importantly, during periods of intense COVID-19 mortality, adaption to preventive behaviors increased—despite the overall temporal decrease. These spatial-temporal characterizations help improve our understanding of the bidirectional feedback loop between outbreak severity and human behavior. Our findings should benefit both computational modeling teams developing methodologies to predict the dynamics of future epidemics and policymakers designing strategies to mitigate the effects of future disease outbreaks."

    "abstract": "Behaviorally informed “nudges” are widely used in government outreach but are often seen as too modest to address poverty at scale. In four field experiments over 2 y ( n = 542,804 low-income households), we test whether more proactive communication, varying message framing, and more precise targeting can boost take-up of tax-based benefits in California above and beyond traditional light-touch approaches. Our interventions focused on extremely vulnerable households, most with no prior-year earnings, who were at risk of missing out on two crucial benefits: the 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit and pandemic-relief Economic Impact Payments. Light-touch outreach consistently increased take-up of these benefits by 0.14 to 2 percentage points—a 150% to over 500% relative increase—regardless of message, sample, timing, or modality. These light-touch approaches resulted in over $4 million disbursed, with a highly cost-effective return of $50 to over $8,000 per $1 spent. However, higher-touch proactive outreach, varying messaging, and more precise targeting yielded minimal additional benefits, with proactive outreach even showing negative returns. These findings demonstrate that light-touch outreach can effectively shift behavior among very vulnerable households in contexts with reduced compliance burdens, but also underscore an urgent need to rethink the role of higher-touch strategies in closing take-up gaps in social safety net programs."
