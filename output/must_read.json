    "abstract": "When assessing media effects, we seldom consider how they change over time. Especially with the prevalence of smartphone use as short-lived, fragmented media use, a systematic approach to temporal dimensions is crucial, particularly to understand mixed effects of smartphone use on situational well-being. We employ a multiverse approach to assess the influence of two central temporal dimensions in intensive longitudinal media effects research: Time frame and time lag. We combine mobile experience sampling (T1 = 2,859, T2 = 7,708) and log data (K1 = 71,807, K2 = 259,004) from N1 = 84 and N2 = 192 participants. Building on theorizing on time in media effects research, we propose four patterns of how short-term effects on situational well-being unfold: they may follow processes of ephemerality (fleeting effects), inertia (delayed onset), reversal (changing directions), or there are no changes over time. We discuss theoretical implications and give recommendations for future studies."

    "abstract": "Social-media–based protests often unfold across multiple, semi-autonomous communities that cooperate, compete, and overlap, yet most research still treats “the movement” as a single unit. I introduce the 3R framework—Rhetoric, Reach, Reinforcement—to trace how collective-identity messages are produced, circulated, and amplified among these communities. The study analyzed a multilingual corpus of 800,000 Facebook posts (200,000 textual posts) spanning three months, using unsupervised topic modeling, multiple linear regression, and social-network analysis. Results show systematic heterogeneity: communal organizations react most intensely to posts criticizing the government, signaling identity-affirming outrage. Journalistic pages function as “bridge nodes,” injecting new topics into the network and diffusing them widely, thereby disrupting potential echo chambers. High-reach, high-rhetoric messages are disproportionately reinforced through repeated sharing and cross-posting, magnifying their visibility well beyond the originating community. This study maps how rhetoric, reach, and reinforcement interact across organizational boundaries, offering a unified theoretical and empirical approach to understanding how online protest movements construct, contest, and sustain collective identities."

Our research advances understanding of how psychological processing influences perceptions and effects of AI-generated messages on message acceptance and credibility. Specifically, the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm, anthropomorphism, and solipsistic introjection are employed to examine the effects of the degree of AI involvement in information delivery when seeking clarification on a politicized issue – ranging from none (e.g., news article), to partial (e.g., AI-generated summaries in Google search results), to full reliance on AI (e.g., responses from ChatGPT). Findings from our online experiment with N = 551 US adults indicate that moderate and highly AI-powered sources are deemed more credible than non-AI human-authored sources, however, this effect is weakened by diminished perceptions of anthropomorphizing of AI. Further, solipsistic introjection is negatively related to message acceptance, indicating this intrapsychic processing may decrease the persuasiveness of messages that combat mis/disinformation. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications."

    "abstract": "Abstract: Given the importance of the credibility and effectiveness of health messaging during politicized public health events, this study explores both message source and message recipient factors in predicting perceived credibility and intent to comply with a COVID-19 mitigation message. Born out of disease avoidance, greater individual disgust sensitivity should lead to greater perceived risk and uptake of mitigation efforts. Meanwhile, conservative partisanship in the US has been associated with less perceived risk and behavioral compliance related to COVID-19. However, greater disgust, sensitivity, and political conservatism enjoy a positive relationship. To test this paradox, we explore both partisanship and disgust sensitivity, along with authoritarianism, to see which ultimately better predicts perceived credibility and intent to comply with government-issued COVID-19 guidance. We further explore partisanship by exploring how messages from the same (or different) political party influence message processing and effects. An online experiment with a US-based sample ( N = 424) found no influence of individuals’ political partisanship, but did find small (yet significant) effects such that messages from Democratic governors elicited greater intent to comply than Republican ones. Results about disgust sensitivity were mixed: greater pathogen disgust sensitivity was associated with greater perceived credibility of messages, whereas greater socio-moral disgust sensitivity was associated with greater intent to comply. Implications are discussed."

This research provides a first look at such perceptions across a wide array of legacy and novel fact-check sources available today. An online survey of 993 participants and an experiment involving 1,002 participants were conducted to examine differences in credibility perceptions, usage, and sharing of fact-checks from professional fact-check organizations, mainstream news outlets, social media platforms, automated fact-check services, and crowdsourcing. Results show that legacy sources are considered most credible, fact-check receiver characteristics (political ideology, analytical thinking, and information literacy) influence perceptions of fact-checker credibility, and perceived credibility of fact-checkers is key to fact-check usage. Results also reveal that fact-checker source type and perceived credibility of fact-checkers are essential to fact-check sharing intention. Our findings advance the nascent concept of fact-checker credibility and contribute to theory, specifically the MAIN model and the stage framework model. They also offer novel data about new sources of fact-checking, including how AI and crowdsource-based fact-checkers are perceived by the public."

This study argues that data markets increasingly operate as digital platforms for cultural production, where the logic of popularity shapes the cultural value of datasets. We conceptualize these shifts by analyzing how dataset valuation operates within cultural data markets . Through statistical and forensic qualitative analysis, we examine key content features of the most popular public datasets on the data science platform Kaggle and their relationship to different popularity metrics. We find that the logic of popularity establishes a value structure that relies on quantifiable user–dataset interactions, which obfuscates key aspects of data curation and collaboration for assessing the cultural value of datasets. Dataset popularity remains a limited approach for data valuation in cultural markets that requires more comprehensive measures of cultural investments in dataset production."

Drawing on a two-year panel survey conducted in Austria (April 2020 to March 2022), we use a mixed Markov chain model to analyze one of the most persistent and widely believed conspiracy narratives—the claim that COVID-19 was a deliberately engineered bioweapon. The results reveal two opposing types of belief trajectories: an upward trajectory of belief stability, reinforcement of accurate beliefs, and correction, driven by perceived health-related threats and exposure to high-quality media, such as public broadcasters and broadsheets; and a downward trajectory marked by heightened belief instability, reinforcement of misperceptions, and an erosion of belief accuracy, associated with perceived economic threats and the use of low-quality media—including tabloids, commercial TV, and social media. Overall, the findings highlight the value of the theoretical frameworks for a more nuanced understanding of belief dynamics in times of crisis and underline the vital role of high-quality media in fostering a well-informed democratic public."

We provide an overview of common estimation methods, including Bayesian approaches and machine learning techniques that use names or images as inputs. We propose and test a hybrid approach that combines surname-based Bayesian estimation with the use of publicly available images in a convolutional neural network. We find that the proposed approach not only reduces statistical bias in downstream analyses but also improves accuracy in a sample of over 16,000 local elected officials. We conclude with a discussion of caveats and describe settings where the hybrid approach is especially suitable."

Yet the mechanisms enabling the endorsement of misinformation may differ in contexts where other identities are salient. This study explores whether religion drives the endorsement of misinformation in India. Using original data, we first show that individuals with high levels of religiosity and religious polarization endorse significantly higher levels of misinformation. Next, to understand the causal mechanisms through which religion operates, we field an experiment where corrections rely on religious messaging, and/or manipulate perceptions of religious ingroup identity. We find that corrections including religious frames (1) reduce the endorsement of misinformation; (2) are sometimes more effective than standard corrections; and (3) work beyond the specific story corrected. These findings highlight the religious roots of belief formation and provide hope that social identities can be marshalled to counter misinformation."

But despite the salience of their victories, we know little about whether these events abroad change citizens’ satisfaction with democracy (SWD). Building on the transnational learning literature, this research tests two diverging effects regarding the spillover of an authoritarian’s electoral victory. Citizens may be less satisfied with domestic democracy (contagion/domino effect) or see their democracy in a rosier light (benchmark effect). Additionally, because of motivated reasoning, such effects may be heterogeneous among citizens with different ideologies. To test for these expectations, I re-analyse two datasets collected in Europe amid the 2016 US presidential election. Both studies demonstrate a modest benchmark effect, as citizens’ SWD increases after Trump’s unexpected victory. Also, the heterogeneity analysis finds that the benchmark effect is most prominent among citizens who previously voted for socialist/radical left parties or liberal parties. I discuss how these findings enrich the literature on autocratization, transnational learning and satisfaction with democracy."

In a three‐wave panel design with a nationally diverse U.S. sample, a correction of misinformation about CRT was tested. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a control condition; (2) a misinformation‐only treatment; or (3) a misinformation plus correction treatment. Those in the misinformation plus correction condition had significantly higher accuracy scores than those in the control and misinformation‐only conditions. Moreover, this increased accuracy in the misinformation with correction condition was stronger among those most predisposed to accept CRT misinformation, that is, participants who scored high on a measure of unawareness of institutional discrimination. In contrast, participants' attitudes toward CRT bans were unaffected by the treatments, suggesting that correction can improve accuracy but does not change related opinions."

Yet, they increasingly use negative rhetoric to attack the opposition rather than forge legislative compromise, contrary to theories of going public. Why? I argue presidents facing congressional obstruction eschew short-term policy persuasion. They speak as negative partisans to mobilize co-partisans and shape the longer-term balance of power in Congress, improving future policy-making prospects. I collect all presidential speeches delivered between 1933 and 2024 and use transformer methods to measure how often, and how negatively, presidents reference the out-party. They do so when the policy-making environment is unfavorable: when majorities are tenuous, government is divided, and as elections approach. I provide additional support with a case study of Democrats’ 2009 filibuster-proof Senate majority. Finally, this rhetoric has behavioral impact: presidential negative partisanship decreases co-partisan approval of the opposition. This research alters our understanding of going public and reinforces the partisan dimension of modern presidential representation."

The Theory of Informative Fictions (TIF) addresses this gap by presenting propositions that predict the conditions under which misinformation is tolerated and promoted. Building on the literature on TIF and deep learning, we uncover how property messages and character messages differ in veracity and explore the relationship between visual misinformation and user engagement. By constructing a short video dataset Tikcron ( N = 42,201) and a multimodal video analysis framework KILL, we classify TikTok videos as misinformation or not, and property messages or character messages. Our results indicate that character messages are more likely to convey misinformation than property messages, and character messages with misinformation are more likely to get tolerated and promoted by social media users than property messages with misinformation. This study extends the current methodological advancement of image-as-data to misinformation videos and proposes a multimodal video analysis framework to develop communication-centered theories. The broader practical implications of this study on the detection, countering, and governance of visual misinformation are also discussed."

One widely recognized challenge is bridging the gap between the nonrepresentative study samples commonly used to evaluate interventions and the broader populations that policymakers aim to serve. To address this challenge, we introduce causal effect generalizability, an approach from causal inference and epidemiology, in the form of an accessible, nontechnical tutorial for psychological and behavioral scientists. We use publicly available data from a real-world psychology intervention study to illustrate why causal effects in a nonrepresentative study sample may systematically differ from those in a broader population. We provide a step-by-step guide with user-friendly R functions, enabling researchers to generalize causal effects from a study sample back to the full target population. This approach allows researchers to assess intervention effects in broader populations, offering valuable insights to guide evidence-based policy development. We hope this nontechnical introductory material will assist scholars in enhancing the policy relevance and real-world impact of psychological science."

    "abstract": "Statistical-mediation analysis is a widely used method in psychological research that helps understand the intermediate variables, known as mediators ( M ), by which an independent variable ( X ) causes an outcome variable ( Y ). A major contribution to statistical-mediation analysis has been the incorporation of causal methods because it allows a clear definition of the causal direct and mediated effects and the specification of the assumptions to interpret such effects as causal. Modern causal approaches to mediation analysis encourage routinely investigating the extent to which unobserved confounders may explain the observed mediated effects. The recommendation acknowledges that even when X represents random assignment, participants are not usually randomly assigned to levels of M ; hence, unobserved confounders may bias the M to Y relation ( b -path). In this article, we describe unobserved pretreatment confounding of the M to Y relation in experimental mediation studies and three sensitivity-analysis methods to assess unmeasured pretreatment confounding of the M to Y relation: the correlated-residuals method, the left-out-variables-error method, and the phantom-variable method. We report the results of a simulation study that compares the routine application of the three sensitivity-analysis methods. Results generally indicate that larger effect sizes of the population b -path are less susceptible to confounding bias for all sensitivity methods. Thus, an initial approach to investigating confounding bias in experimental mediation studies is to assess the effect size of the path relating M to Y , and more details can be obtained by applying one of the three sensitivity-analysis methods."

To effectively cultivate creativity, researchers and educators need reliable and accessible assessment tools. Recent software developments have significantly enhanced the administration and scoring of creativity measures; however, existing software often requires expertise in experiment design and computer programming, limiting its accessibility to many educators and researchers. In the current work, we introduce CAP—the Creativity Assessment Platform—a free web application for building creativity assessments, collecting data, and automatically scoring responses (cap.ist.psu.edu). CAP allows users to create custom creativity assessments in ten languages using a simple, point-and-click interface, selecting from tasks such as the Short Story Task, Drawing Task, and Scientific Creative Thinking Test. Users can automatically score task responses using machine learning models trained to match human creativity ratings—with multilingual capabilities, including the new Cross-Lingual Alternate Uses Scoring (CLAUS), a large language model achieving strong prediction of human creativity ratings in ten languages. CAP also provides a centralized dashboard to monitor data collection, score assessments, and automatically generate text for a Methods section based on the study’s tasks, metrics, and instructions—with a single click—promoting transparency and reproducibility in creativity assessment. Designed for ease of use, CAP aims to democratize creativity measurement for researchers, educators, and everyone in between."

    "abstract": "Proper data visualization helps researchers draw correct conclusions from their data and facilitates a more complete and transparent report of the results. In factorial designs, so-called raincloud plots have recently attracted attention as a particularly informative data visualization technique; raincloud plots can simultaneously show summary statistics (i.e., a box plot), a density estimate (i.e., the cloud), and the individual data points (i.e., the raindrops). Here we first present a ‘raincloud quartet’ that underscores the added value of raincloud plots over the traditional presentation of means and confidence intervals. The added value of raincloud plots appears to be increasingly recognized: a focused literature review of plots in Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review shows that 9% of plots in 2023 were raincloud plots. Another 29% of plots (vs. 2% in 2013) contained individual data points (i.e., raindrops), indicating a strong trend towards transparent and informative data visualization. To further encourage this trend and make raincloud plotting easy and practical for a broader group of researchers and students, we implemented a comprehensive suite of raincloud plots in JASP, an open-source statistics program with an intuitive graphical user interface. Examples from two factorial research designs illustrate how the JASP raincloud plots support a correct and comprehensive interpretation of the data."

    "abstract": "This study examines the moderating role of the context of social opinion in hostile media perception and its effect on partisan audiences in polarized politics. An online experiment ( N = 574), conducted in the US, manipulated the number of congruent/incongruent comments and emojis on social media posts discussing abortion (i.e., pro-choice versus pro-life Facebook posts) to create three distinct opinion contexts (i.e., congruent, balanced, and incongruent). The results indicate that perceived bias gaps between pro-attitudinal and counter-attitudinal posts were reduced in the condition of incongruent context. Furthermore, the study found that the incongruent context mitigates discomfort toward out-party supporters and political participation intention through reducing the perceived bias, whereas the congruent context intensifies them. Implications for media bias perceptions and political polarization are discussed in terms of intergroup relations."

    "abstract": "Engagement with political news is vital for promoting civic participation and political knowledge but can negatively affect individuals’ mental health, including provoking anxiety. We examine how exposure to racial discrimination in news coverage (i.e., vicarious discrimination) may contribute to these negative effects among Latinos during the 2020 U.S. election. One hundred and eight Latinos completed daily measurements of political news engagement, vicarious discrimination, and anxiety-related symptoms for 14 days surrounding the election. Using disaggregated multilevel mediation models, we found that, on days when people engaged more with political news, they reported higher anxiety-related symptoms than on days when they engaged less (within-person relationship), but people who engaged more with political news on average did not report higher anxiety-related symptoms relative to those who engaged less with political news on average (between-person relationship). Additionally, the within-person relationship was mediated by experiences of vicarious discrimination, suggesting engaging with political news serves as an important source of exposure to racial discrimination experienced by others."

    "abstract": "Third-party punishment is theorized by some scholars to be essential to the evolution of large-scale cooperation, but empirically, it often fails to bring about its desired effects. Here, we suggest that third-party punishment destabilizes cooperation when third parties have profit motives to punish. Across nine economic games and judgment experiments (including four preregistered studies), we find that when third-party punishment is profitable, rates of cooperation decrease immediately and remain lower even when punishment outcomes are optimized to support cooperative behavior. Profitable third-party punishment causes targets of punishment to anticipate antisocial punishment and perceive social norms in terms of self-interest, suggesting that the introduction of payment degrades the communicative signals that punishment is meant to convey about punishers’ intentions and social norms. Critically, participants who would benefit from increased cooperation inadvertently reduce their own monetary compensation by opting in to experimental conditions that pay punishers, suggesting that they intuitively fail to consider the signaling consequences of profit motives to punish. Implications for systems of punishment and cooperation in real-world contexts are discussed."
