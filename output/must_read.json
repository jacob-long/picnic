    "authors": "Ta’Les Love, Sonya Dal Cin, Apryl Williams",
    "abstract": "Skin tone discrimination—or colorism—is an additional marginalization barrier that People of Color must navigate. Black women, especially those with darker complexions, are often discursively constructed as the antithesis to Western beauty standards—standards that commonly prioritize White femininity as the beauty benchmark. Studies on the beauty influencer economy reveal that Black women remain at a disadvantage in the beauty hierarchy. This study uses a survey experiment to explore how skin tone impacts perceptions of attractiveness and competence among viewers of digital beauty content. Surveying African Americans ( N = 576), primarily Black Women ( n = 524), we found that beauty influencers with darker skin tones are rated as less attractive and less competent. Participants also revealed that they would be less likely to click on the videos of darker skinned beauty influencers in comparison to influencers with lighter brown and medium brown skin tones. These results suggest that, among Black women viewers, preferences for beauty content is skin tone dependent. Because view counts are a significant metric in influencer marketability, viewing disparities along the lines of skin tone have the potential to widen the gap among Black influencers, creating disproportionate opportunities for success within an already marginalized population.",

Likes and affirming replies were commonplace, whereas Dislikes and negation replies were rare. Getting Likes and affirming replies decreased subsequent toxicity in the short term, as did getting no responses whatsoever. Getting Dislikes increased the hatefulness of users’ next original post and their posts over the next 3 months. Results challenge both the social approval theory of online hate and the need-threat approach to effects of responses to social media hate posting.",

We examine themes’ ability to sustain engagement, showing that sexual behavior and market-value topics generate the most replies, while attraction-focused content and deliberative topics generate the fewest. Gender- and norm-related discussions tend to self-reinforce, whereas attraction-related threads diffuse into broader debates. Findings inform the potential and limits of deliberative online spaces to foster cross-cutting engagement, with theoretical and practical implications for facilitating digital conversations and interventions aimed at countering extremist narratives and selective exposure.",

Using automated image analysis of over three million images posted between 2019 and 2022, we identify nine dominant visual frames. “Public Engagement: Politics &amp; Events” was most prevalent, interactive visuals such as memes generated the highest engagement but predominantly negative response in user comments. By contrast, we find more positive responses for solution-focused frames, but lower levels of engagement.

Using network psychometrics on responses from 71,922 individuals in 68 countries, we model trust as an interconnected community system of attitudes and beliefs. Sincerity emerges as the most central node, linking perceptions of competence, integrity, and goodwill. This dynamic structure challenges reflective latent models and emphasizes trust as a product of message framing and credibility cues. Our findings inform science communication theory by reframing trust as an emergent network and offer practical guidance for communicators seeking to design inclusive, trust-enhancing strategies across diverse sociocultural contexts.",

    "authors": "Lanabi La Lova",
    "abstract": "This study investigates Russian television coverage of Ukraine between 2009 and 2019, drawing on a dataset of over 2.3 million news episodes from eight major television networks and one news agency (Interfax), including both state-controlled and relatively independent outlets. Combining natural language processing techniques with a quasi-experimental design, the analysis traces changes in content patterns over time. The results provide strong evidence consistent with the first hypothesis: following a state-enforced management change at RBC TV in 2016, the network increased the share of news coverage primarily focused on Ukraine by up to 40 percent, depending on the assumed treatment date. Evidence for the second hypothesis—which posits that RBC’s reporting would become more similar to state-controlled outlets—remains only partial. Cosine similarity analysis shows that RBC’s content became more similar to several state-controlled outlets while diverging from relatively independent TV Rain (Dozhd). Sentiment-polarity analysis indicates that RBC’s coverage became modestly more negative after the takeover. These findings suggest that content changes following institutional intervention may reflect increased alignment with state-linked narratives while preserving outlet-specific variation. The study contributes to research on media alignment in autocratic contexts by analyzing a single-case pattern and highlights both the potential and limitations of computational text analysis in examining large-scale trends in state media coverage.",

    "abstract": "The success of party elites in nominating their preferred candidate is dependent on their ability to coordinate their efforts in the primary. While party elite coordination failure is not random, we know relatively little about what helps or hinders party coordination. Previous work has suggested, but not tested, that the media environment affects party coordination, either hindering party coordination by removing the monopoly party elites have on early politics or strengthening party coordination by giving party leaders access to media tools that facilitate coordination. I test these arguments using data on party elite coordination in congressional primaries between 2004 and 2020 and measures of media coverage not directly related to primary competition. I show that media focus on local politics in a congressional district substantially increases party coordination. Overall, this work broadens our understanding of the conditions, and specifically the media environments, that facilitate party elite coordination in primary elections.",

    "authors": "Licheng Liu, Teppei Yamamoto",
    "abstract": "Despite the recent methodological advancements in causal panel data analysis, concerns remain about unobserved unit-specific time-varying confounders that cannot be addressed by unit or time fixed effects or their interactions. We develop a Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) method to address the concern. Our proposed method is built upon a general framework combining Rubin’s Bayesian framework for model-based causal inference (Rubin [1978], The Annals of Statistics 6(1), 34–58) with parametric BSA (McCandless, Gustafson, and Levy [2007], Statistics in Medicine 26(11), 2331–2347). We assess the sensitivity of the causal effect estimate from a linear factor model to the possible existence of unobserved unit-specific time-varying confounding, using the coefficients of the treatment variable and observed confounders in the model for the unobserved confounding as sensitivity parameters. We utilize priors on these coefficients to constrain the hypothetical severity of unobserved confounding. Our proposed approach allows researchers to benchmark the assumed strength of confounding on observed confounders more systematically than conventional frequentist sensitivity analysis techniques. Moreover, to cope with convergence issues typically encountered in nonidentified Bayesian models, we develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm exploiting transparent parameterization (Gustafson [2005], Statistical Science 20(2), 111–140). We illustrate our proposed method in a Monte Carlo simulation study as well as an empirical example on the effect of war on inheritance tax rates.",

We also analyze the significance of emotional representation for the targeted group. To accomplish these goals, we examine the degree to which members of Congress mirrored Black people's documented increase in expressions of anger following the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020. Using a regression discontinuity design and the sentiment analysis of 305,358 tweets, 190,192 Facebook Posts, and 35,409 press releases, we show that descriptive representatives provide the highest levels of emotional representation. To examine the impact of emotional representation, we deployed a two‐stage experiment to 390 Black respondents. We find that Black people who increased in anger after being primed with images of police violence view elected officials who engage in emotional representation as more favorable, empathetic, and trustworthy.",

    "abstract": "Hate speech is widely seen as a significant obstacle to constructive online discourse, but the most effective strategies to mitigate its effects remain unclear. We claim that understanding its distribution across users is key to developing and evaluating effective content moderation strategies. We address this missing link by first examining the distribution of hate speech in five original datasets that collect user-generated posts across multiple platforms (social media and online newspapers) and countries (Switzerland and the United States). Across these diverse samples, the vast majority of hate speech is produced by a small fraction of users. Second, results from a pre-registered field experiment on Twitter indicate that counterspeech strategies obtain only small reductions of future hate speech, mainly because this approach proves ineffective against the most prolific contributors of hate. These findings suggest that complementary content moderation strategies may be necessary to effectively address the problem.",

As an exploratory investigation, we evaluate six GPT-4o configurations to analyze sentiment in Fox News and MSNBC transcripts on Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign. By assessing each model’s alignment with partisan perspectives, we explore how partisan selective processing can be identified in LLM-Assisted Content Analysis (LACA). The findings indicate that LLM-based partisan perspective simulations reflect politically polarized standpoints across partisan groups, revealing a pronounced divergence in sentiment analysis between Democrat-aligned and Republican-aligned persona models. This pattern is evident in intercoder-reliability metrics, which are higher among same-partisan than cross-partisan persona model pairs. Results also suggest that LLM partisan simulations exhibit stronger ideological biases when analyzing politically congruent content. This approach enhances the nuanced understanding of LLM outputs and advances the integrity of AI-driven social science research and may also enable simulations of real-world implications.",

    "abstract": "Many people now use AI chatbots to obtain summaries of complex topics, yet we know little about how this affects knowledge acquisition, including how the effects might vary across different groups of people. We conducted two experiments comparing how well people recalled factual information after reading AI-generated or human-written historical summaries. Participants who read AI-generated summaries scored significantly higher on knowledge tests than those who read expert-written blog posts (Study 1) or Wikipedia articles (Study 2). These improvements were present regardless of whether readers knew the content was AI-generated or if the AI summaries were politically biased. Moreover, AI summaries improved recall across various demographic groups, including gender, race, income, education, and digital literacy levels. This suggets that using AI tools for everyday factual queries does not create new knowledge inequalities but could still amplify existing ones through differential access. Our findings indicate that the increasingly routine use of AI for information-seeking could enhance factual learning, with implications for education policy and addressing inequality.",

    "abstract": "Time-series data have become ubiquitous in psychological research, allowing us to study detailed within-person dynamics and their heterogeneity across persons. Vector autoregressive (VAR) models have become a popular choice as a first approximation of these dynamics. The VAR model for each person and heterogeneity across persons can be jointly modeled using a hierarchical model that treats heterogeneity as a latent distribution. Currently, the most popular choice for this is the multilevel VAR model, which models heterogeneity across persons as quantitative variation through a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Here, we discuss an alternative, the latent class VAR model, which models heterogeneity as qualitative variation using a number of discrete clusters. While this model has been introduced before, it has not been readily accessible to researchers. Here we address this issue by providing an accessible introduction to latent class VAR models; a simulation evaluating how well this model can be estimated in situations resembling applied research; introducing a new R package ClusterVAR , which provides easy-to-use functions to estimate the model; and providing a fully reproducible tutorial on modeling emotion dynamics, which walks the reader through all steps of estimating, analyzing, and interpreting latent class VAR models.",

Third, attempts to increase the creativity of LLMs through instructing LLMs to take on genius personas or different demographic roles lifted performance up to a threshold beyond which the output became opposite real-life patterns, whereas strategic prompt-engineering efforts yielded mixed to negative results.
