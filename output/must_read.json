    "abstract": "The diversity of social media platforms has expanded the possibilities for citizens to encounter political content and express political opinions. However, the patterns of users’ contact with political information and political expression across different platforms are largely unclear. Based on survey data from Germany ( n = 1054), this study investigates social media use, exposure to political content, and political expression across nine platforms and presents a typology of political social media users. A cluster analysis identified five user types: Unpolitical Sporadics , Casual Mainstreamers , Twitter-focused Mainstreamers , Expressive Contributors , and Political Activists . Multinomial logistic regressions reveal that these types are associated with different socio-demographic characteristics, political attitudes, and media usage habits. In particular, a small group of users with right-leaning attitudes is very active on all platforms. These Political Activists could potentially contribute to the much-discussed dominance of the political right on social media."

    "abstract": "This study examines the impact of players’ gender and nationality on game performance before and during the Israel-Hamas war. The study focuses on two games for social impact revolving around intractable conflicts: PeaceMaker (Israeli-Palestinian conflict) and Fact Finders (Cyprus Conflict). We conducted three case studies with 510 undergraduates voluntarily playing the aforementioned games and reporting their final scores. The participants included Israeli-Jew, Palestinian, American, and Cypriot undergraduate students. We found that before the Israel-Hamas war, women won PeaceMaker no less than men. Interestingly, during the Israel-Hamas war, women won PeaceMaker more than men. Finally, third-parties to the Cyprus conflict (Israelis, Palestinians and Americans) significantly outperformed direct-parties (Cypriots) in Fact Finders before and during the Israel-Hamas war. Overall this study's findings suggest that serious games can be used as effective interventions for peace education and conflict resolution regardless of players’ gender or nationality, even during violent times."

Following measures of outgroup (Muslim) vitality and ingroup existential identity-uncertainty, Indian Hindu participants ( N = 149) were randomly assigned to read either a leader narrative of ingroup collective victimhood or a pro-diversity narrative. Participants completed measures of leader endorsement and ingroup essentialism of status. Results indicated that support for collective victimhood rhetoric was related to heightened essentialism of ingroup status as naturally endowed. This effect was accentuated under high identity-uncertainty about the ingroup's future. Findings also replicated results from previous research. Identity-uncertainty about the ingroup's (Hindu) religious future mediated the relationship between outgroup (Muslim) vitality and leader support. Support for leader victimhood rhetoric was heightened when identity-uncertainty was high. Implications for populist leader support are discussed, as victimhood rhetoric is central to populist mobilization of followers."

    "abstract": "Abstract: This study develops an affordance framework of mediated support-seeking that integrates research on affordances, attachment, and mediated support-seeking to explore how adults use texting to seek support from romantic partners in hypothetical stressful scenarios. Through a survey, participants in romantic relationships reported their perceived values of affordance for support-seeking and then composed hypothetical text messages to seek support from their partners, in which support-seeking strategies were further coded. The findings indicate that attachment anxiety is positively associated with the perceived value of accessibility and the availability of social cues, while avoidant attachment is negatively correlated with these affordances in the context of support-seeking. Additionally, the perceived value of accessibility is positively associated with direct texting messages, whereas the perceived value of social cues correlates positively with both positive and negative politeness in messaging. These illuminate how support-seeking individuals work with the affordances of texting as they attempt to meet their needs."

    "abstract": "While we know a great deal about the—typically negative—effects of conspiracy beliefs, surprisingly we know little about the interpersonal effects of such beliefs on relationships with non-believers. QAnon-specific research is now leading the way in this regard, with a handful of surveys and interviews beginning to chart how conspiracy beliefs influence relationships with friends, colleagues, and loved ones. This paper advances that progress via a novel (to the field) methodological approach applied to a vast and unique dataset. Using large language model embeddings, and machine learning algorithms, this study categorized—and examined—over 75 thousand unique references to “family” on the public, anonymous reddit forum r/QAnonCasualties, a subreddit dedicated to specifically discussing QAnon’s effects on relationships. The model reveals a range of family discussions, from emotional tolls, and various negative effects, to potential strategies to salvage the family, and the desire to seek refuge in a support network. The results within also shed light not only on what users discuss most frequently, but also what conversations are most popular (i.e. produce upvotes)—navigating pandemic related issues (e.g. COVID-19, masks, vaccinations), holiday gatherings, and problematic social media behavior represent some of the most well-received discussions. Pleas to better understand the effects of conspiracy beliefs on families were also highly prominent, and popular, on the subreddit. Ultimately the goal of this paper is just that, to partially advance our general understanding of conspiracy belief effects on relationships, though with a more narrow focus on specific relationships (i.e. families)."

The participants were 2,150 LBC with siblings. The study identified four profiles: cold–distant, warm–caring, warm–competitive, and intimate–nurturing. The profiles of LBC’s sibling relationships exhibited different characteristics depending on gender, grade, residence, birth order, frequency of parent–child communication, parental differential treatment, and duration of being left-behind. The four profiles differed significantly in terms of psychosocial adaptation. The warm–caring and intimate–nurturing sibling relationships promoted psychosocial adaptation by encouraging social adaptation and self-esteem. In contrast, the cold–distant and warm–competitive sibling relationships were harmful as they induced depression and anxiety."

    "abstract": "One way to cope with crises is by attributing their ultimate causes to malevolent conspiracies. As crises are rarely simple, and may involve an interplay between multiple, co-occurring threats, we suggest that conspiracy thinking mainly occurs among individuals who experience conditions of threat complexity – such as socioeconomic vulnerability paired with a sense of helplessness in society, and who are also sufficiently paranoid to infer a conspiracy. In the present study, we focused on financial strain and disempowerment, as two relevant threats which were both dramatically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and hypothesized a three-way interaction between financial strain, disempowerment and paranoia in predicting conspiracy thinking. This hypothesis was supported in both cross-national ( N = 64,130) and longitudinal data ( N = 11,159), collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications of the results for understanding the tendency to reduce multiple threats to a single cause are discussed."

Using Jackson and Mumma’s (2023) model of multiracial identity, this study explored how positive social media use, friendship self-efficacy, and friendship aid related to multiracial adolescents’ ethnic-racial identity (ERI; exploration, resolution, affirmation) in 128 adolescents (56% female, U.S. sample, Mage = 14.3). Further, we explored if this relation was moderated by parent/child relationship quality. Direct effects evidenced friendship self-efficacy was positively related to all aspects of ERI, friend aid was only related to ERI resolution, parent/child relationship quality related positively to exploration, and positive social media use was negatively related to affirmation. Results showed the relation of friend aid, and positive social media use with ERI resolution was moderated by parent/child relationship quality. Results indicate the significance of parent-child relationships in ERI while also suggesting that friendships and social media may play important roles in understanding the diverse influences on multiracial teens’ identities."

The results indicated minimal Twitter non-use following Musk’s takeover, and full migration was not observed within a 6-month post-acquisition period. Factors such as the flood of fake news and the loss of the blue-tick verification served as push factors, while the appeal of Mastodon’s enhanced user control and stronger community values acted as pull factors. However, the practical reliance on Twitter’s functionalities, audience base, and professional obligations made total abandonment challenging."

In an online between-subjects experiment ( N = 1,843), participants rated scientists who shared their failures as more benevolent and open, and as having more integrity, than those who only shared their successes. These perceptions further increased support for science and information-seeking intentions. The findings highlight how scientists’ self-presentation on social media can influence important science communication outcomes."

Concurrently, legacy news media outlets are losing their position as the main fora for discussing and providing information on science and politics. In the hybrid media system, a broader range of news media have emerged. Among them are alternative news media, which position themselves as corrective voices to “mainstream” news media—including when it comes to reporting on science. In this context, our focus is on individuals who come into contact with science-related information via alternative news media. We draw on the “Science Barometer Switzerland,” a nationally representative online survey of attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about science and research in Switzerland conducted in 2022 ( n = 1,122), to investigate science- and media-related predictors of the use of alternative news media to access information about science. Our results indicate that the clear majority—more than two-thirds—of the Swiss population do not use alternative news media as sources of science-related information. Respondents who do use alternative news media were more confident about their scientific and media literacy and viewed themselves as information elites who are highly skeptical of established societal elites. However, they do not seem to reject the scientific system in principle."

While formal bonds have vanished, parallelism in news content might still remain; for instance, in a tendency to report more often and more favorably on parties that align with the political leaning of a newspaper. In this article, we ask whether political parallelism exists in newspapers today, and whether or not it has decreased over the last two decades. These questions are answered using a dataset of 5.4 million newspaper articles from three countries (Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) over 20 years, annotated with the presence of political parties, and the sentiment of party news, at the sentence level. Findings suggest that newspapers pay more attention to the mainstream party with which they share political leaning, but that this pattern of parallelism has weakened over time."

    "abstract": "If media outlets influence voters, media elites could hold disproportionate sway over elections. However, little is known about the paths through which these outlets influence voting behavior. Based on spatial voting theory, I argue that ideological media exposure alters two key mediators — ideological positions and perceptions of party positions — to influence voting behavior. The literature on media effects often assumes that the former is the mediator and ignores the latter. This study examines the effects of ideological media exposure on these two potential mediators and on voting behavior. However, it is difficult to study these relationships because audiences usually select like-minded media content, which introduces reverse causality. To address this endogeneity, I use a quasi-experiment: Liverpool’s longstanding boycott of the popular right-wing British tabloid newspaper, The Sun . This was an exogenous boycott that was not caused by political factors. Rather, it was due to The Sun falsely blaming the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster on Liverpool Football Club supporters. I estimate triple differences for the effect of this boycott on lower working-class respondents (who complied with the boycott much more than others) in Liverpool. The results indicate that media outlets influence ideological positions, perceptions of party positions, and, ultimately, voting behavior. The effect of media on perceived party positions appears to be particularly powerful and may indicate that it is an important mediator. Thus, this study provides timely and relevant insights about the specific ways in which media outlets influence elections."

In this paper, we provide a tutorial on conducting simulation-based power analyses for ROC curve and (p)AUC analyses in R. We also created a Shiny app and the R package “ ROCpower ” to perform such power analyses. In our tutorial, we highlight the importance of setting the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) for which researchers want to conduct their power analysis. The SESOI is the smallest effect that is practically or theoretically relevant for a specific field of research or study. We provide how such a SESOI can be established and how it changes hypotheses from simply establishing whether there is a statistically significant effect (i.e., null-hypothesis significance testing) to whether the effects are practically or theoretically important (i.e., minimum-effect testing) or whether the effect is too small to care about (i.e., equivalence testing). We show how power analyses for these different hypothesis tests can be conducted via a confidence interval-focused approach. This confidence interval-focused, simulation-based power analysis can be adapted to different research designs and questions and improves the reproducibility of power analyses."
