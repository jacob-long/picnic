    "abstract": "We develop an integrative conceptual framework and research agenda for studying epistemic authorities in the digital age. Consulting epistemic authorities (e.g., professional experts, well-informed laypeople, technologies) can be an efficient fast-track to knowledge. To fulfill this functional role, those who claim epistemic authority need to be both subjectively recognized (have a perceived advantage in knowledge) and objectively justified (have an actual advantage in knowledge). In a digital media context, new and unconventional knowledge sources have emerged that can fulfill the functional role of epistemic authorities. But false authorities that disseminate misinformation have emerged as well while other sources with important knowledge remain unrecognized. We further analyze the functional role of epistemic intermediaries that can mitigate such problematic developments by correcting false authorities and by providing endorsement for unrecognized authorities. We conclude with a research agenda to study functional forms of epistemic authorities and epistemic intermediaries in the digital public sphere."

    "abstract": "Communication researchers have long sought to situate or contextualize media behaviors in their natural settings. However, the many approaches taken to understand media behavior in context have varied considerably. This article proposes a metatheoretical framework for theorizing media behavior at the situational level, encompassing the entirety of circumstances surrounding a media behavior at a given moment. The framework describes how psychological states, environmental context, and media context combine to shape moment-to-moment media behavior. We then describe how situational factors have the potential to interact with the three phases of media behavior—i.e., selection, processing, and disengagement—in distinctive ways. We argue that communication researchers only gain the ability to explain the variability in media behavior by taking the situational level into account. We conclude by providing future theoretical and empirical directions to guide the field in building a more generalizable and durable understanding of situated media behavior."

However, the effectiveness of AI augmentation remains controversial. This study investigates whether, how and why AI enhances human agents’ sales through a randomized field experiment. Design/methodology/approach This study conducts a two-by-two factorial randomized field experiment ( N  = 1,090) to investigate the effects of AI augmentation on sales. The experiment compares sales outcomes handled solely by human agents with those augmented by AI, while also examining the moderating effect of agents’ experience levels and the underlying mechanisms behind agents’ responses. Findings The results reveal that AI augmentation leads to a significant 5.46% increase in sales. Notably, the impact of AI augmentation varies based on agents’ experience levels, with inexperienced agents benefiting nearly six times more than their experienced counterparts. Mediation analysis shows that AI augmentation improves response timeliness, accuracy and sentiment, thereby boosting sales. Originality/value This study highlights the role of AI augmentation in human–AI collaboration, demonstrates the varying impacts of AI augmentation based on agents’ experience levels and offers insights for organizations on how to regulate AI augmentation to enhance agent responses and drive sales."

    "abstract": "Political satire is often believed to enrich the public sphere in ways distinct from traditional journalism. This study examines whether deliberative qualities of online political talk in response to satire differ from those in response to regular news or partisan news. The analysis focuses on four normative standards: interactivity, diversity, rationality, and civility. A manual content analysis of YouTube comments (n = 2,447) reveals that the public sphere surrounding political satire shows a notable strength: Less incivility, both in terms of impoliteness and intolerance. Surprisingly, aside from this, satire’s public sphere did not differ much from that of regular news. Comments on partisan news were more opinionated and ideologically diverse. These findings suggest that online political talk prompted by satire is not inferior to that of traditional news. Additionally, this study highlights how the presence of different normative standards is often interconnected."

This article theorizes about expertise tension that arises when individuals with valuable insights lack corresponding authority to act, or vice versa. Using observations and interviews, we studied how physicians and nurses navigated this tension in problem-solving situations in a hospital emergency department. We found that nurses, who identified emergent problems, simultaneously asserted their situational authority and displayed a veneer of deference by asking physicians, “What do you want to do [in this situation]?” The question prompted one of three problem-solving activities (i.e., instruction by demand, reversed instruction, and collaborative improvisation) depending on the situation’s urgency and ambiguity. We discuss how nurses and physicians managed expertise tension without undermining their different claims to expertise and authority, highlighting the value of a communication-centered view in examining such dynamics."

We examine whether this bias is exhibited toward virtual assistants, specifically, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant, with various accents. We conducted three studies with different stimuli and designs to investigate U.S. English speakers’ attitudes toward Google's British, Indian, and American voices and Apple's Irish, Indian, South African, British, Australian, and American voices. Analysis reveals consistently lower fluency ratings for Irish, Indian, and South African voices (compared with American) but no consistent results of bias related to competence, warmth, or willingness to interact. Moreover, participants often misidentified voices’ countries of origin but correctly identified them as artificial. We conclude that this overall lack of bias may be due to two possibilities: lack of humanlikeness of the voices and lack of availability of nonstandardized voices and voices from countries toward which those in the United States typically show bias."

Collecting all created and engaged posts ( n = 31,084) from 102 lesbian gamers in both lesbian gamer and female gamer groups, this research utilizes structural topic modeling to delineate their productive and consumptive curation across different groups. The results indicate that lesbian gamers often prioritize discussions on women and queer issues within the female gamer community while presenting a more gamer-centric identity in the lesbian gamer community. Group-swinging emerges as an optimal strategy for exploring a balance between belongingness and distinctiveness, enabling lesbian gamers to navigate their multiple minority identities effectively. This study enriches the understanding of identity curation and optimal distinctiveness theory, offering plausible strategies for the online resilience of marginalized groups within the polymedia context."

In France, a movement to denounce gynaecological and obstetrical violence is expressed through a massive publication of testimonies on social networks. Via a socio-representational approach and from a critical gender perspective, this article aims to explore how people use digital media to communicate about the GE, and to analyse the experiences related to the GE and the representation systems underlying them. Using an inductive strategy, a corpus of discussion from the Doctissimo forum, and testimonies and comments from the PayeTonGynéco Facebook pages and Tumblr was created and submitted to lexicographical analysis. Our results suggest that the GE is indicative of a broader social function. People seem to use digital media to cope with a form of social ignorance of women’s experience in gynaecology with a certain ambivalence regarding their liberating potential."

Two studies in the U.S. across both non-election and election settings test the centrality of political discussion on social media with strong and weak ties in explaining this relationship. Findings across both studies show no significant direct associations between incidental news exposure and political knowledge. However, mediation analyses suggest that incidental news exposure can influence political knowledge when mediated by interpersonal political conversations on social media: discussions with strong ties contribute to political knowledge, but discussions with weak ties are detrimental. Furthermore, the indirect effects via strong and weak ties are significantly conditioned by one’s cognitive ability. The findings highlight the conditions under which incidental news exposure helps yet also hinders individuals’ political knowledge."

An analysis of the content, form, and stance of 250 videos revealed that creators of PoV memes lip-sync to audio remediated from pop culture and mimic how they imagine “you” would act in a given scenario. I offer the concept of “echoic affiliation” to describe how PoV memes leverage TikTok’s “use this sound” function to construct ephemeral bonds between users. Furthermore, PoV memes textually articulate multiple perspectives, producing intersubjective encounters that reflect a platform imaginary in which “the algorithm” efficiently clusters similar people on the same “side” of the app. In the conclusions, I present a novel definition of PoV memes and reflect on the pivotal role of affiliation for TikTok’s platform vernacular."

From a multimodal perspective, we conducted an online experiment ( N = 799) to investigate how multimodal hate speech (i.e., text and images presented together to convey hateful meanings) on social media affected users’ prejudicial attitudes and prosocial behavioral intentions. The results showed that participants in the text-plus-image (vs. text-only) condition felt more sympathy, which led to less implicit prejudice toward the target group and more prosocial behavioral intentions. In addition, exposure to text-plus-image hate speech had an indirect effect on prosocial behavioral intentions through sympathy and implicit prejudice. The findings contribute to scholarship on online hate speech and provide insights into the affect heuristics that individuals rely on when processing multimodal information."

This article examines the role of users in interactive media by exploring the case of webtoons in the context of a changing global political economy and cultural dominance. Korean platform monopolies have established a new business model for webtoons and developed it as a center of Korean creative power. While webtoons have increasingly expanded and attracted the global market and the global audience, some persistent social issues remain, including the precarious labor structure, monopolistic power in the industry, and ideological dominance in content. Although webtoon viewers are often recognized as cultural intermediaries and powerful agents for their contributions to interactive creativity, their role has fluctuated according to changing political-economic structures and industrial strategies. In the course of expanding to the global market and to new business areas such as intellectual property (IP), webtoons have evolved in new fashions while disclosing the ambivalent nature of participatory media and digital interactivity. This article elucidates the double faces of interactive creativity focusing on viewers’ participation in webtoon production in the context of changing webtoon industry and growing partnership with global media."

Our experimental survey demonstrated that bots and human actors who confront a corporation touting their commitment to equality by calling out organizational pay gaps damage perceptions of the corporation, heighten anger toward them, and ultimately can elicit boycott intentions. These hypocrisy challenges are equally effective when they come from bots and user accounts. Challenges to hypocritical behavior on social media are consequential and require further exploration."

    "abstract": "Media criticism is a crucial part of meta-journalistic discourse, ensuring that journalists adhere to their democratic functions, such as informing citizens in an honest and complete manner. However, the profession increasingly faces hostile, nonevidence-based attacks from politicians that attempt to strategically fuel distrust among citizens and delegitimize opposed viewpoints. Despite this reality, we lack a systematic overview of the boundaries between constructive feedback and weaponized attacks in media criticism. To address this gap, we inductively analyzed how media criticism is represented within the social media discourse of ten German politicians from all major parties. Using a grounded theory approach, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of a subset of their tweets from 2015, 2017, and 2022 that contain media criticism ( N = 545), mapping the types and severity of the criticism, the construction of opposing narratives, and the explicitness of references to facticity over opinions. We identified four themes within media criticism discourse, ranging from misinformation attributions to severe accusations of the intentional distortion of reality through the media. Politicians (strategically) employ a wide range of media criticism and inaccuracy claims beyond judgments of facticity with differing degrees of severity for the profession. Based on our findings, we propose a typology of media criticism from political elites that adds nuance to our understanding regarding the boundaries between supportive and disruptive criticism for journalism."

    "abstract": "While researchers have some recommendations for measuring gender identity in surveys based on research and other sources that are summarized in a series of working group and panel reports, we continue to refine our understanding and practices. Gender identity is usually measured in surveys using a categorical selection response format with a small number of response options (e.g., “female,” “male,” “nonbinary”) and an open text response field to capture additional responses (“not listed, please tell us”). There is limited research guiding researchers on the use of other response formats. This study reports results from a between-subjects experiment embedded in a campus climate survey about university students’ attitudes about their campus and their behaviors and experiences related to inclusion and belonging at a large Midwestern university in 2021. Over 13,000 students were asked “What is your gender?” and subsequently randomly assigned to respond using either a categorical selection response format or an open response format (i.e., a place to specify their gender with no response options listed). We examine the distribution of responses, item nonresponse, response times, and concurrent validity (in terms of the association between gender and relevant survey outcomes) across the two response formats. Findings indicate the categorical selection response format is preferred for this population. While results show similar distributions in the categorization of responses across the formats and similar relationships with other survey outcomes, the selection format is associated with less item nonresponse and shorter response times."

Despite their importance, strikingly little work in the domain of organization and management research has tapped into this source of longitudinal big data. In this paper, we highlight the unique nature and profound potential of longitudinal website data and present novel open-source code- and databases that make these data accessible. Specifically, our codebase offers a general-purpose setup, building on four central steps to scrape historical websites using the Wayback Machine. Our open-access CompuCrawl database was built using this four-step approach. It contains websites of North American firms in the Compustat database between 1996 and 2020—covering 11,277 firms with 86,303 firm/year observations and 1,617,675 webpages. We describe the coverage of our database and illustrate its use by applying word-embedding models to reveal the evolving meaning of the concept of “sustainability” over time. Finally, we outline several avenues for future research enabled by our step-by-step longitudinal web scraping approach and our CompuCrawl database."

In this work, we illustrate use of a new regulatory framework to enable computational research on film that permits circumvention of technological protection measures on digital video discs (DVDs). We use this exemption to legally digitize a collection of 2,307 films representing the top 50 movies by U.S. box office over the period 1980 to 2022, along with award nominees. We design a computational pipeline for measuring the representation of gender and race/ethnicity in film, drawing on computer vision models for recognizing actors and human perceptions of gender and race/ethnicity. Doing so allows us to learn substantive facts about representation and diversity in Hollywood over this period, confirming earlier studies that see an increase in diversity over the past decade, while allowing us to use computational methods to uncover a range of ad hoc analytical findings. Our work illustrates the affordances of the data-driven analysis of film at a large scale."

We study at different levels of aggregation (sample clusters, strata, and national) the associations between ideal family size and completed cohort fertility for education groups, on the one hand, and the average level of education in those units, on the other. The consistently very strong empirical associations suggest a plausible narrative by which a higher prevalence of educated women in a spatial unit influences the fertility levels of women in all specific education categories. Empirical associations between education-specific cohort fertility trends at the national level and newly available quality-adjusted human capital data for these cohorts are then operationalized to produce education-specific population projections as they are needed for—among other uses—the shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios that are widely used in the climate change research community. Sensitivity analyses including out-of-sample projections support the validity of the proposed method which is then applied to 37 African countries."

    "abstract": "It has been widely recognized that technologies evolve with recombinant inventions. However, it remains unknown whether technologies developed using different approaches would exhibit different features during evolution. In particular, would technologies developed mainly based on accumulated experience in practices—formulas of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are typical examples of such technologies—have similar evolution features found in modern technologies? This study applied network science to explore the evolution of TCM from the perspective of recombinant inventions based on 59,063 TCM formulas documented over the last two thousand years, with each formula being a combination of components that are mostly herbs. Our results show that similar to modern technological systems, the TCM component networks maintained the core–periphery structures during evolution, and the (weighted) degrees of components followed heavy-tailed distributions. Moreover, simple tuples, which are frequently used combinations of TCM components, serve as building blocks for complex ones. A significant difference with modern technological systems is that the TCM core components were quite stable, while substitutions of core components are frequently observed in modern technological systems, leading to new technological trajectories. TCM comprises ancient knowledge and wisdom. This research provides insight into how it will be like in the future and what is important for its future."

    "abstract": "The “27 Club” refers to the widespread legend that notable people, particularly musicians, are unusually likely to die at age 27. A 2011 inquiry in The BMJ showed this is not the case, dismissing the 27 Club as a myth. We expand on this discourse by demonstrating that although the existence of the phenomenon cannot be empirically validated, it is real in its consequences. Using Wikipedia data, we show that while age 27 does not hold greater risk of mortality for notable persons, those who died at 27 are as a group exceptionally notable compared to those who died at other young ages. The 27 Club legend originated from a statistically improbable event circa 1970, wherein four superstar musicians died within the span of 2 y all at age 27. This coincidence captured the public imagination such that our fascination with the 27 Club brought itself into being, producing greater interest in those who died at age 27 than would have been otherwise. This demonstrates path dependence in cultural evolution, whereby an effectively random event evolves into a narrative that shapes otherwise unrelated events and thus the way we make and interpret history."
