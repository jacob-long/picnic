    "abstract": "This meta-analysis reviews the findings from 26 studies ( N = 8,061) examining the association between children feeling caught between parents (also referred to as parent-child triangulation) and parent-child relationship quality. The cumulative evidence indicated a small but meaningful inverse relationship between children feeling caught and relationship quality with parents ( r = −.218, 95% CI: −.260, −.175). The overall effect was heterogenous. Moderator analyses revealed that the inverse association was stronger in studies using non-U.S. samples ( k = 4, r = −.332, 95% CI: −.419, −.239) compared with U.S. samples ( k = 22, r = −.197, 95% CI: −.237, −.155). Conversely, the association was not moderated by the divorce status of the parents, the Whiteness of the samples, gender of the children, measures of feeling caught and relationship quality, or by research design. Implications for family systems theory are discussed."

A total of 118 participants (72 women, 41 men; age range: 18–34 years; M = 25.11, SD = 4.33) were included, who were current or recent dating app users. Gender differences in dating app use and their impact on body image outcomes, including appearance-based rejection sensitivity, body appreciation, weight control behaviours, and cosmetic surgery acceptance, were examined. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between dating app use and body image outcomes with broad differences between two genders, women and men, indicating different appearance pressures and appearance-modification strategies related to dating app use. Regression analyses identified perceived success as a consistent predictor of all body image outcomes for women, highlighting the role of societal standards and social validation in shaping self-perception. These findings suggest that appearance centred media such as dating apps play a significant role in body image outcomes, particularly for women, and highlight the importance of considering protective filtering and intervention mechanisms on dating apps or for dating app users."

    "abstract": "Depression and loneliness are major threats to health in midlife and older adulthood, carrying substantial mental and physical consequences. Although they frequently co-occur, they are conceptually distinct: depression reflects a broader pattern of psychological distress, whereas loneliness captures the subjective perception of social disconnection. Few studies have simultaneously examined multiple relational dimensions in relation to these outcomes, particularly in non-Western contexts. This study applied network analysis to investigate how diverse features of social relationships—including network size, contact frequency, social engagement, perceived support and strain, and relationship quality—relate to loneliness and depression in South Korean adults aged 40–69 years ( N = 502, M = 54.4; 49.4% male). The network revealed that loneliness was most strongly linked to friend network size, marital quality, and friendship quality and was positively associated with friend and spousal strain. Depression was directly connected to loneliness and marital quality, while indirectly shaped by broader relational features, including friend network size and dynamics within friendships and marriages. Centrality analyses highlighted the pivotal role of emotionally meaningful ties—particularly with spouses and friends—in shaping these outcomes. Gender-stratified networks further showed that women’s outcomes were more closely tied to the quality of close relationships, whereas men’s were more strongly linked to broader social participation. Together, these findings underscore the interdependent and multidimensional nature of social relationships in midlife and older adulthood, extend evidence to a non-Western context, and suggest that strengthening intimate ties and opportunities for meaningful engagement may help reduce loneliness and depression."

    "abstract": "Skin tone discrimination—or colorism—is an additional marginalization barrier that People of Color must navigate. Black women, especially those with darker complexions, are often discursively constructed as the antithesis to Western beauty standards—standards that commonly prioritize White femininity as the beauty benchmark. Studies on the beauty influencer economy reveal that Black women remain at a disadvantage in the beauty hierarchy. This study uses a survey experiment to explore how skin tone impacts perceptions of attractiveness and competence among viewers of digital beauty content. Surveying African Americans ( N = 576), primarily Black Women ( n = 524), we found that beauty influencers with darker skin tones are rated as less attractive and less competent. Participants also revealed that they would be less likely to click on the videos of darker skinned beauty influencers in comparison to influencers with lighter brown and medium brown skin tones. These results suggest that, among Black women viewers, preferences for beauty content is skin tone dependent. Because view counts are a significant metric in influencer marketability, viewing disparities along the lines of skin tone have the potential to widen the gap among Black influencers, creating disproportionate opportunities for success within an already marginalized population."

    "abstract": "Interest in two‐person interaction scenarios has increased substantially over the prior decades, and a multitude of analytic approaches have been developed to accommodate these designs. Although the Actor‐Partner model has received the most attention, useful variations on the Common Fate Model (CFM) for dyadic analysis have emerged. Specifically, the Between‐Within CFM (BW‐CFM) has arisen as a compelling approach, as it produces a Dyad‐level coefficient representing the between‐dyads effect, within‐dyad coefficients at the Person‐level, and allows for the estimation of contextual effects. Although the basic configuration of the BW‐CFM is well understood, several configurations of the model that accommodate different patterns of Person‐level relationships remain unexplored. The present work examines specifications of the BW‐CFM that are likely to arise in real‐world analysis, describes a procedure for selecting the optimal specification of Person‐level parameters and illustrates the application of a procedure for quantifying the degree of model selection uncertainty."

Using automated image analysis of over three million images posted between 2019 and 2022, we identify nine dominant visual frames. “Public Engagement: Politics &amp; Events” was most prevalent, interactive visuals such as memes generated the highest engagement but predominantly negative response in user comments. By contrast, we find more positive responses for solution-focused frames, but lower levels of engagement. These results underscore the value of automated image analysis in uncovering culturally nuanced patterns in visual climate communication."

Using network psychometrics on responses from 71,922 individuals in 68 countries, we model trust as an interconnected community system of attitudes and beliefs. Sincerity emerges as the most central node, linking perceptions of competence, integrity, and goodwill. This dynamic structure challenges reflective latent models and emphasizes trust as a product of message framing and credibility cues. Our findings inform science communication theory by reframing trust as an emergent network and offer practical guidance for communicators seeking to design inclusive, trust-enhancing strategies across diverse sociocultural contexts."

    "abstract": "This study investigates Russian television coverage of Ukraine between 2009 and 2019, drawing on a dataset of over 2.3 million news episodes from eight major television networks and one news agency (Interfax), including both state-controlled and relatively independent outlets. Combining natural language processing techniques with a quasi-experimental design, the analysis traces changes in content patterns over time. The results provide strong evidence consistent with the first hypothesis: following a state-enforced management change at RBC TV in 2016, the network increased the share of news coverage primarily focused on Ukraine by up to 40 percent, depending on the assumed treatment date. Evidence for the second hypothesis—which posits that RBC’s reporting would become more similar to state-controlled outlets—remains only partial. Cosine similarity analysis shows that RBC’s content became more similar to several state-controlled outlets while diverging from relatively independent TV Rain (Dozhd). Sentiment-polarity analysis indicates that RBC’s coverage became modestly more negative after the takeover. These findings suggest that content changes following institutional intervention may reflect increased alignment with state-linked narratives while preserving outlet-specific variation. The study contributes to research on media alignment in autocratic contexts by analyzing a single-case pattern and highlights both the potential and limitations of computational text analysis in examining large-scale trends in state media coverage."

To bring new and stronger evidence to this debate, we conducted a series of pre-registered studies during the 2024 European Parliament elections in Germany, Italy, and France. In this paper, we report results for the highest-powered VAA encouragement experiment to date (total n = 6,501) and a novel regression discontinuity design around VAA recommendation thresholds ( n = 10,535). While we observe null effects of VAA usage on voter turnout, the frequency of vote switching, and political knowledge, we find that our VAAs significantly improved the quality of vote switching: users were more likely to vote for their ideologically most aligned party. Based on these findings and a rich battery of supplementary analyses, we conclude that VAAs are effective precisely for their intended purpose: to help voters make better-informed vote choices."

Key to that success, arguably, is news media attention. Is the media attention that niche parties receive affected by mainstream parties as well? In this paper, we combine news value theory with party competition theory to argue that other parties influence niche party visibility. Focusing on green parties in 11 countries between 1992 and 2021, we find evidence that the salience of green policies in mainstream parties’ manifestoes enhance green party visibility in newspapers if these parties take an adversarial position. This positive effect turns negative as the mainstream party becomes greener, which suggests that it steals a niche party’s thunder. The insight that mainstream parties can influence media attention to niche parties opens up new lines of research on the emergence of niche parties."

    "abstract": "Despite the recent methodological advancements in causal panel data analysis, concerns remain about unobserved unit-specific time-varying confounders that cannot be addressed by unit or time fixed effects or their interactions. We develop a Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) method to address the concern. Our proposed method is built upon a general framework combining Rubin’s Bayesian framework for model-based causal inference (Rubin [1978], The Annals of Statistics 6(1), 34–58) with parametric BSA (McCandless, Gustafson, and Levy [2007], Statistics in Medicine 26(11), 2331–2347). We assess the sensitivity of the causal effect estimate from a linear factor model to the possible existence of unobserved unit-specific time-varying confounding, using the coefficients of the treatment variable and observed confounders in the model for the unobserved confounding as sensitivity parameters. We utilize priors on these coefficients to constrain the hypothetical severity of unobserved confounding. Our proposed approach allows researchers to benchmark the assumed strength of confounding on observed confounders more systematically than conventional frequentist sensitivity analysis techniques. Moreover, to cope with convergence issues typically encountered in nonidentified Bayesian models, we develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm exploiting transparent parameterization (Gustafson [2005], Statistical Science 20(2), 111–140). We illustrate our proposed method in a Monte Carlo simulation study as well as an empirical example on the effect of war on inheritance tax rates."

Yet, the link between micro‐level mechanisms and macro‐level phenomena remains unclear. We investigated the consequences of individuals striving for cognitive coherence in their belief systems on political polarization in society in an agent‐based model. In this, we formalized how cognitive coherence affects how individuals update their beliefs following social influence and self‐reflection processes. We derive agents' political beliefs as well as their subjective belief systems, defining what determines coherence for different individuals, from European Social Survey data via correlational class analysis. The simulation shows that agents polarize in their beliefs when they have a strong strive for cognitive coherence, and especially when they have structurally different belief systems. In a mathematical analysis, we not only explain the main findings but also underscore the necessity of simulations for understanding the complex dynamics of socially embedded phenomena such as political polarization."

Using a regression discontinuity design and the sentiment analysis of 305,358 tweets, 190,192 Facebook Posts, and 35,409 press releases, we show that descriptive representatives provide the highest levels of emotional representation. To examine the impact of emotional representation, we deployed a two‐stage experiment to 390 Black respondents.

Using the unexpected collapse of Lehman Brothers (15 September 2008) as a case, we analyze European Social Survey data from six countries and find that while satisfaction with national economies declined, satisfaction with governments gradually rose. We document that rising media and political attention coincided with a rally effect fueled by past opposition voters and muted opposition elites. These findings demonstrate that foreign economic shocks influence democratic accountability and the ability of governments to act during hard times."

We claim that understanding its distribution across users is key to developing and evaluating effective content moderation strategies. We address this missing link by first examining the distribution of hate speech in five original datasets that collect user-generated posts across multiple platforms (social media and online newspapers) and countries (Switzerland and the United States). Across these diverse samples, the vast majority of hate speech is produced by a small fraction of users. Second, results from a pre-registered field experiment on Twitter indicate that counterspeech strategies obtain only small reductions of future hate speech, mainly because this approach proves ineffective against the most prolific contributors of hate. These findings suggest that complementary content moderation strategies may be necessary to effectively address the problem."

Our thesis is that, irrespective of the direction of the policy (progressive or conservative), nativists express selective support for policies based on different signals of group-identity: descriptive markers, group-based substantive representation, in- and out-group norms, and group-based reasoning. We test this theoretical expectation using a novel AI-powered visual conjoint experiment in the Netherlands and Germany that asked individuals to select between hypothetical educational reform proposals presented by civic actors during a public consultation. Empirically, our results demonstrate that citizens, on average, are indeed selectively (il)liberal and that this instrumental policy support is greater among those with higher levels of underlying nativism. Specifically, we show that—among our multidimensional markers of group-based identities, norms, and reasoning—group-based substantive representation and in-group norms are the strongest determinants of support for diverse reform proposals. These findings have key implications on the malleable nature of citizens’ support for the backsliding of the liberal tenets of democracy as well as the persuasive power of out-group disidentification ."

Respondents were prompted to write about one of two common types of poor government performance—corruption or unemployment. In addition, we asked respondents to write about corruption as generated either by elites or by the system of government generally. Our outcome, support for democracy, is measured using questions about commonly eroded democratic practices and about democracy generally (labeled “conceptual democracy”). We find that the writing primes reduce support for conceptual democracy but did not reduce support for specific democratic practices like civil liberties or institutional checks on executives. These findings show that in addition to factors like partisanship and elite rhetoric, government performance plays an important role in shaping public support for democracy in nuanced ways."

In this paper, we utilize a range of data sources, including a novel one, namely the Central Job Offers Database, which is a register of all vacancies submitted to Public Employment Offices. Their staff members code the vacancies according to the ISCO and KZiS. A hierarchical multi-class classifier has been developed based on the transformer architecture. The classifier begins by encoding the jobs found in advertisements to the widest 1-digit occupational group, and then narrows the assignment to a 6-digit occupation code. We show that incorporation of the hierarchical structure of occupations improves prediction accuracy by 1 to 2 percentage points, particularly for the hand-coded online job advertisements. Finally, a bilingual (Polish and English) and multilingual (twenty-four languages) model is developed based on data translated using closed and open-source software. The open-source software is provided for the benefit of the official statistics community, with a particular focus on international comparability."

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which contains both measured and self-reported health information, we used conditional linear regression trees (CLRT) to assess differential measurement error across several chronic health conditions and risk factors, where measurement error is defined as differences between self-reported and measured (e.g., gold standard or objective) health outcomes or behaviors. Using data on four health conditions/behaviors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and current smoking) from NHANES (2015 through March 2020), we assessed differences between self-reported and measured outcomes by various sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, health insurance, and poverty). We used CLRTs via the “rpms” package in R to identify demographic subgroups with larger differences between self-reported and measured health conditions/behaviors. Identifying subgroups where measurement error may be larger or smaller could help inform future work on improving the estimation of the prevalence of chronic conditions and health behaviors."

    "abstract": "This study attempts to advance automated content analysis from consensus-oriented to coordination-oriented practices, thereby embracing diverse coding outputs and exploring the dynamics among differential perspectives. As an exploratory investigation, we evaluate six GPT-4o configurations to analyze sentiment in Fox News and MSNBC transcripts on Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign. By assessing each model’s alignment with partisan perspectives, we explore how partisan selective processing can be identified in LLM-Assisted Content Analysis (LACA). The findings indicate that LLM-based partisan perspective simulations reflect politically polarized standpoints across partisan groups, revealing a pronounced divergence in sentiment analysis between Democrat-aligned and Republican-aligned persona models. This pattern is evident in intercoder-reliability metrics, which are higher among same-partisan than cross-partisan persona model pairs. Results also suggest that LLM partisan simulations exhibit stronger ideological biases when analyzing politically congruent content. This approach enhances the nuanced understanding of LLM outputs and advances the integrity of AI-driven social science research and may also enable simulations of real-world implications."

    "abstract": "Many people now use AI chatbots to obtain summaries of complex topics, yet we know little about how this affects knowledge acquisition, including how the effects might vary across different groups of people. We conducted two experiments comparing how well people recalled factual information after reading AI-generated or human-written historical summaries. Participants who read AI-generated summaries scored significantly higher on knowledge tests than those who read expert-written blog posts (Study 1) or Wikipedia articles (Study 2). These improvements were present regardless of whether readers knew the content was AI-generated or if the AI summaries were politically biased. Moreover, AI summaries improved recall across various demographic groups, including gender, race, income, education, and digital literacy levels. This suggets that using AI tools for everyday factual queries does not create new knowledge inequalities but could still amplify existing ones through differential access. Our findings indicate that the increasingly routine use of AI for information-seeking could enhance factual learning, with implications for education policy and addressing inequality."

    "abstract": "Many behavioral scientists do not agree on core constructs and how they should be measured. Different literatures measure related constructs, but the connections are not always obvious to readers and meta-analysts. Many measures in behavioral science are based on agreement with survey items. Because these items are sentences, computerized language models can make connections between disparate measures and constructs and help researchers regain an overview over the rapidly growing, fragmented literature. Our fine-tuned language model, the SurveyBot3000, accurately predicts the correlations between survey items, the reliability of aggregated measurement scales, and intercorrelations between scales from item positions in semantic vector space. We measured the model’s performance as the convergence between its synthetic model estimates and empirical coefficients observed in human data. In our pilot study, the out-of-sample accuracy was .71 for item correlations, .89 for reliabilities, and .89 for scale correlations. In our preregistered validation study using novel items, the out-of-sample accuracy was slightly reduced to .59 for item correlations, .84 for reliabilities, and .84 for scale correlations. The synthetic item correlations showed an average prediction error of .17, and there were larger errors for middling correlations. Predictions exhibited generalizability beyond the training data and across various domains, with some variability in accuracy. Our work shows language models can reliably predict psychometric relationships between survey items, enabling researchers to evaluate new measures against existing scales, reduce redundancy in measurement, and work toward a more unified behavioral-science taxonomy."

    "abstract": "Eye tracking in reading research requires high spatial accuracy due to small, densely arranged areas of interest. However, despite widespread use of pupil-based eye trackers in reading studies, a major source of systematic inaccuracy remains largely unaddressed: the pupil size artifact (PSA) – apparent gaze shift in fact caused by pupil dilation even when the eye remains stationary. Using pupillary light reflex manipulations and reading tasks under controlled luminance, we quantified gaze inaccuracy due to the PSA and compared correction methods. We observed systematic apparent gaze shift of up to 2 $$^{\\circ }$$ ∘ as pupil sizes varied from 2 to 6 mm. Horizontal PSA showed contralateral patterns (median slopes: 0.38 $$^{\\circ }$$ ∘ /mm), while vertical PSA increased with pupil size (up to 0.86 $$^{\\circ }$$ ∘ /mm for larger pupils). Even under constant luminance, pupil size varied substantially during reading (median 95% ranges 0.78–1.38 mm). We compared two correction approaches: line assignment (standard in reading research) and PSA recalibration (modeling pupil-size-induced apparent gaze shift across the screen). Both methods effectively corrected vertical apparent gaze shift, showing similar average correction offsets and sensitivity of correction to pupil size, suggesting that line assignment implicitly compensates for vertical PSA effects. However, only PSA recalibration addressed horizontal apparent gaze shift, reducing overall gaze shift by over 50% and improving the performance of line assignment algorithms. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for PSA in reading research. We offer practical recommendations for improving gaze accuracy in eye-tracking reading studies."

    "abstract": "Human–machine partnerships are increasingly used to address grand societal challenges, yet knowledge of the comparative strengths of humans and machines to innovate is nascent. Here we compare the ability of humans (N = 9,198) and large language models (LLMs, N = 215,542 observations) to generate novel ideas in an established creativity task. We present three key results. First, human creativity on average is slightly higher than that of LLMs. Second, creativity differences are pronounced at the extremes of the distribution, with humans exhibiting greater variability and higher levels of creativity in the right-hand tail of the distribution. Third, attempts to increase the creativity of LLMs through instructing LLMs to take on genius personas or different demographic roles lifted performance up to a threshold beyond which the output became opposite real-life patterns, whereas strategic prompt-engineering efforts yielded mixed to negative results. We discuss the implications of our findings for human–machine collaboration and problem solving."
