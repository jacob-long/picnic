    "authors": "Kikuko Omori, Joo-Young Jung, Stephen Croucher",
    "abstract": "This theoretical paper extends Media System Dependency theory to better account for affective dynamics in today’s social media environment. We introduce the Heightened Emotions Social Media Dependency Model to explain how pervasive ambiguity contributes to elevated emotional states, which in turn intensify individuals’ dependency on social media across various goal domains. The model highlights a reciprocal relationship between heightened emotional states and social media dependency. This feedback loop has important consequences: it can increase cognitive vulnerability to misinformation and conspiracy beliefs and drive behaviors such as the spread of inaccurate information. By foregrounding emotion as both a condition and amplifier of media dependency, the proposed model provides a framework for analyzing social media dependency and effects in contemporary digital contexts.",

    "title": "Curation as a communicative act: conceptualizing personal curation within curated flows on social media",
    "authors": "Biying Wu-Ouyang",
    "abstract": "Individuals increasingly express thoughts by clicking “likes,” following groups, and leaving comments. These communicative acts not only express individual preferences but also convey signals to important curators such as algorithms, advertisers, friends, and journalists, which jointly shape social media feeds. In a word, people consume what they curate. Despite its significance, current theories lack clarity on the concept explication of personal curation. This paper addresses this gap by examining the types, motivations, and impacts of personal curation on users’ information intake. Importantly, as individuals engage in curation not from a single reason or convey a single message, this study theorizes personal curation into five dimensions based on platform features (expansiveness), content (heterogeneity), subjects (news attentiveness), sources (belongingness), and the number of platforms involved (multiplatform connectedness). This theorization provides a conceptual framework for understanding how seemingly mundane social media behaviors convey communicative meaning and exert significant influence in daily life.",

    "authors": "Yue Yu, Yue Peng, Runqi Liu, Wenli Tao",
    "abstract": "According to the I³ model of aggression, this study examines the association between dark personality traits and online aggression, with a particular focus on the role of sadism in cyberbullying among Chinese emerging adults. The primary objective was to examine the mediating role of moral disengagement in the relationship between sadism and cyberbullying, as well as the moderating effect of gender on this mediating pathway. Using an online survey methodology, data were collected from 709 university students across China, including mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. The findings reveal that moral disengagement plays a significant mediating role in the link between sadism and cyberbullying, with gender further moderating this relationship. These results suggest that moral cognitive processes, such as moral disengagement, are critical pathways through which dark personality traits like sadism manifest in online aggressive behaviors. By integrating gender as a moderating factor, this study highlights the nuanced psychological mechanisms underlying cyberbullying and emphasizes the unique risks faced by females with subclinical sadistic tendencies. This study contributes to aggression theories by integrating moral disengagement theory and relational theory, and also contributes empirical evidence to the literature on interpersonal violence and online aggression, offering valuable insights for the development of gender-specific prevention and intervention programs that address both moral disengagement and the underlying personality traits associated with cyberbullying. It also highlights the cultural diversity of cyberbullying, providing a valuable Eastern perspective on antisocial behaviors.",

    "abstract": "While trust in the news media has eroded globally, this shift is particularly noticeable in the United States. This lack of trust has been attributed to perceptions that the news media is either unintentionally (misinformation) or intentionally (disinformation) spreading false information. This study examined the relationship between perceptions of misinformation (PMI) and disinformation (PDI) and traditional and social media news use. A survey of US adults ( N = 1005) revealed that both PMI and PDI were negatively associated with television and newspaper news use. Furthermore, PMI was positively associated with YouTube , TikTok , and Instagram news use, whereas PDI was positively associated with YouTube and TikTok news use. Our findings highlight the roles PMI and PDI play in the selection of specific outlets for news consumption and offer implications in understanding how individuals engage in news selection, which could expose them to mis- and disinformation.",

    "authors": "Masanori Takano, Kenji Yokotani, Takahiro Kato, Nobuhito Abe, Fumiaki Taka",
    "abstract": "Avatar-based communication in virtual worlds offers a crucial space for online social support. Such support can be facilitated through avatar customization. However, most platforms, designed primarily for entertainment and attracting numerous users, have not fully examined the relationship between avatar customization and social support. This study provides an integrated explanation of the interplay among avatar customization, avatar identification, and online social support and proposes a practical approach for enhancing user well-being. Drawing on data from a two-wave longitudinal survey with a 9-month interval, conducted among Japanese users of three major avatar communication services (Second Life, ZEPETO, and Pigg Party), we analyzed the longitudinal relationships between these factors. A cross-lagged panel analysis revealed a positive feedback loop wherein avatar identification and perceived online social support mutually and positively reinforce each other over time. More frequent avatar customization at Wave 1 predicted higher avatar identification at Wave 2, suggesting that customization can serve as an upstream starting point for this feedback loop. Avatar identification and perceived online social support were positively associated with subsequent user satisfaction on most metrics. In addition, mediation analyses indicated significant indirect effects of avatar customization on perceived online social support and user satisfaction via avatar identification. By demonstrating how these concepts work together, our findings provide a practical strategy for service providers. By encouraging avatar customization—a measure that aligns naturally with platform operations, such as item releases and events—companies can initiate a positive feedback loop between avatar identification and online social support. This can enhance user well-being by increasing social support while potentially supporting platform success via higher user satisfaction, creating a win-win scenario.",

    "authors": "Ana Jovanovic-Harrington, Alessio Cornia",
    "abstract": "As digital authoritarianism evolves, new tools are needed to analyse its increasingly subtle forms. This paper adopts a longitudinal analysis of under-explored secondary sources to examine coordinated inauthentic behaviour (CIB) linked to Serbia's ruling party, Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). Unlike centralised bot farms common in autocratic regimes, SNS networks evade detection longer and more effectively mimic authentic support. Drawing on sources rarely translated into English and often at risk of censorship, we contextualise these findings within the framework of third-wave autocratisation. Our research reveals that SNS coordinates CIB through public-sector personnel co-optation, leveraging state employment to incentivise participation. This form of organisation is under-explored in CIB literature. For this reason, this study offers new insights into how modern autocracies adapt their influence strategies. Moreover, the paper highlights the need for diverse methodological approaches to improve the detection and understanding of evolving digital propaganda.",

Recent advances in AI have moved those media musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as “companions,” yet there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71; 2017–2025). Works varied widely in considerations of MC according to guiding theories, dimensions of a priori specified properties (subjectively positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts (with more than 50 distinct measured variables). We ultimately offer a literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive; through a facet-theoretical lens, we suggest how this definition can scaffold future research.",

    "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly embedded in everyday information environments, understanding how citizens engage with this technology is critical for science communication. This study examines public engagement with GenAI in Denmark, focusing on trust, AI literacy, experience with GenAI tools, and exposure to science-related information. Denmark provides a relevant case due to its high levels of institutional and scientific trust. Using data from a nationally representative survey conducted in 2024 (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 514) as part of the cross-national ScI-AI project, we analyze how respondents encounter GenAI, assess its trustworthiness, understand its technical and epistemic features, and engage with science-related information across platforms. Descriptive results show moderate trust in GenAI, uneven AI and GenAI literacy, and concentrated experience centered primarily on ChatGPT, alongside pronounced concerns about misinformation and societal risks. To examine how these dimensions relate, we apply a probabilistic graphical model to 29 variables spanning trust, literacy, experience, science-related information exposure, and demographics. The analysis reveals that trust occupies a central position, mediating between technical understanding of GenAI’s functioning and epistemic beliefs about the reliability and truthfulness of its outputs. Science-related information exposure is largely disconnected from trust and GenAI literacy and links to general AI literacy primarily through gender. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of treating trust and literacy as multidimensional and context-sensitive constructs for understanding how GenAI reshapes science-related information encounters.",

    "abstract": "Managing multiple accounts on social networking sites (SNSs) like Instagram is a common strategy for users to tailor self-presentation and manage privacy by segmenting audiences and content. This practice supports privacy management and reflects identity processes such as identity evolution (how users perceive their self-concepts to shift over time) and identity synchronization (how these identities are integrated across accounts). Grounded in privacy management theory, this study uses survey data from 408 Instagram users and a structural equation modeling approach to examine how two distinct types of privacy management, platform-enabled and interpersonal privacy concerns, shape identity construction. Our findings reveal that content management and curation significantly contribute to both identity evolution and synchronization, while interpersonal privacy concerns are tied to network-based self-presentation. These results challenge assumptions of the privacy paradox, showing that users engage in deliberate, context-sensitive strategies and privacy strategies. In addition, audience segmentation, more than content itself, shapes identity work on SNSs.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms increasingly offer users control over their feeds, promising to reduce toxic discourse. This study tests how the mere offer of algorithmic control shapes user experiences. Respondents evaluated identical posts from a fictional platform, with half given the option to filter out toxic political content. Those given this choice reported greater platform satisfaction. However, those who opted for filtering rated content as more hostile than similar respondents who were not offered the choice. A follow-up experiment showed that exposure to only positive content did not reduce hostility ratings; it heightened them compared to exposure to both positive and negative content. These findings challenge the assumption that user autonomy will improve content experiences. Instead, algorithmic choice raises expectations, prompting users to scrutinize content more critically or attempt to “train” the algorithm to align with their preferences. Platforms must consider how expectations, not just content exposure, shape online experiences.",

    "authors": "Moon QMN-Nguyen",
    "abstract": "This study explores online deliberation and discursive (in)civility within Vietnam’s authoritarian context, focusing on Facebook discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines how different types of Facebook pages (i.e. government information pages, state-sponsored media, foreign media, and private discussion groups) shape deliberative quality and how (in)civility can both facilitate and hinder public discussion. Quantitative analysis reveals that foreign media pages foster more rational, diverse, reflexive, and interactive discussions, despite higher levels of incivility. In contrast, government and state-sponsored media pages maintain greater civility but demonstrate lower deliberative quality, while private groups show high incivility with minimal deliberation. To further contextualize these patterns, a close reading identifies emotional triggers and target-induced behaviors in uncivil comments. By integrating macro-level metrics with micro-level discursive practices, this study offers valuable insights for scholars and policymakers seeking to enhance deliberative engagement in digital environments under varying degrees of state control.",

These effects varied by collective scientific efficacy—perceived ability of scientists to work together effectively. Belief-based pathways were stronger under low efficacy, while hope-based pathways were stronger under high efficacy. Findings underscore the value of combining consensus and efficacy cues in science communication to promote engagement with emerging technologies like AI.",

    "abstract": "For many years, political scientists have debated over voter competence in direct democracy. At the core of the discussion is whether this central institution enlightens citizens about political facts. However, scholars have primarily examined if direct democracy fosters general political knowledge even though referendums and ballot initiatives are policy-specific in nature, as citizens vote on particular political proposals. By utilising a range of unique panel survey data collected around four Danish European Union referendums, I show that voters’ knowledge of policy-specific information markedly increased during the campaigns. I also combine the survey data with an original media content analysis and find that the learning of issue-specific facts is more related to the opportunities provided by the media information environment than to individual ability or motivation. These results suggest that a broad group of voters acquire policy-specific facts that help them make informed choices when they are granted full control of political decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Deliberative processes are often proposed to strengthen democracy, yet we know relatively little about how citizens evaluate their legitimacy. With a focus on deliberative citizens’ assemblies (or deliberative mini-publics), an increasingly common institutional form, I argue that experience with deliberation increases legitimacy by enhancing perceptions of process fairness and shifting views about citizens’ capacity to deliberate. I test this claim in Honduras with an experiment that pairs real deliberation and survey-experimental measures of legitimacy. Those without deliberative experience view deliberative processes as less legitimate than the status quo. Experience substantially boosts legitimacy, even among those who disagreed with the policy outcome—a strong test of legitimacy. The results advance research on deliberative democracy, democratic innovations, and citizen engagement, and carry implications for efforts to scale deliberative projects.",

Using named entity recognition and Wikidata linkage in a novel and scalable pipeline, we analyze over 50,000 tweets and 190,000 Facebook posts by all members of the 19th German Bundestag (2017–2021). Our results reveal a clear mandate effect: via district elected MPs refer to locations closer to their constituencies and mention deprived areas within constituencies more often than list MPs.

    "authors": "Deji Suolang, Jiazhi Yang, Lauren Miller, Joseph B Rodhouse, Elina T Page, Yajuan Si, Brady T West",
    "abstract": "In multi-day diary surveys, participants decide daily whether to continue. The day-level nonresponse can introduce nonresponse errors, and underreporting tends to increase over the data collection period. To address these problems, we propose an adjustment by either the construction of person-day level survey weights or multiple imputation (MI). This study used data from the US National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) and focused on four key outcomes in this survey: the occurrence and expenditure of daily food-at-home (FAH) and food-away-from-home (FAFH) events reported by individuals. We employed logistic regression models and conditional inference trees to predict daily response propensities and used the inverse of predicted response propensity as an adjustment factor for the existing FoodAPS household weights. As an alternative, we conducted MI for the key outcome variables using chained equations and fit zero-inflated imputation models for counts and semi-continuous variables to allow bounds and subset restrictions. The results show that raw estimates for the key variables are consistently smaller than those produced by any weighting or imputation techniques, indicating that some form of adjustment is necessary. Person-day level weights and MI show varying impacts across outcome variables, with MI offering a modest efficiency gain. We also performed a sensitivity analysis that employs an alternative definition of missingness, which yielded different MI estimates. This study offers valuable insights into addressing nonresponse errors in multi-day diary surveys and contributes to methodological approaches for conducting innovative weighting and imputation with complex data structures.",

Recent surveys have moved toward presenting it explicitly. Those that do produce estimates of pure independents that are much larger than in past surveys. We present evidence of this phenomenon across multiple surveys and ask: Are self-administered surveys overcounting independents, or are traditional live-interviewer surveys undercounting independents? We answer that question by comparing live-interview and self-administered samples from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies, by undertaking tests to rule out mode effects (including an experiment), and by seeing which question wording correlates more strongly with measures of latent ideology, vote choice, and ratings of the parties. Our findings suggest that surveys that include an explicit response option, allowing Americans to self-identify easily as “(pure) independent,” offer a more precise measurement of the concept of party identification. This has implications for the study of independents, as well as for discussions about polarization and party-system dealignment.",

    "authors": "Manuel Goyanes, Beatriz Jordá",
    "abstract": "Social media platforms offer ample opportunities for dialogue between both sides of the political spectrum. However, prior research suggests that users sometimes unfriend dissenting voices. While some studies argue that unfriending may lead to homogeneous information environments and potentially to heightened polarization, others indicate that users unfriend to preserve a manageable level of diversity. This study contributes to this literature by examining how cross-cutting discussion is directly and indirectly associated to unfriending through two types of behaviors: being politically corrected, a positive interaction linked to democratic, civic dynamics; and being insulted, a hostile behavior and prominent aspect of online incivility. The findings, based on two cross-sectional surveys conducted in Spain and Germany, showed that cross-cutting discussion is associated to unfriending directly and indirectly through being politically corrected and being insulted for political reasons. We also found no statistically significant differences in the two indirect effects in both countries. Taken together, our findings emphasize that users actively shield themselves from opposing views regardless of whether interactions are deemed as constructive (corrections) or hostile (insults).",

    "authors": "Zhicheng Lin",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. In this article, I develop a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive processes. For simulation, the framework includes (a) an implementation-confound checklist distinguishing essential from context-dependent methodological checks, (b) methods for developing psychologically grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, and (c) a three-tier validation framework (direct, indirect, and generative) tailored to data availability. A diagnostic decision framework guides researchers through establishing performance validity, identifying implementation artifacts, and interpreting LLM-human discrepancies. For cognitive modeling, I synthesize (a) emerging approaches for probing internal representations, (b) methodological advances in causal interventions, and (c) strategies for relating model behavior to human cognition. The framework addresses overarching challenges, including prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training-data cutoffs, and ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human-subjects review. Open-weight models are the default for reproducibility. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence about LLM performance—including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and prompt brittleness—to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.",

    "authors": "Ivan Jacob Agaloos Pesigan, Shu Fai Cheung, Huiping Wu, Florbela Chang, Shing On Leung",
    "abstract": "In structural equation modeling (SEM), one method to select the most plausible model from several candidates, or to compare one or more hypothesized models with similar alternatives on plausibility, is to compare the models using Bayesian posterior probability (BPP). BPP can be computed from the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores (Wu et al. Multivariate Behavioral Research , 55 (1), 1–16, 2020). This approach complements conventional goodness-of-fit indices such as the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) in giving concise BPP for assessing uncertainties among all models considered. It can also reveal evidence against a model otherwise hidden by these indices. However, Wu et al. Multivariate Behavioral Research , 55 (1), 1–16. (2020) did not provide guidelines on deciding the models that should be considered. To facilitate the use of BPP, we proposed a novel method for selecting this set of models, called neighboring models , to help researchers decide on the initial set. This novel method integrates seamlessly into the typical workflow for SEM analysis. Researchers can fit a model as usual and then use this method to assess whether it is the most plausible model compared with the neighboring models. We believe the proposed method will make it easier for researchers to make better-informed decisions when evaluating their models. We developed a user-friendly R package, , to automate all the steps: generating the set of neighboring models, fitting them, and computing the BPPs, all in a single function.",

    "authors": "M. Asher Lawson, Sandra C. Matz, Friedrich M. Götz, Ashley E. Martin",
    "abstract": "Research has identified a double-bind for female leaders: When acting in line with gender stereotypes, they are viewed as more likeable but less competent. Here, we test the impact of using gender stereotypical language—characterized by more prevention-focused language (e.g., avoiding risks) and less promotion-focused language (e.g., seeking gains)—on U.S. governors’ approval ratings during COVID-19 and their ability to promote effective social distancing behaviors. With a final dataset of 3,759 documents capturing governors’ communication, a 13-week panel of Google mobility data containing 6,534 observations (Study 1), U.S. nationally representative survey data from 57,532 participants (Study 2), and 24,247 tweets (Study 3), we find that female governors who use less prevention-focused, stereotypical language in their communications are more effective at increasing compliance with social distancing measures but receive lower approval ratings. As such, women leaders’ necessary approaches in crisis situations may undermine their sustainability in positions of power.",

    "title": "When Political Pivots Shift Behaviors but Not Beliefs: Evidence from Trump’s Position Reversal over Facemasks during the COVID-19 Crisis",
    "authors": "Bartholomew A. Konechni",
    "abstract": "Political leaders play a potentially important role shaping behaviors and beliefs during crises. In the pandemic, a number of high-status politicians, notably leaders of populist parties, were seen to diminish compliance with institutional recommendations by casting doubt on COVID guidelines. But what happens when such leaders change position and endorse previously discouraged behaviors? Using longitudinal data from the Understanding Coronavirus in America panel with fixed-effects modeling, this article examines how Trump’s unexpected endorsement of facemasks in July 2020 affected individuals’ likelihood of wearing a facemask and belief in masks’ efficacy. I find that Trump’s pivot lifted Republicans’ use of facemasks, closing 40 percent of the preexisting gap with Democrats and with stronger effects among individuals who were more exposed to the early-summer spike in COVID cases. Additionally, I provide evidence for the unique significance of this moment in the history of the pandemic, showing that at almost no other time did partisan behaviors converge as sharply. However, in contrast to expectations from most dominant theoretical models of behavioral change, especially the health belief model, no corresponding shift in beliefs about facemasks can be detected. These results have important theoretical implications for understanding how pivots can shape behaviors during crises, the validity of existing models in public health, pandemic populism’s causes, and directions of future research.",

    "abstract": "Social identity threat is a vigilance state in which a person anticipates that others in a setting may devalue them because of one (or more) of their social identities. According to theory, threat is multifaceted—encompassing concerns about stereotyping, belonging, fairness, authenticity, and more—and situational, fluctuating depending on which identities and contextual cues are salient. Threat is also theorized as a universal experience—affecting potentially anyone, across any of their identities. Here, we put these central aspects of theory to the test by introducing the Social Identity Threat Concerns (SITC) Inventory, a self-report instrument designed to assess threat across varied identity-by-context situations. Across nine studies ( N  = 8533), we show that threat is common across social groups yet situational, emerging under specific, theorized conditions. The SITC Inventory is a field-advancing tool that equips researchers to better understand and reduce identity-based threats, laying the groundwork for more inclusive and equitable environments.",
