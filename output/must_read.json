    "authors": "Xining Liao",
    "abstract": "Abstract: The present study explores how moral and threat language in news media influences public opinion within the context of the US–China relationship. Drawing on Moral Foundations Theory and Intergroup Threat Theory, I employed a computational approach combining the dictionary method with Large Language Models to identify moral and threat language in coverage of China by six major US news outlets from 2005 to 2022. I then analyzed the relationship between distinct types of moral and threat language and longitudinal polling data on Americans’ attitudes toward China. The results reveal a unified pattern: both liberal- and conservative-leaning outlets employed more binding than individualizing moral language, and emphasized realistic threats over symbolic threats when covering China. However, it is symbolic threat language that more strongly correlates with negative attitudes toward China. Furthermore, realistic threat language only predicted negative attitudes when accompanied by sufficient levels of moral language, with this relationship intensifying as moral language increased. The findings offer insights into the moral and threat dimensions of foreign news and public opinion towards foreign countries, highlighting a critical and complex interplay between these elements in a global context.",

    "authors": "Magdalena Wischnewski, Nicole Krämer",
    "abstract": "Abstract: In this study, we examine how readers perceive the credibility of polarizing news purportedly written by a machine. In particular, we study whether a machine attribution can decrease the polarization inflicted by the self-confirmation bias. To that end, we expect that attitude-confirming polarizing news is perceived as less credible when attributed to a machine than when attributed to a human author. We assume this is due to the lower source credibility of machines and less emotional involvement. In a preregistered online experiment, we presented N = 508 participants with a polarizing news article attributed either to a human author or a machine. The article also either confirmed or disconfirmed participants’ attitudes towards the polarizing issue. Our results show that participants did not differentiate between human and machine-attributed news. Moreover, we found no evidence that machine-attributed news affected the self-confirmation bias. However, we found that, while machine authors were perceived equally competent as human authors, they were perceived as less trustworthy. In addition, we found that the machine attribution induced less emotional involvement in terms of experienced enthusiasm but not experienced anger.",

    "abstract": "Using a 2 (social endorsement: high vs. low) × 2 (AI comment type: approving vs. disapproving) experiment, we examine how AI-generated comments and social endorsement cues jointly influence information-seeking intentions in response to social media health misinformation. Results reveal a moderated-moderated mediation: When AI trustworthiness is high and social endorsement is low, debunking comments promote cognitive elaboration, which in turn increases information-seeking intentions. This pathway suggests that deeper cognitive processing of AI corrections makes individuals more receptive to seeking additional verification. When AI trustworthiness is low, debunking is largely ineffective. Notably, under low trustworthiness and endorsement, misinformation-supporting comments can unexpectedly elicit more elaboration, potentially triggering skepticism-driven information seeking. These findings underscore the importance of AI trustworthiness and reveal nuanced mechanisms in how individuals respond to AI-based health misinformation interventions, highlighting that cognitive elaboration serves as a critical bridge between AI interventions and behavioral intentions.",

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, close to 140 countries worldwide – including 18 in Latin America – have enacted access to information (ATI) laws. Recent increases in populism, authoritarianism, and harassment of the press, however, have been accompanied by rollbacks in public transparency and ATI, raising questions about the factors shaping journalists’ use and perceptions of ATI laws and government transparency more generally. In one of the largest cross-national ATI surveys to date, we draw on responses from 678 journalists across Latin America to examine the influence of macro-level factors – including populist leadership, press freedom, and characteristics of ATI laws – on journalists’ experiences with information access. Our findings show that populist leadership has significantly negative effects on ATI use and experience, in line with other evaluations. However, our findings reveal several unexpected results, including the null effect of the age and legal strength of ATI laws on usage and the statistically significant relationship between negative press freedom and increased ATI use. Overall, our results show that two-thirds of our sample make use of information access laws. And despite negative experiences, journalists continue to file information requests, and the more requests they file, the more positive their assessment of government transparency. Our study thus suggests that ATI laws provide substantially positive returns to both journalists and governments.",

This thriving literature—dealing with research on political stereotypes and projection around sociodemographic, psychological, and lifestyle traits—is disconnected and needs to be placed under a unifying framework. To achieve this, we introduce “Politicultural Linking,” a concept subsuming political inferences from apolitical cues and apolitical inferences from political cues. Through an extensive literature review of the works produced since 2009, we discuss and classify research on this topic, identifying common features, strengths, and weaknesses, and depicting a comprehensive conceptual framework. Moreover, we identify relevant gaps in the literature: the underexploration of inferences involving lifestyle preferences, the overrepresentation of US-based studies, the overlooked role of projection, and the lack of non-survey-based research. Consequently, we aim to set the agenda for future studies on this topic.",

This article examines how the media coverage of members of parliament (MPs) prompts people to seek more information about MPs—an important element of voters’ political knowledge and democratic accountability. I use all available online content from four major Estonian newspapers during 2015–2023 ( ∼ 140,000 articles) and pre-trained transformer models to classify the sentiment and policy issues of news articles that mention MPs. I match media data with MPs’ Wikipedia pageviews on a daily basis over two legislative terms. First, the results show that media visibility of MPs is associated with more views of their Wikipedia page on the same day. Second, news articles with negative sentiment have a greater impact on information-seeking than those with a positive or neutral tone. Third, the impact of MPs' media appearances on information-seeking is dependent on the policy context as well as party affiliation. The findings have implications for understanding the consequences of political communication and democratic representation in the digital age.",

This article explores how generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to create customisable images for visual vignettes. It demonstrates techniques for producing and selectively editing images, highlighting their potential to address the demands of experimental social science research, while it also acknowledges key challenges, including ethical considerations, biases inherent in AI tools, and technical limitations. The article showcases potential applications of AI-generated images in social science research and draws on a pretest with human participants to present evidence on how AI-generated images are perceived and interpreted. By critically evaluating both opportunities and challenges, this article provides researchers with practical guidance on integrating AI-generated visuals into factorial survey experiments, enhancing methodological approaches in the social sciences.",

Building on theories of democratic communication and incivility, platform affordances and moderation, and uses-and-gratifications/network externalities, we specify how decentralized community rules and explicit in-group orientations could shape both the prevalence of uncivil language and patterns of engagement. We analyze a year-long, random sample of submissions and comments scored with established computational measures of incivility, and we link these scores to subreddit-level rule regimes and identity signaling. By distinguishing interpersonal impoliteness from democratic norm violations and by evaluating moderation complexity at the community level, this work clarifies when and how community governance relates to discourse quality and participation dynamics on Reddit. Findings inform ongoing debates about the efficacy of hybrid, human-centered moderation and the role of explicit identity norms in large online communities.",

Quantifying the uncertainty of such predictions is rarely considered, partly because prediction intervals are not defined for many of the algorithms used. However, generating and reporting prediction models without information on the uncertainty of the predictions carries the risk of overinterpreting their accuracy. Conventional methods for prediction intervals (e.g., those defined for ordinary least squares regression) are sensitive to violations of several distributional assumptions. In this tutorial, we introduce conformal prediction, a model-agnostic, distribution-free method for generating prediction intervals with guaranteed marginal coverage, to psychological research. We start by introducing the basic rationale of prediction intervals using a motivating example. Then, we proceed to conformal prediction, which is illustrated in three increasingly complex examples using publicly available data and R code.",

Modern digital communications, social media, and Internet surveillance and censorship technologies are changing the landscape of public speech and dissent. Especially in authoritarian settings, individuals must assess the risk of voicing their true opinions or choose self-censorship, voluntarily moderating their behavior to comply with authority. We present a model in which individuals strategically manage the tradeoff between expressing dissent and avoiding punishment through self-censorship while an authority adapts its policies to minimize both total expressed dissent and punishment costs. We study the model analytically and in simulation to derive conditions separating defiant individuals who express their desired dissent in spite of punishment from self-censoring individuals who fully or partially limit their expression. We find that for any population, there exists an authority policy that leads to total self-censorship. However, the probability and time for an initially moderate, locally adaptive authority to suppress dissent depend critically on the population’s willingness to withstand punishment early on, which can deter the authority from adopting more extreme policies.",

Here, we examine inter- and intramodel agreement across four state-of-the-art LLMs tasked with evaluating 4800 narrative statements on 24 different topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of 192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified nationality affects evaluation outcomes. Different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intramodel agreement across topics, but this alignment breaks down when source framing is introduced. Attributing statements to Chinese individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models and, in particular, for DeepSeek Reasoner. Our findings show that LLMs’ own judgment of agreement with narrative statements exhibit systematic bias from framing effects, with substantial implications for the neutrality and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems.",

This study examines how nationalistic messages and sentiments propagate on Chinese social media, focusing on interactions between celebrities and fans. We analyzed more than 8 million Weibo microblogs and comments, classified their content using machine-learning techniques, and examined the dynamics between celebrities and fans. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings reveal that fans exert a stronger influence on celebrities than vice versa in spreading nationalism. Fans often shape the nationalist narratives that celebrities amplify, with those aligned with specific political leanings (e.g., within the state-conformist camp) having a greater influence. These results highlight the critical role of grassroots online communities in shaping nationalism in nondemocratic contexts, offering insights into the dynamic interactions between the masses and influential figures in reinforcing nationalist ideologies and sentiments.",
