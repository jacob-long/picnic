    "authors": "Kikuko Omori, Joo-Young Jung, Stephen Croucher",
    "abstract": "This theoretical paper extends Media System Dependency theory to better account for affective dynamics in today’s social media environment. We introduce the Heightened Emotions Social Media Dependency Model to explain how pervasive ambiguity contributes to elevated emotional states, which in turn intensify individuals’ dependency on social media across various goal domains. The model highlights a reciprocal relationship between heightened emotional states and social media dependency. This feedback loop has important consequences: it can increase cognitive vulnerability to misinformation and conspiracy beliefs and drive behaviors such as the spread of inaccurate information. By foregrounding emotion as both a condition and amplifier of media dependency, the proposed model provides a framework for analyzing social media dependency and effects in contemporary digital contexts.",

    "title": "Curation as a communicative act: conceptualizing personal curation within curated flows on social media",
    "authors": "Biying Wu-Ouyang",
    "abstract": "Individuals increasingly express thoughts by clicking “likes,” following groups, and leaving comments. These communicative acts not only express individual preferences but also convey signals to important curators such as algorithms, advertisers, friends, and journalists, which jointly shape social media feeds. In a word, people consume what they curate. Despite its significance, current theories lack clarity on the concept explication of personal curation. This paper addresses this gap by examining the types, motivations, and impacts of personal curation on users’ information intake. Importantly, as individuals engage in curation not from a single reason or convey a single message, this study theorizes personal curation into five dimensions based on platform features (expansiveness), content (heterogeneity), subjects (news attentiveness), sources (belongingness), and the number of platforms involved (multiplatform connectedness). This theorization provides a conceptual framework for understanding how seemingly mundane social media behaviors convey communicative meaning and exert significant influence in daily life.",

    "authors": "Ana Jovanovic-Harrington, Alessio Cornia",
    "abstract": "As digital authoritarianism evolves, new tools are needed to analyse its increasingly subtle forms. This paper adopts a longitudinal analysis of under-explored secondary sources to examine coordinated inauthentic behaviour (CIB) linked to Serbia's ruling party, Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). Unlike centralised bot farms common in autocratic regimes, SNS networks evade detection longer and more effectively mimic authentic support. Drawing on sources rarely translated into English and often at risk of censorship, we contextualise these findings within the framework of third-wave autocratisation. Our research reveals that SNS coordinates CIB through public-sector personnel co-optation, leveraging state employment to incentivise participation. This form of organisation is under-explored in CIB literature. For this reason, this study offers new insights into how modern autocracies adapt their influence strategies. Moreover, the paper highlights the need for diverse methodological approaches to improve the detection and understanding of evolving digital propaganda.",

    "abstract": "Understanding covert discrimination is as critical as overt discrimination in combating injustices. This study examines how news media consumption and trust shape covert discriminatory preferences. By analyzing various news media sources (television, newspapers, and social media) and various discrimination grounds, we highlight the complex relationship between factors driving covert discrimination. We use data from an online survey among 3000 Belgian adults, employing a conjoint experimental design to capture implicit bias in the seating preferences on public transport. Results show that media consumption and trust significantly moderate discriminatory preferences. Light consumers of public television news and heavy consumers of commercial television news display greater discriminatory preferences. Higher trust in public broadcasters and quality newspapers aligns with favoring individuals without visible minority traits, while lower trust correlates with preferences for overweight and transgender individuals. TikTok, X, and Instagram consumption also influences these patterns. Our findings have implications for media policy and diversity interventions.",

    "abstract": "The notion of machine companions has long been embedded in socio-technological imaginaries. Recent advances in AI have moved those media musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as “companions,” yet there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71; 2017–2025). Works varied widely in considerations of MC according to guiding theories, dimensions of a priori specified properties (subjectively positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts (with more than 50 distinct measured variables). We ultimately offer a literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive; through a facet-theoretical lens, we suggest how this definition can scaffold future research.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms increasingly offer users control over their feeds, promising to reduce toxic discourse. This study tests how the mere offer of algorithmic control shapes user experiences. Respondents evaluated identical posts from a fictional platform, with half given the option to filter out toxic political content. Those given this choice reported greater platform satisfaction. However, those who opted for filtering rated content as more hostile than similar respondents who were not offered the choice. A follow-up experiment showed that exposure to only positive content did not reduce hostility ratings; it heightened them compared to exposure to both positive and negative content. These findings challenge the assumption that user autonomy will improve content experiences. Instead, algorithmic choice raises expectations, prompting users to scrutinize content more critically or attempt to “train” the algorithm to align with their preferences. Platforms must consider how expectations, not just content exposure, shape online experiences.",

    "abstract": "Large social media platforms are criticized for commodifying user data, corporate surveillance, and perceived censorship of political speech. As a result, some users flock to alternative platforms, like Telegram, Signal, VK, Parler, or Gettr. This study examines the roles of political ideology, anti-establishment views, and privacy concerns in the use of these five platforms. Based on survey data gathered in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany ( n = 1500 each), we find that alternative platform use is highest in the United States and in Germany. Digitally skilled, young, male, educated, and right-wing individuals are drawn to alternative social media. Across all five platforms, right-wing ideology is a stronger predictor of usage than anti-establishment views. In the pooled sample, privacy concerns do not correlate with usage. However, given inconsistencies in the roles of privacy concerns and anti-establishment views, we highlight the importance of specific platform affordances and national context.",

This article offers a systematic, cross-disciplinary review of empirical research on digital populism published between 2015 and early 2025. Analysing 188 studies from political communication, media studies and political science, we map how platform affordances structure populist communication, how digital populism is conceptualised and how it is studied. The literature portrays digital populism as the communicative enactment of populist ideology in environments that privilege personalisation, affective intensity and direct leader–follower engagement. Methods span qualitative, computational and experimental designs, with research concentrated on Twitter/X and Facebook. Most studies examine exclusionary, right-wing cases in European and Western contexts and associate them with polarisation, misinformation and declining institutional trust. Evidence remains largely correlational, and inclusionary or participatory variants are underexplored. We identify key gaps and call for greater analytical precision in assessing democratic consequences.",

    "abstract": "Jihadist organizations and their supporters have long used social media to spread propaganda, creating enduring content moderation challenges. Despite TikTok’s purported zero-tolerance approach to violent extremism, terrorist propaganda persists on the platform. This study investigates how supporters of ISIS and Al-Qaeda employ TikTok’s features to exploit algorithmic recommendations and evade content moderation, increasing their visibility within a hostile platform environment. We strategically enrolled the platform’s recommendation system to surface terrorist propaganda and inductively developed a typology of five communicative techniques: audio camouflage (manipulating recorded audio and metadata), meme infiltration (embedding extremist content within pop culture references), blurred intent (distorting sensitive visuals), emoji codes (using coded language and symbols), and bait-and-switch (deferring the reveal of extremist messaging). Together, these tactics constitute a form of everyday extremism embedded within TikTok’s vernacular practices, aesthetics, and pop culture references, exposing the limitations of TikTok’s moderation and state regulations. Our study underscores the need for improved governance, culturally informed moderation, and greater collaboration between platforms and governments to combat online radicalization and extremism.",

This project uses two studies conducted during the 2020 and 2022 elections to test whether the presumed prevalence/persuasiveness of online misinformation (P3OM)—the perception that online misinformation is both widespread and persuasive—undermines Americans’ satisfaction with democracy. Fixed-effects regression analysis of an eight-wave online panel survey reveals that both dimensions of P3OM are correlated with reduced democratic satisfaction. A follow-up online survey experiment provides evidence that exposure to messages about online misinformation reduces democratic satisfaction. Theoretical implications and strategies for reducing the presumed influence of online misinformation on democratic satisfaction are discussed.",

This study illuminates a less-explored facet of non-democratic contexts’ digital politics by shedding light on discourse quality in cyberspace. Guided by Gastil and Black’s analytical–social framework of deliberation, we propose an integrated analytical model comprising seven dimensions and employ a case study approach combined with supervised machine learning to analyze Chinese netizens’ digital engagement with the public policy of “delaying retirement age” on the popular Q&amp;A platform. The findings reveal deliberative virtues—topic relevance, rationality, and civility—alongside a low presence of political alienation and minimal institutional alignment, suggesting generally strong analytical performance. In contrast, the social dimension, represented by argument reciprocity and transpositional consideration, remains weak, reflecting a lack of sustained interaction. Based on these empirical results, we coin the concept of the “ solo of deliberator ” to describe a pattern of online deliberation where analytical reasoning prevails while social engagement is subdued. Implications for deliberative democracy in non-democratic nations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Prior work shows that passive news engagement, such as selection and consumption, exhibits strong news selectivity. Far less attention has been given to more active forms of news engagement, however. News commentary, an active form of engagement, may reflect cross-cutting engagement rather than pro-attitudinal selectivity, given its expressive and often confrontational nature. Using ten years of commenting data from South Korea’s largest news aggregator—amounting to over 250 million comments posted by approximately six million users—and a deep-learning content analysis to classify political attitudes and hostility, we examine whether hostile commentary is indeed characterized by cross-cutting patterns across both content and source levels. We specifically analyze whether users comment on counter-attitudinal news stories and whether hostile commenters are structurally confined within fragmented outlet clusters in co-engagement media networks. Findings show that hostile commenters are more likely to cross boundaries by targeting opposing news stories and exhibit weaker echo chamber structures, reflecting cross-cutting engagement beyond their clusters. This pattern is especially pronounced in political and societal domains. In today’s media environment, hostility and opposition may ironically disrupt, rather than reinforce, echo chambers.",

    "abstract": "For many years, political scientists have debated over voter competence in direct democracy. At the core of the discussion is whether this central institution enlightens citizens about political facts. However, scholars have primarily examined if direct democracy fosters general political knowledge even though referendums and ballot initiatives are policy-specific in nature, as citizens vote on particular political proposals. By utilising a range of unique panel survey data collected around four Danish European Union referendums, I show that voters’ knowledge of policy-specific information markedly increased during the campaigns. I also combine the survey data with an original media content analysis and find that the learning of issue-specific facts is more related to the opportunities provided by the media information environment than to individual ability or motivation. These results suggest that a broad group of voters acquire policy-specific facts that help them make informed choices when they are granted full control of political decision-making.",

Its value-added includes insights about different sources of (in)stability, the direction of causation between attitudes, and their relative degree of influence; capturing time-invariant individual traits with a multiple factor structure; and addressing the ordinal nature of attitudinal measures, together with heterogeneity in time intervals between interviews, across waves, and people. We examine five core political attitudes concerning how people view the political world and their role in it. Most of their variance reflects infrequently-changing individual characteristics and time-specific effects. Permanent heterogeneity plays a modest role. External efficacy is most influential concerning evaluations of the external political world, while internal efficacy is influential for views on one’s role in politics. Another application examines the role of ideological and party identification on attitudes toward government spending and immigration. The attitudes form a weakly constrained attitude system. Party identification is the most influential, through spillovers to ideological identification. Party and ideological identifications are stable, time-invariant traits explaining most of their variance, with transitory shocks that hint at measurement error and/or expressive responding. Issue attitudes are unstable, driven mainly by transitory shocks.",

To effectively measure this phenomenon, we introduce a novel transformer-based approach capable of automatically classifying large volumes of text. Case studies on coalition signals in Germany and negative campaigning in Austria demonstrate its effectiveness.

We present evidence of this phenomenon across multiple surveys and ask: Are self-administered surveys overcounting independents, or are traditional live-interviewer surveys undercounting independents? We answer that question by comparing live-interview and self-administered samples from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies, by undertaking tests to rule out mode effects (including an experiment), and by seeing which question wording correlates more strongly with measures of latent ideology, vote choice, and ratings of the parties. Our findings suggest that surveys that include an explicit response option, allowing Americans to self-identify easily as “(pure) independent,” offer a more precise measurement of the concept of party identification. This has implications for the study of independents, as well as for discussions about polarization and party-system dealignment.",

Using original survey data collected in the spring of 2022, we find strong suggestive support for our hypothesis. Many of the Americans who fail to condemn the Capitol riot may not be simply knee-jerk partisans, well-intentioned victims of propaganda, or sycophants in thrall to a would-be authoritarian leader.

    "authors": "Andrew Castillo, Joshua D. Miller, Colin Vize, David A. A. Baranger, Donald R. Lynam",
    "abstract": "Two-way interaction effects in linear regression occur when the relation between two variables changes depending on the level of a third. Despite their frequent use, interactions are notoriously difficult to estimate accurately and test for statistical significance because of small effect sizes and low reliability. In this study, we used Monte Carlo simulations to establish stability thresholds for two-way interactions between continuous variables across combinations of reliability (0.7–1.0), main effect size (0.1–0.5), collinearity (0.1–0.5), and interaction effect size (0.05–0.2). Stability was defined as the consistency of estimated effect sizes across repeated samples of the same size from the same population and operationalized using modified definitions of the corridor of stability and point of stability from Schönbrodt and Perugini. Results show that the stability of interaction estimates is primarily determined by sample size and predictor reliability. The case representing a realistic psychology field study, in which researchers have limited control over variables, stabilized at n = 3,800, requiring 72% statistical power. At n ≤≤ 100, 11% to 45% of the estimates were incorrectly signed (i.e., negative when the true effect was positive). Most psychology studies enroll far fewer than 500 participants, and our results indicate many published interactions may be unstable. Analyses involving highly reliable predictors, such as group assignment in experimental designs, may stabilize at lower sample sizes because they attenuate the expected effect size less than variables with more measurement error. Researchers are encouraged to avoid routine tests of two-way interactions unless sample size and reliability are adequate and hypotheses are specified a priori.",

    "authors": "Benjamin Sacks, Virginia Ulichney, Anna Duncan, Chelsea Helion, Sarah M. Weinstein, Tania Giovannetti, Gus Cooney, Jamie Reilly",
    "abstract": "Much of our scientific understanding of language processing has been informed by controlled experiments divorced from the real-world demands of naturalistic communication. Conversation requires synchronization of rate, amplitude, lexical complexity, affective coloring, shared reference, and countless other verbal and nonverbal dimensions. Conversation is not merely a vector for information transfer but also serves as a mechanism for establishing or maintaining social relationships. This process of language calibration between interlocutors is known as linguistic alignment . We developed an open-source R package, ConversationAlign , capable of computing novel indices of linguistic alignment and main effects of language use between interlocutors by evaluating word choice across numerous semantic, affective, and lexical dimensions (e.g., valence, concreteness, frequency, word length). We describe the operations of ConversationAlign, including its primary functions of cleaning and transforming raw language data into simultaneous time series objects aggregated by interlocutor, turn, and conversation. We then outline mathematical operations involved in computing complementary indices of linguistic alignment that capture both local (synchrony in turn-by-turn scores) and global relations (overall proximity) between interlocutors. We present a use case of ConversationAlign applied to interview transcripts from American radio legend Terry Gross and her many guests spanning 15 years. We identify caveats for use and potential sources of bias (e.g., polysemy, missing data, robustness to brief language samples) and close with a discussion of potential applications to other populations. ConversationAlign (v 0.4.0) is freely available for download and use via CRAN or GitHub.

    "authors": "M. Asher Lawson, Sandra C. Matz, Friedrich M. Götz, Ashley E. Martin",
    "abstract": "Research has identified a double-bind for female leaders: When acting in line with gender stereotypes, they are viewed as more likeable but less competent. Here, we test the impact of using gender stereotypical language—characterized by more prevention-focused language (e.g., avoiding risks) and less promotion-focused language (e.g., seeking gains)—on U.S. governors’ approval ratings during COVID-19 and their ability to promote effective social distancing behaviors. With a final dataset of 3,759 documents capturing governors’ communication, a 13-week panel of Google mobility data containing 6,534 observations (Study 1), U.S. nationally representative survey data from 57,532 participants (Study 2), and 24,247 tweets (Study 3), we find that female governors who use less prevention-focused, stereotypical language in their communications are more effective at increasing compliance with social distancing measures but receive lower approval ratings. As such, women leaders’ necessary approaches in crisis situations may undermine their sustainability in positions of power.",

    "authors": "Elena Amaya, Robert Braun",
    "abstract": "This article argues that folklore (orally transmitted group knowledge) shapes far-right voting by inculcating feeling rules that resonate with nativist and autocratic ideas. Drawing on recently rediscovered archives of nineteenth- and twentieth-century folklorists, we pair a dataset of local support for the far-right in all Reichstag elections in Germany’s Weimar period, with unique information on the prevalence of ethnic bogeymen in local folktales. Using spatial autoregressive models, we find a robust and considerable effect of the presence of fearful folktales on radical right voting. These effects are particularly strong for localities where citizens face political and economic threats. We use an instrumental variable analysis drawing on folklore data from the 1860s to establish the long-term roots of this pattern, disentangle the effect of folktales from contemporary political influences, and establish causal order. Our findings suggest that folklore plays a key role in aligning the supply and demand for far-right movements by shaping how citizens see and feel the world around them. In addition, we illustrate that folklore archives provide a unique opportunity to unpack affective-discursive canons across space and time.",

    "title": "When Political Pivots Shift Behaviors but Not Beliefs: Evidence from Trump’s Position Reversal over Facemasks during the COVID-19 Crisis",
    "authors": "Bartholomew A. Konechni",
    "abstract": "Political leaders play a potentially important role shaping behaviors and beliefs during crises. In the pandemic, a number of high-status politicians, notably leaders of populist parties, were seen to diminish compliance with institutional recommendations by casting doubt on COVID guidelines. But what happens when such leaders change position and endorse previously discouraged behaviors? Using longitudinal data from the Understanding Coronavirus in America panel with fixed-effects modeling, this article examines how Trump’s unexpected endorsement of facemasks in July 2020 affected individuals’ likelihood of wearing a facemask and belief in masks’ efficacy. I find that Trump’s pivot lifted Republicans’ use of facemasks, closing 40 percent of the preexisting gap with Democrats and with stronger effects among individuals who were more exposed to the early-summer spike in COVID cases. Additionally, I provide evidence for the unique significance of this moment in the history of the pandemic, showing that at almost no other time did partisan behaviors converge as sharply. However, in contrast to expectations from most dominant theoretical models of behavioral change, especially the health belief model, no corresponding shift in beliefs about facemasks can be detected. These results have important theoretical implications for understanding how pivots can shape behaviors during crises, the validity of existing models in public health, pandemic populism’s causes, and directions of future research.",

    "authors": "Yongyuan He, Yi Bu",
    "abstract": "The rapid integration of generative AI into academic writing has prompted widespread policy responses from journals and publishers. However, the effectiveness of these policies remains unclear. Here, we analyze 5,114 journals and over 5.2 million papers to evaluate the real-world impact of AI usage guidelines. We show that despite 70% of journals adopting AI policies (primarily requiring disclosure), researchers’ use of AI writing tools has increased dramatically across disciplines, with no significant difference between journals with or without policies. Non-English-speaking countries, physical sciences, and high-OA journals exhibit the highest growth rates. Crucially, full-text analysis on 164 k scientific publications reveals a striking transparency gap: Of the 75 k papers published since 2023, only 76 (~0.1%) explicitly disclosed AI use. Our findings suggest that current policies have largely failed to promote transparency or restrain AI adoption. We urge a reevaluation of ethical frameworks to foster responsible AI integration in science.",

    "authors": "Alexandros Gelastopoulos, Pantelis P. Analytis, Gaël Le Mens, Arnout van de Rijt",
    "abstract": "People are influenced by the choices of others, a phenomenon observed across contexts in the social and behavioral sciences. Social influence can lock in an initial popularity advantage of an option over a higher quality alternative. Yet, several experiments designed to enable social influence have found that social systems self-correct rather than lock in. Here, we identify a behavioral phenomenon that makes inferior lock-in possible, which we call the “marginal majority effect”: a discontinuous increase in the choice probability of an option as its popularity exceeds that of a competing option. We demonstrate the existence of a marginal majority effect in several recent experiments and show that lock-in always occurs when the effect is large enough to offset the quality effect on choice but rarely otherwise. Our results reconcile conflicting past empirical evidence and connect a behavioral phenomenon to the possibility of social lock-in.",
