    "abstract": "Digital addictions, such as Internet, game, social media, and smartphone addiction, pose health risks. This cross-sectional online survey of 1,764 participants aged 16–28 (75.7 percent women) identified four addiction subtypes using specific scales. Network analysis revealed significant comorbidity (95.35 percent) among subtypes, with smartphone addiction playing a dominant role, leading to social media, Internet, and potentially game addiction. High comorbidity suggests a shared vulnerability, with smartphone use as a catalyst. Smartphone addiction is a key precursor to other digital addictions."

    "abstract": "This article examines how participatory publics persist in depopulated rural areas during periods of low visibility and mobilization. Drawing on pragmatism and mediatization theory, we analyse communicative figurations in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) using survey data ( N = 529) and develop a Participatory Public Connection Index. Regression models reveal that public connection is driven more by communicative and territorial factors – such as local radio use, civic motivations and municipality size – than by sociodemographics. Our findings suggest that local media help sustain symbolic bonds and latent publics, contributing to democratic engagement and territorial cohesion despite the absence of visible collective action. We conceptualize latency as the communicative and symbolic potential through which publics persist beyond visible mobilization; operationally, the Participatory Public Connection Index captures this latent connection sustained by everyday local media practices."

Conceptually, the article draws on key feminist perspectives, which have, over the past decades, been vital for turning sexual misconduct into a central issue of public concern. Our analysis of Dutch public broadcasting (1984–2019) and Twitter (2011–2019) reveals that Dutch television consistently advocated feminist perspectives and framed sexual misconduct as a national problem rooted in ‘internal’ structural failures. By contrast, Twitter discourse, particularly since 2015, was dominated by far-right rhetoric, framing the issue as an ‘external’ cultural threat linked to Islam and immigration. #MeToo was not visible in the dominant Twitter discourse on sexual misconduct but did appear on public television. Nevertheless, Dutch public broadcasters’ feminist agenda remained limited, failing to debunk the hypervisible racist and Islamophobic perpetrator myths circulating on Dutch social media."

Combining two empirical approaches—a small-scale analysis of top-ranked videos from YouTube search results in 2022 and 2024, and a large-scale data set of over 112k videos—we examine how Tate-related content continues to circulate and how the platform moderates such material. Our findings show that Tate remains highly visible through a diffuse and decentralized network of actors who repackage his messaging into interviews, remixes, and YouTube-native formats. This configuration produces what we term the “Tate-space”: an ambient ideological environment where motivational rhetoric, aspirational masculinity, and far-right talking points converge. We find that YouTube’s substantial moderation efforts are outpaced by the speed and scale of recommendation-driven circulation and that deplatforming, while symbolically significant, fails to disrupt the cultural and logistical dynamics that sustain Tate’s influence."

    "abstract": "The outbreak of war in Ukraine 6 weeks before the 2022 French presidential election generated an exogenous geopolitical shock that disrupted the electoral campaign. This study investigates how candidates adapted their issue emphasis strategies in response to this crisis and whether their adjustments aligned with voter issue salience. Using a combination of media content analysis (PolDem dataset) and public opinion survey data (Enquête Electorale Française – EnEF), the study systematically examines issue emphasis for the six major candidates. The findings show that while candidates initially engaged with the Ukraine crisis, their emphasis on the issue declined over time, as economic concerns dominated the campaign agenda. The analyses confirm that mainstream candidates followed public issue salience more closely than challenger candidates, who engaged in selective issue emphasis strategies. Notably, Marine Le Pen, often classified as a challenger, behaved as a mainstream candidate, prioritizing economic issues over her traditionally owned themes such as immigration. These findings contribute to broader debates on issue salience, electoral shocks, and strategic campaign behavior, demonstrating that while external crises can momentarily disrupt campaign agendas, they do not necessarily redefine electoral competition."

    "abstract": "In this note, we offer a cautionary tale on the dangers of drawing inferences from low-quality online survey datasets. We reanalyze and replicate a survey experiment studying the effect of acquiescence bias on estimates of conspiratorial beliefs and political misinformation. Correcting a minor data coding error yields a puzzling result: respondents with a postgraduate education appear to be the most prone to acquiescence bias. We conduct two preregistered replication studies to better understand this finding. In our first replication, conducted using the same survey platform as the original study, we find a nearly identical set of results. But in our second replication, conducted with a larger and higher-quality survey panel, this apparent effect disappears. We conclude that the observed relationship was an artifact of inattentive and fraudulent responses in the original survey panel, and that attention checks alone do not fully resolve the problem. This demonstrates how “survey trolls” and inattentive respondents on low-quality survey platforms can generate spurious and theoretically confusing results."

While inattentiveness has been well documented in lower quality sample sources, there is less understanding of how common the phenomenon is in high-quality surveys. We document the presence of a small percentage of respondents in Cooperative Election Study surveys who pass quality control measures but still exhibit inattentive behavior. We show that these respondents may affect public opinion estimates for small subgroups. Finally, we present the results from an experiment testing whether inattentive respondents can be encouraged to pay more attention, but we find that such an intervention fails."

By contrast, we find evidence that a reminder of accuracy can modestly improve truth discernment among people who report sharing political news. These results suggest the need for a reexamination of the role of affective polarization in the dissemination of misinformation online."

We evaluate the effects of five distinct message frames—scientific, religious, moral, and two economic (efficiency and equity)—on support for climate change policy using a randomized experiment with over 2300 U.S. respondents. Moving beyond pairwise frame comparisons, we adopt a policy learning approach that identifies the most effective frame using cross-validated sample splitting, thereby avoiding selective inference. We find that the economic efficiency frame consistently yields the largest gains in policy support, outperforming both the control condition and all alternative frames, on average. While the effects of covariate conditional frame assignment were modest and not significantly different from assigning the best overall frame, we find consistent positive effects of the efficiency frame across partisan subgroups. Our findings offer methodological and substantive contributions: we highlight how policy-learning methods can be applied in experimental framing studies, and we offer specific evidence on the relative efficacy of alternative framing messages on support for several climate policies."

Extending previous research, we benchmark the Google Cloud service with state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems from Meta (wav2vec 2.0), NVIDIA (NeMo), and OpenAI (Whisper). To do so, we use 100 randomly selected and recorded open-ended responses to popular social science survey questions. Additionally, we provide a basic, easy-to-understand introduction on how the Whisper ASR system works as well as code for implementation. By comparing Word Error Rates, we show that for our data the Google Cloud ASR service is outperformed by almost all other systems, highlighting the need to also consider other ASR systems."

We assess these expectations in opinion dynamics around US Republicans’ views on COVID-19 vaccines. Data are from a preregistered experiment in a national survey of Republicans (n = 3,058). Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatments or a control (no message) condition. Treated individuals received a message that connected vaccination to patriotism, a core conservative value, and this was attributed to a public health official (treatment 1), Republican voter (2), or Democratic voter (3). With the exception of those who were vaccinated and boosted, the message either had no effect or, more often, produced a backlash that led Republicans to express less favorable dispositions toward vaccination; backlash was stronger for messages sourced to a Democrat or public health official. Our conclusion discusses implications for moral reframing research and public health messaging."

These challenges can hinder the validity of quantitative studies, particularly those examining racial, ethnic, and other social-identity differences. Although quantitative-critical-race-theory scholars have proposed principles for handling racial and ethnic categories in quantitative research, their application in statistical analyses remains limited. In this article, we introduce CATAcode , an R package designed to assist researchers in exploring and preparing CATA demographic items for statistical modeling. By applying this tool to cross-sectional and longitudinal data, in the tutorial, we demonstrate how CATAcode can enhance the generalizability, transparency, and reproducibility of social-science research. Improving the rigor of demographic measurement is essential for identifying and addressing social inequalities, allocating resources, and understanding broader patterns of marginalization."

In four pre-registered studies (United States and United Kingdom, N = 1196), we test whether participants more likely to believe in conspiracy theories have a stronger preference for forming their own beliefs independently. Participants chose between doing a difficult perceptual task themselves or relying on an expert’s answer. Internal fixed-effect meta-analyses revealed a weak but statistically significant relationship between belief in conspiracy theories and preference for first-hand evidence. By contrast, the relationship between epistemic individualism and this preference was stronger and more robust. This suggests that, although individuals endorsing conspiracy theories express a stronger preference for “doing their own research,” their behavior mostly does not match this preference in non-conspiratorial contexts."

Although partisan-bias effects in judgments of misinformation are robust and pervasive, there is ongoing debate about whether partisan-bias effects arise from identity-protective motivated reasoning or differential knowledge of identity-congenial versus identity-uncongenial information. Prior empirical work has been unable to differentiate the two accounts because of a reliance on groups with pre-existing differences in knowledge (e.g., Democrats and Republicans). The current research addresses this issue by using randomly assigned rather than pre-existing identities. Across two experiments ( N total = 1,411), adult U.S. Prolific workers showed lower thresholds for accepting information that is congenial versus uncongenial to a randomly assigned identity, despite having no differences in prior knowledge. These results support theories that emphasize identity protection as a factor underlying partisan bias in the acceptance of misinformation, with important practical implications for misinformation interventions."

Prior research using simplified group coordination tasks (e.g., face-naming) shows network structure shapes group consensus, but the underlying cognitive mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examine how network structure influences the emergence and semantic content of shared narrative beliefs in experimental online social networks, using natural language processing measures and agent-based modeling. Media content with complex causal structure attenuates network structure effects by encouraging longer exploration of background knowledge. Yet network structure still shapes the narrative content communicated. An embedding-based narrative alignment measure shows that fully connected groups orient their interactions more toward communicating causes of an event, whereas locally connected networks emphasize the event’s effects. A group’s network structure also influences representational and language change in personal narratives: participants in fully connected networks showed the largest increase in causal language in personal narratives written after interaction, which also orient more around the narrative’s causal events."
