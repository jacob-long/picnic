    "abstract": "We develop an integrative conceptual framework and research agenda for studying epistemic authorities in the digital age. Consulting epistemic authorities (e.g., professional experts, well-informed laypeople, technologies) can be an efficient fast-track to knowledge. To fulfill this functional role, those who claim epistemic authority need to be both subjectively recognized (have a perceived advantage in knowledge) and objectively justified (have an actual advantage in knowledge). In a digital media context, new and unconventional knowledge sources have emerged that can fulfill the functional role of epistemic authorities. But false authorities that disseminate misinformation have emerged as well while other sources with important knowledge remain unrecognized. We further analyze the functional role of epistemic intermediaries that can mitigate such problematic developments by correcting false authorities and by providing endorsement for unrecognized authorities. We conclude with a research agenda to study functional forms of epistemic authorities and epistemic intermediaries in the digital public sphere."

    "abstract": "Communication researchers have long sought to situate or contextualize media behaviors in their natural settings. However, the many approaches taken to understand media behavior in context have varied considerably. This article proposes a metatheoretical framework for theorizing media behavior at the situational level, encompassing the entirety of circumstances surrounding a media behavior at a given moment. The framework describes how psychological states, environmental context, and media context combine to shape moment-to-moment media behavior. We then describe how situational factors have the potential to interact with the three phases of media behavior—i.e., selection, processing, and disengagement—in distinctive ways. We argue that communication researchers only gain the ability to explain the variability in media behavior by taking the situational level into account. We conclude by providing future theoretical and empirical directions to guide the field in building a more generalizable and durable understanding of situated media behavior."

However, the effectiveness of AI augmentation remains controversial. This study investigates whether, how and why AI enhances human agents’ sales through a randomized field experiment. Design/methodology/approach This study conducts a two-by-two factorial randomized field experiment ( N  = 1,090) to investigate the effects of AI augmentation on sales. The experiment compares sales outcomes handled solely by human agents with those augmented by AI, while also examining the moderating effect of agents’ experience levels and the underlying mechanisms behind agents’ responses. Findings The results reveal that AI augmentation leads to a significant 5.46% increase in sales. Notably, the impact of AI augmentation varies based on agents’ experience levels, with inexperienced agents benefiting nearly six times more than their experienced counterparts. Mediation analysis shows that AI augmentation improves response timeliness, accuracy and sentiment, thereby boosting sales. Originality/value This study highlights the role of AI augmentation in human–AI collaboration, demonstrates the varying impacts of AI augmentation based on agents’ experience levels and offers insights for organizations on how to regulate AI augmentation to enhance agent responses and drive sales."

    "abstract": "Political satire is often believed to enrich the public sphere in ways distinct from traditional journalism. This study examines whether deliberative qualities of online political talk in response to satire differ from those in response to regular news or partisan news. The analysis focuses on four normative standards: interactivity, diversity, rationality, and civility. A manual content analysis of YouTube comments (n = 2,447) reveals that the public sphere surrounding political satire shows a notable strength: Less incivility, both in terms of impoliteness and intolerance. Surprisingly, aside from this, satire’s public sphere did not differ much from that of regular news. Comments on partisan news were more opinionated and ideologically diverse. These findings suggest that online political talk prompted by satire is not inferior to that of traditional news. Additionally, this study highlights how the presence of different normative standards is often interconnected."

This article theorizes about expertise tension that arises when individuals with valuable insights lack corresponding authority to act, or vice versa. Using observations and interviews, we studied how physicians and nurses navigated this tension in problem-solving situations in a hospital emergency department. We found that nurses, who identified emergent problems, simultaneously asserted their situational authority and displayed a veneer of deference by asking physicians, “What do you want to do [in this situation]?” The question prompted one of three problem-solving activities (i.e., instruction by demand, reversed instruction, and collaborative improvisation) depending on the situation’s urgency and ambiguity. We discuss how nurses and physicians managed expertise tension without undermining their different claims to expertise and authority, highlighting the value of a communication-centered view in examining such dynamics."

We examine whether this bias is exhibited toward virtual assistants, specifically, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant, with various accents. We conducted three studies with different stimuli and designs to investigate U.S. English speakers’ attitudes toward Google's British, Indian, and American voices and Apple's Irish, Indian, South African, British, Australian, and American voices. Analysis reveals consistently lower fluency ratings for Irish, Indian, and South African voices (compared with American) but no consistent results of bias related to competence, warmth, or willingness to interact. Moreover, participants often misidentified voices’ countries of origin but correctly identified them as artificial. We conclude that this overall lack of bias may be due to two possibilities: lack of humanlikeness of the voices and lack of availability of nonstandardized voices and voices from countries toward which those in the United States typically show bias."

We argue that existing research can be framed in terms of experiential learning cycles and outline how this approach can be beneficial for acquiring algorithm literacy. Finally, we propose a future research agenda that includes defining core competencies relevant to algorithm literacy, standardization of measures, integrating subjective and factual aspects of algorithm literacy, and task- and domain-specific approaches."

Collecting all created and engaged posts ( n = 31,084) from 102 lesbian gamers in both lesbian gamer and female gamer groups, this research utilizes structural topic modeling to delineate their productive and consumptive curation across different groups. The results indicate that lesbian gamers often prioritize discussions on women and queer issues within the female gamer community while presenting a more gamer-centric identity in the lesbian gamer community. Group-swinging emerges as an optimal strategy for exploring a balance between belongingness and distinctiveness, enabling lesbian gamers to navigate their multiple minority identities effectively. This study enriches the understanding of identity curation and optimal distinctiveness theory, offering plausible strategies for the online resilience of marginalized groups within the polymedia context."

Four major motivations driving users to authenticate information are identified: expectancy violation, task features, personal involvement, and pre-existing attitudes. Users evaluate AI-generated information’s credibility using both internal (e.g. relying on AI affordances, content integrity, and subjective expertise) and external approaches (e.g. iterative interaction, cross-validation, and practical testing).

Two studies in the U.S. across both non-election and election settings test the centrality of political discussion on social media with strong and weak ties in explaining this relationship. Findings across both studies show no significant direct associations between incidental news exposure and political knowledge. However, mediation analyses suggest that incidental news exposure can influence political knowledge when mediated by interpersonal political conversations on social media: discussions with strong ties contribute to political knowledge, but discussions with weak ties are detrimental. Furthermore, the indirect effects via strong and weak ties are significantly conditioned by one’s cognitive ability. The findings highlight the conditions under which incidental news exposure helps yet also hinders individuals’ political knowledge."

In France, a movement to denounce gynaecological and obstetrical violence is expressed through a massive publication of testimonies on social networks. Via a socio-representational approach and from a critical gender perspective, this article aims to explore how people use digital media to communicate about the GE, and to analyse the experiences related to the GE and the representation systems underlying them. Using an inductive strategy, a corpus of discussion from the Doctissimo forum, and testimonies and comments from the PayeTonGynéco Facebook pages and Tumblr was created and submitted to lexicographical analysis. Our results suggest that the GE is indicative of a broader social function. People seem to use digital media to cope with a form of social ignorance of women’s experience in gynaecology with a certain ambivalence regarding their liberating potential."

I offer the concept of “echoic affiliation” to describe how PoV memes leverage TikTok’s “use this sound” function to construct ephemeral bonds between users. Furthermore, PoV memes textually articulate multiple perspectives, producing intersubjective encounters that reflect a platform imaginary in which “the algorithm” efficiently clusters similar people on the same “side” of the app. In the conclusions, I present a novel definition of PoV memes and reflect on the pivotal role of affiliation for TikTok’s platform vernacular."

It enables the reproduction of Henderson’s symmetric and Musgrave’s asymmetric filters used in the X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal adjustment algorithm. This paper proposes two extensions of local polynomial filters for real-time trend-cycle estimates: first including a timeliness criterion to minimize the phase shift; second with procedure for parametrizing asymmetric filters locally while they are generally parametrized globally, which can be suboptimal around turning points. An empirical comparison, based on simulated and real data, shows that modeling polynomial trends that are too complex introduces more revisions without reducing the phase shift, and that local parametrization reduces the delay in detecting turning points and reduces revisions. The results are reproducible and all the methods can be easily applied using the R package rjd3filters."

We introduce the standard survey estimators of the series of means, which are not guaranteed to be nondecreasing. We employ the Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm (PAVA) to turn the series of standard survey estimates into a nondecreasing series. We introduce five methods of constructing confidence intervals for the series of non-decreasing means: normal-theory intervals based on the standard survey point estimator of the mean and the Taylor series estimator of its variance; normal-theory intervals based on the nondecreasing PAVA estimator of the mean and a unique jackknife estimator of its variance developed here (jackknife-[Formula: see text]); intervals similar to the aforementioned method but based on Student’s-[Formula: see text] distribution (jackknife-[Formula: see text]); analytical intervals due to Morris; and simultaneous confidence limits due to Korn. We report the results of a Monte Carlo simulation and assess the methods’ performance under various scenarios. Jackknife-[Formula: see text] intervals exhibited coverage probabilities that are near the nominal value. Taylor, jackknife-[Formula: see text], and Korn intervals found coverage below the nominal value while Morris intervals were excessively conservative. Jackknife intervals were much narrower than Taylor intervals."

The application of a Continuous AutoRegressive Moving Average (CARMA) model is investigated as a tool to provide change of support applications, thereby allowing interpolation for published survey estimates. A simulation study provides comparisons of competing estimation methods, and a synthetically constructed data set is developed in order to elucidate real data applications. The proposed method can be successful for change of support problems, despite modeling challenges with the CARMA framework."

    "abstract": "While researchers have some recommendations for measuring gender identity in surveys based on research and other sources that are summarized in a series of working group and panel reports, we continue to refine our understanding and practices. Gender identity is usually measured in surveys using a categorical selection response format with a small number of response options (e.g., “female,” “male,” “nonbinary”) and an open text response field to capture additional responses (“not listed, please tell us”). There is limited research guiding researchers on the use of other response formats. This study reports results from a between-subjects experiment embedded in a campus climate survey about university students’ attitudes about their campus and their behaviors and experiences related to inclusion and belonging at a large Midwestern university in 2021. Over 13,000 students were asked “What is your gender?” and subsequently randomly assigned to respond using either a categorical selection response format or an open response format (i.e., a place to specify their gender with no response options listed). We examine the distribution of responses, item nonresponse, response times, and concurrent validity (in terms of the association between gender and relevant survey outcomes) across the two response formats. Findings indicate the categorical selection response format is preferred for this population. While results show similar distributions in the categorization of responses across the formats and similar relationships with other survey outcomes, the selection format is associated with less item nonresponse and shorter response times."

In three studies ( N = 2363, two preregistered), we examined censorship claims about (conservative-aligned) controversial COVID-19 topics. In Studies 1a and 2 participants read COVID-19 claims framed as censored or not. Conservatives reported more attraction to and belief in the claims, regardless of censorship condition, while liberals showed decreased interest and belief when information was presented as censored. Study 1b revealed divergent interpretations of suppression motives: liberals assumed censored information was harmful or false, whereas conservatives deemed it valuable and true. In Study 2, conservatives made more critical thinking errors in a vaccine risk reasoning task when information was framed as censored. Findings reveal the polarizing effects of forbidden knowledge frames."

This research has largely yielded that reappraisal is an effective strategy by which to change emotional experience, but implications of expressive suppression are not as clear. This may be due to variations in experimental methodologies, which have not consistently evaluated suppression against a within-subject control condition, as well as conceptual limitations that have muddled the implications of significant findings. Across two high-powered, within-subject paradigms, the present study demonstrates that expressive suppression induces significant decreases in negative emotion relative to one’s general attempts to downregulate negative emotion (Study 1) and respond naturally (Study 2). Our findings add to a growing body of literature that demonstrate that suppression may facilitate emotion regulation at both the expressive and experiential levels, and underscore the importance of incorporating flexibility and goal-focused frameworks in future research."

    "abstract": "Increasing honesty is critical in modern society. Moral Disengagement Tactics (MDTs) enable individuals to engage in unethical behavior while avoiding self-criticism, making MDTs a form of self-persuasion. One way to prevent persuasion is inoculation. Across three experiments ( N = 972), two preregistered, we randomly assigned individuals to a code of ethics versus inoculation to MDTs condition. Study 1 ( n = 443) found that those high in narcissism reported increased ethical intentions in the inoculation condition. Study 2 ( n = 224) replicated and extended this effect, finding that individuals high in narcissism were more likely to behave honestly in the inoculation condition. Study 3 ( n = 305) was a longitudinal study finding that inoculating those high in narcissism led to fewer lies over the past week’s inoculation. None of these interaction patterns emerged for Machiavellianism or psychopathy. Thus, inoculation to MDTs appears effective in reducing dishonesty among those high in narcissism."

    "abstract": "Movies are a massively popular and influential form of media, but their computational study at scale has largely been off-limits to researchers in the United States due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In this work, we illustrate use of a new regulatory framework to enable computational research on film that permits circumvention of technological protection measures on digital video discs (DVDs). We use this exemption to legally digitize a collection of 2,307 films representing the top 50 movies by U.S. box office over the period 1980 to 2022, along with award nominees. We design a computational pipeline for measuring the representation of gender and race/ethnicity in film, drawing on computer vision models for recognizing actors and human perceptions of gender and race/ethnicity. Doing so allows us to learn substantive facts about representation and diversity in Hollywood over this period, confirming earlier studies that see an increase in diversity over the past decade, while allowing us to use computational methods to uncover a range of ad hoc analytical findings. Our work illustrates the affordances of the data-driven analysis of film at a large scale."

    "abstract": "While female education has long been recognized as a key driver of fertility decline during the process of demographic transition and most population projection models consider it implicitly or explicitly in their forecasts of overall fertility, there still is need for a method to forecast education-specific fertility trends directly. Here we propose a method for projecting education-specific fertility declines for cohorts of women in Sub-Saharan Africa based on all available demographic and health surveys data for African countries (including 1.03Mio cases). We study at different levels of aggregation (sample clusters, strata, and national) the associations between ideal family size and completed cohort fertility for education groups, on the one hand, and the average level of education in those units, on the other. The consistently very strong empirical associations suggest a plausible narrative by which a higher prevalence of educated women in a spatial unit influences the fertility levels of women in all specific education categories. Empirical associations between education-specific cohort fertility trends at the national level and newly available quality-adjusted human capital data for these cohorts are then operationalized to produce education-specific population projections as they are needed for—among other uses—the shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios that are widely used in the climate change research community. Sensitivity analyses including out-of-sample projections support the validity of the proposed method which is then applied to 37 African countries."

    "abstract": "It has been widely recognized that technologies evolve with recombinant inventions. However, it remains unknown whether technologies developed using different approaches would exhibit different features during evolution. In particular, would technologies developed mainly based on accumulated experience in practices—formulas of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are typical examples of such technologies—have similar evolution features found in modern technologies? This study applied network science to explore the evolution of TCM from the perspective of recombinant inventions based on 59,063 TCM formulas documented over the last two thousand years, with each formula being a combination of components that are mostly herbs. Our results show that similar to modern technological systems, the TCM component networks maintained the core–periphery structures during evolution, and the (weighted) degrees of components followed heavy-tailed distributions. Moreover, simple tuples, which are frequently used combinations of TCM components, serve as building blocks for complex ones. A significant difference with modern technological systems is that the TCM core components were quite stable, while substitutions of core components are frequently observed in modern technological systems, leading to new technological trajectories. TCM comprises ancient knowledge and wisdom. This research provides insight into how it will be like in the future and what is important for its future."
