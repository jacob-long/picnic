    "authors": "James Lull",
    "abstract": "Classic structuration theory explains how social actors use their personal and collective agency to contend with the structural forces they encounter in everyday life. The antonimous interface between structure and agency is analyzed from an evolutionary communication perspective as it applies to structuration theory generally and to media audiences specifically. The explanatory power of structuration theory is then reconsidered in light of new research on an eternally profound question: Is the power of human agency restricted, if not entirely eliminated, by a lack of free will that can be exercised in human endeavors? Although the nature of structural influence is proving to be much broader than previously recognized, the agentive capacity of social actors is not diminished in light of the recent findings. But while people deploy their agency to maximize rewards from their engagements with media and other settings, they may not be the autonomous, real-time authors of that agency.",

    "authors": "Qing Yang, Xinhui Qiu, Yicheng Wang, Miao Lv",
    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of social networking sites (SNSs) has facilitated easy access to others’ shared content and life presentations, catalyzing upward social comparison. When faced with uncertainty, individuals tend to engage in upward social comparison as a self-evaluation tool, deriving ways for self-improvement and personal growth that may contribute to regained psychological stability. However, excessive indulgence in such comparisons may backfire, exacerbating intolerance of uncertainty (IU). Despite a theoretical link between IU and upward social comparison on SNS, no research has combined the two so far. Thoroughly exploring this issue holds significant practical importance, especially during emerging adulthood, because this period is characterized by an intricate transition from adolescence to full adulthood, marked by a variety of challenges and uncertainties. Therefore, we conducted a ten-month longitudinal study among emerging adults in China, with a mean age of 19.24 years (N = 460), to examine predictive relationships between IU and upward social comparison on SNS. We found such reciprocal associations using a three-wave cross-lagged panel model. Specifically, IU has a positive longitudinal predictive effect on the intensity of upward social comparisons on SNS. In contrast, upward social comparisons on SNS in the prior wave positively predicted IU in the subsequent wave, establishing a vicious cycle. Our findings may provide valuable insights for young social media users, helping them to cope more effectively with uncertainty and the pressures of social comparison, ultimately contributing to their emotional well-being.",

    "authors": "Xiang Niu, Philippe Verduyn, James Gaskin, Sebastian Scherr, Dean McDonnell, Jin-Liang Wang",
    "abstract": "Mixed findings regarding the relationship between social media (SM) use and mental health have left the research field at somewhat of a crossroads, with one significant requirement being a comprehensive tool to measure SM use. In an effort to advance relevant research, this study extends the common ‘active-passive model’ of SM use to develop and validate a comprehensive scale. This scale will measure complex SM behaviors, focusing on subtypes of active and passive use. A 29-item Extended Active-Passive Use Scale (E-APUS) developed for adolescents and young adults was validated using a total sample of individuals (N = 4,372) from four independent Chinese samples. An exploratory factor analysis with N1 = 305 and a confirmatory factor analysis with N2 = 289 revealed six dimensions characterizing engagement on SM. These dimensions include targeted-warm use, non-targeted-warm use, cold use, browsing high self-relevance success stories, browsing low self-relevance success stories, and browsing failure stories. The study confirmed measurement invariance (N3 = 3,524) across genders and educational stage groups (i.e., adolescents vs. young adults) through (multi-group) confirmatory factor analyses. Convergent validity of the E-APUS scale was established with active-passive SM use measures, and criterion validity was supported using indicators of subjective well-being. However, discriminant validity was comparatively lower for personality factors. The E-APUS scale exhibited good internal consistency and high test-retest reliability (N4 = 254) over a 2-week period. Summarily, the E-APUS emerges as an effective, valid, and reliable tool for measuring SM use.",

We conducted meta-analyses across 28 articles, comprising 33 studies and 146 effect sizes (2005–2024), to examine (a) message effects on psychological reactance and (b) the influence of psychological reactance on persuasion outcomes. Results showed that high freedom-threatening language increased anger (k = 28, r = .21), negative cognitions (k = 25, r = .17), and psychological reactance (k = 53, r = .20) compared to low freedom-threatening language. These effects were moderated by behavior repetitiveness and communication modality. However, gain vs. loss framing showed no significant differences in anger (k = 6, r = –.03), negative cognitions (k = 6, r = –.01), or psychological reactance (k = 12, r = –.02).

Leveraging the propositions of balance theory as suggested by Grizzard, Francemone et al. (2020), our findings demonstrate that moral information about a single character biases perceptions and judgments of other characters within the same narrative. Beyond replicating binary comparative judgments between characters, similar to past work on character interdependence, we show that the relational information conveyed by a character network can reveal how interdependent effects between several characters will manifest. Specifically, our results demonstrate that characters are either contrasted or assimilated to one another based on the relationship valences communicated by the narrative’s character network. Extrapolating from these findings, we discuss several aspects of character networks that should be considered to further develop the concept of character interdependence.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the effect of slogan specificity on the mobilization potential of movements on social media platforms. We argue that specific slogans attract more narrowly defined audiences with consistent interpretations. In contrast, vague slogans appeal to broader, more heterogeneous audiences whose interpretations are often diverse, inconsistent, and fragmented. To analyze the link between slogan specificity and mobilization potential, we introduce three concepts: diversity (the range of causes), consistency (continuity of cause related messages), and interconnectivity (the degree to which users refer to common causes). We test this argument on 709,222 tweets of the countermovements of Black Lives Matter (All Lives Matter, Blue/Police Lives Matter, and White Lives Matter) using network analysis and natural language processing techniques. Our findings substantiate the hypothesized trade-off between slogan specificity and mobilization potential. This study contributes to existing literature with a theoretical framework for understanding the mobilization dynamics of social movements in digital environments.",

Even less work has been done to examine how social media use may condition the relationships between cognitive orientations, such as epistemic and science populism beliefs, and climate change misperceptions. This study fills this gap by analyzing data from a national representative survey of 1405 US adults. Results confirmed the relationships between cognitive orientations and climate change misperceptions. While neither mainstream nor alternative social media use had a direct impact, both types of social media use conditioned the relationships between cognitive orientations and climate change misperceptions. This study’s findings suggest that social media use’s adverse impact on climate change misperceptions may have been overstated.",

However, it has focused primarily on Yandex’s web and news search algorithms and largely neglected Yandex’s popular top-5 news recommender algorithm. Therefore, this study investigates the role of news embedded on Yandex’s homepage—on the side to its search functionality—in disseminating Russia’s propaganda to foreign audiences and tracks its evolution over time. To do so, I audited Yandex’s top-5 news algorithm in Belarus from 2010 to 2022. By analyzing 474,663 news headlines from Yandex’s homepage ( yandex.by ) in Belarus, I found that (1) on a monthly average, the majority (52.2%) of Yandex’s top-5 news in Belarus came from sources with explicit connections to Russia’s ruling elites, and (2) a substantial portion of the news was political, with the share of political news increasing over time. In addition, Yandex in Belarus (3) frequently featured news about Russia or Russian actors, which appeared almost exclusively in the default domestic top news section for Belarus as opposed to the top news happening in the world, and (4) experienced a notable decline in the presence of Kremlin-critical news sources, marked by the complete disappearance of Western and Russian opposition websites in late 2018–2019 and the disappearance of Belarusian opposition websites shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. These findings demonstrate the gradual political appropriation of Yandex’s top-5 news algorithms by Russia’s ruling elites, marking Yandex as a propaganda tool of the Kremlin.",

    "abstract": "With artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly shaping newsroom practices, scholars debate how citizens perceive news attributed to algorithms versus human journalists. Yet, little is known about these preferences in today’s polarized media environment, where partisan news consumption has surged. The current study explores this issue by providing a comprehensive and systematic examination of how citizens evaluate AI-attributed news compared to human-based news from like-minded and cross-cutting partisan sources. Using a preregistered conjoint experiment in the United States ( N = 2,011) that mimics a high-choice media environment, we find that citizens evaluate AI-attributed news as negatively as cross-cutting news sources, both in terms of attitudes (perceived trustworthiness) and behavior (willingness to read the news story), while strongly preferring like-minded sources. These patterns remain stable across polarizing and non-polarizing issues and persist regardless of citizens’ preexisting attitudes toward AI, political extremity, and media trust. Our findings thus challenge more optimistic views about AI’s potential to facilitate exposure to diverse viewpoints. Moreover, they suggest that increased automation of news production faces both public mistrust and substantial reader resistance, raising concerns about the future viability of AI in journalism.",

    "authors": "Maximilian Overbeck, Keren Tenenboim-Weinblatt, Christian Baden",
    "abstract": "Traditional agenda-setting research often focuses on the most urgent problems that dominate present public agendas. Challenging the prevalent conflation of importance with urgency in agenda-setting research, this article proposes a shift from a singular to a layered temporal conceptualization of public agendas. The suggested framework distinguishes between the immediate agenda, which addresses problems perceived as most urgent, and the delayed agenda, which focuses on issues deemed most important for the future. Enriching agenda-setting theory with insights from construal level theory, the study examines the psychological and media-related factors shaping the placement of topics on these agendas. Drawing upon original survey data and a large-scale news content analysis from the French 2022 Presidential Elections, as well as survey data from the 2023 to 2024 war in Israel and Gaza, the findings provide empirical support for the proposed framework. The results indicate that participants prioritize psychologically proximate issues on the immediate agenda, whereas psychologically distant issues gain importance on the delayed agenda. Additionally, we identify media agenda-setting effects that extend beyond the immediate temporal layer. Specifically, both studies provide evidence for a media priming effect, where news exposure increases issue salience without affecting temporal layering. The Israeli case reveals additional initial evidence for an urgency effect, where news exposure boosts issue salience of some issues primarily on the immediate agenda. Overall, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of public agendas and news media effects, introducing a temporally nuanced perspective that enriches classical approaches to agenda-setting research.",

While existing research has examined the direct effects of these factors on beliefs, two overlooked key aspects are addressed in this article. First, I investigate how interpersonal communication interacts with the impact of negativity in news on shaping beliefs. Second, building upon media system dependency theory, I accounted for the temporal dynamics of media effects since the pandemic evolved and progressed in phases with shifting societal contexts. By relying on a linkage approach consisting of a five-wave panel survey and a quantitative media content analysis conducted in Sweden, the findings indicate that interpersonal communication serves as an amplifying moderator for exposure to negativity in forming beliefs about the negative societal impact of COVID-19. Furthermore, I find evidence supporting the temporally varying nature of media effects, with the influence of negativity decreasing as the crisis dragged on.",

I find small or non-existent effects for the overall population, substantial negative effects for Democrats, and substantial positive effects for Republicans. Moreover, and despite Democratic politicians’ attempt to distance themselves from the “defund” position, these partisan effects have persisted, with Democratic backlash against police notably larger than Republican increases in support.",

In response, scholars have put forward new democratic designs that enhance the democratic system's inclusiveness and popular control, thereby aiming to decrease populism among citizens, or so‐called populist attitudes. However, it is not known whether populist attitudes are even changeable, and whether they respond to such democratic improvements or merely reflect the populist ideas supplied by populist parties. This paper explores the behavior of populist attitudes over time and considers possible drivers of populist attitudes change. For doing so, it conducts a latent growth curve analysis of panel data from the Netherlands and Great Britain spanning approximately four years and containing 16 and 6 waves, respectively. The analyses show that populist attitudes fluctuate over time, and that changes in populist attitudes are associated with changes in democratic satisfaction. This implies that populist attitudes could function as a thermometer of a political system's perceived democratic quality.",

Our results suggest that researchers should think carefully about the conditions under which they may make claims about belief change at the individual level. To guide substantive theory‐building, we propose a concise diagnostic routine researchers can use to translate their claims into a set of plausible alternatives and evaluate potential generative processes.

    "abstract": "As the use of computational text analysis in the social sciences has increased, topic modeling has emerged as a popular method for identifying latent themes in textual data. Nevertheless, concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the results produced by this method, given that it is largely automated and inductive in nature, and the lack of clear guidelines for validating topic models has been identified by scholars as an area of concern. In response, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review of 789 studies that employ topic modeling. Our goal is to investigate whether the field is moving toward a common framework for validating these models. The findings of our review indicate a notable absence of standardized validation practices and a lack of convergence toward specific methods of validation. This gap may be attributed to the inherent incompatibility between the inductive, qualitative approach of topic modeling and the deductive, quantitative tradition that favors standardized validation. To address this, we advocate for incorporating qualitative validation approaches, emphasizing transparency and detailed reporting to improve the credibility of findings in computational social science research when using topic modeling.",

But text-as-data methods continue to dominate as modes of classification, as multimodal social media data are costly to collect and label. Researchers who face a budget constraint may need to make informed decisions regarding whether to collect and label only the textual content of social media data or their full multimodal content. In this article, we develop five measures and an experimental framework to assist with these decisions. We propose five performance metrics to measure the costs and benefits of multimodal labeling: average time per post, average time per valid response, valid response rate, intercoder agreement, and classifier’s predictive power. To estimate these measures, we introduce an experimental framework to evaluate coders’ performance under text-only and multimodal labeling conditions. We illustrate the method with a tweet labeling experiment.",

We examine the relationship between “receptiveness to opposing views” (i.e., an individual difference in the willingness to engage with information from opposing perspectives) and the propensity to form positive and close collaborative relationships with ideologically opposed others. Across three studies varying in sampling and methodological approaches—a retrospective network study, a time-lagged field study, and an experiment—we find that individual and mutual receptiveness mitigate the negative influence of ideological opposition on relationship formation and willingness to collaborate. We find evidence that receptiveness is distinctively influential as compared to related personality characteristics (e.g., extraversion, self-monitoring, agreeableness, openness, and intellectual humility). These findings contribute to our understanding of how individual differences shape social network formation and collaboration across ideological divides.",

A first step towards such a theory is to create a computational model that can predict human behaviour in a wide range of settings. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behaviour in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art language model on a large-scale dataset called Psych-101. Psych-101 has an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from more than 60,000 participants performing in excess of 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behaviour of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but it also generalizes to previously unseen cover stories, structural task modifications and entirely new domains. Furthermore, the model’s internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after fine-tuning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behaviour across a wide range of domains. We believe that such models provide tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories, and we present a case study to demonstrate this.",

However, it remains unclear whether empathy, encompassing understanding, ‘feeling with’ and caring, is perceived differently when attributed to AI versus humans. We conducted nine studies (n = 6,282) where AI-generated empathic responses to participants’ emotional situations were labelled as provided by either humans or AI. Human-attributed responses were rated as more empathic and supportive, and elicited more positive and fewer negative emotions, than AI-attributed ones. Moreover, participants’ own uninstructed belief that AI had aided the human-attributed responses reduced perceived empathy and support. These effects were replicated across varying response lengths, delays, iterations and large language models and were primarily driven by responses emphasizing emotional sharing and care. Additionally, people consistently chose human interaction over AI when seeking emotional engagement. These findings advance our general understanding of empathy, and specifically human–AI empathic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Has ideological polarization actually increased in the past decades, or have voters simply sorted themselves into parties matching their ideology more closely? Here we present a methodology to quantify multidimensional ideological polarization by embedding the respondents to a wide variety of political, social and economic topics from the American National Election Studies into a two-dimensional ideological space. By identifying several demographic attributes of the American National Election Studies respondents, we chart how political and socioeconomic groups move through the ideological space in time. We observe that income and especially racial groups align into parties, but their ideological distance has not increased over time. Instead, Democrats and Republicans have become ideologically more distant in the past 30 years: Both parties moved away from the centre, at different rates. Furthermore, Democratic voters have become ideologically more heterogeneous after 2010, indicating that partisan sorting has declined in the past decade.",

    "title": "Tendencies toward triadic closure: Field experimental evidence",
    "authors": "Mohsen Mosleh, Dean Eckles, David G. Rand",
    "abstract": "Empirical social networks are characterized by a high degree of triadic closure (i.e., transitivity, clustering): network neighbors of the same individual are also likely to be directly connected. It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form such ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se versus other processes such as homophily and more opportunities for exposure. These mechanisms are difficult to disentangle in many settings. On social media, however, they can be decomposed - and platforms frequently make decisions that depend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we randomize the existing network structure that a user faces when they are followed by a target account that we control. We then examine whether the user reciprocates this tie formation. Being randomly assigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie formation by 35%. Through multiple control conditions, we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that indicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure should be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and accordingly we find larger effects when the subject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial role for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what might be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these tendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and information diffusion in online networks.",
