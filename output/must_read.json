    "abstract": "This preregistered study aimed to design and validate a questionnaire which measures passive and active Instagram use (iPAUM), and to explore its connection to users’ self-esteem levels. While Instagram, as an image-based social media platform, shares common features with other social networking sites (SNS) in enabling sharing of information and social interaction, its emphasis on visual content and specific digital features, such as algorithmic exposure to strangers’ content and public and one-directional interaction, may influence user experiences differently compared to other SNSs. Individual users interact with Instagram in a variety of ways. Consequently, studies that rely on general use measures, such as the time spent on Instagram, often yield mixed results in regard to psychological outcomes, as these measures do not account for variability in use. To address these nuances, a new scale for Instagram behaviours was created in two phases. In Study 1 (N = 289, Mage = 30.4, SD = 10.21), an 18-item questionnaire was developed, reflecting four categories of Instagram use: Active reacting, Active direct social, Active creating, and Passive use. The four-factor structure was established through exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and good internal reliability and validity were demonstrated. In Study 2 (N = 297, Mage = 29.6, SD = 9.8), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on an independent sample to validate the factor structure, confirming the reliability and discriminant validity of the measure. In the second part of Study 2, the iPAUM was employed to investigate associations between the four types of Instagram use and self-esteem, and whether following strangers on Instagram moderates this relationship. Self-esteem was not significantly associated with most types of Instagram use, except for a negative association between self-esteem and active direct social use, which was moderated by the percentage of strangers followed. The findings confirm the importance of differentiating between various types of Instagram use. The iPAUM is a validated tool which provides a more nuanced view of Instagram use for future research.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of short video platforms has raised concerns about their potential impact on young people’s mental health and well-being. However, the dynamic relationship between short video use and daily anxiety symptoms remains poorly understood. To address this gap, this study employed the experience sampling method (ESM) and dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM) to examine their bidirectional relationship in a representative sample of Chinese young adults (N = 389; Mage = 20.38 years, SD = 1.44 years; 51.1% male). The results indicated that at the within-person level, there were no significant bidirectional effects between short video use (i.e., active use, passive use, or total use time) and daily anxiety symptoms. However, upward social comparison tendency moderated the within-person effect of passive short video use on subsequent anxiety symptoms. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of upward social comparison experienced greater anxiety during periods of increased passive short video use. In contrast, those with lower levels of upward social comparison experienced less anxiety under similar conditions. These findings suggest that while short video use may not directly contribute to daily anxiety, its psychological impact is contingent upon individual differences in social comparison. In particular, those prone to upward comparison may be more vulnerable to anxiety during passive consumption of short video content.",

Guided by the theory of dyadic morality, the limited capacity model of motivated-mediated message processing, and exemplification theory, we investigated how safety threats shaped individuals’ physiological responses and behavioral moral decision-making. Using an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment simulating a moral tradeoff, participants crossed a deep pit and made decisions between their safety and that of another person, reflecting a tradeoff between egoism and altruism. Results from an experiment with 201 participants revealed that exposure to threat increased arousal (physiologically and self-reported), which decreased the extent to which they felt their decision harmed others, leading to selfish decisions in the moral dilemma. However, this pattern only manifested when concerns of harm were not made salient before the threatening experience. Together, these findings demonstrate VR’s utility for simulating moral tradeoffs and advancing both psychophysiological and behavioral approaches to media psychology and morality research.",

Accordingly, mobile media augment human cognitive processes by being accessible to users as they move through and act in the world. Moreover, this theory accounts for the emergence of mobile autonomous systems that can move through and act in the world, in the absence of human cognition. As an analytical tool, this theory can be applied to understand specificities of how humans and nonhumans act, move, know, and produce agential change in the world.

In addition to 30 expert interviews, the study finds that fact-checkers prioritize counter-speech and transparency, rejecting a permissive “anything goes” stance. Some support removals in cases involving incitement to violence, illegality, or harmful health misinformation. Most agree that freedom of expression should not guarantee algorithmic amplification.

Efforts to strengthen cybersecurity have been hindered by a lack of knowledge about the prevalence and dynamics of smartphone sharing, resulting in blind spots in cybersecurity design and policy. Based on a survey of 967 Australian adults who use smartphones and have been in an intimate relationship, we found that 70% share access to their mobile phones with their intimate partners. This high rate of shared access indicates that one-user, one-device threat models are inadequate for promoting cybersecurity in realistic use conditions. Such models are particularly ill-suited to intimate relationship contexts where the parties are more likely to share devices than not. Our findings provide previously unavailable baseline information about mainstream smartphone-sharing practices. This evidence can be used to improve privacy protections for telecommunications users in Australia and elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "In the digital age, philanthropy is increasingly mediated by platform microcelebrities who mobilize audiences for social good. This study examines the novel philanthropic model of YouTube creator Jimmy Donaldson as a case of outsourced activism , characterized by a dual-outsourcing structure: audiences transfer charitable intent and contributions (via attention-as-currency) to Donaldson, who acts as a central agent and then outsources execution to NGOs and collaborators. Using a mixed-methods design combining a walkthrough, multimodal discourse analysis of 101 videos, and topic modeling of 11,208 comments, we demonstrate how sentimental and digital spectacles sustain this process as tools for activism. The mechanism forms a new connective practice, creating a network of moral delegation and affective investment among audiences, creators, sponsors, and NGOs. Yet, it raises ethical concerns, including depoliticizing social issues and reinforcing unequal power relations. The study advances theories of media activism, connective action, and digital philanthropy by identifying a replicable logic that redefines agency, accountability, and civic participation in platform societies.",

    "abstract": "Social media has grown to be a large part of our virtual connectedness online. However, with this growth in digital connection, we have also become connected with digital entities that run them (social media). Borrowing from the concept of interpersonal responsiveness, researchers have found that users perceive their algorithm to be responsive to their needs and sensitive to their identity have a greater sense of well-being online and media enjoyment. However, the mechanisms for which these connect with one another (responsiveness predicting subjective well-being) remain to be disentangled. Guided by self-determination theory, this study examines whether autonomy, competence, and relatedness satisfaction through TikTok use mediate the associations between perceived algorithm responsiveness and insensitivity and satisfaction with life. With an online survey ( N = 385), our study found that greater responsiveness is associated with greater life satisfaction mediated through greater relatedness satisfaction. However, greater competence satisfaction was associated with lower life satisfaction. Future research and current limitations in light of our findings are discussed.",

Situating the multiple crises in a long-term perspective on the transformation of party systems, we emphasize their reinforcing effect on the structuring capacity of the new cultural divide. In some countries, this divide and its main driving forces have become so powerful in transforming the political space that we observe an emerging multi-polar pattern of party configurations. This pattern is characterized by a green new left opposed to the populist radical right on the new cultural dimension. In contrast, the center-left and the center-right, despite converging, still oppose each other on the economic dimension. Empirically, the article examines election campaigns in Austria, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, drawing on the original PolDem relational content analysis of mass media coverage published before national elections from the 1970s up to 2022.",

    "abstract": "Far-right communication often portrays a division between ‘the people’ and perceived antagonists, potentially fuelling intergroup tensions. A pivotal element is the politicisation of religion: in Christian-shaped regions, far-right parties invoke Christianity as part of Western identity – despite their weak religious ties and growing secularisation. This paradox raises questions about religion’s function in far-right discourse. I argue that far-right parties systematically use a conservative reading of Christianity as a demarcation tool – marking not only Islam but also cultural liberalism as incompatible with a Christian-framed ingroup. Using parliamentary data from Europe, I conduct automated text classification to identify religious markers and their co-occurrence with inclusionary–exclusionary rhetoric across countries and over time. Results reveal group-specific framing, distinct patterns of religious invocation compared to other parties, and links of these patterns to events. This study demonstrates how Christian narratives serve as rhetorical resources for boundary construction, challenging the cohesion of even secularised societies.",

This paper bridges a gap between computer and political science in multimodal data analysis using audio. The adoption of multimodal analyses in political science (e.g., video/audio with text-as-data approaches) has been relatively slow due to unequal distribution of computational power and skills needed. We provide solutions to challenges encountered when analyzing audio, advancing the potential for multimodal data analysis in political science. Using a dataset of all televised U.S. presidential debates from 1960 to 2020, we focus on three features encountered when analyzing audio data: low-level descriptors (LLDs), such as pitch or energy; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs); and audio embeddings/encodings, like Wav2Vec. We showcase four applications: (a) forced alignment of audio text using MFCCs, time-stamping transcripts, and speaker information; (b) speech characterization using LLDs; (c) custom-made classification models with audio embeddings and MFCCs; and (d) emotional recognition models using Wav2Vec for classification of discrete emotions and their valence-arousal dominance. We provide explanations to help understand how these features can be applied for different political research questions and advice on vigilance to naive interpretation, for both experienced researchers and those who want to start working with audio.",

    "abstract": "The literature presents two contrasting accounts on how cognitive reflection (overriding intuition with deliberation) influences susceptibility to political misinformation. According to the classical reasoning account, predominantly rooted in research on soft news, cognitive reflection improves discernment of true from false information. According to the motivated reasoning account, rooted in research on hard (policy‐related) issues, individuals prone to cognitive reflection display stronger political bias and fall for politically congruent misinformation. We integrate these accounts by examining how the soft‐hard distinction interacts with individuals' reasoning style to shape truth discernment and susceptibility to political bias. An integrative data analysis (IDA) combined data from 18 political misinformation studies ( N = 41,289) with independent soft‐hard news ratings. Additionally, two experiments ( N = 666), in the United States and Greece, exposed participants to either soft or hard news. Across all datasets, participants prone to cognitive reflection displayed stronger political bias, but only when evaluating hard news. Cognitive reflection was associated with improved truth discernment for soft and hard news in the IDA, but not consistently so in the experiments. Our findings reconcile discrepancies in misinformation research and demonstrate that cognitive reflection is not a one‐size‐fits‐all solution to political misinformation as it can exacerbate bias in policy‐related issues.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 15 years or so, many studies have compared the accuracy of estimates produced when the same questionnaire is administered to samples generated using probability and nonprobability sampling methods. Most studies conclude that estimates from probability sample surveys are more accurate than estimates from nonprobability sample surveys. In trying to understand why probability sample surveys generally produce more accurate estimates than nonprobability sample surveys, most research has focused on the differences in survey samples reached as a result of the sampling mechanisms used by each approach, and looked to various adjustment (weighting) approaches to bring the nonprobability sample estimates closer to the comparative probability sample estimates and independent benchmarks. Less common, however, are comparative studies that focus on measurement error. This study compares estimates generated from five Australian online panels; one probability-based online panel and four nonprobability online panels. We use widely implemented techniques to identify instances of survey satisficing—the phenomenon of survey respondents providing lower quality responses to reduce cognitive effort. When comparing the level of satisficing across panels, a higher proportion of respondents in the nonprobability panels give responses consistent with satisficing than in the probability panel. We then show that excluding these suboptimal responses from our analysis dataset, before weighting, results in a greater bias reduction across the nonprobability panels than weighting alone, and that this is the case across all four nonprobability panels. In contrast, very little change to bias is observed after applying the same exclusions to the probability panel. We end with a call for others to undertake similar research in the hope that this approach might become part of the toolkit of techniques being developed to reduce the bias in survey estimates generated from nonprobability online samples.",

Results show no overall effects of third-party fact-checking on users’ propensity for conspiratorial beliefs. However, when individuals with high conspiracy mentality and strong conservative identification encounter a fact-check, they are more likely to endorse Facebook-related conspiracy beliefs.

Grounded in diffusion of innovation theory, we ask: What factors predict the adoption and use of these emerging platforms? We compiled original data on all members of Congress ( N = 535) by collecting social media account information from official congressional websites and manually verifying platform presence. Adoption was measured as a binary variable, and usage as the number of posts made through November 2023. Using probit and OLS regression models, we tested predictors including party affiliation, age, race, leadership status, and prior digital engagement. The empirical analyses reveal that Democrats and younger legislators are more likely to adopt Threads and TikTok. Prior digital engagement consistently predicts usage on both platforms. Notably, racial identity plays a critical role: non-white members are more likely to adopt and use TikTok, while white members are more likely to use Threads. This study offers the first empirical analysis of congressional adoption and usage of Threads and TikTok. Our findings demonstrate that platform choice is shaped by identity, institutional context, and political strategy. These findings offer new insights into the determinants of early platform adoption among U.S. congress members and the importance of aligning communication choices with constituent behavior and platform culture.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics of anti-Muslim hate speech within Norwegian social media during the period between 2010 and 2021. Using a dataset of more than one million comments from Twitter and Facebook, we developed a custom hate speech classifier trained on an annotated corpus of 3,277 comments in Norwegian language. We identify that despite representing a small share of the total comments, hate speech content has increased over time. In an effort to understand the social network characteristics of hate speech content, we delve deeper into Twitter conversations as we can more easily identify how this content is spread. We develop network metrics to assess the prevalence, distribution, and diffusion of hateful content. The findings reveal that regardless of the number of users or tweets in a conversation, the volume of hateful content tends to remain constant. Furthermore, a small fraction of users contribute disproportionately to the dissemination of hate speech, with most conversations being limited in participant diversity. These results contribute to the growing field of computational social science by offering a novel methodology for studying hate speech in under-resourced languages and suggesting that mitigating hate speech may be possible through targeted network interventions rather than content removal alone.",

    "abstract": "This study examined how well large language models (LLMs) approximate human psychological ratings for early-acquired English words. We used four state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o and Meta-Llama-3.1, to evaluate 21 static psychological features for 695 words and compared these estimates with human norms. The results showed that LLMs aligned well with human ratings for some features (e.g., Concreteness, Bodily Interactiveness) in terms of rank correlations ( r s &gt; .82) and distributional similarities but diverged notably for others (e.g., Iconicity, Arousal; r s &lt; .48). Compared with content words, function words showed more pronounced discrepancies between human and LLM ratings. We also assessed how similarly human- and LLM-derived psychological features predicted words’ age of acquisition (AoA), revealing both strong correspondences and systematic biases, depending on the model (differences in correlations ranged from −.27 to .28). Based on these analyses, we identified which features may be reliably estimated using LLMs, which require further refinement, and what methodological considerations are necessary for applying LLM-based measures in cognitive science. We discuss the implications of using LLMs as methodological tools in psychology and cognitive science, highlighting both their practical advantages (e.g., data coverage and data collection efficiency) and theoretical relevance. The present study provides a novel framework for evaluating the cognitive plausibility of LLMs by using lexical psychological features, complementing existing benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The spread of disinformation is widely regarded as one of the most serious global risks. In one laboratory and three online experiments ( N total = 3,066), we measured trust in true, false, and disinformation statements related to the Russo–Ukrainian war (Experiments 1–3) and to politics, climate, and health (Experiment 4). We examined longer-term effectiveness of a fact-based corrective message delivered either before (prebunking) or after (debunking) participants’ initial evaluation of disinformation statements. Across all four experiments, debunking intervention consistently and substantially reduced trust in disinformation, with effects persisting for at least two weeks. Prebunking intervention produced similarly durable benefits only when it was immediately followed by evaluation of the just-corrected disinformation. When evaluation was delayed, prebunking had no reliable impact. We found no significant backfire effects on trust in disinformation across any ideological groups. However, debunking induced a more conservative response pattern overall, reducing trust in true statements as well.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the complexities of midpoint and non-substantive responses, such as “Don’t Know,” in Likert scale surveys on gender attitudes. While existing research often assumes these responses are neutral or random, this study challenges that notion by applying the item response tree model to disentangle respondents’ attitudes from their response tendencies. Analysis of data from the Chinese General Social Survey shows that traditional gender attitudes are associated with a higher likelihood of such responses, indicating biases in conventional methods. After disentangling these elements, I reassemble them through latent profile analysis to examine the dominant configurations of gender attitudes and response tendencies. Five distinct profiles emerge: Passionate Egalitarians, Genuine Neutrals, Forthright Moderates, Evasive Traditionalists, and Unembellished Traditionalists. Passionate Egalitarians advocate strongly for gender equality, while Evasive Traditionalists use non-substantive responses to conceal traditional views. This study provides a refined approach to rating scale analysis, advancing both sociological methodology and gender studies.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary personality assessment relies heavily on psychometric scales, which offer efficiency but risk oversimplifying the rich and contextual nature of personality. Recognizing these limitations, this study explores the use of commercially available generative large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Claude and so on, to assess personality traits from open-ended qualitative narratives. Across two distinct samples and methodologies (spontaneous streams of thought and daily video diaries), we used seven commercial, generative LLMs to score Big-Five personality traits, achieving convergence with self-report measures comparable to or exceeding established benchmarks (for example, self–other agreement, ecological momentary assessment, and bespoke machine learning models). Although results differed across different LLMs, we found that using the average LLM score across models provided the strongest agreement with self-report. Further, LLM-generated trait scores also demonstrated predictive validity regarding daily behaviours and mental health outcomes. This LLM-based approach achieved quantitative rigour based on qualitative data and is easily accessible without specialized training. Importantly, our findings also reaffirm that personality is expressed ubiquitously, in that it is carried in the stream of our thoughts and is woven into the fabric of our daily lives. These results encourage broader adoption of generative LLMs for psychological assessment and—given the new generation of tools—stress the value of idiographic narratives as reliable sources of psychological insight.",

    "abstract": "“More than 1 in 8 LGBTQ people live in states where doctors can refuse to treat them.” This headline describes a flurry of laws passed in 2025 allowing doctors to refuse treatment of LGBTQ patients based on personal beliefs. This and other laws like it limit healthcare access and exacerbate health inequality for LGBTQ individuals. But health is not the only domain in which LGBTQ individuals face disparities. Long-standing inequalities also exist in other domains of life, for example, gay men earn up to 32% less wages than their heterosexual peers. In the current research, we ask if exposure to LGBTQ inequality in one domain (e.g., health) motivates more support for action than exposure to inequality in other domains (e.g., economics). In six experiments (five preregistered), we test our hypothesis that emphasizing health-based LGBTQ inequality (vs. economics and belonging) spurs engagement with and support for mitigating action (S1-2). We also investigate why people support action (S1a-1b) and what boosts support (S3a-3c). As predicted and preregistered, we find greater support for action to mitigate health-based LGBTQ inequality, compared to economics and belonging. This occurs, in part, because people blame LGBTQ individuals less for health (vs. economic) disparities and perceive health inequalities to violate morally sacred values, which is associated with greater perceived injustice. Finally, we find that connecting economic inequality to health inequality in individuals’ minds can increase support for mitigating economic inequality.",
