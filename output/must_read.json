    "abstract": "The article explores the social role and implications of large language models (LLMs) through the lens of media theory. Rather than considering LLMs as advanced forms of artificial intelligence, I argue that a communication-focused perspective provides a more effective way to interpret their impact on information management in contemporary society and to address the associated ethical and operational challenges. Supported by information management tools such as archives, catalogs, and later search engines, previous communication media expanded the scope of communication, making it possible to reach more, distant, diverse, and possibly anonymous communication partners. LLMs now signify a new phase in the evolution of communication, as they function themselves as communication partners capable of responding autonomously to user queries in a personalized manner. This perspective highlights and explains the capabilities and limitations of various LLM-based chatbots and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, while also addressing issues such as misalignment and hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: In recent decades, social media has become an integral part of adolescents’ daily life, reshaping peer interactions. To overcome the limitations of the quantitative approach of adolescents’ social media use when investigating relationships with psychological outcomes, motivational factors have become increasingly popular. The first aim was to review the psychometric properties of existent tools used to measure adolescents’ social media use motives. The second objective was to elaborate a classification of the main motives among adolescents. Following PRISMA guidelines, 14 articles were reviewed based on the search of 5 databases. Psychometric properties were examined based on the COSMIN guidelines. The reviewed articles showed a heterogeneous process, with only two of them considered as a satisfying procedure of development and validation. Based on the Use and Gratification Theory, a classification of the five main motives for adolescents’ social media use was developed. Overall, this study encourages the pursuit of studies on social media use among adolescence, while carefully choosing a tool with satisfying psychometric properties.",

We examined the topics, prevalence of different moralities and how these moralities explain talk of collective action for different ideological groups. Across all issues and ideological groups, talk of action was most often associated with talk of authority but ideological differences between left- and right-leaning participants emerged. Among left-leaning people, action was motivated by a range of moral foundations, but among right-leaning people action was primarily motivated by authority. Our findings map the ideological diversity found within modern town halls and confirm the critical role of these settings in contemporary socio-political life.",

However, research on the relationship between weaponized information and polarization remains limited due to conceptual ambiguities and geographical context. This study uses cross-sectional survey data ( N = 520) collected across eight provinces in Afghanistan to explore the direct and indirect association between exposure to disinformation and malinformation online and ethnic polarization. Findings through mediation analyses reveal that exposure to disinformation was not associated with ethnic polarization, either directly or indirectly. Conversely, exposure to malinformation was directly associated with ethnic polarization and indirectly linked to it through increased ingroup positive perception. These findings highlight the nuanced difference in how intentional falsehoods and the harmful misuse of accurate information shape polarization dynamics in ethnically diverse and polarized societies.",

However, most studies have been conducted in the US, where low turnout and high partisanship create optimal conditions for such a strategy. In this study, we analyze novel data on political parties’ use of targeting in Facebook and Instagram ads to examine the nature of microtargeting. The context of the 2022 Danish general election - with multiple parties, high voter turnout, and low partisanship - is a hard case for the mobilization thesis. Yet, in line with existing literature, we find that political parties focus their online targeting strategies on existing voters. However, the findings also suggest that political parties adjust their messages to conform with the presumed preferences of the targeted group, highlighting heterogeneity in the mobilization strategy.",

    "abstract": "The literature presents two contrasting accounts on how cognitive reflection (overriding intuition with deliberation) influences susceptibility to political misinformation. According to the classical reasoning account, predominantly rooted in research on soft news, cognitive reflection improves discernment of true from false information. According to the motivated reasoning account, rooted in research on hard (policy‐related) issues, individuals prone to cognitive reflection display stronger political bias and fall for politically congruent misinformation. We integrate these accounts by examining how the soft‐hard distinction interacts with individuals' reasoning style to shape truth discernment and susceptibility to political bias. An integrative data analysis (IDA) combined data from 18 political misinformation studies ( N = 41,289) with independent soft‐hard news ratings. Additionally, two experiments ( N = 666), in the United States and Greece, exposed participants to either soft or hard news. Across all datasets, participants prone to cognitive reflection displayed stronger political bias, but only when evaluating hard news. Cognitive reflection was associated with improved truth discernment for soft and hard news in the IDA, but not consistently so in the experiments. Our findings reconcile discrepancies in misinformation research and demonstrate that cognitive reflection is not a one‐size‐fits‐all solution to political misinformation as it can exacerbate bias in policy‐related issues.",

The long‐standing theory that party cues function as “heuristics” provides an answer, predicting that variation in exposure to policy information, a propensity for effortful thinking, or both causally affects the influence of party cues. However, this prediction has escaped decisive empirical testing to date, leaving in its wake a string of mixed results. Here we characterize the challenges that limit previous tests, and report on two large‐scale experiments designed to overcome them. We find that exposure to policy information causally attenuates the influence of party cues, but engagement in effortful thinking per se does not. Our results advance understanding of the “when” and “why” of party cue influence; clarify a number of previously ambiguous findings; and have broad theoretical, methodological, and normative implications for understanding the influence of party cues.",

    "abstract": "Acquiescent response style (ARS) is the tendency to agree with measurement items regardless of their content. ARS tends to differ across cultures, making it particularly relevant for cross-cultural research, as it may disrupt cross-cultural comparability. Balanced measurement scales include items written in different directions of the measured construct and are hypothesized to be a remedy for undesirable effects of ARS. This study examined the effect on measurement properties of three scale balancing approaches in a cross-cultural research setting: (i) unbalanced scales; (ii) scale balancing with negated items where some of the items were written with a negation, such as “no” or “not”; and (iii) scale balancing that introduce items written with polar opposite terms (e.g. “unhappy” as the opposite of “satisfied”) that reversed the item direction without using negations. This study examined these approaches on four well-being measurement scales, originally unbalanced, that used an Agree-Disagree Likert response scale. Participants were recruited to a Web survey from three groups: U.S. non-Hispanic whites (n = 1,200, interviewed in English), U.S. Hispanics (n = 1,200, interviewed in English), and Mexicans (n = 1,200, interviewed in Spanish). Respondents were randomly assigned to one scale-balancing conditions for well-being measures. Balanced scales outperformed unbalanced scales for convergent validity, with higher correlations observed between scale scores and validation measures. Between negated and polar opposite balancing, no statistical differences were observed in factorial model fit, reliability, or convergent validity. This study supports that, when designed carefully, balanced measurement scales may be effective for addressing ARS and improving measurement properties over unbalanced scales.",

    "abstract": "Survey research is entering a new era which centres on its linkage with other forms of digitally generated data such as social media. Many suggest that this can help to address existing weaknesses in self-report surveys such as non-response and measurement bias. However, to link a participant’s survey responses to their social media data, consent from the participant is required. Previous studies have shown that consent to linkage is typically low and selective. This paper expands on the existing literature by comparing Twitter (now X) usage and consent to survey linkage across five national contexts. Testing the effects of several sociodemographic and attitudinal predictors in the US, the UK, France, Germany and Poland, our study finds that overall consent rates vary significantly by age, political attention, privacy concern, trust in social media companies and frequency of political posting on Twitter/X. However, our results also confirm that variable effects differ significantly between nations, suggesting a moderating cultural influence. Within-country variation in the US between 2020 and 2024 is also present, indicating that effects are not necessarily fixed over time. These findings dictate the need for caution when conducting substantive comparisons across countries and time when using social media data.",

Using a dataset of more than one million comments from Twitter and Facebook, we developed a custom hate speech classifier trained on an annotated corpus of 3,277 comments in Norwegian language. We identify that despite representing a small share of the total comments, hate speech content has increased over time. In an effort to understand the social network characteristics of hate speech content, we delve deeper into Twitter conversations as we can more easily identify how this content is spread. We develop network metrics to assess the prevalence, distribution, and diffusion of hateful content. The findings reveal that regardless of the number of users or tweets in a conversation, the volume of hateful content tends to remain constant. Furthermore, a small fraction of users contribute disproportionately to the dissemination of hate speech, with most conversations being limited in participant diversity. These results contribute to the growing field of computational social science by offering a novel methodology for studying hate speech in under-resourced languages and suggesting that mitigating hate speech may be possible through targeted network interventions rather than content removal alone.",

    "abstract": "Past research on cross-cultural equivalence has focused on statistical procedures and techniques for ensuring measurement equivalence in tests and surveys. With the rise of big data and machine learning (ML), particularly natural language processing, researchers have powerful tools to study culture using large-scale, organic language data from social media. However, the lack of methodological guidance on how to establish cross-language equivalence in cross-cultural studies, especially with multilingual or culturally diverse text data, poses a major challenge. To address this gap, in this article, we propose a framework to raise awareness of key equivalence challenges and offer practical guidance for reducing measurement biases when applying ML techniques to social media language data. The framework outlines five types of equivalence following the ML pipeline from data collection to evaluation: source equivalence, sample equivalence, input equivalence, psychological-ground-truth equivalence, and model-performance equivalence. We also draw parallels to survey-based research to highlight shared conceptual challenges and identify future directions to advance cross-cultural research with big data and computational-linguistic methods.",

    "abstract": "This study examined how well large language models (LLMs) approximate human psychological ratings for early-acquired English words. We used four state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o and Meta-Llama-3.1, to evaluate 21 static psychological features for 695 words and compared these estimates with human norms. The results showed that LLMs aligned well with human ratings for some features (e.g., Concreteness, Bodily Interactiveness) in terms of rank correlations ( r s &gt; .82) and distributional similarities but diverged notably for others (e.g., Iconicity, Arousal; r s &lt; .48). Compared with content words, function words showed more pronounced discrepancies between human and LLM ratings. We also assessed how similarly human- and LLM-derived psychological features predicted words’ age of acquisition (AoA), revealing both strong correspondences and systematic biases, depending on the model (differences in correlations ranged from −.27 to .28). Based on these analyses, we identified which features may be reliably estimated using LLMs, which require further refinement, and what methodological considerations are necessary for applying LLM-based measures in cognitive science. We discuss the implications of using LLMs as methodological tools in psychology and cognitive science, highlighting both their practical advantages (e.g., data coverage and data collection efficiency) and theoretical relevance. The present study provides a novel framework for evaluating the cognitive plausibility of LLMs by using lexical psychological features, complementing existing benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The spread of disinformation is widely regarded as one of the most serious global risks. In one laboratory and three online experiments ( N total = 3,066), we measured trust in true, false, and disinformation statements related to the Russo–Ukrainian war (Experiments 1–3) and to politics, climate, and health (Experiment 4). We examined longer-term effectiveness of a fact-based corrective message delivered either before (prebunking) or after (debunking) participants’ initial evaluation of disinformation statements. Across all four experiments, debunking intervention consistently and substantially reduced trust in disinformation, with effects persisting for at least two weeks. Prebunking intervention produced similarly durable benefits only when it was immediately followed by evaluation of the just-corrected disinformation. When evaluation was delayed, prebunking had no reliable impact. We found no significant backfire effects on trust in disinformation across any ideological groups. However, debunking induced a more conservative response pattern overall, reducing trust in true statements as well.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how ordinary Americans engage in unprompted conspiracy talk when discussing their daily lives. Drawing on a representative sample of 1,612 life course interviews from the “American Voices Project”, we explore how conspiracy theories surface in reflections on topics people consider important—such as relationships, employment, religion, and politics. Using both computational and qualitative analysis, we identify instances of conspiracy talk in the corpus, and categorize these passages into three orientations: supporting, challenging, and referencing conspiracy talk. Notably, 10 percent of the interview transcripts contain some form of conspiracy talk—a striking figure given that no questions about conspiracies or conspiracy theories were asked. While the overall volume of conspiracy talk rose during the pandemic, this increase was largely driven by a fivefold increase in passages that challenge conspiracy theories. Building on the recent theoretical work on conspiracy theories and conspiracy culture, this study highlights the value of empirically grounded analysis focused on ordinary people—not just dedicated conspiracy theorists or participants in, or followers of, the conspiracy theory milieu. In doing so, we offer new insights into how conspiracy theories are discussed, negotiated, and made meaningful in the course of everyday life.",
