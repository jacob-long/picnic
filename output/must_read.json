    "authors": "Hassan Mustafa, Markus Luczak-Roesch, David Johnstone",
    "abstract": "Since the 2016 U.S. election and the U.K. Brexit campaign, computational propaganda has become an important research topic in communication, political and social science. Recently, it has become clearer that computational propaganda doesn’t start from a clean slate and is not precisely bound to single issues or campaigns. Instead, computational propaganda needs to be looked at as a complex phenomenon in a global environment of co-evolving issues and events, emerging technologies, policies and legal frameworks, and social dynamics. Here, we review the literature on computational propaganda from this perspective and theorize this evolving and longitudinal nature of computational propaganda campaigns through the lens of relational dynamics. Our conceptual contribution forms the basis for a new kind of empirical research on computational propaganda that is aware of the complex interdependencies, feedback cycles and structural conditions that are elusive when focusing on individual campaigns and short time frames.",

    "title": "Narrative virtual reality as a memory machine",
    "authors": "Tim Gruenewald, Cecilia Chen",
    "abstract": "Since 2014, a new narrative medium has been emerging that is delivered through virtual reality headsets. This paper theorizes narrative virtual reality as a new filmic medium with new and unique affordances that facilitate narrating and sharing memories. In contradistinction to the much-discussed concept of VR as an ‘empathy machine’, we propose to think of VR as a memory machine. This capability of VR is reflected in the proliferation of memory-related content in narrative VR and its early adoption in public history. Narrating and sharing individual and collective traumatic memories have featured prominently in narrative VR. Three unique properties enable a recipient of narrative VR, the immersant, to experience someone else’s memories: embodiment, immersion, and interactivity. First, embodiment allows the immersant to assume the role of the person who remembers or a person that is being remembered. Second, immersion enables the virtual transportation to a past setting that is remembered. Third, since VR always offers at least some form of interactivity, narrative VR permits the immersant to have agency within the remembered narrative. These three aspects combine to provide a qualitatively richer experience of memories in VR than was possible in conventional narrative media. We show how creators have leveraged these specific affordances of VR in support of narrating memories by analyzing two case-studies. First, we look at an example of traumatic collective memory in The Book of Distance (2020), which narrates a family history of forced removal and internment of Japanese immigrants in Canada during World War II from the perspective of the victim’s grandson. Second, we discuss Is Anna Ok? (2018), which lets the immersant experience two sisters' memories of traumatic brain injury, once from the perspective of the injured victim and once from the sister who witnessed the accident.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the rate of reporting abuse, harassment and problematic content to platforms is substantially low. This article assesses the extent to which platform interfaces may contribute to discouraging the use of reporting as a remedy to online harms. Using a walkthrough method, we analyse reporting interfaces for the extent to which they may contribute to a lack of trust in reporting. The study found that reporting interfaces (1) did not provide appropriate access to platform policy or guidelines, (2) failed to provide options for dialogue, testimonials or mechanisms to report in formats supporting user wellbeing needs, (3) were consistently framed as individualising and transactional rather than brokering care or peer support, and (4) added to the opacity of platform intervention and decision-making processes. We argue the available interfaces do not do enough to protect users from digital harms.",

    "authors": "Emma Turkenburg",
    "abstract": "Contemporary political discussions are often subject to criticism of increasing simplification. Yet, there are also explicit calls for simplicity, and worries about the effects of politicians’ overly complex talk. This paper addresses these concerns, distinguishing between inaccessibility (complex form) and unsophisticatedness (simplistic content), and exploring their separate and combined effects on citizens’ reasoning and attitudes toward politicians. Results of a 2 × 2 experiment (N = 1,959) show that both inaccessible and unsophisticated political communication negatively affect citizens’ self-reported reasoning, and lower affective evaluations of the communicating politician. Yet, only a lack of sophistication lowers evaluations of politicians’ qualifications. When combined, inaccessibility and unsophisticatedness do not strengthen each other’s negative impact across the board. This study highlights the importance of considering both accessibility and sophisticatedness as separate dimensions, and presents novel insights into how these different forms of simplicity and complexity impact the way citizens think about politics and politicians.",

    "authors": "Byungjae Min, Daehwan Kim, Yong Jae Ko",
    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of in-game situations (battle vs non-battle) and advertisement animation (static vs animated) on visual attention, memory, brand attitude and behavioral intention in eSports. Design/methodology/approach A 2 (advertisement animation: static vs animated) × 2 (in-game situations: non-battle vs battle) between-subject factorial design was developed. Participants wearing eye trackers watched a 2-min-and-30-s stimulus featuring manipulated variables. Subsequently, they completed a questionnaire designed to measure variables. Findings In-game situations significantly influenced visual attention, with non-battle contexts eliciting higher fixation duration and count. Moreover, fixation count positively affected both explicit and implicit memory. Additionally, implicit memory enhanced brand attitude, which in turn positively affected behavioral intention. Practical implications These findings guide eSports event organizers and brand managers in optimizing advertisement placement. Advertisements should be positioned in non-battle situations, where visual attention is higher. Repeated brand exposure is more effective than prolonged single exposures for enhancing memory retention and brand attitude. Lastly, unobtrusive advertisement exposure is essential because implicit memory plays a key role in shaping consumer attitudes and behavioral intentions. Originality/value This study advances eSports advertising research by identifying psychological mechanisms influencing consumer behavior. Moreover, the study extends the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC3MP) by demonstrating how cognitive resource allocation varies across in-game situations and advertisements. Furthermore, this research contributes to self-perception theory and the mere exposure effect by clarifying the distinct roles of explicit and implicit memory in shaping brand attitudes.",

    "authors": "Mengru Yang, Xixian Peng, Qiuzhen Wang, Yuxiang Chris Zhao, Xinwei Wang",
    "abstract": "Purpose Chatbots are vital for enhancing e-commerce sustainability by providing efficient customer support. Although previous studies have considered both linguistic and visual anthropomorphism as crucial factors in e-commerce chatbot design, their joint effects and their underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. Drawing on insights from the literature on anthropomorphism and the elaboration likelihood model, this research attempts to examine the joint effects of the two types of anthropomorphism, the boundary condition, and the subsequent impact on purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach A research model was proposed and empirically tested using two laboratory-controlled experimental studies. Findings Linguistic anthropomorphism plays a dominant role over visual anthropomorphism in influencing social presence and communicative effectiveness. In addition, linguistic anthropomorphism harms persuasion through the mediating role of communicative effectiveness, and the fit between linguistic and visual anthropomorphism amplifies the negative effect on purchase intention. Moreover, shopping motivation serves as a boundary condition for the negative effect of anthropomorphism. Practical implications Chatbot designers should be cautious when using anthropomorphism in e-commerce chatbot design. The use of machine-like languages may be more persuasive than that of human-like languages, especially for utilitarian products. Notably, mismatched anthropomorphic elements may harm user experience. Originality/value This study enriches chatbot literature by examining the role of chatbot anthropomorphism in the e-commerce context. Moreover, this study provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding how chatbots’ linguistic and visual anthropomorphism jointly influence consumer behavior.",

    "authors": "Haiyuan An, Wenli Li, Yahe Yu, Zhen Wang",
    "abstract": "Purpose This study examines how default bias, driven by the default positive review (DPR) rule – which automatically classifies reviews not provided by consumers within a specified period as positive – and rebate bias, associated with the conditional rebate strategy (CRS), where sellers offer rebates exclusively to consumers who submit positive reviews, distort the distribution of online product reviews over time and impact consumer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach A key aspect of our method lies in developing latent variable models that capture the relationship between biased online reviews and consumer satisfaction levels. By applying our models to a panel dataset from Taobao – a leading Chinese e-commerce platform – and using insights from online consumer feedback surveys, we assess the extent of the biases introduced by DPR and CRS in a given feedback system. A hierarchical regression model was employed to investigate the impact of the proposed biases on consumer satisfaction. Findings Consumers who have previously written online reviews experience satisfaction outcomes 72.9% of the time with DPR and up to 81.3% when CRS is included. Implementing DPR may boost product sales to some extent, but it would significantly amplify consumer dissatisfaction, whereas offering a rebate could effectively alleviate consumer discontent, even though the rebate is conditional. Originality/value Our findings reveal the extent of biases introduced by CRS and DPR in online reviews and inform the consumer satisfaction debate regarding the phenomenon of excessive positive reviews resulting from these practices.",

Scholars from various disciplines—including communication, law, computer science, anthropology, and sociology—have turned to this idea (or related ones such as tech colonialism, data colonialism, and algorithmic colonization) to conceptualize the harmful impact of digital technologies globally. This article reviews significant historical precedents to the current critique of digital colonialism and further shows how digital rights activists from the Global South have been actively developing and popularizing these ideas over the last decade. I argue that these two phenomena help explain why scholars from varied disciplines developed adjacent frameworks simultaneously and at this specific historical juncture. The article also proposes a typology of digital colonialism around six core features. Overall, this article encourages historicizing current debates about tech power and emphasizes the instrumental role of nonscholarly communities in knowledge production.",

    "abstract": "Digital hate has become an inevitable aspect of daily life for social media users, constituting a formidable societal challenge. Despite broad consensus of related harms, researchers have struggled to predict users’ intervening activity and moderation preferences, especially given that they are subject to temporal changes. A two-wave panel survey was conducted to investigate how exposure frequency to incivility, intolerance, and threats is associated over time with (de-)sensitization regarding perceived severity, different intervention activities, and content moderation preferences, while also considering free-speech attitudes as a moderating factor. Results provide evidence for both consistent and selective (de-)sensitization over time across response and hate types. Most notably and contrary to popular desensitization narratives, users demonstrated heightened awareness and engagement when confronted with hateful content more frequently, actively intervening through reactions, comments, or private messages. Overall, these findings give reason for hope that users may become increasingly sensitive and engaged in combating digital hate.",

    "authors": "Juliane Wegner",
    "abstract": "This study explores gender representation among healthcare experts on German television during the first wave of Covid-19 reporting, addressing the broader issue of gender disparities in media coverage. Using Caldwell’s concept of televisuality and the audio-visual character analysis (ACIS) method for content analysis, we examined 174 corona-related news programmes that aired between 16 April and 30 April 2020. Of the 2,240 characters analyzed, 1,299 were experts, yet only 15% were women. Despite women’s strong presence in healthcare professions, men overwhelmingly dominated medical and political discussions during this period, while women were more frequently shown in supportive or emotional roles. These findings reveal a significant gender gap in the visibility and portrayal of experts during the pandemic’s early crisis communication, with men disproportionately occupying authoritative roles. This imbalance underscores how media coverage in public health emergencies continues to reinforce traditional gender norms, limiting female representation in leadership positions. The study highlights the need for more equitable media representation in crisis reporting to better reflect societal diversity and ensure inclusive communication.",

Using a mixed-method approach that combines computational analysis of the activities of 861 journalists on Twitter and Mastodon with qualitative interviews of 11 active journalists, this study aims to (1) examine the extent to which journalists have exhibited different forms of Twitter disengagement post-acquisition; (2) identify the motivating and discouraging factors influencing their move, guided by the push-pull-mooring model; and (3) explore how journalists managed their online presence across platforms. The results indicated minimal Twitter non-use following Musk’s takeover, and full migration was not observed within a 6-month post-acquisition period. Factors such as the flood of fake news and the loss of the blue-tick verification served as push factors, while the appeal of Mastodon’s enhanced user control and stronger community values acted as pull factors. However, the practical reliance on Twitter’s functionalities, audience base, and professional obligations made total abandonment challenging.",

    "abstract": "This study examines how digital nationalism distorts the articulation of feminism on China’s popular video-sharing platform, BiliBili. Through a discourse analysis of the 100 most-viewed user-generated videos tagged with “feminism” ( nüquan ), we find that BiliBili’s unique sociotechnical context, functioning both as a cultural platform and as a conduit for state propaganda, creates a space where various forms of nationalism—including anti-consumerism, anti-Western liberalism, and Sinocentric nationalism/chauvinism toward East Asian neighbors—intersect with discussions of feminism. Consequently, feminism on BiliBili gains virality only insofar as it does not appear “contradictory” to state-sponsored ideological slogans, norms, and notions of national identity. This article demonstrates how a seemingly participatory and free discursive space for user-generated content can, in fact, constrain women’s agency in negotiating the very concept of feminism, limiting their ability to articulate struggles and diversify narratives.",

I argue that instead of considering the various extant theoretical approaches as competing and irreconcilable, the field should strive for a holistic understanding that helps integrate them. I consider PCC as a process that unfolds over time in complex multilevel dynamics between macro-level structural transformations and the decisions and resulting behaviors of individual and collective actors. I propose a structure–actor model of PCC that accounts for both, determined and contingent processes simultaneously. It is also able to explain the emergence of paradox phenomena and collective misjudgments despite better knowledge. I conclude by using examples from the context of the “filter bubble” phenomenon to illustrate the heuristic value of the developed model and sketch an empirical research agenda that follows from its arguments.",

The Brazilian mother privileges cute aesthetics by enchantment in an inspirational sharenting and does not promote the child’s memeability. In contrast, the Portuguese influencer privileges cringe aesthetics, encouraging her daughter’s memeability by exploring the ambivalence of parenting with humor in a transgressive sharenting. The findings point to the unpredictability and uncontrollability of the memetic culture. In Brazil, the child’s image was appropriated for playful and parodic engagement, neglecting her privacy, reputation, and well-being despite her mother’s public complaint. This unauthorized memeability results from the girl’s celebrification after her display in viral content and advertising campaigns. In contrast, the encouraged memeability of the Portuguese influencer does not exceed her community of followers since her daughter’s recognition seems limited to an extension of the mother’s self.",

This is particularly true of opinion journalism, which reflects elite voices. Within the climate change communications literature, an important shift marks a turn away from outright denial of the existence of climate change towards delaying narratives. In this paper, we use a longitudinal mixed-methods analysis to chart ‘discourses of delay’ in editorials relating not only directly to climate change but to the closely connected issue of energy transitions across seventeen UK daily and weekly newspapers over the period 2011–2021. Though we find both a trend away from outright denial of climate change and an identifiable increase in support for climate action even among right-leaning editorials over this period, we also show that narratives are characterised by multiple discourses of delay across both climate change and various energy narratives.",

This special issue critically engages with existing discussions by adopting a broad political-economic perspective on the platform economy in China. Aiming to deconstruct and contextualize the dominant concepts of “platformization” and “infrastructuralization,” we focus on three central themes under the overarching framework of Digital China : “Platform cum Infrastructure along a Techno-developmental Path,” “Platform Governance,” and “Platform Spatiality and Geopolitics.” These themes collectively deepen our understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of platforms, as well as their conceptual significance as evolving processes and outcomes. More importantly, we highlight how the development of Chinese platforms reflects not only the contours of China’s contested integration into global capitalism but also the state’s shifting socio-economic priorities and its broader aspiration to establish a distinct “Chinese model of modernization.”",

    "abstract": "After the Canadian oil corporation Enbridge proposed replacing its Line 3 pipeline in 2014, activists began protesting against its environmental risks and violations of Indigenous rights, among other concerns. As the pipeline’s construction progressed and resistance intensified, a parallel discourse emerged online under the hashtag #StopLine3. This study explores the temporal evolution of that discourse and its alignment with on-the-ground developments. Specifically, we assess whether the discourse conforms to a phasic model of collective action inspired by Melucci, which contends that social movements oscillate between phases of visibility and latency. This oscillation is mediated by key mobilizing events, which drive activists to focus their energy toward fighting a target. Once a resolution is reached (positive or negative), the movement progresses into a latent phase, where participants regroup, reflect, and build unity. The ideas behind this model were developed before the digital turn. Given how social media complicates temporality, it remains unclear how well the model explains discursive resistance online. We use #StopLine3 as a case study to test the phasic model, examining all tweets with the hashtag posted between 2016 and 2023. We break up the data into temporal segments based on peaks and lulls in overall activity and explore how both tweet content and forms of engagement shift from segment to segment. In line with the model, we find that the shifts between segments are mediated by key events; however, we also find that the Twitter discourse consistently favors mobilization-oriented forms of engagement and content over latency. Our results suggest that Twitter primarily facilitates mobilization work, and call into question the importance of latency work, what it looks like, and where it takes place on platforms such as Twitter. We argue that Twitter may not be an effective venue for latency processes, or alternatively, may alter how those processes manifest. Overall, we trouble the application of the phasic model to #StopLine3 and other similar public-facing discourses.",

Some studies find that social media networks support little, low-cost, periodic, and demographically biased civic participation, while others find the opposite. We argue that many studies do not have an adequate point of comparison to determine the contribution of social media networks relative to other organizational forms, such as formal volunteering. Using an original population survey on volunteering during the COVID crisis, we compare social media networks to other types of organizations in terms of the relative volume of participation, the type of participation, the persistence of the volunteer, and volunteers’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We do not find that social media networks contribution is comparatively trivial, low cost, and biased when compared to other organizational forms.

    "title": "Journalists, Emotions, and the Introduction of Generative AI Chatbots: A Large-Scale Analysis of Tweets Before and After the Launch of ChatGPT",
    "authors": "Seth C. Lewis, David M. Markowitz, Jon Benedik A. Bunquin",
    "abstract": "As part of a broader look at the impact of generative AI, this study investigated the emotional responses of journalists to the release of ChatGPT at the time of its launch. By analyzing nearly 1 million Tweets from journalists at major US news outlets, we tracked changes in emotion, tone, and sentiment before and after the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. Using various computational and natural language processing techniques to measure emotional shifts in response to ChatGPT’s release, we found an increase in positive emotion and a more favorable tone post-launch, suggesting initial optimism toward AI’s potential. This research underscores the pivotal role of journalists as interpreters of technological innovation and disruption, highlighting how their emotional reactions may shape public narratives around emerging technologies. The study contributes to understanding the intersection of journalism, emotion, and AI, offering insights into the broader societal impact of generative AI tools.",

    "title": "The Ideal Influencer: How Influencer Coaches and Platforms Construct Creators as Monetizing for the Right Reasons",
    "authors": "Taylor Annabell",
    "abstract": "This article examines the construction of the ideal influencer across two sites of articulation within the influencer ecology: influencer coaches and platforms. It seeks to make visible the normative model that underpins and regulates influencer identities, practices and monetization, which is tied to the interests and values of different actors. Drawing on a sample of 70 TikTok videos and Instagram posts from influencer coaches, a dataset of 69 TikTok and Instagram policies, and a walkthrough of TikTok and Instagram creator accounts, I analyze what constitutes the ideal influencer through a critical feminist approach to influencer labor. In content shared by influencer coaches, the influencer is framed as a strategic actor who offers value to their community and embraces their identity as a professional entrepreneur. Through platform policies and interface design, the influencer is constructed as a skilful creator who engages their audiences in the “right” ways and assumes responsibility for complying with regulations. I argue that these constructions converge on the assertion that influencers should monetize for the “right” reasons. This steers influencers toward a worker subjectivity that is ideal for the platform, linking the construction of influencers as users—rather than workers who should be rewarded but not compensated for their labor—to the professionalization of the industry.",

    "title": "More-Than-Human, More-Than-Digital: Postdigital Intimacies as a Theoretical Framework",
    "authors": "Adrienne Evans, Jessica Ringrose",
    "abstract": "In this article, we extend the concept of “postdigital intimacies” by developing its more-than-human and more-than-digital capacities. We argue that while we have witnessed a gradual flattening out of the digital and non-digital, our institutions, regulations, laws, ethics, and policies still make distinctions between digital experiences and “real life.” This demands a refinement of critical understandings of intimacy. We locate postdigital intimacies in accounts that situate intimacy as ambivalent, and draw on posthuman and new feminist materialism to argue for the interdependencies between human and non-human agencies, making intimacy something always more-than-human. In turn, we develop accounts of the postdigital that suggest a more-than-digital by highlighting experiences of an entangled digital and non-digital, and the practical implications of this for how we advocate approaching health, safety, well-being, and anti-harassment. We bring these two bodies of work together through two distinct examples: one of the intimate therapeutics of AI chatbots and the other in how young people navigate technology-facilitated sexual violence in schools. We argue that a theory of postdigital intimacies demonstrates the importance of thinking through the more-than-human and more-than-digital of intimacy in relation to regulation, policy, and research pertaining to harms, risk, and vulnerability.",

    "title": "Political Campaign Responses to Information Disorder: A Case Study of the 2023 Nigerian Presidential Elections",
    "authors": "Abubakar Adam Ibrahim, Brian Ekdale",
    "abstract": "During the 2023 Nigerian presidential campaign, a variety of political, ethnic, and religious tensions contributed to a significant spike in false and misleading information. To navigate this complex information ecosystem, campaigns set up media units to, in varying degrees, produce disinformation about other candidates, reinforce disinformation being spread on social media, and respond to disinformation targeting their preferred candidate. Our study examines the circulation of false and misleading information during the 2023 Nigerian presidential campaign through a critical discourse analysis of campaign press statements issued in support of the top three candidates for president. To analyze these statements, we first present an original typology of political campaign responses to information disorder that includes prebunking, debunking, fake-news tagging, and counter-disinformation. We then apply this typology to our case, finding that Nigerian presidential campaigns frequently trafficked in information disorder, both by introducing false and misleading information as well as by responding to damaging information. In closing, we argue that our typology, which conceptualizes information disorder as an ongoing exchange between purveyors and targets of false and misleading information, can be helpful for understanding information disorder in political campaigns around the world.",

    "title": "Visual framing of climate change during natural disasters at home and abroad: an analysis of British news",
    "authors": "Defne Günay, Öykü Yenen Aytekіn, Gіzem Melek",
    "abstract": "The connection between climate change and its consequences is often implicit for the general public. Moreover, the public often perceives climate change as a phenomenon affecting distant regions and future generations, rather than recognising its immediate repercussions. Media play a pivotal role in informing the public on climate change and its consequences, including increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters. This research examines the visual frames employed by British news outlets during periods of natural disasters transpiring in the UK, or globally. The aim of the research is to reveal the most common visual frames used, whether nature is framed as a threat and whether psychologically distant visuals are used at times of natural disasters. The authors analyse 2413 images extracted from 907 climate change-related news articles from UK publications and media, namely the The Guardian , BBC and Daily Mail , published during periods marked by natural disasters. They find that the natural environment is not visually framed as threatening, despite the experience of natural disasters. Second, they observe that the news stories mostly reduced psychological distance by using the person frames using a camera angle that creates empathy. However, they also undermine this effect by not providing geographical details regarding origins of persons and location of the scenes depicted in the visuals. Furthermore, significant differences exist in the frames utilised by different outlets that they analysed. This study demonstrates that the visuals used in news stories also tell a story about climate change and this story has a potential to reduce the perceived distance of climate change effects on the viewer, offering ways to improve visual framing of climate change.",
