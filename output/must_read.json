    "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to address the issue of privacy leakage indirectly caused by non-private data shared by travellers on location-based social media (LBSM) in data mining. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a privacy-preserving location data collection approach based on local differential privacy (LDP) and validates the feasibility of the approach through experiments on three real-world public check-in datasets. Findings The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which preserves privacy while retaining over 90% of the data utility. Practical implications This research has the potential to assist tourism practitioners in establishing improved collaborations with trusted third parties, enabling the exploration of user location data insights without undue concerns regarding indirect privacy breaches during data mining, thereby enhancing travellers’ experience and aiding businesses’ decision-making. Originality/value This paper is likely to be the first to represent a promising solution for addressing privacy leakage concerns related to non-sensitive data in data mining. It provides a location data collection technology that strikes a balance between user privacy and data utility for tourism practitioners."

    "abstract": "Purpose This study examines how default bias, driven by the default positive review (DPR) rule – which automatically classifies reviews not provided by consumers within a specified period as positive – and rebate bias, associated with the conditional rebate strategy (CRS), where sellers offer rebates exclusively to consumers who submit positive reviews, distort the distribution of online product reviews over time and impact consumer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach A key aspect of our method lies in developing latent variable models that capture the relationship between biased online reviews and consumer satisfaction levels. By applying our models to a panel dataset from Taobao – a leading Chinese e-commerce platform – and using insights from online consumer feedback surveys, we assess the extent of the biases introduced by DPR and CRS in a given feedback system. A hierarchical regression model was employed to investigate the impact of the proposed biases on consumer satisfaction. Findings Consumers who have previously written online reviews experience satisfaction outcomes 72.9% of the time with DPR and up to 81.3% when CRS is included. Implementing DPR may boost product sales to some extent, but it would significantly amplify consumer dissatisfaction, whereas offering a rebate could effectively alleviate consumer discontent, even though the rebate is conditional. Originality/value Our findings reveal the extent of biases introduced by CRS and DPR in online reviews and inform the consumer satisfaction debate regarding the phenomenon of excessive positive reviews resulting from these practices."

    "abstract": "Purpose Users contribute to online communities by posting and responding to discussion threads. Nonetheless, only a small fraction of threads gain popularity and shape community discourse. Prior studies have identified several factors driving thread popularity; however, despite their prevalence, the role of emotional expressions within discussion threads remains understudied. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of thread starters’ valence and embedded discrete emotions of anger, anxiety and sadness on thread popularity, drawing on the negativity bias and the emotion-as-social-information theories. Design/methodology/approach Using two samples from Reddit, this study employs negative binomial regression analysis to examine the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results demonstrate that negativity in thread starters significantly influences thread popularity; however, the expression of discrete emotions impacts popularity variously. In some contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccination subreddits, embedded anger in thread starters decreases thread popularity, whereas anxiety and sad expressions enhance it. In other contexts, such as professional discussions (e.g. r/Medicine subreddit), anger and anxiety expressions increase thread popularity, while sad expressions have no significant influence. Research limitations/implications The study is limited by its focus on specific emotions and contexts. Future research could examine a broader range of emotions, post-content modalities and the impact of cultural and linguistic differences. Originality/value This study contributes to theory by offering a new definition of thread popularity and enhancing our understanding of the impact of emotions in online discussions. It also provides practical implications for online community members and moderators seeking to promote discussion posts that help achieve community goals."

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping labor markets and sparking political debates. Like economic globalization, AI developments promise benefits, including job creation and lower prices, but also costs such as job displacement, raising crucial questions about public perceptions. Will AI, like globalization, challenge existing paradigms and trigger a backlash? Leveraging a conjoint experiment with 6,000 respondents from the United States and Canada, we examine public opinion toward offshoring and generative AI, focusing on the multidimensional trade‐offs between job and price changes. Across all scenarios, respondents are equally or more sensitive to price changes than employment shifts. AI is favored over offshoring, especially among Democrats, highlighting an emerging partisan divide in the United States. Republicans and Canadians show more varied support, indicating AI is not immune to opposition. By focusing on the microfoundations of opinion formation, we identify scenarios that may trigger or temper protectionist stances."

    "abstract": "In many settings, scholars wish to estimate the similarity of political texts. However, the most commonly used methods in political science struggle to identify when two texts convey the same meaning as they rely too heavily on identifying words that appear in both documents. This limitation is especially salient when the underlying documents are short, an increasingly prevalent form of textual data in modern political research. Building on recent advances in computer science, I introduce to political science cross‐encoders for precise estimates of semantic similarity in short texts. Scholars can use either off‐the‐shelf versions or build a customized model. I illustrate this approach in three examples applied to social messages generated in a telephone game, news headlines about US Supreme Court decisions, and Facebook posts from members of Congress. I show that cross‐encoders, which utilize pair‐ level embeddings, offer superior performance across tasks relative to word‐based and sentence‐level embedding approaches."

    "abstract": "In the US, abortion attitudes are categorized using the terms pro-life/pro-vida and pro-choice/pro-elección. In light of demographic changes in the U.S. population, it is important to explore whether these U.S.-centric abortion-related socio-political terms are interpreted similarly by English and Spanish speakers. We analyzed survey data from 1,025 adults and 15 cognitive-style interviews. We (1) quantitatively examined responses for abortion-related terms across English and Spanish, and (2) qualitatively assessed whether Spanish speakers are familiar with pro-vida and pro-elección, how they define these terms, their perceptions of people who self-identify with the terms, and their suggestions for alternative terms. Results suggest that Spanish speakers are less familiar with the contextual background of these terms. As such, they define them literally and conceptualize them from a broad perspective, which entails a degree of ambiguity for public opinion research. This study offers recommendations for abortion attitudes survey research and provides insights for survey methodologists and implications for multilingual survey research in culturally diverse settings. With Roe v. Wade being overturned in the U.S. in 2022, and thus abortion being on the ballot in many states hereafter, understanding how English and Spanish speakers interpret these terms is of utmost importance for polling and elections."

While others have investigated the impact of women role models on women’s and girls’ engagement and ambition, previous research has not directly examined women politicians’ effect on political gender stereotypes in the United States. Using a panel survey of both adolescents and adults, we ask whether adolescents who observe women politicians become more likely to favor more women in office and more likely to see women as possessing positive leadership traits. We find that those for whom women candidates are more novel—Republican teens, and especially Republican girls—are most likely to shift their beliefs when exposed to women candidates of either party. Consistent with research on political socialization, these effects are apparent only for adolescents, not adults."

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics and duration of trending topics on digital platforms has been deemed a crucial issue of research in computer-mediated communication. Employing event history analysis (EHA), this study attempts to examine the antecedents of the lifespan and evolution of trending topics on Sina Weibo, one of the most prevalent social media platforms in China. Based on a collection of 2,386 Sina Weibo trending topics that emerged between January 1 and January 31, 2022, the study explores how factors of trending topics, especially their semantic and textual features, significantly influence topic persistence. Our findings indicate that the median survival time of Weibo trending topic was 6.28 hours, with an average of 8.29 hours. In addition, exogenous non-viral topics, driven by external events or media coverage, tend to remain on the trending list longer than other topics. Furthermore, political topics tend to have a relatively longer period of survival duration when compared to social events, life records and moods, and fashion and entertainment topics. Lastly, actionable and opinion-oriented topics tend to have shorter longevity compared to informational and emotional topics. By quantifying the factors that affect trending topic duration, the study offers a novel theoretical perspective on the role of political drivers and external influences in shaping collective and connective digital discourses. The findings contribute to the broader field of digital platform communication, particularly in public opinion management and content governance on social media."

    "abstract": "Moderation effects in longitudinal structural equation models are often analysed using latent variable product terms, which can be complex and difficult to estimate, especially in large models with many panel waves. An alternative approach for categorical moderation variables is the simpler technique of multiple-group comparisons. This method allows for straightforward model specification and precise differentiation of effects in complex models. This tutorial demonstrates multiple-group comparisons using examples based on developmental trajectories of juvenile delinquency. These trajectories are modelled via a latent growth curve approach, treating the variables as count data and applying Bayesian estimation using the software M plus . The results are processed using the R programming language. This method addresses challenges associated with maximum likelihood estimation, particularly for latent growth models with count variables and additional exogenous latent variables. The analysis examines group differences by gender and school type in the trajectories of an unconditional growth model. It also examines the effect of legal norm acceptance on these trajectories using a conditional growth model. The moderating effects of gender and school type on these effects are analysed separately. The results reveal group differences of gender and school type for the unconditional growth model, while the conditional growth model highlights a moderating effect of school type on the relationship between legal norm acceptance and growth trajectories."
