    "abstract": "The belief in the capabilities of one’s own group is crucial for joining collective action aimed at addressing large-scale societal crises like climate change. Drawing from the two-step flow of communication theory and behavioral models of collective action, we conducted two experimental studies and an innovative quasi-experimental field study (total N = 2,960). Across these studies, influencer messages increased collective response efficacy beliefs and political action intentions, particularly among followers with strong parasocial ties. Moreover, repeated exposure to an influencer’s message reinforced these effects. Our research underscores the potential of influencers in mobilizing collective political action within digital media environments."

In this preregistered online experiment, children aged 8–12 ( N = 256) viewed an animated television program that featured women who varied in their character role (i.e., superheroes vs. supervillains) and character description (i.e., labeled vs. not labeled as scientists). Children reported high levels of epistemic trust in scientists overall. However, viewing a villainous woman who was labeled (vs. not labeled) as a scientist led to slight reductions in epistemic trust. Furthermore, habitual exposure to superhero television negatively predicted one dimension of epistemic trust (i.e., perceived benevolence). We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and offer practical suggestions for content design."

    "abstract": "Nomophobia, characterized by anxiety when out of mobile phone contact, has emerged as a pervasive issue in this digital age, with negative consequences across various domains. Prior studies have been limited by reliance on cross-sectional designs that restrict causal inference and by insufficient exploration of the mechanisms linking nomophobia to developmental outcomes. This study addressed these gaps by employing longitudinal research designs to explore the effect of nomophobia on academic achievement and mental health, with a particular focus on the mediating effects of the I-self (e.g., self-control) and the Me-self (e.g., self-esteem). A sample of 499 secondary students completed the Nomophobia Questionnaire, Self-Control Scale, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale across three waves over 18 months. Structural equation modeling showed that after controlling for baseline levels, nomophobia negatively predicted self-control six months later, which in turn significantly predicted academic achievement another six months later. Similarly, nomophobia predicted subsequent self-esteem, which in turn predicted subsequent mental health. These findings provide longitudinal evidence of the detrimental effects of nomophobia and highlight the importance of the self-system processes. Altogether, this study underscores the need for interventions aimed at reducing nomophobia symptoms and strengthening self-system processes to support adolescents’ psychological development."

In a single-factor experiment ( N = 1,264), compared to lean narratives or statistics, rich narratives most effectively elicited fear through heightened transportation, although they did not outperform lean narratives in evoking guilt. Fear increased risk perception through reduced psychological distance and greater self-referencing; guilt was positively associated with both. Elevated risk perception predicted more favorable attitudes and stronger behavioral intentions. These findings offer theoretical and practical implications for science communication strategies to promote antibiotic stewardship and other health behaviors."

Results indicate that science belief significantly predicts both perceived threat and efficacy, which subsequently elicit the four correction behaviors. Multigroup analysis further revealed that the proposed science belief model varies by levels of interdependent self-construal. Among individuals with high interdependence, science belief exerted a stronger influence on perceived threat and efficacy, and efficacy more strongly predicted public correction and refutation behaviors."

Given the rising trend of multi-platform social media use, this article introduces a two-step approach to investigate how networks across platforms conjointly and distinctly relate to incidental exposure to news and political information. Our analysis of survey data from the United States showed that greater immersion in multiple politically heterogeneous networks across platforms predicted higher counter-attitudinal incidental exposure, while greater immersion in multiple politically homogeneous networks across platforms predicted higher pro-attitudinal incidental exposure. Among the popular platforms, immersion in networks on Facebook, X (Twitter), and YouTube played a particularly influential role in these relationships. Surprisingly, we also found that greater immersion in homogeneous networks across multiple platforms predicted higher counter-attitudinal exposure, even though immersion in any single platform’s homogeneous network was not a significant predictor."

    "abstract": "What news spreads on social media equally depends on what news users do and do not share. However, prior research has predominantly focused on successful news sharing , overlooking the equally consequential behavior of deliberate news withholding. This study addresses that gap by proposing a self-presentation model of deliberate news withholding on social media, integrating three dominant approaches previously used to examine successful news sharing: (1) the informational approach focusing on the virality of news content, (2) the structural approach emphasizing social media network characteristics, and (3) the relational approach centered on users’ self-presentation and management of relationships with their audience. Specifically, this study combines two types of data: (1) survey data from 408 users and (2) a text analysis of news content they withheld in their three most active chatrooms. We examine how users selectively withhold news with varying levels of emotionality, argumentativeness, and hard or soft news value, depending on the characteristics of their audience networks – particularly network size and tie strength – and in relation to three self-presentational goals: self-construction, privacy protection, and audience-pleasing. Findings show that users strategically withhold varied types of news content across different user-audience networks to meet distinct self-presentational goals, thereby managing audience expectations and curating their online image. By shifting attention from news sharing to news withholding, this study offers a more complete account of how everyday users shape news flows and social discourse on social media."

This study examined anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate posts on X.com and the verbal replies, Likes, and reposts they acquired over the following month. It tests a theory explaining the propagation of hate messages in social media based on the social approval posters garner from other users. The analysis involved replies to 6388 anti-Muslim or anti-Jewish hate posts in terms of their semantic convergence or divergence with the content of original posts. No differences between patterns of anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim discourse arose. Convergent replies to one’s hate posts led individuals to post more hatefully in their next post, and more quickly. Likes also accelerated hate posting, while reposts decelerated them. Divergent replies led to less hateful and slower subsequent hate postings. Conclusions address implications for the social approval theory of online hate, and the relative influence of verbal replies due to their costliness."

We conducted a two-wave panel survey ( N = 3,395) to replicate these findings in two new countries: France and Germany. The replication reinforces the conclusions of the original study: we found that higher news consumption predicted greater surveillance knowledge acquisition across the waves, as well as greater awareness of and belief in true news stories. News consumption also increased awareness of false news stories without increasing belief in false news stories. These findings strengthen the idea that news helps people become more informed and better at discerning truth from falsehoods."

This article presents a dataset of climate change salience in 1,792 political manifestos of 620 political parties across different party families in forty-five OECD, European, and South American countries from 1990 to 2022. Importantly, our measure uniquely isolates climate change salience, avoiding the conflation with general environmental and sustainability content found in other work. Exploiting recent advances in supervised machine learning, we developed the dataset by fine-tuning a pre-trained multilingual transformer with human coding, employing a resource-efficient and replicable pipeline for multilingual text classification that can serve as a template for similar tasks. The dataset unlocks new avenues of research on the political discourse of climate change, on the role of parties in climate policy making, and on the political economy of climate change. We make the model and the dataset available to the research community."

We argue that undemocratic behavior affects perceived dominance, which citizens value in times of conflict. We fielded two conjoint experiments and a factorial vignette experiment in the United States to test this two-step argument. First, our conjoint experiments demonstrate a robust and strong relationship between undemocratic candidate behavior and dominance impressions. Second, our vignette experiment – manipulating undemocratic behavior by in-party presidential candidates and priming threats of conflict with China and Russia – shows that undemocratic candidates are evaluated more positively under conflict compared to peace. This is especially the case among Republican voters, although the pattern is also evident among Democrats and Independents. Our letter sheds light on the consequences of the escalation of wars with relevance to the United States around the globe, pointing to toleration of undemocratic behavior specifically."

Empirically, I leverage a survey experiment where the treatment is administered via an originally created video that resembles a tour guide of an American city. With minimal manipulations, respondents in the treatment group are exposed to Confederate commemorations, while those in the control group are not. I find that these symbols signal the town’s history and predominant ideology. They also negatively shape observers’ emotions, political efficacy, trust in the town residents, and donations to local schools. The effects are moderated by partisanship. Republican respondents are either unaffected by the treatment or move in the opposite direction. These results highlight the potential negative consequences of maintaining controversial commemorations."

Drawing on an original survey experiment during the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, I randomly assigned respondents to read one of ten fact-checked misleading statements made by either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in a nationally televised debate. I found that individuals were more likely to justify, excuse, and downplay the democratic harm of misinformation when it came from their preferred candidate. While this tendency was evident across both partisan groups, the tendency to downplay the democratic harm of co-partisan misinformation was particularly noticeable among Trump supporters. Moreover, the main effect was stronger among respondents who perceived misinformation as widespread during the campaign. Finally, I demonstrate that willingness to accept misinformation varies by policy area, with greater justification for misleading statements on immigration, abortion and gun rights among Trump supporters, and trade and tax among Harris supporters. These findings highlight how partisan loyalty can distort moral judgment and underscore the challenges misinformation poses for democratic accountability."

In this paper, we propose and test a model suggesting that such inflammatory messages are effective because they signal that the messenger is unwilling to compromise with the groups they have offended. Taking the example of inflammatory pro‐gun messaging, we show, in three preregistered experiments with American conservatives (total n = 1742) that conservatives view such messages as offending liberals, and, to the extent that they feel negatively toward Democratic politicians, they view the producers of these inflammatory messages positively, seeing them as the sort of politician who should be trusted by conservatives and as the sort of politician that they would be willing to vote for. However, this is not true across the entire conservative electorate, as conservatives who feel more warmly toward Democratic politicians view politicians posting inflammatory messages (and therefore offending liberals) as less trustworthy and less vote‐worthy. As affective polarization is on the rise in the United States, these inflammatory, bridge‐burning messages may become more prevalent with politicians trying to appeal to voters who are increasingly suspicious of anyone who might be tempted to compromise."

This scenario raises concerns that GenAI usage may result in widespread dissemination of misinformation, given its ability to generate seemingly authentic information. Nevertheless, despite the importance of Gen AI, few researchers have examined how individuals use this tool to search for election-related information. This study aims to assess how GenAI’s perceived system (i.e., accessibility and integration) and information quality (i.e., completeness, accuracy, and neutrality) impact its usage. Focusing on the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we conducted a two-wave survey and data was collected from 364 Americans. Participants were found to have a favorable attitude overall toward GenAI. Further, accuracy and neutrality were positively associated with GenAI usage. A fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis was also conducted to identify different configurations of perceived system and information quality that led to high GenAI usage. Analyzing the qualitative responses further confirmed the results. This study contributes to the literature on the role of GenAI during elections, providing a nuanced understanding of how dimensions of GenAI’s perceived system and information quality impact individuals’ GenAI usage. The findings have significant practical implications for dealing with the (mis)information generated by GenAI."

We focused specifically on violent video game (VVG) and aggression research and tested the hypothesis that non-players and non-habitual players would update their beliefs based on the study conclusions, whereas more habitual players would not. Participants read abstracts with either a positive effect or a null effect. Beliefs about the effect of VVGs on aggression were measured before and after reading. Results in both studies (overall N = 1,576) showed that at low VVG exposure levels, participants in both conditions updated their beliefs to align with the research. However, at high VVG exposure levels, participants maintained their belief that VVGs do not increase aggression, and at very high VVG exposure levels, positive-effect studies led participants to believe the opposite: that VVGs reduce aggression. We interpret this pattern of response as suggesting a process of psychological distancing, whereby individuals defensively shift their beliefs away from threatening claims. These findings highlight the need to understand how scientific information is received and to develop strategies that prevent reinforcing misconceptions."

Using a nationally representative, online and offline-integrated dataset of a Generation Z cohort in China, we provide large-scale evidence on the determinants of success in attracting attention. Our findings reveal that ‘how you express yourself’ (using various emojis and expressing multiple emotions) is more influential than ‘who you are’ (in terms of gender, education, family background and personality traits) in attracting attention on social media. Further analysis confirms a causal effect of the variety of emojis and types of emotions on attracted attention, while simulation processes using agent-based models suggest that empathy evocation is the primary underlying mechanism. We also show that the mode of expression is largely independent of individual characteristics and that the attention gained from highly appealing expressions is easier to acquire than to sustain, as it is highly sensitive to changes in expression modes over time. Overall, our research identifies three key features of attention capital allocation on social media: low alignment with traditional resources, considerable manipulability and ease of acquisition but difficulty sustaining it over time."
