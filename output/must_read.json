    "authors": "Janise Brück, Charlotte Knorr, Lars Guenther",
    "abstract": "Copy-pasting is harmless in many contexts, but in the field of journalism, it has transformed into a widely debated practice known as churnalism. Churnalism, or copy-and-paste journalism, refers to a journalistic practice in which journalists (heavily) rely on external third-party materials, leading to news stories that are (verbatim) reproductions of this material. Although the practice is accused of having become particularly widespread in digital journalism, theoretical approaches have examined the complex relationship between journalism and its sources for decades. This theoretically broad and well-established discussion is why research on churnalism not only reflects different understandings but also contains mixed findings and evaluations. Consequently, this systematic review aims to provide an overview of the research state on churnalism by qualitatively examining 46 papers from the last 25 years (1999–2024). Our findings confirm that churnalism is a multifaceted practice, understood as the recycling of both journalistic and non-journalistic material. The literature contains different indicators of churnalism and has produced mixed results on its prevalence. Influencing factors include a lack of journalistic resources and the characteristics of (non-)journalistic organizations, demonstrating that churnalism entails both benefits and risks for journalists. Further research should focus on countermeasures and the potential effects of churnalism.",

    "title": "On the stabilization of media effects after repeated exposure: consequences for media effects research",
    "authors": "Susanne E Baumgartner",
    "abstract": "Public concerns about media effects are oftentimes fueled by anecdotal evidence and popular press reports pointing towards strong media effects. Interestingly, however, these public concerns are in contrast to findings from empirical studies that point towards minimal media effects. In the past decades, scholars have proposed several explanations for these minimal effects. This article adds to this, by proposing that one reason is that media effects stabilize after repeated exposure. If media effects stabilize, media effects occur only during effect-sensitive periods and might therefore only be empirically observable during these periods. This article delineates how well-established psychological theories as well as communication science theories are crucial in understanding the effects of repeated media exposure and how the conceptualization of media effects as stabilizing after repeated exposure has strong consequences for our empirical endeavors. The article discusses how to move the field forward, both empirically as well as theoretically.",

    "authors": "Lillian Darke, Helen Paterson, Celine van Golde",
    "abstract": "Gaslighting is a covert form of psychological manipulation that undermines an individual’s confidence in their perceptions, thoughts, and memories, often by labelling them as irrational or ‘crazy.’ Public awareness of gaslighting has surged in recent years, making it a common topic in media and popular culture. However, empirical research has lagged behind, leaving gaps in understanding how the public perceives and defines this form of abuse. Addressing public understanding of covert abuse is critical for improving early recognition by victims, bystanders, and front-line services, as well as encouraging support-seeking behaviours. This study examined public perceptions of gaslighting by presenting 595 university students with vignettes manipulating key contested components: repetition, intention, and victim outcomes. Participants assessed the vignettes on seriousness, acceptability, likelihood of intervention, and whether they classified the behaviour as gaslighting. They also provided definitions of gaslighting and completed a gaslighting acceptance scale. Findings indicate that while students generally recognise gaslighting as emotional abuse, ambiguities remain in its definition and identification. These results underscore the need for educational campaigns to clarify gaslighting’s patterns and severity. Targeted initiatives, particularly in schools and community settings, could foster cultural change, enhance bystander intervention, and reduce the prevalence of covert abusive behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Do parties respond to inequality? Despite the relevance of inequality and its consequences, existing studies fail to capture parties’ emphasis on economic equality and redistribution or to differentiate between existing levels of inequality and increases in inequality. Based on 850,000 party statements from 12 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries (1970–2020), we introduce a crowd-coded dataset that allows us to distinguish positive references to economic equality and redistribution from upward-trending equal-rights/anti-discrimination rhetoric. We show that responses found in previous studies do not capture economic equality and redistribution. In reassessing the impact of inequality, we argue that low visibility, status quo bias, and turnout effects discourage party responses to high inequality levels , while rising inequality poses a visible status quo change and a threat that left parties respond to. We find that left parties respond to inequality increases (except less tangible gains among the most affluent) but not to (high) inequality levels. This helps to understand why inequality is not self-correcting.",

    "abstract": "Public allegations of international law violations are common in international politics. When do these accusations generate international backlash for governments? We argue that political costs hinge on a rhetorical battle to shape perceptions of the government’s behavior. Governments use strategic messaging to contest information, challenge the appropriateness of international law, or cite extenuating circumstances. International organizations (IOs) counter government rhetoric to reinforce the law. These competing messages shape support for punishment among citizens and political elites. We test our argument with survey experiments measuring perceptions of alleged military aggression and human rights violations. Among the US public and a global sample of diplomatic elites, foreign government denials and claims about mitigating circumstances reduce punitive attitudes. IO rebuttals counter denials but can only partially neutralize other claims. We offer a new framework for analyzing the politics of noncompliance and present novel evidence illuminating the strengths and limitations of IOs in enforcing international law.",

    "abstract": "How can public agencies become more responsive to marginalized citizens? We develop a theory of bureaucratic responsiveness as the product of resources, representation, and recognition. While material investments and inclusion of marginalized personnel are insufficient in passive forms, they can be jointly activated through institutional recognition : organizational dynamics that enhance a social group’s visibility and ascribe value to efforts to meet their needs. We illustrate this in the domains of policing and gender, examining station-level Women’s Help Desks in India. Combining a large-scale experiment and sustained qualitative research, we reveal how the desks—when staffed by female officers—increased police responsiveness to women’s cases. This occurred as female personnel actively used help desk resources to build professional standing while supporting women. These gains, however, were constrained by patriarchal norms that limit reporting and prosecution of gender-based violence. Our findings illuminate possibilities and challenges of institutional change in unequal settings.",

    "abstract": "Globally, prejudicial attitudes toward women persist. By taking anti-discriminatory stances, value-oriented organizations – e.g., political parties and religious denominations – can tap into group identities to shape their members’ attitudes. We know much less about the role of organizations that are not inherently value-oriented – such as sports teams – in accomplishing the same. Yet, as various campaigns by sports teams worldwide indicate, this is precisely what non-value-oriented organizations increasingly attempt to do. Can football team fandom be leveraged to promote gender-egalitarian attitudes? We address this question with data from a national survey in Brazil and a survey experiment conducted in partnership with a major Brazilian football club. We find that while football team identity is salient and may be leveraged to change displayed social attitudes, the Club’s anti-sexism campaign inadvertently increased men’s expressed prejudice toward women in football – although it may have also improved institutional trust among women.",

When voting by mail, people can make their choices at their own pace at a time convenient to them, conducting additional research if they wish to do so. We propose that when people vote by mail, they are more likely to successfully identify the candidates that are best aligned with their preferences. Using cross-sectional and causal inference approaches, we show that people who voted by mail in 2020 were more likely to vote correctly than those who cast their ballots in-person. Vote-by-mail was more than just a way to minimize health risks during the coronavirus pandemic – it also had civic dividends. When people vote by mail, they are more likely to choose candidates aligned with their stated preferences.",

    "abstract": "Statistics Sweden employs a unique approach to higher-level aggregation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In the Swedish method, so-called “long-term links” are used to incorporate contemporaneous weight information into the index with a two-year lag. We compare this approach to the more standard method used for the European Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), as well as to a long-term link variation of the HICP methodology. Our main focus is on year-on-year rates of change. This is motivated by the fact that, while long-term links by construction should improve the measurement of price change over longer time periods, effects on year-on-year inflation are less clear. In a simulation study performed on Swedish data, inflation rates are evaluated against a common benchmark measure. Several types of decompositions are also derived to help further explain differences and similarities between the methods.",

    "abstract": "Disability measures often collect information on functional limitations but may not fully capture disability status in the working-age population, and seldom collect the type of disability people have. The present research used a multimethodological approach to assess new disability measures for a federal survey. The questions were designed to capture whether respondents have disabilities that impact the kind or amount of paid work they can do, as well as a novel question that collected type of disability. We used multiple methodologies, including cognitive interviews, card-sort/categorization tasks, and web probing. During cognitive interviews, we used retrospective probes to assess the response process and question sensitivity, and a card-sort task, where participants sorted a list of health conditions into similar groups. Additional participants completed a web-probing study, which used a mix of open- and closed-ended probes and were compared to the cognitive interview results. We used thematic coding to compare findings from all three methods, including unique findings that would have been missed if only one method had been used. Each method supported allowing respondents to select multiple types of disabilities, simplification of response categories, and including examples of health conditions that help distinguish categories from one another and vary in level of severity. The cognitive interviews helped refine response category names, while the card-sort and categorization tasks helped develop appropriate category examples. The web-probing study revealed additional question sensitivity not observed in the other methods. We discuss the advantages of a multimethodological approach to survey research.",

    "abstract": "This study uses qualitative thematic analysis to explore a dataset of open-ended textual responses from 369 online panelists explaining why they rated feeling more or less uncomfortable being asked the same sensitive survey question (“How many sex partners have you had in the last 12 months?”) in a hypothetical live video interview versus in two other interviewer-administered survey modes (in person and by phone) and two self-administered survey modes (a web survey and a “prerecorded video” interview in which participants enter their answers after playing a video of the interviewer asking the question). Different participants reported finding the very same features of live video—for example, social copresence with the interviewer, seeing and being seen, a sense of privacy and anonymity—as leading to greater discomfort or greater comfort. The mixed-method analyses, which build on participants’ quantitative ratings of discomfort in the different modes, reveal video-specific concerns that are likely to be important to understand as video interviewing emerges as a new survey mode. These include the potential for a live video interview to be recorded and other household members to overhear (for some participants more concerning than in person or on the phone), and more nuanced distinctions about wanting to see or not see the interviewer and wanting to be seen or not be seen by the interviewer. Exploratory analyses suggest that participants’ video experience in other contexts and some demographic characteristics may correlate with different levels of self-reported discomfort with live video relative to other interviewing modes.",

However, annotating syntactic structure for a given natural language is arguably a harder task than annotating the onset and offset of speech units such as phonemes and syllables, as the latter can be identified by relying on the physically overt and temporally measurable properties of the signal, while syntactic units are generally covert and their chunking is model-driven. We describe and validate a pipeline that takes into account both physical and theoretical aspects of speech and language signals, and operates a theory-driven and explicit alignment between overt speech units and covert syntactic units.",

In this visualization, the author uses household-level data from the American Community Survey from 2013 to 2023 ( n = 10,713,204 households) to estimate a linear probability model predicting Internet access by race/ethnicity, household educational attainment, and poverty status. The results suggest that household Internet access has increased over the past decade, but disparities still exist on all three dimensions.",

When Uzbekistan’s data are removed and statistical uncertainty is corrected to account for spatial correlations, KLW’s central estimate aligns closely with previous literature and their results are no longer statistically distinguishable from mitigation costs at any time this century.",

We call this method ‘science fiction science’. We suggest that the reason that this method has not been fully embraced yet, despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be reluctant to engage in work that faces such serious validity threats. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on the types of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the unconventional, immersive methods that it may require. We seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been marginalized for so long, the benefits it would bring if it could be built on strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle of validity improvement.",
