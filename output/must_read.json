    "authors": "Diego F M Oliveira, Qian Huang",
    "abstract": "This article examines gender disparities in academic communication research, focusing on authorship, collaboration, citation impact, faculty representation, and compensation in leading U.S. public universities. An analysis of 62,359 papers from 121 journals (2004–2023) shows women constitute 50.4% of authors and nearly half of sole-authored works, yet receive fewer citations, even in higher-impact journals. Women-only teams perform strongly in journal impact factors, particularly in smaller groups, suggesting parity in some contexts. Persistent biases remain: women in larger mixed-gender teams are cited less, and women Assistant Professors earn 5.61% less than men, though women Associates slightly out-earn men. These findings highlight the need for institutional reforms to promote equitable pay, recognition, and representation in communication research.",

    "authors": "Jana H Dreston, Andreas Nanz",
    "abstract": "As political campaigns increasingly use social media to reach voters, scholars debate whether users actually acquire election-related knowledge or merely perceive themselves as more knowledgeable. It remains unclear whether social media enhances voting that aligns with users’ political attitudes (“correct voting”). Previous studies suggest social media effects vary substantially based on whether exposure is intentional or incidental. In a between-subject online experiment (N = 1,460), participants scrolled through a social media feed exposing them to policy statements either intentionally, incidentally, or not at all before voting in a mock election. We found that both intentional and incidental exposure increased objective knowledge, whereas only intentional exposure enhanced subjective knowledge. Yet, participants did not translate the acquired knowledge into aligned voting. However, those who intentionally sought election information felt more confident in their voting decision. Our findings suggest social media may mobilize voters more effectively than it enables them to make “good” decisions.",

    "abstract": "The present study provides an Italian-adapted version of the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) 2.0, namely Italian version of the MFD (it-MFD), for use in the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count software. The MFD 2.0 was translated and adapted from English into Italian following a multistep process. Subsequently, the reviewers compared the output with the original text to identify semantic discrepancies. Independent judges then evaluated the relevance of each word to the five moral foundations, and only the words assessed as both relevant and with a high level of agreement between the judges were included in the final version. The resulting it-MFD comprises 2,881 words. To evaluate the tool's effectiveness, we applied it to a sample of salient texts originally written in Italian and for which official English translations were available. The results are presented and discussed.",

Using a mixed-method approach, we examine researchers’ justifications to scale up content analysis and assess the methodological adjustments—or lack thereof—when employing supervised machine learning for 38 large-scale content analyses. Almost all of the included studies displayed deficiencies in study design, primarily related to the uncritical use of frequentist statistics on datasets containing the entire statistical population, or employing supervised machine learning without methodological adjustments to account for misclassifications. Our findings question the need for large datasets and automated coding in the first place.",

While the positive effects of narrative transportation have been examined in the SMI context, its potential backfire effects are rarely explored. Through two online experiments, Study 1 ( N = 161) found that narratives (vs. non-narratives) resulted in less positive ad responses, with these effects fully mediated by perceived manipulative intent. Study 2 ( N = 257) replicated these findings and further revealed that sponsorship disclosure moderated these effects: disclosure exacerbates the backfire effects of narratives by heightening perceived manipulative intent, whereas in non-narrative ads, it enhances ad effects by reducing consumers’ inference of manipulative intent.",

    "authors": "Florian Muhle, Indra Bock",
    "abstract": "The article demonstrates intermedia dynamics in the hybrid media system and reveals the susceptibility of traditional media to attempts to influence their agenda and public opinion formation. Specifically, it deals with the thematization of a faux pas by the conservative chancellor candidate Armin Laschet during the German federal election campaign in 2021. To analyze the intermedia dynamics in this case, the first step is a content analysis of journalistic reporting of the faux pas, which illustrates the responsiveness of traditional media to social media trends and activities. The research shows that journalistic media addressed the faux pas only after it was problematized on social media and became visible through the trending hashtag #LaschetLacht on Twitter. Building on this, the next step involves network and content analyses of Twitter users and their posts about the faux pas, which shed light on how the hashtag trend emerged and gained momentum. Key actors who were particularly relevant to the emergence and dissemination of the hashtag are identified, as well as their strategies to reinforce the trend and draw the attention of journalistic media to it. As the analysis reveals, highly active accounts played a significant role by attempting to artificially amplify the emerging Twitter trend, aiming to exploit the attention logics in the hybrid media system.",

    "title": "Historical Roots of Information Flows in Hybrid Media Systems",
    "authors": "Silke Fürst",
    "abstract": "Research on hybrid media systems has predominantly focused on recent digital developments, often overlooking historical precedents and long-term patterns that continue to shape today’s media landscape. This study addresses that gap by examining information flows—the cross-media dissemination of information and amplification of attention—from a historical perspective. Combining a literature review in journalism and media history with a longitudinal analysis of newspaper content, the study investigates four phenomena that illustrate information flows over time: media events, scandals, intermedia agenda-setting, and metaphors of public response. These phenomena are closely linked to recurring phrases and terms in public discourse and function as self-reinforcing communication patterns that connect different media channels and logics. The analysis draws on press coverage from three leading German-language newspapers: &lt;em&gt;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; (Germany), &lt;em&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; (Switzerland), and &lt;em&gt;Die Presse &lt;/em&gt;(Austria). The findings reveal that terms such as “media frenzy,” “media attention,” and “scandal” have been used since the mid-20th century to describe cross-media dynamics, well before the advent of digital and social media. The frequency of such terms has increased over time, particularly with the expansion and diversification of mass media, and again with the rise of digitalization. By situating information flows in a historical context, the study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of continuity and change within hybrid media systems. While focused on German-speaking countries, the results suggest broader relevance and encourage future research that further integrates historical perspectives into the study of information flows in hybrid media systems.",

    "authors": "Camelia Cușnir",
    "abstract": "This study explores how the communication strategies of public institutions have been redefined by digital platforms, with a particular focus on TikTok. Specifically, it examines the extent to which elements of “govtainment”—the “spectacularisation” of government communication through digital media—are present in the communication strategies of public institutions. We analysed how the communication strategies of two Romanian ministries on TikTok are shaped by the platform’s specific characteristics, the impact of these adaptations on their audiences, and what elements of “govtainment” can be identified within their content. We employed a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative content analysis of TikTok publications by Romania’s Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Internal Affairs—the only two ministries with a consistent presence on the platform. The findings indicate that both ministries adapt their communication strategies to align with TikTok’s features, incorporating elements that enhance virality, such as tone, viral trends and sounds, content formats, speech acts, and humanisation. Our analysis confirms the presence of govtainment elements in the communication strategies employed by these ministries. However, when correlating spectacularisation elements such as trend participation, tone, and speech acts with audience engagement, we found that their presence does not necessarily result in the highest engagement rates. Nevertheless, the overall figures suggest that both institutions have managed to gain significant engagement on their TikTok accounts.",

This study examines the psychological consequences of being phubbed and how individuals cope through mobile use based on the temporal need-threat model. A lab experiment was conducted where participants interacted with partners and were phubbed. Results showed that phubbed individuals felt socially excluded, experienced threats to fundamental needs, and reported lower mood than those in the no-phubbing condition. Phubbing also led to less favorable attitudes toward the partners and lower interaction intention. Analysis of mobile use during a break after phubbing revealed no significant differences in social versus non-social mobile use. Interestingly, individuals with high social mobile use reported increased need threats. These findings highlight the impact of phubbing and its implications for need satisfaction and social interactions in the digital age.",

I investigate how scientists integrate themselves into policy disputes. Through a survey, I identify four groups of scientists with specific self-images regarding their roles in policy disputes: Moderate Mainstreamers, Issue Advisors, Issue Advocates, and Honest Brokers . Furthermore, the findings reveal differences in how these groups of scientists perceive the importance of science in policy-making: Particularly U.S.-based Issue Advocates wish for science to direct policy-making. In addition, I find that pandemic researchers overwhelmingly do not support political causes by selectively communicating political advice. I present empirically evidence that pandemic researchers sought to clarify the relevance of research during the pandemic, but did not attempt to distort policy disputes dishonestly.",

    "abstract": "Genes are increasingly understood to influence behavior. Research—generally conducted among convenience samples— has suggested that genetic influences tend to be perceived as playing a greater role in positive (e.g. prosocial) behaviors than in negative (e.g. antisocial) behaviors. Several potential bases for this asymmetry have been explored previously. We examined, in a U.S. sample, whether an asymmetry in genetic attributions between prosocial and antisocial behavior would be observed, and if so, what might help to explain it. Results revealed that the asymmetry did occur and appeared to be robustly mediated by an asymmetry between how “natural” prosocial and antisocial behavior are perceived to be. Genetic attributions were also lower on average when the individual was described as African American, especially as an African American man. These findings provide further evidence that genetic attributions are endorsed selectively, in ways that appear to reflect pre-existing psychological motivations and views about human nature.",

People in collectivist societies are less outspoken about science in daily life, whereas lower education is associated with higher outspokenness. Limited access to digital media is correlated with participation in public protests on science matters. We discuss implications for future research, policy, and practice.",

However, a growing number of users perceive negativity in political debate taking place in those venues and are increasingly frustrated when discussing politics with those they disagree with. In this article, we test the proposition that perceiving online discussions as healthier (i.e. more polite and civil) than offline discussions invigorates online political participation. We rely on an online survey fielded in 17 European countries on more than 28,000 individuals. Our findings indicate that being embedded in healthier discussions on social media is more of an important predictor of online participation for those respondents reporting higher political discussion fatigue and less so for those perceiving online discussions as fun.

This study aims to extend previous research by comparing the widely used general NFM measure with topic-specific perceptions of entertainment, sports, politics, COVID-19, and climate change news. We assess the strength, predictors, and outcomes of NFM perceptions across those different thematic domains. Our findings show that NFM perceptions are stronger for soft news (entertainment and sports) compared to hard news (politics, COVID-19, climate change). In addition, interest in a news topic is associated with lower NFM perceptions for hard news and higher perceptions for soft news. While the traditional NFM measure reflects “News Finds Me” perceptions in politics and COVID-19 well, it is not as effective in capturing perceptions of climate change and soft news. Our results emphasize the need to explore different news genres to better understand news consumption beliefs and behaviors.",

    "title": "New/s Gatekeepers: The Impact of Social Media Algorithms on Arab TV News Coverage",
    "authors": "Alyaa Anter, Nermeen Ibrahim",
    "abstract": "Drawing on gatekeeping theory and platform governance, this study examined Arab journalists’ perspectives on news gatekeeping via social media, the challenges they faced when covering politically sensitive events, and the strategies they employed to address those challenges. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining in-depth interviews with twenty-four Arab multimedia journalists, social media specialists, and managers, along with an online survey of 171 Arab journalists from four Arab countries. The results revealed that the participants perceived algorithms as powerful intermediaries that considerably influenced their professional practices and news values on social media. They reported their experiences of shadow banning and content removal, particularly when reporting on Arab political issues such as the Palestinian issue. Journalists have reported that they must either adapt to the algorithmic dynamics or employ strategies to circumvent the algorithmic restrictions on Arab news coverage. This study underscores the need for greater transparency in algorithmic curation to ensure the fair representation of diverse voices in political news coverage.",

    "authors": "Ming M. Boyer, Cal le Gall, Carolina Plescia",
    "abstract": "Negative campaigns can have different effects on voting behavior and political attitudes. While recent work has differentiated between contexts and campaigns, few have investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of negative campaigns. We argue that negative campaigning may affect whether citizens understand voting as supporting one candidate or party (positive meanings of voting), as opposing another (negative meanings of voting), or even as something useless, unpleasant or undesirable (anti-voting meanings). Using preregistered cross-sectional analyses in the 2022 Hungarian and US elections, we confirm that negative and anti-voting meanings are pervasive, and related to political parties’ use of negative and “dirty” campaigns. Two preregistered survey experiments, however, only confirm the effects of the most outrageous campaign messages. We conclude that meanings of voting are important democratic attitudes that are related to parties’ campaigning behavior. However, they are relatively stable attitudes that are only affected by relatively extreme stimuli.",

    "authors": "Jana H Dreston, Audrey Halversen, Brian E Weeks",
    "abstract": "Political discussion is often considered essential for a healthy democracy, but what motivates people to engage in it? Traditionally, objective political knowledge—holding factually correct beliefs about politics—has been considered a crucial prerequisite for political action, such as political talk. Recent research challenges this conventional wisdom, arguing that subjective knowledge—individuals’ metacognitive perceptions of their own knowledge—may be a more accurate predictor of political engagement more broadly. Thus, in this study, we sought to better understand how both objective and subjective political knowledge relate to political discussion with different audiences (in-group, out-group, strong ties, and weak ties). Results from a 2-wave survey (YouGov) of U.S. adults (W1 = 1,800; W2 = 1,265) showed that people who think they know a lot about politics are more willing to engage in all types of political discussion. In contrast, objective knowledge is only associated with political discussions with political in-group members and strong ties. Thus, discussions with the out-group members and weak ties may be motivated by a flawed perception of knowledge that is not supported by actual facts and information (i.e., knowledge illusion).",

    "authors": "Homero Gil de Zúñiga, Ryan Yang Wang, Zicheng Cheng",
    "abstract": "This study employs an agent-based model (ABM) simulation grounded in polarization theory to explore how social and media influences shape affective polarization, social diversity, and media diversity within a hostile partisan information environment. We examine four scenarios: minimal, strong, social-dominated effect, and media-dominated effect, by iterating 16 combinations of parameters, including influence strength, homogeneous discussion, and selective exposure rates. Calibrated with a real-world U.S. population dataset, results show that while social and media influences accelerate sorting, selectivity structure is the primary driver of affective polarization. Notably, low homogeneous discussion and low selective exposure produce the highest polarization levels across four scenarios due to a probabilistic backfire effect that reflects identity-protective cognition. Strong, locally concentrated social influence sharply reduces social diversity, whereas media influence alone cannot produce convergence without social reinforcement. Media diversity proves more resilient due to global exposure, though it declines under high selective exposure and strong media influence. Despite initial partisan gaps, final-stage outcomes reveal minimal differences between Democrats and Republicans across all conditions.",

    "authors": "Diana C. Mutz",
    "abstract": "Although studies of Americans’ general discussant networks have been repeated over time, research that assesses change in the nature of Americans’ political discussion networks has yet to be conducted in nationally representative probability surveys. In this study I answer two questions about the quality of the American public sphere that have generated widespread speculation, but little evidence to date. First, how have Americans’ political discussion networks changed over the past 25 y? Second, are the consequences of these changes what one would expect based on previous theory linking Americans’ interpersonal information environments to political tolerance and political participation? I resolve competing claims suggesting that people feel less free to discuss politics, with claims suggesting instead that political discussion now permeates everyday life to a greater extent than in the past. Findings suggest widespread increases in political discussion, changes driven almost entirely by increases in like-minded political discussion partners. Surprisingly, Americans are no more or less likely to engage in conversations across lines of political difference. The predicted consequences of these fluctuations confirm an intrinsic tension between characteristics valued in democratic citizens. Political tolerance has declined significantly, along with decreased awareness of rationales for others’ relative to one’s own views. Political participation is significantly higher on average than 25 y ago. Few people reported engaging with online political discussants, despite efforts to make sure they were included in network measures.",
