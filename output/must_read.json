    "abstract": "This article conducts a bibliometric analysis of 816 Games and Culture publications (2006–2025) indexed in Scopus to explore how specialized journals shape the institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields. Through citation networks, keyword co-occurrence, authorship, and geographic analyses, it treats the journal as a model of scholarly infrastructure in game studies. Results reveal steady publication growth (from 20 to over 100 articles annually), increasing collaboration (2.39 authors per paper), substantial citation accumulation (2006–2008 works exceeding 3,000 citations), and diversification beyond anglophone regions. Temporal keyword trends trace thematic shifts from virtual worlds and MMOs to esports, ethics, gamification, and representation. These findings inform broader debates on how niche journals foster disciplinary legitimacy, showing that Games and Culture has been central to consolidating game studies and offers a transferable framework for examining institutionalization in other interdisciplinary domains."

    "abstract": "Current explanations for political divides in entertainment media use identify divergent preferences for or evaluations of content. According to the theory of normative social behavior (TNSB), extratextual information such as cues about the audience may also influence exposure intentions due to viewers’ perceptions of ingroup norms. Social media users discuss and form communities around entertainment content while conveying partisan and racial identities. A preregistered experiment exposed Black and White partisans (N = 1,259) to tweets in which a television show was endorsed by co- or out-partisans who were racial in- or out-group members. Exposure intentions were stronger when endorsement came from co-partisans; however, this effect was stronger for White partisans. Treatment effects were mediated by perceived ingroup norms and perceptions of how much of the audience consisted of ingroup members. Implications of multiple identities (i.e., race and partisanship) for the TNSB and the study of partisan entertainment divides are discussed."

Inspired by the marketing concept of the choice set, we conducted two experiments in the US (N1 = 731; N2 = 396) to examine how choice set size (number of articles presented at a time) and composition (ratio of supportive “pro” to opposing “anti” articles) affect news exposure, attitudes, and intentions. Smaller choice sets with fewer articles led individuals to select fewer articles overall and fewer cross-cutting articles that challenged preexisting attitudes. Choice set composition did not affect whether individuals engaged with articles or their overall news exposure, but it shaped which articles they chose: the selection and browsing of cross-cutting news differed notably between homogeneous (all pro or all anti) and mixed sets. Neither choice set size nor composition systematically affected attitudes or behavioral intentions in the short term."

Using a two-alternative forced-choice task, participants selected between two faces differing in masculinity-femininity traits to match an Italian cue word. In Study 1, participants were presented with gender-marked pronouns as cue words, and they consistently chose faces matching the pronoun's gender. Study 2 replaced pronouns with common gender nouns denoting professional roles, revealing a gender-career bias: female-dominated jobs were matched with more feminine faces, and male-dominated jobs with more masculine ones. Study 3 introduced gender-marked articles, which eliminated the bias of Study 2, suggesting that explicit linguistic markers can override implicit associations. Across all studies, effects were stronger when facial traits were clearly distinct. The findings highlight how language shapes cognitive biases and introduce a novel paradigm for assessing implicit associations. This research offers practical insights for promoting gender equality through language-based interventions."

This study analyzed varying configurations of parent-child political discordance—including partisan-partisan and partisan-neutral dyads—in Hong Kong ( N = 586) following the 2019 social unrest and examined its familial and psychological consequences over two weeks ( n = 200). Findings indicate that neutral-partisan dyads, similar to their partisan-counterparts, exhibited significantly larger differences in support for government, police, and anti-government protestors compared to politically concordant dyads. Dyads in which one member supported the anti-government (“ yellow ”) camp and the other supported the pro-government (“ blue ”) camp or identified as neutral reported lower levels of positive communication and poorer family functioning than dyads sharing the same stance. Mediation analyses revealed that reduced positive communication explained the impact of political discordance on increased psychological distress across discordant dyads. However, this mediation effect on family functioning was observed only in yellow - neutral and yellow - blue dyads. By incorporating partisan-neutral disagreements into the analysis, this study offers an ecologically valid account of parent-child political discordance among partisan and neutral family members, highlighting the potential threat to both personal and family well-being when intrafamilial communication is compromised."

Drawing on Hallin’s sphere model and Egelhofer et al.’s coding categories, it uses manual content analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling to identify rhetorical functions and patterns. Findings show that the term “fake news” functions mainly as a weaponized label to delegitimize opponents rather than describe misinformation. The results show how alternative media redraw boundaries between consensus, controversy, and deviance, underscoring their role in intensifying partisan discourse and redefining political communication."

However, little is known about the strategies employed by the far right to drive this trend, particularly outside Western countries and major platforms. This study addresses these gaps by conducting a systematic content analysis of far-right content on VK (VKontakte), the most widely used Russian social network, to examine the content’s characteristics that facilitate the mainstreaming of the far right. Findings indicate that far-right actors leverage agenda-setting mechanisms and adopt news-like formats to embed xenophobic and exclusionary narratives within the broader mainstream Russian discourse. This study contributes to research on far-right content-related strategies and the interplay between non-Western contexts, digital affordances, and far-right communication in less regulated online spaces."

    "abstract": "Audience engagement signals on social media platforms have shaped how media outlets produce news. Mukerjee et al. examined this phenomenon empirically by estimating the extent to which media outlets respond to audience engagement signals on Facebook in deciding what news to publish on the platform. However, the extent to which their findings can be generalized to other social media platforms remains unknown. We replicate their study on Twitter using the same methodological pipeline ( N ≈ 4 . 55 million posts, twenty-eight media outlets, between 2015 and 2019). Our results indicate that media responsiveness to audience engagement on Twitter aligns with the core patterns identified in the Facebook study. Specifically, topics receiving higher audience engagement generally experience significantly increased coverage shortly thereafter, and the responsiveness is not conditioned on the nature of topics. However, we observe three differences in dynamics on Twitter compared to Facebook: first, the maximum response window on Twitter is shorter; second, conservative outlets on Twitter are not more likely to respond to engagement signals; third, platform-specific metrics (e.g., retweets) show different patterns of responsiveness. Our replication thus highlights the generalizability of the original study while underscoring the importance of platform-specific characteristics in shaping media production on social media."

These message-based experiments often hinge on intermediary variables—actions subjects must take to actually receive the treatment or control embedded in a message. Whether subjects open the message is a crucial intermediary step, which can serve as a condition for estimating downstream treatment effects or as an outcome of interest in its own right. Yet opens are often measured with error, most notably when some openers are misclassified as non-openers in email-based studies. We characterize the resulting bias, derive interpretable bounds on effects for well-defined subgroups, and provide sensitivity analyses for mismeasurement, thereby offering practical guidance for message-based experiments conducted through email and other communication technologies."

Yet, relying on sexual norms theory, this study unveils persistent sexual prejudice. We differentiate between “normalized” sexual issues, like same-gender marriage, which have gained mainstream acceptance, and “nonnormalized” issues, such as nontraditional sexual practices and relationships, which remain stigmatized. Through a conjoint experiment in Catalonia, Spain, we investigate public attitudes toward adoptive parents with varying sexual orientations, relationship types, and age differences, confirming that discriminatory preferences are prevalent in contexts with low social desirability. By highlighting the continued prejudice against both normative and nonnormative sexual issues, this research contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of sexual attitudes and the challenges facing LGBTQ+ politics and rights."

    "abstract": "The planning of sample size for research studies often focuses on obtaining a significant result given a specified level of power, significance, and an anticipated effect size. This planning requires prior knowledge of the study design and a statistical analysis to calculate the proposed sample size. However, there may not be one specific testable analysis from which to derive power (Silberzahn et al., Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science , 1 (3), 337356, 2018) or a hypothesis to test for the project (e.g., creation of a stimuli database). Modern power and sample size planning suggestions include accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE, Kelley, Behavior Research Methods , 39 (4), 755–766, 2007; Maxell et al., Annual Review of Psychology , 59 , 537–563, 2008) and simulation of proposed analyses (Chalmers &amp; Adkins, The Quantitative Methods for Psychology , 16 (4), 248–280, 2020). These toolkits offer flexibility in traditional power analyses that focus on the if-this, then-that approach. However, both AIPE and simulation require either a specific parameter (e.g., mean, effect size, etc.) or a statistical test for planning sample size. In this tutorial, we explore how AIPE and simulation approaches can be combined to accommodate studies that may not have a specific hypothesis test or wish to account for the potential of a multiverse of analyses. Specifically, we focus on studies that use multiple items and suggest that sample sizes can be planned to measure those items adequately and precisely, regardless of the statistical test. This tutorial also provides multiple code vignettes and package functionality that researchers can adapt and apply to their own measures."

By contrast, both Trump and Clinton voters reported less prejudice of their own. We conducted a 2024 conceptual replication, measuring perceived norms of prejudice and own-prejudice toward 128 groups, both before ( N = 362) and after ( N = 261) the U.S. election. We separately measured the negativity of Trump’s campaign rhetoric toward these groups ( N = 188). Levels of prejudice and perceived norms of prejudice acceptability were mostly stable pre-/post-election, but Trump’s negative rhetoric predicted an increase in perceived acceptability of prejudice among targeted groups (replicating the 2016 results), and a rise in self-reported prejudice in the same groups post-election (reversing the 2016 results). Despite changes in the sociopolitical context between elections, the election of a leading politician who campaigned on prejudice was again associated with increases in the acceptability of prejudice."

By when must we take action to prevent its worst consequences? This article presents the first large-scale assessment of the structure and evolution of temporalities expressed in U.S. media discussions on climate change (2000 to 2021). To do so, we developed a novel computational framework for detecting and interpreting temporal expressions in textual data. Our analyses yield three main findings: First, temporal horizons for climate change have continuously shrunk since 2000, stably targeting, on average, the year 2060. However, second, while anticipated effects are getting closer, horizons for the coordination of climate action have remained highly stable, averaging around 16 years into the future at any given time. Third, contrasting the stability of explicitly stated horizons, we find a sharply expanding discourse of urgency patterned by outbursts of urgency: sudden surges in calls for immediate action or warnings against climate change’s devastating consequences during events like the 2020 California wildfires. By uncovering this disjuncture of different forms of temporality, we illuminate a crucial aspect of the climate change debate, contribute to the sociological theory of events, and identify some of the conditions underlying climate inaction."

    "abstract": "AI is expected to reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Large-scale survey data ( N = 37,079; 38 European countries) indicate that the public tends to view AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for technology-related, political, and sociodemographic factors, these data further show that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Two preregistered, nationally representative experiments ( N = 1,202, United Kingdom; replication study N = 1,200, United States) provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democracy and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may decrease democratic legitimacy and public engagement in shaping the future of AI."
