    "abstract": "This contribution aims to better understand the level of and reasons for the trust U.S. television viewers place in the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) amidst what is often perceived as a general decline in trust in U.S. media and public institutions. Based on a nationwide survey of 1533 self-declared PBS viewers and rooted in theories of the conceptualization of organizational trust, our findings suggest that PBS viewers trust PBS along three vectors: institution-based trust (value for public dollars); characteristics-based trust (news and children’s programming); and process-based trust (nostalgia). This trust, notably for news and political programming, is shared by viewers across the political spectrum. We argue this unique multi-faceted foundation of trust, media, and politics can be the basis for a rehabilitated sense of trust in U.S. public institutions and can also be marshaled to justify the political sustainability and, even, amplification of U.S. public media.",

    "authors": "Hyeonchang Gim",
    "abstract": "Positive mediated intergroup contact improves intergroup relations. By examining such effects in the foreign-language film context with varying verbal delivery methods, the study explores outgroup characters’ language accommodation to viewers as a critical mechanism. This experiment ( N = 204) investigated how different verbal delivery methods in a foreign language movie featuring Asian Americans (titled Minari ) influenced attitudes toward Asian Americans. Among native English speakers in America, watching the film with a native speaker's English dubbing (vs. foreign-accented English dubbing vs. foreign language with subtitles) led to more positive attitudes toward Asian Americans, mediated by two theory-driven mechanisms: perceived similarities and processing fluency with the target Asian American character. Results indicated that exposure to the target Asian American character in the native speaker's English dubbed (vs. subtitled) condition resulted in more perceived similarities with the character and fluent processing of the character's speech. Subsequently, these factors translated into positive evaluations of the character and Asian Americans as a group. With an emphasis on the role of language accommodation to viewers, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

    "authors": "Diana Camila Garzón-Velandia, James W. Pennebaker",
    "abstract": "Three studies developed and validated a linguistic dictionary to measure negative affective polarization in English and Spanish political texts. It captures three dimensions: negative affect, delegitimization, and political context. In the first study, two independent judges evaluated the candidate words, and reliability indicators were calculated, showing acceptable values for short texts (.572 in English, .541 in Spanish) and higher values for larger corpora (.964 in English, .957 in Spanish). The second study tested discriminant validity by comparing negative affective polarization scores in social media comments on politics and entertainment. Results showed significantly higher polarization scores in political content, confirming the dictionary's validity. The third study compared the dictionary to an existing online polarization measure, finding greater coverage and alignment with the construct. Additionally, it was observed that polarization scores were higher in texts containing hate speech compared to those where it was absent. The findings suggest that the dictionary in both languages have strong psychometric properties, making it a valuable tool for analyzing online content, particularly social media comments. It can be used as an independent measure or as input for machine and deep learning models.",

Findings indicate a significant relationship between COVID-19 death rates and reduced divorce searches during the first two years, with no mediation by stay-at-home behavior. In the third year, stay-at-home behavior began significantly mediating an increase in divorce searches, especially pronounced in high-income countries. These results highlight the evolving societal responses to the pandemic and underscore the importance of adaptable support strategies in the face of changing marital dynamics during public health crises.",

This study, grounded in protection motivation theory, explored how scam prevention communication and victimization influence their information-seeking behaviors. Analyzing survey data from 521 migrant workers in China, findings showed that scam prevention communication increases perceived severity, encouraging information seeking, but has limited effects on other cognitive factors. Victimization reinforces victim-blaming beliefs and social stigma while lowering self-efficacy and discouraging proactive behaviors. Victimization also indirectly drives information seeking by increasing perceptions of information insufficiency. These findings emphasized the importance of anti-fraud campaigns that not only raise awareness but also address psychological barriers among vulnerable groups.",

Consistent with prior, mostly US-focused research, we find that European tech-workers hold a liberal worldview, which values openness to change, individualism, and universalism and devalues conservatism. However, our findings challenge the notion of tech-workers as being a completely distinct or a homogeneous group in terms of their values. While developers appear to be substantively different from other occupations and non-developers working in tech, non-developers hold values similar to those of other occupational elites, such as professionals and managers.

Results indicate that government posts or those with visual cues received fewer “likes” but garnered more supportive comments, while awareness prompts and legal warnings received more supportive comments across three misinformation types.

These individuals have repeatedly been labeled as opinion leaders, but often without in-depth theoretical reflection. We fill this gap by introducing a novel typology that allows for greater scrutiny in the identification of different types of opinion leaders in the modern media environment. Using this typology, we adequately capture—for the first time—opinion leadership as practiced by actors like SMIs, describing them as Proximal Mass Opinion Leaders (short: ProMOLs). We highlight that—despite their reach—ProMOLs exert a seemingly interpersonal and horizontal influence by engaging in personalized communication with opinion followers in self-built networks. Furthermore, we theoretically model the various flows of communication between ProMOLs, their communities, and other actors in the public sphere, thereby illustrating the multiple layers of ProMOLs’ impact. Finally, we discuss the model’s implications and suggest directions for future research.",

Quantitative analyses showed different forms of online gambling, participation in gambling communities online, and instant loans associated with increased problem gambling. Qualitative analyses revealed that gamblers were drawn to gambling sites through an online ecosystem including complex social and monetary incentive structures and sought instant loans through dedicated websites to continue gambling. Together, the results show that gamblers’ problems have deepened and become more multifaceted due to online environments. The online realm enables gambling through ubiquitous opportunity, targeted marketing, social influence, and access to gambling credit, although it also offers information and peer support groups to help gamblers abstain.",

    "abstract": "Social media communication of government agencies should ideally be truthful and impartial to sustain public trust in government and support democratic goals. However, the politicization of agencies may harm the benefits that impartial and engaged communication brings. In this study, we provide a linguistic framework for analyzing how agency politicization is reflected in the language of government social media communication by asking: How does the agency (1) use speech acts (e.g., commands, requests), (2) talk about itself and others, (3) refer to statistical and scientific information, and (4) express positive and negative sentiment? We demonstrate the application of the framework by conducting a case study of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s messaging on Twitter across administrations with distinct ideological alignments between the agency and its top administrator. The analysis shows that (1) requests and statistical information were used substantially more under the administrator more aligned with the agency mission; (2) expressive speech acts were used more often during the administration less aligned with the agency mission; and (3) posts were generally positive but more so under the administration less aligned with the agency mission, possibly to counteract increased public criticism. We discuss the results in relation to theories of politicization and government communication, and the implications for citizens and public sector communicators using social media sites.",

    "abstract": "Measuring affective polarization, defined as the liking for one's political ingroup and the dislike for political outgroups, poses methodological challenges in multiparty systems: evaluations of seven, 13 or even more parties in a survey are costly, time‐consuming and demanding. Some studies therefore use subsets of parties to create brief affective polarization measures. However, it is unclear how this affects the construct and predictive validity of these brief measures, potentially causing problematic inferences. Across 39 countries (), we demonstrate that brief measures that include ratings of only three to five parties can maintain acceptable validity, as illustrated by strong correlations with full measures and consistent associations with political correlates. The construct and predictive validity of brief measures are best when selecting a set of large, ideologically diverse parties. We provide specific recommendations for the effective measurement of affective polarization in different multiparty systems.",

This study uses a MultiTrait MultiError approach to assess the data quality of issue questions by separating four sources of variation: trait, acquiescence, method, and random error. The questions generally achieved moderate data quality, with 76% on average representing valid variance. Random error made up the largest proportion of error (23%). Error due to method and acquiescence was small. We found that 5-point scales are generally better than 11-point scales, while answers by respondents with lower political sophistication achieved lower data quality.

However, they typically lack information about the foreign partners with whom these firms trade. Linking import data from one NSO to corresponding export data from a partner NSO could significantly enhance statistics on firms’ international operations. While technically feasible, such linkage is legally constrained by strict privacy laws. Private set intersection (PSI) protocols may help address privacy concerns but require unique identifiers to avoid linkage errors. To overcome this limitation, we propose a PSI protocol with three innovations. First, we estimate the rates of linkage error by modeling the number of links from a given record. Second, we adjust an estimated population mean according to the estimated linkage accuracy. Lastly, our adjustment explicitly accounts for this accuracy without assuming a particular relationship among the target variables.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of smart devices, in particular mobile devices, has widened the potential types of data that can be collected in the social sciences. Given the fact that traditional surveys require more and more effort, new data sources collected via smart devices can potentially improve measurement of variables of interest and representation of the target population. New data sources also bring new challenges. New data sources, such as smartphone sensor data offer less control and coherence than traditional data such as administrative and survey data do, and are therefore often integrated either during, or after data collection. Respondents remain in control and help to resolve inconsistencies, missing data, or provide context. We discuss the consequences of hybrid data collection and methodology needed to reduce errors in smart surveys. Since quantification of the various types of errors is costly and time-consuming, we present a number of practical criteria. These criteria help evaluate whether hybrid data collection may have a positive business case and justify further investments in systems for data collection, data processing, and integration. We apply the criteria to three case studies: the measurement of mobility, consumption, and physical activities. Large-scale field experiments have been conducted for each of the case studies that allow us to evaluate the criteria.",

    "authors": "Jennifer Stromer-Galley, Brian McKernan, Saklain Zaman, Chinmay Maganur, Sampada Regmi",
    "abstract": "Systematic content analysis of messaging has been a staple method in the study of communication. While computer-assisted content analysis has been used in the field for three decades, advances in machine learning and crowd-based annotation combined with the ease of collecting volumes of text-based communication via social media have made the opportunities for classification of messages easier and faster. The greatest advancement yet might be in the form of general intelligence large language models (LLMs), which are ostensibly able to accurately and reliably classify messages by leveraging context to disambiguate meaning. It is unclear, however, how effective LLMs are in deploying the method of content analysis. In this study, we compare the classification of political candidate social media messages between trained annotators, crowd annotators, and large language models from Open AI accessed through the free Web (ChatGPT) and the paid API (GPT API) on five different categories of political communication commonly used in the literature. We find that crowd annotation generally had higher F1 scores than ChatGPT and an earlier version of the GPT API, although the newest version, GPT-4 API, demonstrated good performance as compared with the crowd and with ground truth data derived from trained student annotators. This study suggests the application of any LLM to an annotation task requires validation, and that freely available and older LLM models may not be effective for studying human communication.",

    "authors": "Xingyu Ken Chen, Jin-Cheon Na",
    "abstract": "Information disorder (IDO) presents a persistent challenge to society, necessitating innovative approaches to understanding its dynamics beyond just merely detecting it. This study introduces a theory-driven framework that integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) with deep learning, utilizing the target-based emotion–stance analysis (TESA) approach to analyze emotion and stance dynamics within IDO content. Complementing TESA, interactive graph generation (IGG) is applied for scalable and interpretable qualitative analyses. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study leverages TESA for target-centric emotion and stance analysis, evaluating target-based classifiers on both human-annotated and synthetic datasets. Additionally, the study explores synthetic data generation using generative AI to enrich the analysis, applying IGG to map complex data interactions. The study also found that integrating synthetic data developed from human annotations enhanced model performance, particularly for emotion classification tasks. Results demonstrate that IDO narratives significantly differ from non-IDO narratives, frequently leveraging negative emotions such as anger and disgust to manipulate public perception. TESA proved effective in capturing these nuanced variations, while IGG facilitated the triangulation of such findings via the scalable interpretation of emotional narratives, revealing that IDO content often amplifies polarizing and antagonistic perspectives. By combining TESA and IGG, this research emphasizes the importance of using NLP to extract and examine the emotional and stance nuances toward targets of interest within IDO context. This approach not only deepens theoretical insights into IDO’s persuasive mechanisms but also supports the development of practical tools for analyzing and managing the influence of IDO on public discourse.",

    "authors": "Armin Granulo, Christoph Fuchs, Robert Böhm",
    "abstract": "Governments need to develop and implement effective policies to address pressing societal problems of our time, such as climate change and global pandemics. While some policies focus on changing individual thoughts and behaviors (e.g., informational interventions, behavioral nudges), others involve systemic changes (e.g., car bans, vaccination mandates). Policymakers may use system-level policies to achieve socially desirable outcomes, yet often refrain from doing so because they anticipate public opposition. In this article, we propose that people’s psychological reactance driving this opposition is a transient phenomenon that dissipates once system-level policies are in place. Using secondary survey data ( N = 49,674) and experimental data (six studies; N = 4,629; all preregistered), we document that psychological reactance to system-level policies is greater when they are planned (ex ante implementation) than when they are already implemented (ex post implementation). We further demonstrate that this effect can be observed across various intervention contexts and provide insights into its underlying psychological mechanisms. Specifically, ex ante vs. ex post the system-level policy’s implementation, individuals focus more on the transition-induced personal losses than on the prospective societal outcome gains. In line with this perspective, we show that the decline in reactance to system-level policies after their implementation is mediated and moderated by the salience of personal losses, and that the initial reactance to such policies is mitigated by the salience of societal gains. These findings suggest that the public’s negative reactions to system-level policies are more transient than previously thought and can help policymakers design effective interventions.",

    "authors": "C. Y. Cyrus Chu, Juin-Jen Chang, Chang-Ching Lin",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between democratization and the development of AI and information and communication technology (ICT). Our empirical evidence shows that in the past 10 y, the advancement of AI/ICT has hindered the development of democracy in many countries around the world. Given that both the state rulers and civil society groups can use AI/ICT, the key that determines which side would benefit more from the advancement of these technologies hinges upon “technology complementarity.” In general, AI/ICT would be more complementary to the government rulers because they are more likely than civil society groups to access various administrative big data. Empirically, we propose three hypotheses and use statistical tests to verify our argument. Theoretically, we prove a proposition, showing that when the above-mentioned complementarity assumption is true, the AI/ICT advancements would enable rulers in authoritarian and fragile democratic countries to achieve better control over civil society forces, which leads to the erosion of democracy. Our analysis explains the recent ominous development in some fragile-democracy countries.",

    "authors": "Lisa P. Argyle, Ethan C. Busby, Joshua R. Gubler, Alex Lyman, Justin Olcott, Jackson Pond, David Wingate",
    "abstract": "Despite its importance to society and many decades of research, key questions about the social and psychological processes of political persuasion remain unanswered, often due to data limitations. We propose that AI tools, specifically generative large language models (LLMs), can be used to address these limitations, offering important advantages in the study of political persuasion. In two preregistered online survey experiments, we demonstrate the potential of generative AI as a tool to study persuasion and provide important insights about the psychological and communicative processes that lead to increased persuasion. Specifically, we test the effects of four AI-generated counterattitudinal persuasive strategies, designed to test the effectiveness of messages that include customization (writing messages based on a receiver’s personal traits and beliefs), and elaboration (increased psychological engagement with the argument through interaction). We find that all four types of persuasive AI produce significant attitude change relative to the control and shift vote support for candidates espousing views consistent with the treatments. However, we do not find evidence that message customization via microtargeting or cognitive elaboration through interaction with the AI have much more persuasive effect than a single generic message. These findings have implications for different theories of persuasion, which we discuss. Finally, we find that although persuasive messages are able to moderate some people’s attitudes, they have inconsistent and weaker effects on the democratic reciprocity people grant to their political opponents. This suggests that attitude moderation (ideological depolarization) does not necessarily lead to increased democratic tolerance or decreased affective polarization.",
