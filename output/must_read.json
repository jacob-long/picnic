    "abstract": "While the spread of toxicity on social media has received ample attention, studies offer conflicting expectations and mixed evidence about its contagious nature. This study advances understanding of how toxicity becomes contagious by distinguishing between exposure to toxicity by ingroup versus outgroup members and separating toxicity into impolite style and intolerant substance. We focus on Israel during 2023, a period marked by intense political polarization. Using Twitter panel data from original and replication datasets, we analyze ∼1M tweets from 12,481 users and ∼6M tweets from the 713,231 accounts they follow. We find that exposure to toxic behavior by ingroup members is the primary driver of contagious toxicity, compared to smaller, less consistent associations with outgroup toxicity. Moreover, seemingly less harmful forms of toxicity (impoliteness) by the ingroup are not only associated with increased users’ impoliteness but also with increased intolerance toward political groups—which may carry troubling implications for democracies."

    "abstract": "Abstract: Despite the proliferation of equality-focused actions on social media, such as the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, discrimination is still prevalent on these platforms. While confronting prejudice may reduce future discrimination (i.e., counter-speech), several factors limit confrontation within face-to-face interactions (i.e., social costs, perceived effectiveness, self-efficacy). Intervention is also more likely when others’ actions are driven by situational factors (i.e., external attribution) than stable features of personality (i.e., internal attributions). Yet, whether these antecedents of face-to-face confrontation parallel online confrontation is unclear. Participants ( N = 120) viewed a sexist or neutral social media profile manipulated to be consistent or inconsistent (i.e., facilitating internal and external attributions, respectively) and were asked to respond to the user’s recent post. Inconsistently sexist profiles were more likely to be confronted than consistently sexist profiles. However, participants exhibited more effort in responding (i.e., number of characters) to sexist than neutral prompts, regardless of the user’s consistency. Higher self-efficacy increased confrontation of sexist profiles, with larger effects emerging for inconsistent sexist behavior. Contrary to expectations, heightened social cost (i.e., perceived risks of confrontation) increased response effort for sexist profiles. These counterintuitive results indicate cognitive appraisals for online counter-speech might differ from face-to-face confrontation, potentially driven by partial anonymity, physical distance, and temporal delay of feedback observed in social media interactions. While results provide partial support for the role of attribution and individual differences for online confrontation, additional research is needed to understand antecedents of counter-speech on social media."

    "abstract": "Public sentiment toward government communicators plays a critical role during crises, influencing societal resilience and potentially contributing to broader trust in government. Such sentiment is shaped not only by what is said, but also by who says it. While existing literature on political crisis communication has largely focused on the content of governmental messages, it has overlooked the importance of the messenger. This study addresses that gap by shifting attention from what is communicated to who is communicating. This research explores how the personal characteristics of government communicators relate to public sentiment toward them during crises. To do so, this study matches data on communicators present at government-held press conferences with social media discourse, examining how these communicators are referenced online. Social media platforms serve as vital spaces where citizens communicate about their government’s crisis response and thus play an important role in building or undermining public responses. Given their role in shaping public perceptions of government performance, these digital platforms offer an ideal setting to observe sentiment toward communicators during crises. The study analyzes 744,000 posts on Twitter (now X) from six European countries during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic using advanced transformer-based classification models. Expressions of positive sentiment are identified through sentiment analysis, capturing affective reactions in user-generated content. The findings indicate that political actors are generally associated with less positive sentiment than experts, who tend to elicit more positive responses. Gender also emerges as a significant factor: During peak crisis periods, women communicators are more likely to be referenced positively on social media. This pattern aligns with prior research on a potential “trust advantage” for women in crisis communication, which has been linked to relational communication traits that are particularly valued in high-stress contexts."

    "abstract": "This mixed-methods study combines experience sampling and smartphone log data to explore momentary associations between passively sensed smartphone use, feeling rushed, and perceived task juggling in daily life. Using data from 774 adults, we analyze how four use features (frequency, duration, fragmentation, and notifications received) of four mobile app categories (email, social media, chat, and work communication) affect how rushed people feel, both directly and indirectly by increasing their perceived juggling load. At the between-person level, persons who use work communication apps more frequently and longer, and who receive more chat notifications, also felt more rushed on average. Findings also revealed within-person associations in the theorized direction (e.g., increased email frequency predicting increased task load and feelings of being rushed) for nearly all features of three out of four examined app categories, with social media use features as a noticeable exception. Perceived task juggling mediated these associations, suggesting that the examined smartphone use features contribute to feeling rushed by increasing the (real or perceived) load of tasks that people juggle within and across role domains. Some patterns differed based on age, gender, parenthood, and segmentation preference. Taken together, these findings support the theoretical link between technology use and experiences of time scarcity."

    "abstract": "Online advertising is an important component of political campaigning. With microtargeting techniques, voter groups who have shared concerns about specific issues can be identified and, subsequently, targeted with posts addressing those issues. This paper aims to provide an initial investigation into the dynamics and effects of targeted issue ads. We study whether these targeted persuasion efforts influence which issues matter to voters and, vice versa, if voters are more likely to receive ads about issues that they deem important. We take a comparative approach by collecting data in the run-up to the 2021 Dutch general election ( N = 103) and during the 2022 United States midterm election ( N = 31). To test the effects of ads that individual voters were exposed to during these times, we use a novel combination of methods, namely, mobile experience sampling, screenshot data donations, and content analysis. In both countries, we find that exposure to online ads increases the salience of issues among voters. We did not find evidence for successful targeting on issue preferences in the United States or the Netherlands. We discuss possible explanations and implications of these findings."

    "abstract": "Negative campaigning is an age-old strategy, yet its impact on trust in election outcomes remains underexplored, particularly in newer democracies. In this study, I argue that negative campaign messages erode electoral trust by fostering cynicism, undermining confidence in politicians, and heightening the perceived stakes of elections. By signalling that candidates will do whatever it takes to win, such messages raise concerns about fraud and diminish institutional trust. I further contend that these effects depend on the autonomy of electoral management bodies (EMBs). When EMB autonomy is low, greater exposure to negative campaigning significantly increases perceptions that elections are unfair. By contrast, where EMBs are highly autonomous, negative campaigning does not reduce trust in electoral integrity and may even bolster it, as institutional safeguards reassure voters. To test these claims, I draw on Afrobarometer survey data from eighteen countries across three rounds, expert assessments of negative campaign coverage from the Negative Campaigning Comparative Expert Survey, and measures of EMB autonomy from Varieties of Democracy. My findings show that the interaction between media negativity and EMB independence shapes public trust in elections, underscoring the central role of electoral institutions in mediating the democratic consequences of campaign strategies."

    "abstract": "Studies have found that voters in democratic countries are far more reluctant to use military force against democracies than against nondemocracies. This pattern may help explain why democracies almost never wage war against other democracies. In an important contribution, Rathbun, Parker, and Pomeroy (2025) propose that the apparent democratic peace in public opinion is an artifact of failing to account for race. Rather than democracy itself influencing support for war, they argue, the term “democracy” cues assumptions about the adversary’s racial composition, and those racialized assumptions are the true drivers of support for war. We reevaluate RPP’s evidence, concluding that their data do not support their predictions. In fact, their novel experiments provide powerful evidence that democracy affects support for war, independent of race. Our findings contribute to major debates about both regime type and race in international relations, as well as the design and interpretation of survey experiments."

Partnering with a state government agency in Bihar, India, we conducted a field experiment in 583 villages with 13,500 students, using a 4-month curriculum designed to build skills, shift norms, and enhance knowledge about health misinformation. Intent-to-treat estimates demonstrate that treated respondents were significantly better at discerning true from false information, altered their health preferences, relied more on science, and reduced their dependence on unreliable news sources. We resurveyed participants 4 months post-intervention and found that effects persisted, as well as extended to political misinformation. Finally, we observe within-household treatment diffusion, with parents of treated students becoming more adept at discerning information. As many countries seek long-term solutions to combat misinformation, these findings highlight the promise of sustained classroom-based education."

    "abstract": "This study explores whether ideological polarization increases political engagement and trust, both of which are central elements of civic culture. Polarization can clarify political positions and thereby simplify the formation of opinions, increase the stakes of elections, and offer more options to citizens. To estimate the impact of polarization from a causal perspective, we exploit variation within individuals over time using individual-level data from the Swiss Household Panel spanning from 1999 – 2023, amounting to 178,251 observations from 28,187 persons. Ideological polarization at the individual level is measured by a process of increasing extremity of the self-position on the left-right scale. In addition, we test how polarization of cohabiting household members has spillover effects on political engagement and trust. For political engagement, we adopt a comprehensive approach, focusing on interest in politics, participation in popular votes, party identification, and frequency of political discussions as dependent variables. Political trust is measured as confidence in the federal council. To analyze the data, we primarily use fixed effects models, complemented by a pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, and cross-lagged models to address reverse causality. Results show that ideological polarization does promote engagement but has a weak negative impact on political trust. This effect remains significant when controlling for affective polarization. Additionally, there is an overall increase in political engagement and a decrease in political trust if partners living in the same household become more extreme in their ideological preferences."

This paper has three aims. First, it establishes the importance of facilitation. Second, it argues that facilitation may not be enough to counteract the imbalances in power and influence within deliberation. As such, this paper introduces two games that can be utilized in concert with facilitation: deliberative worth exercises and simulated representation. The former pushes participants to remain aware of their behavior patterns within deliberation by asking them to choose the best deliberator at the end of each round of deliberation; the latter enables empathy and perspective-taking by partnering participants and asking them to represent one another’s viewpoints for a portion of deliberation as if they were their own. Third, using proof-of-concept experiments, this paper demonstrates the efficacy of these games."

    "abstract": "Partisan polarization in the United States has intensified, fueling hostility toward partisan out-groups and eroding political and social trust. This divide has often been compared to the fervent loyalty of sports fans, where competition and “team spirit” dominate behaviors. Despite this comparison, research has not systematically explored how views on fairness and competitiveness in partisan competition predict support for anti-democratic policies. This paper addresses this gap by developing a novel survey battery that uses sports as a conceptual proxy to measure these attitudes. We test this survey battery, and further refine it, on two U.S. samples. Using dimensional analysis we recover two latent dimensions: fairness and competitiveness. Using a novel measure, a gerrymandering map-choice, we find that these dimensions are highly predictive of anti-democratic behavior. This study illustrates how individuals’ partisanship and underlying psychology lead to undemocratic outcomes in the context of partisan competition."

    "abstract": "Are Americans more strongly attached to their political parties than ever before? Despite partisanship’s stronger associations across politics, inter-election panel surveys show that the durability of partisan attachments has slightly weakened. After bringing attention to this fact, I propose that this discrepancy exists because comparisons across time are mostly a product of greater consistency in mass partisan behavior, not the strengthening of mass partisan attachments. Model estimates confirm that thermometer- and vote-based indicators of partisanship have mostly become more consistent markers of partisanship instead of representing stronger modern-day partisan orientations. These estimates find that American partisan attachments have strengthened since the 1970s but remain similar to the 1950s and 1960s. American partisanship is clearly a more relevant and consistent conduit for mass political opinion and behavior in recent years, but American partisan attachments are not much stronger; they are just as movable now as they were in the past."

We report results from an experiment embedded in a two-wave panel survey with 1,081 Ukrainians (811 re-interviewed) at the start of Russia’s 2022 invasion. We find that respondents generally value competence and warmth over dominance in leaders. Yet, war increases preferences for dominance and reduces preferences for warmth and competence. Emotional reactions to war also relate to leader trait preferences: Ukrainians who react with aggressive emotions display enhanced preferences for all leader traits, whereas fearful reactions leave trait preferences mostly unaffected. These findings advance our understanding of how war shapes leader preferences."

    "abstract": "The Brazilian National Statistical Office (IBGE) uses its main household survey, PNADC, to produce annual estimates of the extreme poverty rate at the country level, as well as for each of its 27 Federative Units (26 states and the Federal District). Although poverty monitoring could benefit from more frequent and spatially disaggregated estimates, those obtained via direct estimation from the PNADC are considered too unreliable for informing public policy due to their large uncertainty. In this article, we illustrate the use of transformed Fay-Herriot models to combine PNADC data with covariate information obtained from an administrative register of beneficiaries of social programs in Brazil (CadUnico). Our results show that, while the CadUnico alone cannot be a substitute for official estimates of extreme poverty, it can be used as a covariate source to produce more frequent and disaggregated estimates of extreme poverty. More precisely, we use CadUnico data to produce quarterly model-based estimates for each of the Geographic Strata, an IBGE geography that partitions Brazil into 146 domains. Use of small area estimation leads to model-based estimates that are more precise, as quantified by the estimated MSEs, than their direct counterparts. Due to their increased frequency, the model-based estimates also provide a more detailed description of the evolution of extreme poverty rates. The article focuses on those elements that ensure an appropriate implementation of Fay-Herriot models, including the choice of transformations, use of administrative data, and variance smoothing. The article contributes by proposing improvements to the estimation strategy used by IBGE to derive spatially disaggregated and timely small area estimates."

It considers the entire distribution and measures the distance between the (economic) equi-distribution scenario and the average ratio of quantiles below the median to their symmetric counterparts above it. We present a finite population framework for estimating this index and its standard error under some complex sampling designs. Our estimator demonstrates high accuracy and precision, even with relatively small samples. Being solely based on quantiles, this index exhibits remarkable robustness, having limited sensitivity to anomalous values and highly skewed distributions. This is also shown by an analysis of its influence function."

While prior research has primarily examined changes in overall online participation, it has paid less attention to how activists adjust their strategies in response to repression. Addressing this gap, this article argues that repression incentivizes online activists to broaden their support base by promoting inter-group engagement and signaling inclusivity. Focusing on the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, the study analyzes Twitter interactions using network measures of assortativity and cross-group tie proportions. It applies permutation tests and ARIMA-based Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis to compare network patterns across key phases, delineated by the Brooklyn Bridge mass arrests on October 1 and the eviction threat of Zuccotti Park on October 13. The results show that repression triggers a significant decrease in assortativity, indicating increased inter-group engagement, while cross-group tie proportions remain stable, suggesting structural rather than isolated behavioral changes."

    "abstract": "Invalid responses pose a significant risk of distorting survey data, compromising statistical inferences, and introducing errors in conclusions drawn from surveys. Given the pivotal role of surveys in research, development, and decision-making, it is imperative to identify careless survey respondents. The existing literature on this subject comprises two primary categories of approaches: methods that rely on survey items and methods involving post hoc analyses. The latter, which does not demand preemptive preparation, predominantly incorporates statistical techniques or metadata analysis aimed at identifying distinct response patterns that are associated with careless responses. However, several inherent limitations limit the precise identification of careless respondents. One notable challenge is the lack of consensus concerning the thresholds to use for the various measures. Furthermore, each method is designed to detect a specific response pattern associated with carelessness, leading to conflicting outcomes. In this article, we seek to assess the efficacy of the existing methods using a novel survey methodology encompassing responses to both meaningful and meaningless gibberish scales in which the latter compels respondents to answer without considering item content. Using this approach, we propose the application of machine learning to identify careless survey respondents. Our findings underscore the efficacy of a methodology using supervised machine learning combined with unique gibberish data as a potent method for the identification of careless respondents, aligning with and outperforming other approaches in terms of effectiveness and versatility."

To address this shortcoming, the current tutorial paper showcases how to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients using the new BFpack module in the free and open-source software program JASP. The module supports Bayesian tests of various types of correlations such as product–moment correlations, polyserial correlations, or tetrachoric correlations, among others. Partial correlations can be tested by controlling for certain covariates. Moreover, both dependent and independent correlations can be tested to be zero or tested against each other. This tutorial aims to get researchers acquainted with this new flexible testing paradigm, which avoids the limitations of classical methods, and to make the methodology widely available to the research community."

    "abstract": "Our paper provides a conceptualization of magnitude-based hypotheses (MBHs). We define an MBH as a specific type of hypothesis that tests for relative differences in the independent impact (i.e., effect size difference) of at least two explanatory variables on a given outcome. We reviewed 1,715 articles across eight leading management journals and found that nearly 10% (165) of articles feature an MBH, employing 41 distinct methodological approaches to test them. However, approximately 40% of these papers show missteps in the post-estimation process required to evaluate MBHs. To address this issue, we offer a conceptual framework, an empirical illustration using Bayesian analysis and frequentist statistics, and a decision-tree guideline that outlines key steps for evaluating MBHs. Overall, we contribute a framework for applying MBHs, demonstrating how they can shift theoretical inquiry from binary questions of whether an effect exists, to more comparative questions about how much a construct matters,compared to what, and under which conditions."

    "abstract": "Existing research demonstrates that liberals are more likely than conservatives to endorse climate policies. Scholars attribute this to differences in worldviews, elite cues, and misinformation. But political divisions are also emotional, as evidenced by partisans’ increasingly disliking one another. Recent work extends this pattern beyond political identity to the domain of issue-based polarization. The authors apply these insights to the sociology of climate change, advancing the concept of affective climate polarization to situate climate attitudes as expressions of social identity and group affiliation. Drawing on original survey data from a nationally representative probability sample ( n = 2,503), the authors examine how supporters and opponents of decarbonization evaluate each other on dimensions of emotional warmth. Supporters and opponents both express in-group favoritism and outgroup dislike, patterns indicative of polarization. Supporters’ animosity appears driven by frustration at opponents’ resistance to endorsing policy to mitigate climate change. Opponents’ animosity seems to be driven by frustration at being morally judged for their climate attitudes. The authors argue that climate attitudes are increasingly tied to identity-based boundary-making, whereby individuals perceive those with opposing climate views as members of morally distinct (and suspect) groups. This contributes to theorizing climate politics as a site of social conflict, boundary-making, and emotionally grounded group differentiation."

    "abstract": "Are widespread stereotypes accurate1,2,3 or socially distorted4,5,6? This continuing debate is limited by the lack of large-scale multimodal data on stereotypical associations and the inability to compare these to ground truth indicators. Here we overcame these challenges in the analysis of age-related gender bias7,8,9, for which age provides an objective anchor for evaluating stereotype accuracy. Despite there being no systematic age differences between women and men in the workforce according to the US Census, we found that women are represented as younger than men across occupations and social roles in nearly 1.4 million images and videos from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr and YouTube, as well as in nine language models trained on billions of words from the internet. This age gap is the starkest for content depicting occupations with higher status and earnings. We demonstrate how mainstream algorithms amplify this bias. A nationally representative pre-registered experiment (n = 459) found that Googling images of occupations amplifies age-related gender bias in participants’ beliefs and hiring preferences. Furthermore, when generating and evaluating resumes, ChatGPT assumes that women are younger and less experienced, rating older male applicants as of higher quality. Our study shows how gender and age are jointly distorted throughout the internet and its mediating algorithms, thereby revealing critical challenges and opportunities in the fight against inequality."

    "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings is based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalysed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across the studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 < inclusion Bayes factor (BF10) < 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF10 > 3 or BF10 < 1/3) and fewer than 20% were strongly supported (BF10 > 10 or BF10 < 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more-robust results. Our study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for the results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that the results are flawed but, rather, suggesting caution in interpreting individual edges."

    "abstract": "Smartphones are essential tools in daily life yet concerns persist about their potential effects on mental health and well-being. Research on these relationships often relies on subjective measures of smartphone use, which can lack validity. These studies are also often limited by small, homogenous samples and the inability to differentiate between types of smartphone activities (e.g., social media vs. other applications). In this study, we analyzed 250,000 d of smartphone usage data from 10,099 adults, using objective measures of smartphone usage collected over 4 wk. We examined normative usage patterns and the temporal relationships between smartphone use and mood. Our findings reveal weak or null associations between smartphone use and mood, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and at both individual and group levels. Demographic factors, such as age and gender, were stronger predictors of mood than smartphone use. Statistically significant results that were observed showed that younger adults demonstrated a stronger association between social media use and lower mood cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Non-social app use was linked to lower mood in between-subjects analyses, but better mood in within-subjects analyses. However, all effects were small (or null), indicating minimal practical significance. These findings suggest that smartphone use has a limited or negligible impact on mood and well-being over a 4-wk period and do not support claims of a strong or causal relationship between smartphone use and mental well-being across this timeframe."
