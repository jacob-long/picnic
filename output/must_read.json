    "abstract": "The article explores the social role and implications of large language models (LLMs) through the lens of media theory. Rather than considering LLMs as advanced forms of artificial intelligence, I argue that a communication-focused perspective provides a more effective way to interpret their impact on information management in contemporary society and to address the associated ethical and operational challenges. Supported by information management tools such as archives, catalogs, and later search engines, previous communication media expanded the scope of communication, making it possible to reach more, distant, diverse, and possibly anonymous communication partners. LLMs now signify a new phase in the evolution of communication, as they function themselves as communication partners capable of responding autonomously to user queries in a personalized manner. This perspective highlights and explains the capabilities and limitations of various LLM-based chatbots and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, while also addressing issues such as misalignment and hallucinations."

We argue, in contrast, for an account that views polarization in media and the public as a co-adaptive process. This paper begins with a brief review of cultural evolution and co-adaptation and then considers the application of similar ideas to changes in media and the public over time. Using formal models, we suggest that—in combination with the human tendency toward in-group bias—a co-adaptive (rather than unidirectional) relationship can best account for real-world dynamics. We consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of media effects and technological innovation in polarization, representative democracy, and mass-mediated communication more broadly."

To overcome the limitations of the quantitative approach of adolescents’ social media use when investigating relationships with psychological outcomes, motivational factors have become increasingly popular. The first aim was to review the psychometric properties of existent tools used to measure adolescents’ social media use motives. The second objective was to elaborate a classification of the main motives among adolescents. Following PRISMA guidelines, 14 articles were reviewed based on the search of 5 databases. Psychometric properties were examined based on the COSMIN guidelines. The reviewed articles showed a heterogeneous process, with only two of them considered as a satisfying procedure of development and validation. Based on the Use and Gratification Theory, a classification of the five main motives for adolescents’ social media use was developed. Overall, this study encourages the pursuit of studies on social media use among adolescence, while carefully choosing a tool with satisfying psychometric properties."

Participants encountered celebrity (deep)fake news in text and video formats on social media. The results showed that the difficulty induced by news authentication lowered self-confidence in truth discernment, which, in turn, decreased the perceived credibility and engagement intentions toward subsequent unrelated fake news of the same modality."

Experimentation is widespread (88%), yet workflow integration remains uneven. Adoption is strongest among younger professionals, and sectoral differences are detected: marketing reports higher adoption, whereas journalists and educators report the lowest usage. ChatGPT dominates (77%), followed by Canva (38%), and DALL·E and MidJourney (27%). Frequency of use lag behind positive attitudes. National patterns also diverge, reflecting cultural, regulatory, and market factors. Results draw on SCOT, Rogers’ diffusion, and Bozdag’s AImosis to frame sociotechnical adoption of AI as a negotiation.

    "abstract": "This article investigates the digital afterlives of lynching, how its memory is invoked, refracted, and contested on Twitter. Drawing on a hybrid methodological approach that combines computational analysis of tweet corpora with interpretive readings, the research examines how histories of racial violence circulate within the algorithmically mediated space. While lynching remains a central symbol of anti-Black terror in the United States, its meaning in public discourse has become increasingly unstable. On Twitter, lynching is deployed as a historical referent, a metaphor, political claim, and rhetorical provocation, thereby surfacing in divergent frames. We theorize this instability as frictional memory: a dynamic of circulation under constraint, operating through temporal traction (mnemonic pivots that attach past to present), semantic abrasion (collisions that produce drift, contestation, and repair), and visibility routing (platform-mediated asymmetries of attention). This framework shows how histories of racial violence are not simply recalled online but continually reconfigured in digital architectures."

For which ideological groupings do specific moral foundations matter and in the context of which issues? We analysed 210,170 tweets about the Australian television programme Q&amp;A – a panel show with synchronous live and online audiences. We examined the topics, prevalence of different moralities and how these moralities explain talk of collective action for different ideological groups. Across all issues and ideological groups, talk of action was most often associated with talk of authority but ideological differences between left- and right-leaning participants emerged. Among left-leaning people, action was motivated by a range of moral foundations, but among right-leaning people action was primarily motivated by authority. Our findings map the ideological diversity found within modern town halls and confirm the critical role of these settings in contemporary socio-political life."

    "abstract": "This study reframes late-night smartphone use among Chinese young adults beyond pathologizing it as self-regulation failure. Integrating self-determination theory with social acceleration theory, we conceptualize this behavior as a strategic temporal negotiation to reclaim personal time. Structural equation modeling (n = 503) reveals that perceived leisure freedom and leisure satisfaction primarily drive behavioral intention, while perceived short-term risk deters it. Perceived long-term risk and guilt show no significant impact on intention. Perceived time constraint intensifies actual behavior, while social control paradoxically reinforces rather than limits it. Although self-control significantly reduces behavioral enactment, it cannot eliminate underlying motivational drivers. These findings reveal a tripartite negotiation: leisure benefits versus health risks, pleasure versus guilt, and personal autonomy versus social order. We theorize this as “strategic connected deceleration”—an adaptive response whereby individuals use technology to secure autonomous time amid systemic acceleration. Interventions should address structural time pressure rather than exclusively targeting individual discipline."

    "abstract": "The ‘conflict thesis’ between scientific and supernatural beliefs has attracted considerable intellectual interest. However, empirical studies examining its impact on health behaviours are scarce. To address this gap, drawing on the Health Locus of Control (HLOC) theory, we developed an integrated dual-pathway cognitive model to explore how these conflicting attitudes compete and how they influence health behaviours differently. In an online survey conducted with 673 middle-aged and older Chinese adults, we found that supernatural beliefs did not directly conflict with scientific attitudes. Instead, they competed in predicting cancer-prevention behaviours through their associated sub-beliefs – specifically, cancer fatalism and cancer controllability. Our findings do not support a root-level ‘conflict thesis’ but instead support a downstream-level ‘conflict thesis’. This finding adds to the literature on the ‘conflict thesis’ and enhances our understanding of how conflict manifests in the cancer-prevention setting. The cultural specificity and generalizability of this study are discussed."

Because outlets depend on direct consumers for revenue, they respond primarily to this core audience’s preferences. Several contemporary styles of news coverage—which emphasize partisan conflict, employ specialized jargon, engage in predictive analysis, and use clickbait language—are attractive to core consumers, but may also make news less accessible for others. In a pre-registered survey experiment ( n = 2,233), I show that, relative to a public interest style that prioritizes key information about policy and democratic norms, typical news styles weaken post-exposure recall of key news information—that is, they are under-informative. Recall penalties are especially severe for those with lower baseline political engagement, yet still affect highly engaged consumers as well. This study shows that contemporary approaches to news coverage broadly under-serve the public by inhibiting political learning."

Building on prior studies by Barber and Pope (2019, 2024) regarding Donald Trump's impact on people's policy preferences during his 2017–2021 presidency, we examine whether this influence persists soon after Trump's first presidential tenure concludes in late 2021 through a survey experiment. We also assess the influence of a second external cue that has gained attention due to the growing role of social media in political processes: a close friend, who might also serve as a relevant figure for policy position formation. We find that Trump's liberal cues shift Republican preferences in a liberal direction, while close friend cues show diverse patterns, including some backlash effects where individuals adopt positions opposite to conservative friend advocacy. These effects vary with individuals' party identification, political knowledge, and social conformity levels. Individual characteristics moderate political elite influence, while peer influence operates through reactance mechanisms rather than conformity, revealing that social networks shape opinions through more complex pathways than commonly theorized."

    "abstract": "Americans’ trust in scientists has been stable and high, relative to other political and social institutions, for the last half century (Krause, Brossard, and Scheufele 2019). Yet, underlying this stability lies a dramatic change such that a partisan gap has emerged, with Democrats exhibiting substantially more trust than Republicans. Fifty years ago, Republicans in fact exhibited more relative trust in scientists. This article explains this continuity and change. First, we demonstrate that the demographic correlates of trust in scientists have been remarkably stable for more than a half century: women, Black, rural, religious, non-college educated, and lower/working-class individuals exhibit less trust than their counterparts. Second, we show that the partisan relationship with trust in scientists has flipped (over that same time period) as low-trusting demographic strata shifted partisan allegiances. This is particularly the case when it comes to education and religiosity. Concomitant with the emergent partisan gap is a massive perceptual gap among Democrats, who perceive a partisan divide more than double its actual size. Democrats vastly underestimate Republicans’ trust in scientists. The enduring demographic basis of trust in scientists provides an opportunity to bridge partisan divides by addressing demographic inequities in the practice and application of science."

Its effectiveness was tested in three preregistered experiments. In a laboratory study ( N = 243), active use of the generator helped participants counter media strategies, with effects persisting for 11 days. A novel online active inoculation tool also reduced uncritical acceptance of herbal product reporting, intentions to use herbs for health, and trust in complementary and alternative medicine industries/media in both a student ( N = 439) and a community sample ( N = 452). The intervention was especially effective among experiential thinkers and those believing in extrasensory perception. Scalable and resource-efficient, this tool inoculates consumers against misleading media tactics and is adaptable for use across educational, media, and healthcare contexts."

    "abstract": "Extant work has identified two discursive forms of racism: overt and covert. While both forms have received attention in scholarly work, research on covert racism has been limited. Its subtle and context-specific nature has made it difficult to systematically identify covert racism in text, especially in large corpora. In this article, we first propose a theoretically driven and generalizable process to identify and classify covert and overt racism in text. This process allows researchers to construct coding schemes and build labeled datasets. We use the resulting dataset to train XLM-RoBERTa, a cross-lingual large language model (LLM) for supervised classification with a cutting-edge contextual understanding of text. We show that XLM-R and XLM-R-Racismo, our pretrained model, outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in classifying racism in large corpora. We illustrate our approach using a corpus of tweets relating to the Ecuadorian indígena community between 2018 and 2021."
