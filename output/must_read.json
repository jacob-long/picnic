    "authors": "Wenqing Zhao, Yan Jin, Toni van der Meer, Michael Hameleers, Xuerong Lu",
    "abstract": "Numerous global trends related to communicative conflicts—like widespread public dissent, the increasing fragmentation of the digital media landscape, the fast-paced dissemination of mis- and disinformation, polarization of public debates, and delegitimizing populist rhetoric—form a perfect storm that significantly disrupts today’s society on multiple levels. Against this backdrop, research on content, causes, consequences, and counter-strategies of conflicts has been central to the discipline of communication science and beyond over the past decades. Although many of these societal challenges are rooted in communication problems similar in nature, current research lines appear to move forward in isolation, creating largely disconnected streams of research that could benefit from more integration. With this article, we aim to bring together disconnected strands of literature in communication that revolve around conflicts in mass and digital communication under the umbrella term “informational conflict.” This framework synthesizes existing knowledge, enabling us to better understand the root causes of increasing cleavages in society and to forward potential solutions leading to conflict resolution.",

    "authors": "Camille J Saucier, Nathan Walter, Stefanie Z Demetriades",
    "abstract": "Following Kunda’s (1990) defense of the influence of motivations on reasoning, a growing body of communication research has coalesced around the idea that specific motivations can influence decision-making. At the same time, this body of research has been subjected to criticisms highlighting alternative explanations that do not involve motivated processes. The present study contributes to this conversation by reviewing the evidence around motivated reasoning as reflected in empirical communication research over the past 30 years (k = 143), focusing on the framework’s key components: motivation, reasoning, and responses. The findings identify considerable gaps, including a limited focus on distinct motivations, an underemphasis on reasoning, and a concentration on a narrow set of responses. This article concludes by proposing the Motivation-Reasoning-Response Model, which visually summarizes the findings of this review and indicates possible opportunities for future research.",

    "authors": "Parker Bach, Carolyn E Schmitt, Shannon C McGregor",
    "abstract": "While clarity is often upheld as a core element of successful communication, we argue that a lack of clarity can also benefit a speaker, a concept called strategic ambiguity. This concept has been used across disciplines for decades, but its definitions are often overly context-specific. In this article, we follow Chaffee’s (1991) framework for explication to survey the literature and provide a unified definition of strategic ambiguity as a rhetorical tactic in which a communicator creates a: (1) polysemic message with multiple reasonable interpretations supported by the text, that is: (2) aimed at audiences from varying interpretive communities; and (3) by which polysemy the communicator stands to gain some specific advantage. We offer methodological suggestions on the study of strategic ambiguity, accompanied by two case studies of strategic ambiguity, centering Congressional newsletters and conservative political satire. We close with suggestions for scholarships that could be informed by incorporating strategic ambiguity.",

This paper explores the design of such a tailored methodology for investigating the value-driven development of online public service media platforms in Germany. While qualitative methodologies are time- and resource-consuming and digital methods leave out less context to the field, this mixed methodology emphasizes the context and invests in collecting thick data. It encompasses multiple stages of recording and mapping that employ qualitative and quantitative approaches to bring together various vignettes, unveiling complementary context and contradictory accounts with the help of visualization. In each mapping and visualization stage, the paper investigates actors and relationships heuristically and emphasizes the work-in-progress nature of mapping regarding platforms.",

    "abstract": "Media effects research has observed significant diversity in the effects of social media on adolescent well-being, with outcomes ranging from positive to negative and, in some cases, neutral effects. In an effort to comprehend and elucidate this diversity, we have formulated The Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues, a theoretical framework that systematically categorizes potential sources contributing to these variations. This dynamic model encompasses the complex layers of social cues present within platforms, the social environment, and individual (neuro)susceptibility, collectively shaping how social media influences the well-being of adolescents. The primary goal of this model is to enhance research by concurrently considering a broader range of individual difference factors, providing a comprehensive framework for investigations into the complex interplay of social context in social media effects.",

Results showed participants preferred accommodative stances over non-accommodative stances (under or over accommodation), and that accommodative interpretability was the most frequently mentioned communication strategy in all four countries. Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences across countries for all strategies, with the strongest effects for discourse management. Implications for adding CAT into medical education communication training are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: This study introduces a novel VR-based approach to measure pupillary responses during media consumption. Researchers exposed participants to 30 video messages in a virtual TV viewing room, capturing pupil dilation and constriction via VR-integrated eye-tracking. By analyzing cross-receiver similarity (inter-subject correlations) of pupillometric responses, we could identify which specific video an individual was watching. This method worked best under normal viewing conditions and was sensitive to attentional manipulations. This study also found that messages with the most robust pupil response signatures were more likely to be remembered. Theoretical implications for quantifying media exposure and developing signatures of perceptual attention in individuals and audiences are discussed. Practically, this pupillary audience response measurement could be applied to various media formats, including screen-based media, social media, and VR/AR environments. In sum, the study highlights the potential of pupillometry in understanding audience engagement and response dynamics in naturalistic media consumption settings.",

Large-scale data and qualitative textual analysis revealed that tweet dissemination is influenced by perceived risks and benefits, while the tweet format (narrative vs. non-narrative) had no significant effect. Personal stories gained more shares than cultural stories, and high-benefit narratives received more retweets than low-risk ones. Tweets with highly perceived benefits elicited positive sentiments, highlighting implications for effective health communication on social media.

Our findings show that while all media types prioritize professionalism, their strategies for cultivating intimacy differ significantly. Compared to commercial and provincial media, central media achieved the best balance between intimacy and professionalism. Individual media demonstrated the highest intimacy scores, whereas central media excelled in professionalism. This study enhances our understanding of how institutional backgrounds shape strategies in audio journalism. It offers insights into balancing intimacy with professional standards in the podcast medium.",

    "abstract": "Rankings are a well-established genre for evaluating diverse phenomena, yet culturally resonant critiques of them are relatively rare. This paper examines how student vloggers on YouTube challenge and reinterpret university rankings through ‘tier list’ and ‘reaction’ videos, thereby shifting genre expectations. Through a move analysis of 30 such videos, we identify 3 rhetorical actions – making sense of ranking, audience interpellation and subverting the ranking genre – and discuss how the ranking’s remediation simultaneously rejects and reinforces hierarchy as the social form underlying it. This results in often humorous critiques where vloggers challenge ‘objective’ cardinal assumptions and posit rank as collaboratively constructed. Remediation in social media has the potential to not only make visible genre work performed by the genre’s discursive community, but in doing so also reconfigures the rhetorical premises that characterise the ranking genre in the first place.",

This study uses a quasi-experimental two-wave design to examine the relationship between BeReal use duration and well-being indicators. Results suggest that long-term BeReal use is linked to higher friendship satisfaction, positively influencing life satisfaction. In addition, long-term use is associated with reduced fear of missing out and connection overload compared to short-term use, suggesting BeReal may enhance well-being possibly by facilitating daily interactions with close ties, limiting usage time, and providing a more authentic representation of everyday life compared to other social media platforms.",

    "abstract": "Emotionality is a well-established strategy for boosting audience engagement on social media. While fact-checking is positioned to provide objective information, fact-checking posts on social media often involve heightened emotionality. How much emotionality is present and how emotionality influences audience engagement and public sentiment toward fact-checked targets remain largely understudied. Informed by social psychological frameworks explicating message-level factors influencing public engagement and sentiment, the present study examines emotionality in 49,270 fact-checking posts created by 10 United States fact-checking organizations on Facebook from 2017 to 2022. Results showed that emotionality in fact-checking posts significantly increased by 13.5% over the years. Editorial fact-checkers (e.g., Washington Post) used higher levels of emotionality than independent fact-checkers (e.g., snopes.com). Emotionality positively indicated public engagement as predicted. However, in both fact-checked true and false information, emotionality was negatively associated with the public’s sentiment toward fact-checked targets, suggesting a potential spillover effect on stories verified to be true. This study reveals that emotionality in fact-checking posts boosts social media engagement yet with the potential of compromising fact-checking effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "In the task of assessing how sudden, significant events causally affect public opinion, political pollsters often ask respondents how the event affected their attitudes and beliefs. We study the case of former President Donald Trump’s federal indictment for allegedly mishandling classified documents using two methods of retrospective causal inference. The commonly used change format asks respondents to state directly how the event affected their attitudes: Republicans say the event increased their support of Trump, while Democrats say the opposite. Like previous work, we argue that the change format exhibits a form of bias known as response substitution. The alternative counterfactual format is plausibly free of this source of error and asks respondents to imagine what their attitudes and beliefs would have been if the event had not happened. Using this method, Republican primary voters report that the indictment increased their belief that Trump mishandled documents (+2.5 pp) and decreased their intention to vote for him in the primaries (−1.6 pp). We argue that the counterfactual format is particularly valuable for studying the effects of highly salient news events like the Trump indictment on public opinion.",

Instead, we hypothesize that anger erodes democracy-relevant political attitudes only when a threat affects citizens’ norms and only when blame for said threat is attributed to the domestic political system. We corroborate our hypotheses using data from a unique survey experiment conducted in Germany in 2022, in which we vary the level of responsibility attribution and threat noxiousness by exposing respondents to different threats that were salient during the field phase. The results indicate that citizens differentiate whom they hold accountable, such that it is not necessarily the quality of the threat but the quality of the political response to the threat that determines the future of democracy.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable interest in studying the impact of major life events (e.g., marriage, job loss) on people’s lives. This line of research is inherently causal: Its goal is to study whether life events cause changes in the examined outcomes. However, because major life events cannot be randomly assigned, studies in this area necessarily rely on longitudinal observational data. In this article, we provide guidelines for researchers interested in studying life events in an explicitly causal framework. Although focused on life-event studies for substantive context, many recommendations also apply to longitudinal observational studies more broadly. We begin by emphasizing the importance of clearly specifying the causal estimand and describe conditions in which the defined causal estimand can be identified. Then, we discuss the features and challenges of the two main analytical approaches to causal inference in life-event studies: difference-in-difference designs with a (matched) comparison group that attempt to separate event-related changes from normative changes and within-person designs that control for all time-invariant person-level confounders. We describe how the desired causal effect can be estimated in these designs and provide recommendations for when to apply each modeling strategy. In addition, we present methods for conducting sensitivity analysis, probing the robustness of the estimated causal effects, and evaluating the generalizability of the results. We conclude by describing how new specialized panel studies can be designed to examine the impact of various life events in more controlled settings.",

This study measured participants' perceived metacognitive monitoring abilities using a novel psychometrically validated questionnaire (Study 1) and then examined how well survey responses aligned with online measures of metacognitive monitoring (resolution, discrimination, sensitivity, efficiency) taken from confidence ratings participants made while performing a perceptual decision-making task and Raven’s Progressive Matrices (Study 2). We found a negative correlation between the questionnaire responses and many of the online measures of metacognitive monitoring – those who reported being better at metacognitive monitoring, in fact tended to be worse according to the online metacognitive ratings. This occurred because, in general, high self-perceptions of monitoring ability were, in fact, related to higher confidence and lower cognitive performance. These findings suggest that we may have inaccurate insights into our own metacognitive monitoring capacity and questionnaire-based measures of metacognitive abilities may be problematic as they may represent unrealistic self-perceptions.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: As LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two measures: LLM Word Association Test, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Relative Decision Test, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in contextual decisions. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Word Association Test adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Relative Decision Test operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). These prompt-based measures draw from psychology’s long history of research into measuring stereotypes based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.",
