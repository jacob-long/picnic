    "abstract": "Taking breaks from digital connectivity has become a common practice but we still have limited knowledge of which approaches are used and who uses them. This article explores how technological measures are used to take temporary breaks from smartphones and digital media. Technological measures include silent and airplane mode, turning off notifications, deleting and setting time limits on apps, downloading disconnection apps, and using a simpler phone. Based on two representative surveys from Norway (2018, N = 1046; 2023, N = 1142), the study shows a preference for simple measures – silencing, removing, and deleting – over complex tools like disconnection apps. Regarding socio-demographic differences, the article shows that younger, highly educated, and left-leaning people ‘use tech to beat tech’ to a higher degree. Furthermore, the study explores how the use of technological measures corresponds with how respondents assess their smartphone (over)use. The article adds to the body of nationally representative surveys in digital disconnection research and contributes to understanding how technological measures for disconnection have evolved and their popularity and use."

A content analysis of N = 1514 articles on nine TAs in Western Europe since 2016 examines which characteristics of the attacks (rightwing TAs vs. Islamist TAs; death toll; and number of injured victims), the media environment, and the article (tabloid vs. broadsheet; country of reporting; article type; time frame; and article length) predicted the mitigation strategies presented in the articles. Results revealed that media coverage of TAs disproportionately emphasizes SSR and migration-control strategies, while largely neglecting deradicalization measures. This focus may contribute to shaping negative out-group perceptions, highlighting the need for increased awareness among journalists regarding the implications of their reporting."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for understanding people’s relational introspections with machines. Through a social information processing lens, we argue that such introspections begin with relative perceptions of two basic traits: communion (prosocial intentionality) and agency (goal-pursuit capacities) for both machine and user. These relative perceptions are then interpreted through relational schemas in the short term and regulated by trust in the long term––jointly shaping relational behaviors toward the machine (e.g., intention to use). We surveyed three US samples of various AI-technology users (college students, N = 438; MTurk participants, N = 1,023; Prolific participants, N = 726, matched to census demographics). Results consistently showed that (a) intention to use such a machine was driven by self-agency followed by machine-communion, whereas machine-agency and self-communion had no direct impact, and (b) the relative importance of these trait perceptions was mediated by certain relational schemas and moderated by trust across respondents."

    "abstract": "Media messages shape our knowledge about the world, but measuring individual exposure and attention remains challenging. Emerging media offer a solution to studying message reception in simulated real-world environments, which may soon become the actual media environments in which we encounter messages. Here, we utilized virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking to investigate message processing in a realistic virtual city environment populated with billboards. We introduced an inception-style manipulation where billboards initially overlooked by participants were covertly reintroduced based on real-time gaze tracking. Our findings show this algorithmic manipulation, undetected by participants, significantly boosted message memory retention for the targeted messages. This study reveals a path of media influence, demonstrating how undetected algorithmic manipulations can shape individual and collective memory. The findings carry practical and theoretical implications for diverse communication contexts, from advertising and public health to political messaging in the emerging metaverse ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Abstract: Social media are increasingly becoming platforms for moral discussions. Users communicating on a moral level can encourage us to engage with information regarding a moral debate by activating processes that shape our moral judgments. To investigate these processes, this paper studies the effect of attitude congruence and morally-framed arguments on the selection, reading time, and liking of social media content related to moral debates and whether the level of perceived moral relevance of the topic influences the effects’ strength. Further the role of identification with other users when choosing what content to interact with is examined. In a 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design experiment, participants were given an information selection task in which they were shown different posts within a mockup Facebook feed. Here, comment valence (positive vs. negative), type of argumentation within the comment (moral argument vs. no moral argument) and the opinion climate within one’s ingroup (ingroup supports attitude-consistent vs. attitude-inconsistent views) were manipulated. Results supported the confirmation bias regarding the selection and liking of content in social media. The hypothesized effects of moral arguments, relevance and group identification did not influence information selection or reading duration. Exploratory analyses revealed that content accompanied by comments with moral arguments has a higher likelihood of being liked, especially when the issue is seen as morally significant."

A three-wave panel study collected data among 520 French adolescents ( M age = 15.14, SD age = 1.90, 58.7% girls) in 2021–22 and was linked to content analytical data on the political posts of adolescents’ favorite accounts. The random intercept cross-lagged panel model revealed no significant between-person differences or within-person reciprocal effects between exposure to influencers’ and celebrities’ political content and adolescents’ political interest. Furthermore, neither peer nor parental political interest moderated these relationships. Explanations for the absence of media and selection effects are discussed."

    "abstract": "Social media platforms have removed influential users for violating platform rules. While this intervention reduces harmful content on the platform, deplatforming high-profile figures may prompt general users to migrate to alternative domains, where they can continue to engage with inappropriate communication. Utilizing web tracking data from 12,400 US Twitter users, we showed that after Twitter deplatformed Donald Trump, users had no immediate change in Twitter usage, but their engagement with the platform decreased slightly over time. Meanwhile, they demonstrated an increase in visiting alternative domains, although this spike gradually tapered off. This pattern varied across the population: Those frequently consuming left-leaning news immediately increased Twitter usage, whereas users visiting right-leaning outlets displayed a rise in using alternative social media, especially among heavy consumers of right-leaning news. These findings highlight the importance of investigating two separate processes of platform migration, non-use and new use, for appraising the impact of content moderation."

    "abstract": "Gender inequality in Dutch politics remains persistent, with men dominating parliament. This study explores whether social media campaigning can help reduce this imbalance by examining how women and men differ in their online campaign strategies and how these differences affect likability on social media and electoral success. Drawing on the concept of trait-balancing, the study analyzes communication styles, issues, and sentiments in tweets from all parliamentary candidates using topic modeling. Results show that while men and women use similar communication styles, women benefit more from social and positive messaging, as well as participation in Q&amp;A interactions—factors that predict higher preference votes. However, these advantages do not offset systemic barriers. The findings suggest that structural factors, such as male-dominated candidate lists and informal party-selection rules, continue to sustain unequal gender representation. Thus, while social media offers opportunities, institutional reform remains essential for achieving gender equality in politics."

We argue that existing methodologies for the analysis of visual content based on the notions of the metapicture are not yet fully equipped to account for the multi-layered, dynamic, and information-rich nature of audio-visual material. To fill this gap, we propose an approach aimed at ‘enriching’ the metapicture with textual and other components, alongside visual ones, to critically and systematically analyse video collections. First, we explain how researchers can enrich the metapicture by following three main principles: metadating, disaggregation and reaggregation, and readability. To illustrate our approach, we present a case study based on data donations to explore the content and gender representations TikTok users are exposed to. The study is structured in three steps, each introducing a type of enriched metapicture: the megapicture, scene-by-scene timeline, and video stack."

    "abstract": "Confronting severe economic challenges in the twenty-first century, many news media are forging new relationships with advertisers, including the focus of this study: native advertising. At the same time, as the climate crisis worsens, and political pressures and news coverage increase, we are seeing the fossil fuel industry expand and shift its communication about the topic. This study sits at the intersection of these trends: we ask to what extent, and how, native advertisements are being employed in fossil fuel communication campaigns. We analyze 252 native ads sponsored by fossil fuel companies between 2014 and 2022 in leading English-language news outlets. Led by human quantitative content analysis, with supplementary automated text analysis, we show that the style of climate science denial documented by, for example, Oreskes and Conway, is absent from native ad communications; in its place are frequent mentions of the environment, the reality of climate change, and the need to decarbonize. In fact, the primary position of fossil fuel companies in our data is the assertion that they are leading the decarbonization of energy systems. To do so, they strongly emphasize the relative virtues of natural gas and promote investments in unproven new technologies. A secondary tactic emphasizes the importance of energy to development and quality of life. Our discussion explores the challenges of analyzing claims that are often superficially true but misleading in context and the questions misleading native advertising raises for news media in a challenging digital media landscape."

Using MyFactChecker, an AI-powered sentiment and verification tool, we reveal that disinformation most frequently relied on fear-based appeals (41%), identity-driven rhetoric (32%), and content mimicking credible journalism (27%). The findings show that disinformation gained traction not through factual accuracy but through emotional resonance and relational trust within ideologically cohesive groups. Even when flagged as false, corrective content was often dismissed as propaganda or foreign interference, thus underscoring how truth contests unfold within closed, affective networks."

    "abstract": "Freedom of speech is an essential pillar of democracy. Despite constitutional protections, citizens in some liberal democracies increasingly feel the “bulwark of liberty” under pressure. While the underlying causes of these developments remain largely ambiguous, a fundamental question persists: What exactly do citizens have in mind when assessing the concept of “freedom of speech” – and who do they believe is restricting it? Clarifying this is essential for interpreting survey data, understanding underlying causes, and developing effective strategies to counter this trend. A quota-representative national survey of German citizens ( N = 1,490) reveals (1) that most respondents perceive free speech in both legal and social terms. Additionally, (2) a notable portion perceives freedom of speech as too restricted, driven by both dimensions, slightly emphasizing the legal aspect. Finally, (3) perceptions of the general status quo and both dimensions are – at least partly – shaped by different actors, underscoring the need to distinguish the social and the legal dimensions of freedom of speech."

We answer this question using evidence from two studies—a survey experiment and media content analysis—conducted in the Netherlands, a leading country in the green transition. Our experimental findings reveal an asymmetric bias in public support for protests. For the same protest action, public support is higher for environment-critical movements compared to pro-environment ones. This bias is most pronounced among right-leaning individuals with low education and low trust in science and politics. Our content analysis traces the bias back to newspaper reporting. While attention to protest groups is balanced across tabloid and broadsheet newspapers, tabloid reporting is more negative about pro-environment movements. These results highlight an important aspect of the backlash against environmental policies: a bias against pro-environment movements within parts of the public and media."

Even though the delivery is key to understanding political speech, we know little about when and why political actors choose particular delivery styles. Focusing on legislative speech, we expect legislators to deliver more emphatic speeches when their vote is aligned with the preferences of their constituents. To test this proposition, we develop and apply an automated video analysis model to speech recordings from the US House of Representatives. We match the speech emphasis with district preferences on key bills using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We find that House members who rise in opposition to a bill give more passionate speeches when public preferences are aligned with their vote. The results suggest that political actors are not only mindful of public opinion in what they say but also in how they say it."

    "abstract": "Politics is increasingly negative, especially surrounding elections, raising concerns about mass disengagement and democratic backsliding. Despite these worries, the literature on how negativity in voting affects democratic attitudes and voting intentions is riddled with ambiguous and contradictory results. We argue that this may partly be due to the failure to distinguish between two types of negativity in voting: (a) understanding voting as a way to act against a specific party, politician, or policy (negative meanings of voting), and (b) opposition to voting itself (an anti-voting orientation). Contrasting these to the classical conception of voting to support a party, politician, or policy (positive meanings of voting), we conceptualize these constructs and validate their measurement in twelve countries, differing in geography, political systems, and levels of democracy ( N = 23,828). We arrive at two main conclusions. First, positive and negative meanings of voting are complementary and compatible attitudes. Modeling positive and negative voting separately rather than relative to each other shows a more nuanced picture of negative voting than previous work. Second, negative voting and anti-voting orientation are distinct types of negativity that relate differently to classical conceptions of voting and democratic attitudes. The first signals political dissatisfaction but belief in the electoral process. The second corresponds to such a disillusionment about voting that it inhibits dissatisfaction with democracy. As such, this distinction highlights the multifaceted nature of political negativity from a citizen perspective and helps clarify the relationship between negativity and democracy."

In contrast, this study holds institutional factors constant and investigates how individual-level and system-level changes, i.e. actual transitions in political power following elections, affect people’s appraisals of democracy. In a panel survey that immediately precedes the January 20, 2025 inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, and two post-inaugural follow-up waves, we find a shifting partisan gap in satisfaction with democracy in America. Following Trump’s inauguration, partisan Democrats become less satisfied with democracy, Republicans become more satisfied, while Independents’ views are largely unchanged. To explain the shift, we consider economic, emotional, and institutional mechanisms, where changes in presidential trust provide the strongest mediation of the power transition gap. Our results illustrate how presidential power transitions can raise alarms among opposing partisans, especially in highly polarized contexts."

We introduce a survey module that captures multiple dimensions of immigration-related perceptions alongside respondents’ confidence in their estimates. Using population survey data from Switzerland, we develop confidence-weighted indicators that separate misperception from guessing. Although inaccurate perceptions are widespread across several immigration domains, they are less prevalent than often assumed; guessing accounts for a substantial share of observed inaccuracy. This measurement strategy enables more precise empirical tests of theories linking perceptions to political attitudes and behavior."

Surveying individuals at the moment they experience an event—or shortly thereafter—could enhance data quality. Advances in technology now enable real-time event detection and the immediate delivery of surveys to individuals as events occur. However, the practical feasibility and benefits of in-the-moment surveys compared to conventional retrospective surveys remain largely unexplored. This paper investigates the use of in-the-moment surveys triggered by geolocation data in an opt-in online panel. During July/August 2024, panelists visiting any of the 2,480 mainland beaches in Spain received survey invitations one hour after their arrival. The results were compared to a conventional survey conducted at the end of the same period, asking participants to retrospectively report their last beach visit. Findings indicate comparable participation and post-participation evaluations between methods. However, in-the-moment responses do not produce significant benefits in reducing explicit non-recall (“don’t know” answers), except for challenging questions that are difficult to reconstruct, and only among those responding while still at the beach (on-site participants); other data quality aspects did not improve. Nonetheless, this method allowed for the collection of specific information (e.g. photos) more conveniently gathered on-site. Significant disparities in substantive results were observed between methods, largely, but not solely, driven by differences in the events captured (e.g. timeframe and duration of beach visits). When compared with external sources, in-the-moment surveys demonstrated greater credibility."

Extensive research in American political behavior counsels against such an expectation, as a long line of research suggests individuals absorb the views of their party and therefore Republicans and Democrats should hold vastly different views on labor policy. However, this underestimates the potentially meaningful role of personal experience in policy preferences as a potential counterweight to partisanship. A key limitation to testing this has been the absence of data with workers’ preferences and direct measures of working conditions. This study draws on original data on 5,425 service sector workers to examine the relationship between partisanship, direct experience with poor working conditions, and labor policy preferences. The results suggest that partisanship is an important determinant of labor policy preferences, but only when workers work in relatively good jobs. Among workers with good working conditions, partisanship is influential and Republicans and Democrats hold significantly different views on labor policy. Yet as working conditions deteriorate, the role of partisanship diminishes and Republican and Democratic workers’ views converge and align, with both embracing pro-union labor policy preferences."

However, their presence and impact on social movements remain poorly understood, which underscores the need for further academic inquiry. Consequently, relying on the concept of computational propaganda, we conducted a computational analysis of approximately 1.30 million public comments on Facebook during the July Revolution of 2024 in Bangladesh, utilizing specialized methods for bot detection, network analysis, and topic modeling. Our findings indicate that 22.27% of the comments were likely generated by bots. We discovered a well-organized network of bots that utilized template-based message crafting, mass duplication of messages, and systematic distribution efforts to disseminate propaganda and control the narrative of the movement. The topics discussed by the bots varied according to the event’s timeline and intensity, closely mirroring real-time developments. This suggests that bots may have helped initiate and guide activities, or influence and amplify the dynamics and outcomes of the event."

    "abstract": "The vision of leveraging digital technologies to deliver real-time psychological interventions in everyday settings is realized via just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) – an intervention design that guides the use of rapidly changing information about a person’s internal states and contexts to decide whether and how to intervene in daily life. Microrandomized trials (MRTs) were developed as an experimental design to address scientific questions about how to best construct JITAIs, enabling scientists to investigate whether, what type, and under what conditions, intervention delivery can promote behavior change. However, missing data present challenges to the ability of MRTs to inform the development of JITAIs. This article articulates the multiple sources of missing data that can manifest in MRT studies, discusses how such missing data can impact (1) bias, (2) variance, and (3) the future implementation of JITAIs, and discusses strategies for both minimizing missing data in an MRT design and handling missing data when they occur. The overarching goal is to provide a conceptual framework that will guide future investigators in anticipating missing data and making informed decisions to manage them. Throughout, we illustrate concepts using existing data from the Mobile Assistance for Regulating Smoking (MARS) study. MARS ( n = 99) involved a 10-day MRT that included up to six randomizations per person per day."

    "abstract": "The advancement of large language models poses a severe, potentially existential threat to online survey research, a fundamental tool for data collection across the sciences. This work demonstrates that the foundational assumption of survey research—that a coherent response is a human response—is no longer tenable. I designed and tested an autonomous synthetic respondent capable of producing survey data that possesses the coherence and plausibility of human responses. This agent successfully evades a comprehensive suite of data quality checks, including instruction-following tasks, logic puzzles, and “reverse shibboleth” questions designed to detect nonhuman actors, achieving a 99.8% pass rate on 6,000 trials of standard attention checks. The synthetic respondent generates internally consistent responses by maintaining a coherent demographic persona and a memory of its prior answers, producing plausible data on psychometric scales, vignette comprehension tasks, and complex socioeconomic trade-offs. Furthermore, its open-ended text responses are linguistically sophisticated and stylistically calibrated to the level of education of its assigned persona. Critically, the agent can be instructed to maliciously alter polling outcomes, demonstrating an overt vector for information warfare. More subtly, it can also infer a researcher’s latent hypotheses and produce data that artificially confirms them. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability in our data infrastructure, rendering most current detection methods obsolete and posing a potential existential threat to unsupervised online research. The scientific community must urgently develop new data validation standards and reconsider its reliance on nonprobability, low-barrier online data collection methods."

    "abstract": "We advance the understanding of so-called “cancel culture” at the university by presenting the results of three survey experiments among university students. Designed in an “adversarial collaboration” among researchers with competing perspectives, these experiments disentangle whether students’ preferences for curtailing academic freedom are based on viewpoint discrimination, professional academic standards, or prosocial concerns. Our findings show that a substantive share of university students support viewpoint-based restrictions on academic discourse. While they also apply academic and prosocial criteria, they apply them more strongly to conservative viewpoints. The results further show that conservative statements are perceived as causing more social harm. However, prosocial concerns do not fully explain the higher demand for ideological viewpoint discrimination. These results are important because they can inform the debate about universities as ideological spaces—a view often invoked in recent government-led attacks on academic freedom."

    "abstract": "Mass shootings occur with horrifying frequency in the United States. Many point to electoral politics as a potential path to change this. Here, we test whether mass shootings increase electoral participation using the most granular dataset to date. We draw information on mass shootings from the Gun Violence Archive and estimate national block group-level turnout using four snapshots of the national voter file. Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we find that mass shootings mobilize local voters (especially in heavily Democratic areas) but do not shift presidential vote choices. Furthermore, we show that pre-election mass shootings were associated with increased support for a 2016 Californian gun reform ballot initiative. Our results show the (geographically bounded) salience of mass shootings for local political engagement and ballot reform efforts."
