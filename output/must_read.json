    "abstract": "Working with the concept of epistemic welfare, defined as creating and maintaining the conditions and capabilities for individuals’ epistemic agency in the public sphere, this contribution provides a theoretical framework to demonstrate a way out of what has been described as an epistemic crisis, illustrating this with the case of algorithmic recommender systems used by media organizations. First, we identify the processes of datafication, algorithmization and platformization and their impact on the public sphere, specifically how they disrupt knowledge production, dissemination and acquisition. Next, we combine social epistemology, welfare studies and communication research to build a framework that allows analyzing how well communicative social practices, procedures and institutions fulfill epistemic standards and, thus, contribute to individuals’ opportunities to exercise their epistemic agency and reach epistemically valuable states. Finally, we discuss epistemic welfare’s implications for media governance, i.e., building conditions and capabilities that ensure epistemic agency."

    "abstract": "News aggregators inherently constitute choice architectures in which placement and presentation of news articles in the user interface affect how people perceive and engage with them. Accordingly, deliberate changes of a news aggregators’ choice architecture may nudge engagement. Against this background, our study aims to test the effects of 2 nudges, namely a position and an accessibility nudge, on (a) the selection of, (b) the engagement with, and (c) learning from environmental news articles by means of a 7-day field experiment using a news aggregator app in the United Kingdom. Results suggest that prominent article positioning coupled with visual highlighting significantly increases the selection of environmental news, its reading time and recall of information. In contrast, automated rewriting of environmental articles for lower text complexity had no significant effects. Additional analyses indicate that neither nudge backfired by decreasing user satisfaction, thus suggesting the practical usability of our approach."

    "abstract": "Political orientation is related to many aspects of our lives. Here, we investigate how political orientation relates to how women from different parts of the world picture their ideal partner. Using data from the Ideal Partner Survey , we analyzed relationships between political orientation and long-term partner preferences in a sample of 13,257 heterosexual, single women from 144 countries. Replicating previous work, political orientation was related to a preference for political similarity, such that women holding more extreme political views showed the strongest preferences for political similarity. In addition, women leaning more to the right side of the political spectrum held higher preferences for ethnic and religious similarity. Partly consistent with the possibility that political orientation relates to women’s attraction towards men conforming to a masculine, male breadwinner stereotype, more right-leaning views were not only linked to preferring a financially secure and successful partner, but also to ascribing more importance to a partner´s height. No or only negligible relationships with political orientation were found for partner´s kindness-supportiveness and level of height. For all other preferences, results were less conclusive. In sum, results indicate that who women want as a romantic partner is partly related to their political orientation."

    "abstract": "Political polarization is driving disconnection and animosity between opponents in the United States. We propose perceiving opponents as self-disclosing helps foster connection and reduce animosity. Building on research demonstrating that self-disclosure fosters interpersonal relationships, we test whether vignettes expressing political views that seem self-disclosing increase connection, respect, and willingness to interact among opponents. Across six studies, we demonstrate self-disclosure reduces partisan animosity by building connection between political opponents. Previous work shows that vignettes about opponents’ personal experiences bridge divides better than fact-based vignettes. The results from the current research suggest this is because experiences are especially self-disclosing. Leveraging this, we find that many statements partisans share can improve connection and reduce animosity when they are perceived as self-disclosing. We test this through manipulating the self-disclosure of statements in experiments and by teaching people how to make their statements more self-disclosing. Results indicate self-disclosure is consistently effective for liberal and moderate partisans but in many cases are also effective for conservatives. By highlighting the power of self-disclosure, our findings offer a promising path toward bridging partisan divides."

However, less is known about how an individual’s ease of listening interacts with conversational contexts to influence participation. This study hypothesizes that this listening disposition amplifies the effect of political talk on political participation. Using data from a 2024 US national survey (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 800), we test this using OLS regression on a composite index of political participation. The model assesses how the frequency of political talk across four contexts (strong/weak ties network, and like-minded/different-minded people) is moderated by self-reported ease of listening (to like- and different-minded people). Results show that while talking and listening to like-minded people is positively associated with participation, the main effect for talking and listening to different-minded people is not significant. However, a significant interaction emerges: The positive effect of talking with different-minded people on participation is amplified by the ease of listening to those same views. This effect is confined to cross-cutting conversations; no comparable interactions were found in strong-tie, weak-tie, or like-minded contexts. These findings indicate that the civic benefit of listening is highly contextual, with the ease of listening to differing views unlocking the participatory potential of talk during cross-cutting discussion."

    "abstract": "Despite broad scientific support, vaccination is traditionally a contested issue among the public. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the issue of vaccination received widespread attention in news media and on social media. Although we know that public debates on such disputed issues evolve over time in hybrid media systems, there is still little knowledge about the extent to which news media and social media align or differ in their issue attention dynamics and semantics. Furthermore, empirical studies, particularly on social media data, tend to focus on periods of high issue attention, often missing relevant reference points before or after such phases. Focusing on the issue of vaccination in Switzerland, we examine 77,798 news articles by 20 Swiss online newspapers and 929,431 posts by 22,672 Swiss Twitter (now X) users to investigate the similarities and differences between the two spheres through a time series analysis between April 1, 2019, and June 30, 2022. The findings show how vaccination gained vastly in issue attention—measured as the share of total coverage and tweet volume, respectively—during the Covid-19 pandemic. Twitter and news media were closely aligned during the crisis in terms of issue attention and semantics, but less so before and after the pandemic. These findings substantiate previous works on issue agendas in hybrid media systems that converge toward a dominant issue in times of crisis."

Because of the informational outcome focus, common misinformation interventions (i.e. forewarning and debunking) have not been systematically tested for their ability to mitigate persuasive effects. In two preregistered experiments ( N = 657 and N = 427), we tested the effectiveness of forewarning versus debunking for positive and negative misinformation, focusing on attitudes and behavioral intentions as outcome measures. Results show that, as hypothesized, post-exposure corrections are most effective in reducing misinformation’s persuasive effects; pre-exposure corrections in fact do not significantly reduce persuasive effects. We also corroborate prior findings that especially effects of negative misinformation are resistant to corrections. Based on our results, we advise media outlets to not only rely on forewarnings, but to also correct misinformation after user exposure."

Women authors are underrepresented in national outlets and are more often reported by liberal media.

Our study addresses this research gap by providing insights into the voices of these young individuals and their communities on TikTok, as they engage in partisan online political discourse. Using topic modeling, thematic content analysis, and sentiment analysis, we analyzed 124,963 audience comments and 100 video posts by young supporters of the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States. We found that the topics discussed in the young supporters’ video posts varied significantly between the two parties, as did the audience’s reactions to these posts. Young supporters often employ the platform to reinforce in-group solidarity and target ideological opponents, and their political messaging closely aligns with their respective parties’ ideologies. They leverage the platform’s socio-technical features to engage with their audiences in “politainment” by means of humor, sarcasm, and cultural references."

Analyzing extensive data on electorates, parties, and individuals in 24 countries for over half a century, we document a systematic pattern whereby economic crises tend to disproportionately favor the right. Three main forces underlie this pattern. First, voters tend to decrease support for the party heading the government when the crisis erupts. Second, after crises, voters tend to assign greater importance to issues typically owned by the right. Third, when center‐right parties preside over a crisis, voters often drift further rightward to nationalist parties rather than defect to the left. The far‐right thus serves as an effective vehicle for keeping the center‐right in power even when facing postcrisis disaffection by its voters."

We report the first longitudinal evidence on these matters by leveraging a unique two‐wave survey of Asian, Black, Latino, and multiracial adults. First, contrary to the current conceptualization, we find PoC solidarity is as stable as PoC identity , suggesting two alternate but durable sources of political unity among these groups. Second, consistent with its present conceptualization, we show PoC identity is associated with shifts in solidarity , but not vice versa. Third, we offer evidence that the dynamics between these variables hold uniformly across different PoC subgroups, highlighting this mega‐group's coherence and political relevance. We conclude by discussing our results’ implications for US inter‐minority politics."

Reflecting the combination of these two dimensions, we develop four treatments based on real evidence/stories and test several pre-registered hypotheses regarding their efficacy in two survey-experimental studies conducted in Denmark. We find that manifest types of evidence – from an audit study and a personal story exhibiting explicit discrimination – are the most effective in raising majority members’ awareness of ethnic minority discrimination. Further, the effect of the personal story extends to increased support for anti-discrimination policies and higher donations to an immigrant NGO, highlighting how personal stories can increase majorities’ awareness of and willingness to act on the adversity experienced by minorities."

Making use of two studies, combining automated content analyses (170,786 manifesto statements), election surveys ( n = 17,140) and a survey experiment ( n = 1125) I find that that moral appeals can have positive as well as negative effects, many of which are dependent upon the source of the appeal.

In this article, we introduce a computationally inexpensive and fully open-source method for estimating media criticism from news articles using à la carte (ALC) word embeddings. We validate our approach using Arabic-language news media published during the Arab Spring. An applied example demonstrates how our technique generates credible estimates of changes in media criticism after a democratic transition is ended by a military coup. Experiments demonstrate the method works even with sparse data. Analyses of synthetic news media demonstrate that the method extends to multiple languages. Our approach points to new possibilities in the monitoring of media freedom within authoritarian and democratizing settings."

We argue that in a polarized environment, partisan bias applies not only to citizens’ evaluations of macro-policy outcomes but also to citizens’ evaluations of mundane tangible public services, such as education, health, policing, and transportation. We provide rigorous empirical evidence for this hypothesis using the case of Israel during the two dramatic, hyper-polarized government changes in 2021 and 2022. The data include two repeated cross-sectional survey datasets: A large seven-wave survey study and an administrative survey dataset by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics.

Conventional social-science accounts, emphasizing the stability of racial attitudes, dismiss this possibility. In contrast, we theorize how these events may have altered Americans’ racial attitudes, in broadly progressive or in potentially countervailing ways across partisan and racial subgroups. An original content analysis of partisan media demonstrates how the information environment framed Black Americans before and after the summer of 2020. Then we examine temporal trends using three different attitude measures: most important problem judgments, explicit favorability towards Whites versus Blacks, and implicit associations. Challenging the conventional wisdom, our analyses demonstrate that racial attitudes changed following George Floyd’s murder, but in ways dependent upon attitude measure and population subgroup."

Direct intergroup contact interventions have shown promise in reducing partisan polarization, but are costly, time-consuming, and sensitive to subtle changes in implementation. Vicarious intergroup contact—observing co-partisans engage with outparty members—offers a possible solution to the drawbacks of direct contact, and could potentially depolarize Americans quickly and at scale. We test this proposition using a pre-registered, placebo-controlled trial with a nationally representative sample of Americans. Using both attitudinal and behavioral measures, we find that a 50-minute documentary showing an intergroup contact workshop reduces polarization and increases interest but not investment in depolarization activities. While we find no evidence that the film mitigates anti-democratic attitudes, it does increase optimism about the survival of democratic institutions. Our findings suggest that vicarious intergroup contact delivered via mass media can be an effective, inexpensive, and scalable way to promote depolarization among Americans."

We test how ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility predicted social media users’ engagement with 62,118 posts by 484 US partisan accounts before and after the first Trump assassination attempt (July 13) and Biden’s re-election campaign suspension (July 21). We find that, while outgroup hostility is typically the dominant predictor of engagement, interactions with ingroup solidarity surged among Republicans after the Trump shooting and among Democrats after Biden’s withdrawal. We show that negativity toward other groups is not always key to going viral. Rather, positive ingroup emotions appear to play a leading role in times of crisis."

    "abstract": "By varying prompts to a large language model, we can elicit the full range of human behaviors in a variety of different scenarios in classic economic games. By analyzing which prompts elicit which behaviors, we can categorize and compare different strategic situations, which can also help provide insight into what different economic scenarios might induce people to think about. We discuss how this provides a step toward a nonstandard method of inferring (deciphering) the motivations behind the human behaviors. We also show how this deciphering process can be used to categorize differences in the behavioral tendencies of different populations."

    "abstract": "We investigate how to counter misinformation about voter and election fraud using data from the US and Brazil. Our study first compares two types of messages countering claims of widespread fraud: (i) retrospective corrections from credible sources speaking against interest and (ii) prebunking messages that prospectively warn of false claims about future elections and provide information about election security practices. In the US, each approach immediately increased election confidence and reduced fraud beliefs, with prebunking showing somewhat more durable effects. In Brazil, prebunking had positive immediate effects across measured outcomes, whereas those of the credible source corrections were less consistent. We then conducted an experiment in the US randomizing exposure to a persuasion forewarning before election security information is provided. Prebunking again increased confidence and decreased fraud beliefs but only when the forewarning was omitted, suggesting that novel factual information is responsible for the observed effects of the prebunking treatment."
