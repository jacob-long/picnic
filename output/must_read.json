    "authors": "Woochul Kim",
    "abstract": "This study compares Netflix Korean original films with top-grossing Korean theatrical films using Napoli’s diversity taxonomy. Drawing on a cross-sectional sample (2021–2024) with a historical benchmark (2006–2020), it assesses differences in source diversity (production-company concentration), content diversity (genres, creative roles, and expressive intensity via age ratings), and the narrative articulation of Korean locality. The results reveal that while Netflix functions as a new type of investor creating opportunities for some filmmakers, it operates within entrenched patterns of capital concentration while exhibiting selective diversification across content dimensions. These findings suggest that Netflix’s promotional rhetoric of global diversity functions less as straightforward cultural inclusion than as a market expansion strategy that reinforces broader patterns of capital accumulation, revealing the complex entanglement of diversity discourse with platform capitalism.",

    "authors": "Isaac Vaghefi",
    "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the temporary discontinuance of social media. Building on stimulus-response binding and priming mechanisms, we propose a research model illustrating how compulsive social media use–through hedonic consumption, social interaction and content sharing–shapes temporary discontinuance. We argue that compulsive use can be modulated by cognition-based priming effects (cognitive dissonance and attitudes toward discontinuance) and affect-based priming effects (somatic and self-evaluative mood states), with exposure to cues (e.g. social media apps on smartphones) acting as a potential moderator. Design/methodology/approach We tested our model through a field study and quantitative analysis of Facebook users who voluntarily took a break from the platform. An objective assessment of participants’ temporary discontinuance was used to validate the model. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze relationships between compulsive social media use, priming effects and discontinuance behaviors. Findings The results indicate that compulsive social media use can both directly and indirectly influence temporary discontinuance. Cognition-based priming (cognitive dissonance and attitudes) and affect-based priming (mood states) significantly shape discontinuance behavior, while exposure to cues moderates these relationships. The findings highlight the complex mechanisms underlying social media disengagement. Originality/value This study extends discontinuance behavior research in information systems (IS) by identifying priming effects as key mechanisms influencing temporary disengagement. The findings offer practical insights for users seeking to manage social media use, service providers designing interventions and policymakers addressing digital well-being.",

    "authors": "Syrios Siyao Li, Sufang Wang, Matthew Kwok On Lee",
    "abstract": "Purpose The prominence of online social networks (OSNs) has made them ideal platforms for viral marketing. Otome games efficiently use OSNs for viral campaigns, making them a valuable case for studying viral marketing strategies. This study identified key elements of viral marketing posts to inform the operational strategies of commercial accounts. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed China's sizable otome game market using operational behavioral data from the top five games, compiled into the OtomeVM dataset. Following the knowledge discovery in databases framework, this study identified key characteristics of the top 25% most viral posts and proposed the ViralGD model, a multimodal machine learning model for virality prediction. The model's decision logic was further interpreted through a global surrogate method to ensure transparency. Findings This study identified lottery mechanisms as significant predictors of post virality, with optimal performance observed for content combining short videos of 180 s or less and long-text descriptions of 175 characters or more. Commercial social media accounts often produced emotionally homogeneous content, with emotions having minimal impact on the viral spread of their posts. Originality/value This study is the first to apply large-scale real-world data and data mining to uncover overlooked patterns in viral marketing, offering theoretical insights into defining virality and refining campaign design. Practically, the iterative application of the ViralGD model uncovers high-impact features that boost content diffusion, effectively guiding operators in selecting optimal improvements.",

    "authors": "Shiyu (Sharon) Zheng, Shiyi Zhang",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of social media platforms has profoundly reshaped news reporting, particularly concerning sensitive events like suicide. This study investigates how Chinese news media framed the suicides of two high-profile female celebrities, Sulli and Coco Lee, on the influential social media platform Weibo. It examines the dominant reporting frames and explores how Weibo’s unique interactive environment influenced the framing process. Computational thematic analysis was employed to investigate dominant themes from Weibo posts published by verified news media accounts, and three primary frames were identified: mental health, gossip, and nationalism. While the mental health frame marked a shift from traditional Chinese reporting, it often remained superficial and was intertwined with sensational elements. The gossip frame, which centres on personal scandals and conflicts, aligns with the problematic sensationalism often observed in suicide reporting. The nationalism frame positioned the suicides within contexts of cultural comparison and national pride. Findings indicate that social media affordance significantly shaped these frames, resulting in more sensational and dynamically evolving narratives. This has shifted traditional gatekeeping and agenda-setting power, and potentially diminishes the quality and responsibility of reporting. This research highlights the complex interplay between journalistic norms, platform dynamics, and audience interaction in the digital news era, underscoring the need for updated approaches to responsible reporting on social media.",

    "abstract": "Co-present smartphone use—the use of smartphones in the presence of others—is a prevalent behavior in social contexts. However, the situational mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. While previous research has primarily conceptualized co-present smartphone use as a stable individual disposition and focused on person-level determinants, the role of specific situational characteristics has remained largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, the present study investigates co-present smartphone use from a situational perspective, aiming to gain insights into the situational predictors of co-present smartphone use. We conducted an experience sampling study with 87 participants, reporting on 829 social interactions to examine how co-present use is linked to different types of connection cues (technical, spatial, and mental). The findings show that a person's smartphone use during an interaction is related to the smartphone use of others present and the number of notifications received.",

Our investigation concerns the “Barbarian Right” subculture on X (formerly Twitter), where reactionary content is often intertwined with wellness messaging. Using social network analysis of 42 accounts identified through digital ethnography, we mapped the structure of this community and identified key influencers. Subsequent semiotic discourse analysis revealed ideological practices and their relationship to platform affordances. Our findings reveal a small number of prominent accounts, supported by alternative media outlets that dominate this space. These accounts primarily deliver health advice strategically interspersed with white nationalist messaging. This research offers empirical insights into the growing alignment between far-right and wellness communities, shedding light on potential radicalization pathways and recruitment strategies of the dissident right.",

    "abstract": "This study examines how digital affinity groups construct collective identity in the context of the TikTok ban in the United States, which led to a large-scale migration of American users to the Chinese social media platform REDNOTE (Little Red Book). Using Collins’ Interaction Ritual Chains theory as a framework, we conducted participant observation, content analysis, and computational textual analysis of over 1000 high-engagement posts and 9000 comments under the #TikTokRefugee hashtag on REDNOTE. Our findings show that platform algorithms facilitate virtual co-presence and help form symbolic boundaries between American and Chinese users. Through shared experiences, emotional exchanges, and multimodal interactions (such as bilingual memes and cultural symbols), users developed a sense of group belonging and constructed a new “TikTok Refugee” identity. The study reveals a dynamic process of confrontation and integration: while users express resistance to the ban and reinforce group solidarity, they also engage in cross-cultural dialogue and adapt their identities. These results highlight the dual role of platform algorithms and emotional energy in shaping digital communities, offering new insights into how online platforms mediate identity formation in transnational contexts.",

    "abstract": "Using a 2 (social endorsement: high vs. low) × 2 (AI comment type: approving vs. disapproving) experiment, we examine how AI-generated comments and social endorsement cues jointly influence information-seeking intentions in response to social media health misinformation. Results reveal a moderated-moderated mediation: When AI trustworthiness is high and social endorsement is low, debunking comments promote cognitive elaboration, which in turn increases information-seeking intentions. This pathway suggests that deeper cognitive processing of AI corrections makes individuals more receptive to seeking additional verification. When AI trustworthiness is low, debunking is largely ineffective. Notably, under low trustworthiness and endorsement, misinformation-supporting comments can unexpectedly elicit more elaboration, potentially triggering skepticism-driven information seeking. These findings underscore the importance of AI trustworthiness and reveal nuanced mechanisms in how individuals respond to AI-based health misinformation interventions, highlighting that cognitive elaboration serves as a critical bridge between AI interventions and behavioral intentions.",

    "authors": "Sylvain Parasie, Antoine Machut, Béatrice Mazoyer",
    "abstract": "This article explores the role played by legacy media in the pervasive situation where far-right activists highly politicize migrant crimes on social media. Focusing on particular crimes they consider indicative of a state’s failure to secure borders and protect its citizens, they utilize social media platforms to mobilize and garner political and media attention. However, little is known about the dynamics of influence between far-right activism on social media and legacy media in the process of politicizing migrant crimes. To overcome the analytical and methodological limitations of current research, we have developed a computational method to capture the public discussion that took place in France around a single event – the murder of a young teenager in Paris in October 2022. Applying an event identification algorithm to a vast corpus of Twitter data has enabled us to analyze the dynamics of public discussion held in various arenas, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This article’s main argument is that legacy media act as a “moral compass” vis-à-vis far-right mobilizations that politicize migrant crimes on social media. While they were unable to influence the volume of attention that social media users pay to this murder, the French legacy media have contributed to setting limits to the form and spread of politicization by the far right on social media. More specifically, they were able to influence the attention paid to the facts that serve as the basis for discussion on social media and to steer that discussion toward questioning the relevance of politicizing the crime.",

While most extant work has focused on voters’ social identities and their related, expressive considerations about the social bases of parties, this article directs attention to two other considerations that may also influence the vote: voters’ evaluations of social groups, as suggested by reference group theory, and their instrumental considerations about the extent to which parties work to advance the interests of specific groups. Using both an observational ( N = 2,065) and a preregistered experimental study ( N = 7,090) about voter evaluations of social classes and the extent to which parties are seen as fighting for them in Denmark, the study shows how these considerations influence party choice over and above the influence of identity-based considerations. Thereby, the study is the first to show experimental evidence for the effect of group evaluations on vote choice.",

We investigate the effect of observing similarities in apolitical characteristics—such as gender, age, personality, or lifestyle choices—on people’s decision to engage in political conversations, and whether ideological expectations or apolitical homophily drive this effect. To this end, we introduce the “dynamic parallel conjoint experiment” and field it in the Czech Republic, France, Italy, and Sweden. We find that observing apolitical similarities in others consistently increases the likelihood of engaging in political conversations. Political expectations engendered by these similarities do not play a relevant role. Rather, similarities motivate political conversations directly through homophily, providing evidence supporting the “incidental model” of political conversations (Minozzi et al., 2020). Our study contributes to debates on the dynamics underlying political conversation and introduces an innovative methodological approach for studying implicit mediation in political behavior.",

I use all available online content from four major Estonian newspapers during 2015–2023 ( ∼ 140,000 articles) and pre-trained transformer models to classify the sentiment and policy issues of news articles that mention MPs. I match media data with MPs’ Wikipedia pageviews on a daily basis over two legislative terms. First, the results show that media visibility of MPs is associated with more views of their Wikipedia page on the same day. Second, news articles with negative sentiment have a greater impact on information-seeking than those with a positive or neutral tone. Third, the impact of MPs' media appearances on information-seeking is dependent on the policy context as well as party affiliation.

We analyze a year-long, random sample of submissions and comments scored with established computational measures of incivility, and we link these scores to subreddit-level rule regimes and identity signaling. By distinguishing interpersonal impoliteness from democratic norm violations and by evaluating moderation complexity at the community level, this work clarifies when and how community governance relates to discourse quality and participation dynamics on Reddit.

Quantifying the uncertainty of such predictions is rarely considered, partly because prediction intervals are not defined for many of the algorithms used. However, generating and reporting prediction models without information on the uncertainty of the predictions carries the risk of overinterpreting their accuracy. Conventional methods for prediction intervals (e.g., those defined for ordinary least squares regression) are sensitive to violations of several distributional assumptions. In this tutorial, we introduce conformal prediction, a model-agnostic, distribution-free method for generating prediction intervals with guaranteed marginal coverage, to psychological research. We start by introducing the basic rationale of prediction intervals using a motivating example. Then, we proceed to conformal prediction, which is illustrated in three increasingly complex examples using publicly available data and R code.",

Study 2 found that in both abstract (general description) and concrete (public figure) presentations, faces of left-wing in-group members expressing gender critical views were judged more negatively than self-identification faces, with Progressive-generated gender critical faces evaluated more negatively than Traditional Liberals–generated faces. Replicating Study 1, the Rowling face generated by Traditional Liberals was evaluated positively.

Traditional models have focused on impulse inhibition: effortfully inhibiting prepotent motor responses toward a temptation, yielding a stage-based evolution of choice. Other models emphasize dynamic competition between goal and temptation, yielding a more integrative evolution of choice. Although these models represent fundamentally different conceptions of self-control, current methods are inadequate for investigating real-time dynamics, leaving the question of which model best describes self-control unresolved. We investigate these models using mouse-tracking: a dynamic, real-time measure of decision-making in which we measure participants’ computer mouse movements as they navigate tradeoffs between immediate and delayed gratification (e.g., $5 today vs. $20 in 3 mo). We develop a quantitative approach that integrates the rich spatial and temporal information contained in mouse trajectories, and find evidence for both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. Notably, impulse inhibition is less frequent, occurring in only one-quarter of choices favoring larger later rewards over smaller sooner ones. We further find substantial individual variability on who relies on impulse inhibition, with more present-biased individuals more likely to use impulse inhibition to choose larger-later options. Finally, our approach reveals the diverse variability within impulse inhibition and dynamic competition, and accounting for this variability greatly strengthened models predicting out-of-sample choices. Our findings clarify the mechanisms underlying self-control and introduce a robust tool for quantifying real-time decision-making dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Expressions of dissent against authority are an important feature of most societies, and efforts to suppress such expressions are common. Modern digital communications, social media, and Internet surveillance and censorship technologies are changing the landscape of public speech and dissent. Especially in authoritarian settings, individuals must assess the risk of voicing their true opinions or choose self-censorship, voluntarily moderating their behavior to comply with authority. We present a model in which individuals strategically manage the tradeoff between expressing dissent and avoiding punishment through self-censorship while an authority adapts its policies to minimize both total expressed dissent and punishment costs. We study the model analytically and in simulation to derive conditions separating defiant individuals who express their desired dissent in spite of punishment from self-censoring individuals who fully or partially limit their expression. We find that for any population, there exists an authority policy that leads to total self-censorship. However, the probability and time for an initially moderate, locally adaptive authority to suppress dissent depend critically on the population’s willingness to withstand punishment early on, which can deter the authority from adopting more extreme policies.",

    "authors": "Federico Germani, Giovanni Spitale",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate text, raising urgent questions about whether their judgments are consistent, unbiased, and robust to framing effects. Here, we examine inter- and intramodel agreement across four state-of-the-art LLMs tasked with evaluating 4800 narrative statements on 24 different topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of 192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified nationality affects evaluation outcomes. Different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intramodel agreement across topics, but this alignment breaks down when source framing is introduced. Attributing statements to Chinese individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models and, in particular, for DeepSeek Reasoner. Our findings show that LLMs’ own judgment of agreement with narrative statements exhibit systematic bias from framing effects, with substantial implications for the neutrality and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems.",

    "authors": "Ji Yeon Hong, Yong H. Kim, Han Zhang, Tianzhu Qin",
    "abstract": "How nationalism spreads and is reinforced has long been debated. This study examines how nationalistic messages and sentiments propagate on Chinese social media, focusing on interactions between celebrities and fans. We analyzed more than 8 million Weibo microblogs and comments, classified their content using machine-learning techniques, and examined the dynamics between celebrities and fans. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings reveal that fans exert a stronger influence on celebrities than vice versa in spreading nationalism. Fans often shape the nationalist narratives that celebrities amplify, with those aligned with specific political leanings (e.g., within the state-conformist camp) having a greater influence. These results highlight the critical role of grassroots online communities in shaping nationalism in nondemocratic contexts, offering insights into the dynamic interactions between the masses and influential figures in reinforcing nationalist ideologies and sentiments.",
