    "abstract": "The article explores the social role and implications of large language models (LLMs) through the lens of media theory. Rather than considering LLMs as advanced forms of artificial intelligence, I argue that a communication-focused perspective provides a more effective way to interpret their impact on information management in contemporary society and to address the associated ethical and operational challenges. Supported by information management tools such as archives, catalogs, and later search engines, previous communication media expanded the scope of communication, making it possible to reach more, distant, diverse, and possibly anonymous communication partners. LLMs now signify a new phase in the evolution of communication, as they function themselves as communication partners capable of responding autonomously to user queries in a personalized manner. This perspective highlights and explains the capabilities and limitations of various LLM-based chatbots and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, while also addressing issues such as misalignment and hallucinations."

    "abstract": "Political polarization is often characterized as a consequence of changes in media content or technology. We argue, in contrast, for an account that views polarization in media and the public as a co-adaptive process. This paper begins with a brief review of cultural evolution and co-adaptation and then considers the application of similar ideas to changes in media and the public over time. Using formal models, we suggest that—in combination with the human tendency toward in-group bias—a co-adaptive (rather than unidirectional) relationship can best account for real-world dynamics. We consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of media effects and technological innovation in polarization, representative democracy, and mass-mediated communication more broadly."

    "abstract": "Multiple crises have marked the formative years of young adults. These crises heightened the need for information while also creating a large audience for misinformation. This article highlights digital resilience in four countries (the US, the UK, France, and Canada) and across different age groups, using a survey conducted in February 2021 at the apex of a series of crises. Based on a sample of 6,000 respondents, the two youngest age groups are more likely to use fact-checking websites, verify suspicious information, and report misinformation to social media platforms. These practices reflect digital resilience. In terms of cross-national differences, respondents from the US have higher use of fact-checking sites, which can be explained by the structural availability of these websites, which tend to focus on American content. In line with theories about uncertainty avoidance, respondents from France have higher rates of verification of suspicious information. Canada is distinctive in its low rates of misinformation reporting to social media platforms. While much of the scholarship has focused on political ideology as shaping engagement with misinformation, this study highlights generational differences, cultural differences, digital literacy programming, structural opportunities, and regulatory frameworks that may shape practices related to digital resilience."

Since the General Data Protection Regulation took effect, DDPs have found application in research. While the literature on the value of DDPs primarily points toward scaling and validating aggregate-level data, their potential to illuminate complex user–media relationships within datafied environments at the micro-level appears underexplored. Drawing from recent conceptualizations of the “data mirror,” which captures the feedback loops between users and digital media, this article provides theoretical grounding and practical guidelines for “mirroring” DDPs to users. Based on exercises with 64 participants, we articulate through an illustrative case study how DDPs can serve as prompts, contexts, and reflections, revealing reflexive strategies users employ to curate information flows on algorithmic platforms like Instagram. In addition, we introduce an open-source web application to operationalize DDPs as data mirrors for non-technical researchers."

Experimentation is widespread (88%), yet workflow integration remains uneven. Adoption is strongest among younger professionals, and sectoral differences are detected: marketing reports higher adoption, whereas journalists and educators report the lowest usage. ChatGPT dominates (77%), followed by Canva (38%), and DALL·E and MidJourney (27%). Frequency of use lag behind positive attitudes. National patterns also diverge, reflecting cultural, regulatory, and market factors. Results draw on SCOT, Rogers’ diffusion, and Bozdag’s AImosis to frame sociotechnical adoption of AI as a negotiation. We offer a baseline of AI practices in European communication professions and identify key priorities in policy."

By revealing Douyin’s affective affordances to produce queer counterpublics through censorship, we propose a framework that explains how queer counterpublics navigate user–state tensions and balance affect with strategy in a dynamic discursive space. Based on our large-scale Douyin video dataset, we analyze 102,031 videos from 90,901 accounts by combining computational and qualitative methods. By employing computer vision and content analysis, we uncover the multimodal features and strategies calling for justice in those videos. We also show how non-influencers, influencers, and official accounts adopt distinct strategies and how these strategies are associated with user engagement. Further multimodal discourse analysis examines three key counter discourses, including maximum visibility, limited anger, and infinite hope. This study contributes to the understanding of queer counterpublics in China and the potential of short video platforms like Douyin to foster social change."

The study employed a survey approach, collecting data from 4089 scientists affiliated with German universities and research institutions. Trust in journalism was measured across five dimensions: appropriate topic selection, accurate representation, proper fact selection, fair assessment, and desirable impact. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between dissatisfaction with pandemic-era media coverage, trust in journalism, and scientists’ willingness to engage in science communication. Results show that scientists’ trust in news media is generally limited and varies across media types. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated distrust, particularly in media outlets expected to maintain high standards, such as national newspapers and public broadcasters. Trust in journalism proved central in mediating dissatisfaction and engagement, highlighting that distrust may reduce scientists’ media involvement and, in turn, weaken public trust in science."

An experimental group ( n = 41) received jargon-oriented and GenAI feedback; controls ( n = 37) received only jargon feedback. Participants preferred revised texts, with slightly higher preference in the GenAI group. SciComm-based rubric assessment revealed GenAI-supported texts significantly improved in SciComm strategies, particularly connecting science to everyday life and narrative use. Findings highlight GenAI’s potential to enhance SciComm content and scalable feedback, supporting its careful integration into training."

However, research on the relationship between weaponized information and polarization remains limited due to conceptual ambiguities and geographical context. This study uses cross-sectional survey data ( N = 520) collected across eight provinces in Afghanistan to explore the direct and indirect association between exposure to disinformation and malinformation online and ethnic polarization. Findings through mediation analyses reveal that exposure to disinformation was not associated with ethnic polarization, either directly or indirectly. Conversely, exposure to malinformation was directly associated with ethnic polarization and indirectly linked to it through increased ingroup positive perception. These findings highlight the nuanced difference in how intentional falsehoods and the harmful misuse of accurate information shape polarization dynamics in ethnically diverse and polarized societies."

    "abstract": "This study argues that in China’s digital sphere, online misogyny functions less as a gateway to extremism and more as a structural hub for systemic discontent. Drawing on opportunity structure theory, our mixed-methods approach combines computational analysis of posts from Baidu Tieba ( n = 91,026) with in-depth interviews ( n = 27). We find that “Gendered Insults” exhibits the highest betweenness centrality, acting as a structural bridge connecting disparate frustrations. Women-targeting topics are both speakable and resonant within the community, anchored by a self-deprecating “sewer mouse” masculinity that navigates opportunity structures. Interviews reveal that when political opportunity structures remain closed while discursive and mediated (legacy platform) opportunities stay relatively accessible, misogyny becomes a functional language for channeling widespread socioeconomic anxieties. We conclude that in this context, misogyny operates not as a starting point for radicalization but as a core organizing principle for the socially disillusioned. This suggests that divergent structural conditions produce different mechanisms."

Measuring these differences in opinion using traditional methods, such as opinion polls, can be costly and provides only a snapshot of sentiment at a given time. Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) may offer a real-time tool for assessing opinions to explore the relationship between differing viewpoints about the pandemic and how these differences impact the occurrence and severity of disease burden. Utilizing an open-source data set of 1.75 million keyword-selected X (Twitter) posts, updated weekly from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, along with publicly available COVID-19 case and death counts and county-level data on election outcomes from the 2020 election, we analyzed how the volume of tweets on the X (Twitter) platform related to COVID-19 has changed over time and how patterns of use vary across the partisan divide. We discovered that Democratic-leaning counties exhibited higher X (Twitter) volume associated with COVID-19 topics compared to Republican-leaning counties in response to changes in case or death rates. In addition, we found a higher proportion of tweets in urban counties compared to rural ones."

    "abstract": "Political news consumption is highly uneven today: few people consume from news outlets directly, while many encounter news incidentally through social media and aggregators. Because outlets depend on direct consumers for revenue, they respond primarily to this core audience’s preferences. Several contemporary styles of news coverage—which emphasize partisan conflict, employ specialized jargon, engage in predictive analysis, and use clickbait language—are attractive to core consumers, but may also make news less accessible for others. In a pre-registered survey experiment ( n = 2,233), I show that, relative to a public interest style that prioritizes key information about policy and democratic norms, typical news styles weaken post-exposure recall of key news information—that is, they are under-informative. Recall penalties are especially severe for those with lower baseline political engagement, yet still affect highly engaged consumers as well. This study shows that contemporary approaches to news coverage broadly under-serve the public by inhibiting political learning."

Building on prior studies by Barber and Pope (2019, 2024) regarding Donald Trump's impact on people's policy preferences during his 2017–2021 presidency, we examine whether this influence persists soon after Trump's first presidential tenure concludes in late 2021 through a survey experiment. We also assess the influence of a second external cue that has gained attention due to the growing role of social media in political processes: a close friend, who might also serve as a relevant figure for policy position formation. We find that Trump's liberal cues shift Republican preferences in a liberal direction, while close friend cues show diverse patterns, including some backlash effects where individuals adopt positions opposite to conservative friend advocacy. These effects vary with individuals' party identification, political knowledge, and social conformity levels. Individual characteristics moderate political elite influence, while peer influence operates through reactance mechanisms rather than conformity, revealing that social networks shape opinions through more complex pathways than commonly theorized."

    "abstract": "Americans’ trust in scientists has been stable and high, relative to other political and social institutions, for the last half century (Krause, Brossard, and Scheufele 2019). Yet, underlying this stability lies a dramatic change such that a partisan gap has emerged, with Democrats exhibiting substantially more trust than Republicans. Fifty years ago, Republicans in fact exhibited more relative trust in scientists. This article explains this continuity and change. First, we demonstrate that the demographic correlates of trust in scientists have been remarkably stable for more than a half century: women, Black, rural, religious, non-college educated, and lower/working-class individuals exhibit less trust than their counterparts. Second, we show that the partisan relationship with trust in scientists has flipped (over that same time period) as low-trusting demographic strata shifted partisan allegiances. This is particularly the case when it comes to education and religiosity. Concomitant with the emergent partisan gap is a massive perceptual gap among Democrats, who perceive a partisan divide more than double its actual size. Democrats vastly underestimate Republicans’ trust in scientists. The enduring demographic basis of trust in scientists provides an opportunity to bridge partisan divides by addressing demographic inequities in the practice and application of science."

    "abstract": "Extant work has identified two discursive forms of racism: overt and covert. While both forms have received attention in scholarly work, research on covert racism has been limited. Its subtle and context-specific nature has made it difficult to systematically identify covert racism in text, especially in large corpora. In this article, we first propose a theoretically driven and generalizable process to identify and classify covert and overt racism in text. This process allows researchers to construct coding schemes and build labeled datasets. We use the resulting dataset to train XLM-RoBERTa, a cross-lingual large language model (LLM) for supervised classification with a cutting-edge contextual understanding of text. We show that XLM-R and XLM-R-Racismo, our pretrained model, outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in classifying racism in large corpora. We illustrate our approach using a corpus of tweets relating to the Ecuadorian indígena community between 2018 and 2021."
