    "abstract": "Unhealthy social media habits may foster procrastination, leading to negative psychological and behavioral outcomes. The rising prevalence of procrastinatory short-form video (SFV) use (e.g., on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) highlights the need to better understand how established predictors of problematic media use operate in this emerging media environment. To address this gap, this study investigated the motivational factors underlying procrastinatory SFV use and its relationship with user well-being. Using an online survey of college students ( N = 549) from two U.S. universities, structural equation modeling revealed that individuals with lower self-control, stronger habitual SFV use, and greater involvement (enjoyment, escapism, and social connectedness) were more prone to procrastinatory SFV use, which in turn was associated with higher stress levels, poorer overall sleep quality, longer sleep latency, more sleep disturbances, and greater daytime dysfunction, but not with academic performance. This study contributes to the understanding of motivational factors underlying procrastinatory SFV use and its associations with user well-being. Theoretical contributions to the study of irrational media use, practical recommendations for mitigating procrastinatory SFV engagement, and directions for longitudinal and context-sensitive future research are discussed."

    "abstract": "This study examines how European media portrayed Syrian refugees in 2015 and Ukrainian refugees in 2022, across seven national contexts. Drawing on the GDELT database of news articles and its automated sentiment analysis, the study compares the tone and salience of coverage surrounding two highly symbolic mediatic events: the death of Syrian child Alan Kurdi in 2015 and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2022. Results reveal stark disparities: Ukrainian refugees were consistently represented more positively than Syrian refugees and non-Syrian/non-Ukrainian refugees. These findings provide quantitative evidence of how cultural, racial, and geopolitical proximity shape refugee representations in European media, thereby confirming previous literature. While some prior scholarship has demonstrated these dynamics, this article contributes to existent literature by offering a large-scale, cross-national, and event-based comparative analysis."

    "abstract": "Online support communities play an important role in providing access to quality social support. Additionally, those who experience health concerns that face social stigma, such as depression, are more likely to seek support online. To identify effective strategies that help individuals seeking support for depression receive high-quality social support online, we explore the role of two linguistic features in encouraging polite responses to their posts. This study employed a 2 (agency: human vs. depression) × 2 (causality: biological vs. nonbiological) factorial design. The politeness package for R was used to identify linguistic indicators of negative politeness and our results demonstrated that attributions of agency and causality did not have a significant direct effect on the prevalence of negative politeness in support responses. This suggests that support seekers’ understanding of the etiology of depression, and how they present it to support providers, has little impact on the quality of support provided in terms of negative politeness."

Drawing on survey data from 1,340 Swiss–German participants, this study reveals that engagement with diverse political views is not solely shaped by stable personality traits but also by the characteristics of the informational context. Openness, for instance, shows a positive relationship with seeking controversial information in the media but not the interpersonal sphere, while extraversion is linked to a preference for controversial political discussions. Nevertheless, our results also point to a particular personality type, plasticity (i.e., shared variance of openness and extraversion), that seems to be more actively engaged in cross-cutting exposure across communication settings. In contrast, individuals high in stability (i.e., shared variance of conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness) tend to be somewhat less engaged."

    "abstract": "Interpersonal sexual objectification is a pervasive phenomenon among women and has been increasingly recognized in men. Research suggests sexual objectification is associated with two contrasting psychological outcomes: self-objectification and enjoyment of sexualization. Yet, little is known about how these outcomes vary by interpersonal context and gender, particularly in Asian contexts. To this end, two studies were conducted in the Chinese cultural context. In Study 1, a two-stage process was used to collect and screen objectifying comments towards women and men. In the first stage, 67 women and 41 men were recruited to generate a pool of comments. In the second stage, another 75 women and 50 men were recruited to evaluate these comments, resulting in eight representative comments for each gender. In Study 2, 239 women and 194 men participated in a 4 × 2 experiment examining how the perpetrator’s role (stranger, colleague, friend, or intimate partner) and the comment valence (positive or negative) affected self-objectification and enjoyment of sexualization. Results revealed distinct response patterns between genders. For women, positive objectifying comments led to lower self-objectification compared to negative comments in acquaintance contexts (i.e., colleagues, friends, and partners). However, no differences were found in the context with strangers. In contrast, men’s self-objectification remained stable across perpetrators and comment valences. Women’s enjoyment of sexualization was highest from intimate partners than from strangers, colleagues, and friends, whereas men’s enjoyment of sexualization was relatively high across perpetrators but lowest with colleagues. These findings extend objectification theory to the Chinese setting, highlighting gender-specific patterns in how interpersonal contexts shape psychological responses to sexual objectification."

This propensity can also make adolescents a population more vulnerable to misinformation, particularly during crises when misinformation levels surge. In situations of uncertainty and risk, such as during public health crises, trust plays an important and influential role. This study explored whether adolescents’ trust in an individual sharing misinformation, and trust in their misinformation about Covid-19, differed based on adolescents’ perceived risk of harm from Covid-19 (risk vs reduced risk) and the age of the misinformer (peer vs adult). When shown misinformation about a hypothetical Covid-19 variant, adolescents (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 131; 14–17 years old) trusted a misinformer more when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents were also asked to provide open-ended justifications for their trust evaluations which were analysed in accordance with the elaboration likelihood model. We found that adolescents who reported to more regularly scrutinising information were more likely to consider information and source credibility when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents who reported engaging in less information-scrutinising behaviours were more likely to consider their relationship with the misinformer when the misinformer was a peer. These findings suggest how the elaboration likelihood model can play an important role in risk communication amongst adolescents and emphasise the need for educating adolescents about the importance of scrutinising information, particularly during crises."

    "abstract": "Online hostility has become increasingly common in digital public spaces, often to the detriment of marginalized groups. While prior research distinguishes between incivility and intolerance, little is known about whether users can recognize these forms as conceptually distinct. Moreover, the roles of prior digital hate perpetration and national context in shaping such perceptions remain unclear. This cross-national survey ( N = 4041; Austria, France, Hungary, and Sweden) addresses these gaps. Participants rated uncivil anti-immigration content not only as more uncivil but also as more intolerant than explicitly intolerant content, indicating an alarming misreading of exclusionary messages. Recent perpetration was associated with weaker recognition of incivility and intolerance, as well as reduced differentiation between content types, suggesting desensitization and blurred perceptual boundaries. The findings were consistent across countries, indicating that these mechanisms transcend national contexts. Strengthening users’ ability to recognize subtle exclusionary rhetoric is essential to counter its normalization in public spheres."

This research tested the leap of faith hypothesis, suggesting that secular individuals may accept scientific claims based more on faith in science than on scientific literacy. In Study 1 ( N = 202) and a preregistered Study 2 ( N = 300), Indonesian adults completed measures of secular beliefs, faith in science, scientific literacy, and confidence in scientific consensus. Across both studies, faith in science consistently mediated the effect of secular beliefs on confidence in scientific consensus, whereas scientific literacy did not. These findings suggest that secular individuals may place trust in scientific claims through conviction—indicating that confidence in science can operate as a faith-like commitment rather than a cognitive understanding."

Results show that media usage and sociodemographics influenced attitudes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower education and stronger religiosity correlated with reduced interest in or trust in science. Use of online legacy media showed rally-around-the-flag effects, but we found no clear differences between public and private broadcasters regarding their impact on science attitudes. These findings highlight the relationship of media use, sociodemographics, and public attitudes during societal uncertainty and over time, offering insights for targeted, context-sensitive science communication."

This study investigates how older adults respond to misinformation on social media and how their responses vary by sociodemographic factors and digital skills. Based on survey data collected in 2023 from 2000 adults ages 60+, we find that many users take a multifaceted approach to assessing false or misleading information on social media. The most common strategies are reading the comments for validation and checking the source. The prevalence of such responses to misinformation highlights older adults’ active participation in information verification on social media. Findings also suggest that those who use the internet less frequently and those with lower social media skills are less likely to use such strategies suggesting that digital inequality is at play when it comes to responding to misinformation."

Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment—how well AI systems meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values. However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of AI-enabled systems in Germany ( n = 1800) and the United States ( n = 1756). We examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more normatively charged goals—like fairness and aspirational imaginaries—receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S. responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences."

Additionally, this research finds that information attributed to social media is perceived as less credible and lower in value. The results have implications for sourcing practices of journalists, suggesting that use of nonelite sources in news might lower people’s perceptions of the information."

Unlike prior studies, our treatments are contrast ads and not purely negative ads. While the inclusion of positive messaging from the sponsor could increase voters’ parasocial relationship with the candidate, shielding them from backlash, the results from our experiment suggest that British voters view attacks on personal traits as too negative and lower their evaluation of the sponsor as a result."

Previous research on the design of such questions found that providing multiple small answer boxes yields more and richer answers than providing one larger answer box. Using a series of classifiers based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers language model, we empirically study how this design choice affects the classification of such answers. We design a 2 × 2 factorial experiment: (i) analysis with a multi-label versus single-label classifier and (ii) answers obtained from one larger answer box versus multiple smaller answer boxes. We find that the multi-label classifier gives more accurate results than the single-label classifier (1 percent versus 9 percent misclassification of individual labels), regardless of how the answers were obtained. Surprisingly, analysis with a multi-label classifier is preferable. We attribute this success to the classifier’s ability to use label correlations. We conclude that list-style open-ended questions should continue to provide multiple answer boxes due to better data quality. However, answer boxes should be concatenated for analysis to improve classification performance."

Drawing on causal inference, we clarify this by distinguishing between total, direct, and—centrally—joint effects, defined within the potential-outcomes framework and illustrated with directed acyclic graphs. Joint effects extend average treatment effects to repeated interventions, providing a practical measure of combined intervention effects over time. Using a worked example on smartphone use and sleep quality, we demonstrate how different estimands answer different questions, why single total effects can sometimes mislead in longitudinal settings, and how joint effects capture strategy-level consequences across time. A key practical takeaway is that joint effects can be estimated in both experimental and observational studies. In the latter, it typically suffices to adjust only for variables that govern treatment decisions at each time point rather than modeling the entire causal system. Building on this, we propose covariate-driven treatment assignment (information-restriction designs in which decisions depend only on observed covariates) as a practical route to causal inference in nonexperimental psychology, and we connect these designs to estimation via g-methods from epidemiology. We provide open materials, including R code, to support adoption."

Four LLMs were prompted across three experiments to test how they generate psycholinguistic ratings of words in comparison with humans. LLM ratings, averaged across varying list contexts, were found to be highly correlated with human ratings, and differences in correlation strengths were partly explained by differences in rating ambiguity. LLM context manipulations strengthened correlations with human ratings through better calibration, and variability in LLM ratings was correlated with human inter-rater variability. Additional results from testing LLM generation of word naming latencies showed functional deviations from factors that underlie human word naming, indicating that lexical function assembly in LLMs is currently limited by patterns of co-occurrence in textual data. Patterns at finer-grained timescales are needed in the training data to model online lexical processes. We conclude that LLMs used context to guide the assembly of generalized lexical functions, rather than recalling ratings and latencies from training data."

Previous work on naturalistic scenes has frequently focused on collections of discrete images with considerable physical differences between stimuli. However, it is often desirable to assess representations of naturalistic images that vary along a continuum. Traditionally, perceptually continuous variations of naturalistic stimuli have been obtained by morphing a source image into a target image. This produces transitions driven mainly by low-level physical features and can result in semantically ambiguous outcomes. More recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate continuous perceptual variations within a stimulus category. Here, we extend and generalize this approach using a different machine learning approach, a text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion XL), to generate a freely customizable stimulus set of photorealistic images that are characterized by gradual transitions, with each image representing a unique exemplar within a prompted category. We demonstrate the approach by generating a set of 108 object scenes from six categories. For each object scene, we generate ten variants that are ordered along a perceptual continuum. This ordering was first estimated using a machine learning model of perceptual similarity (LPIPS) and then subsequently validated with a large online sample of human participants. In a subsequent experiment, we show that this ordering is also predictive of stimulus confusability in a working memory task. Our image set is suited for studies investigating the graded encoding of naturalistic stimuli in visual perception, attention, and memory."

    "abstract": "Implicit measures are used extensively in psychological science. One fundamental goal of these measures is to provide information diagnostic of an individual’s attitudes or beliefs. After 25 years of research, this goal has not been achieved. We argue that this is because psychologists have not yet even quantified the individual-level precision of implicit measures, much less calibrated them to it. In this paper, we examine the individual-level precision of six different implicit measures across three different attitude domains (race, politics, and self-esteem) using a very large open dataset. Despite some variation, we find that there is substantial room for improvement for the precision of implicit measures as measures of individual attitudes. We recommend that researchers who wish to make theoretical inferences about individuals directly quantify individual-level precision to calibrate their tasks appropriately, both in the context of implicit measures and with tasks in psychological science more broadly."

    "abstract": "Conspiracy endorsement has previously been linked to national narcissism—an unrealistic belief in the greatness of the national in-group. In this research, we explore the role of the need for uniqueness in explaining why national narcissists seize on conspiracy theories. In Study 1 ( N = 1,000), we found that a self-attributed need for uniqueness mediated the link between national narcissism and conspiracy beliefs. In Study 2 ( N = 387), we introduced the novel concept in the form of a group-attributed need for uniqueness and found its role in explaining the relationship between national narcissism and conspiracy beliefs. In Study 3 ( N = 799), we considered both types of the need for uniqueness and observed only group-attributed need for uniqueness as a significant mediator of the relationship between national narcissism and conspiracy beliefs. In Study 4 ( N = 1,616), we experimentally increased national narcissism and observed its positive effect on conspiracy beliefs targeting in-group (vs. out-group) members. This effect was mediated by group-attributed need for uniqueness. Results shed light on psychological motives that may drive conspiracy beliefs among collective narcissists."

    "abstract": "We present an item response model for ordinal public opinion data to understand individual-level variation in attitudes as a function of covariates. The approach allows investigating how individuals (or population subgroups) differ in substantive stances and attitude strength. It is a two-dimensional partial credit model that incorporates covariates linked to attitude direction and strength into the basic model. We exemplify the types of substantive insights into heterogeneity that can be obtained from the approach but not from existing models with two applications: attitudes toward gender equality (European Values Study) and the evaluation of presidential candidates (American National Election Study)."

    "abstract": "Climate-related disasters such as wildfires and floods pose escalating risks to communities worldwide, yet motivating individuals to adopt protective measures remains a persistent challenge. In a pre-registered field experiment with 12,985 Australian homeowners in wildfire-prone areas, we demonstrate that a simple behavioural intervention—integrating proximal cues, such as participants’ suburbs, into climate risk communications—significantly increases engagement. Participants who received localized messages were twice as likely to seek further information about wildfire preparedness compared with those who received generic communications (odds ratio of 2.03, 95% confidence interval of 1.33 to 3.16). This effect highlights the power of behavioural interventions in addressing barriers to climate adaptation, particularly by reducing psychological distance and fostering place attachment. By making abstract climate risks tangible and personally relevant, the intervention nudges individuals towards action. These findings suggest a scalable, low-cost approach for enhancing disaster preparedness, offering insights for leveraging behavioural science to mitigate the impact of climate-related disasters."

    "abstract": "Scientists provide important information to the public. Whether that information influences decision-making depends on trust. In the USA, gaps in trust in scientists have been stable for 50 years: women, Black people, rural residents, religious people, less educated people and people with lower economic status express less trust than their counterparts (who are more represented among scientists). Here we probe the factors that influence trust. We find that members of the less trusting groups exhibit greater trust in scientists who share their characteristics (for example, women trust women scientists more than men scientists). They view such scientists as having more benevolence and, in most cases, more integrity. In contrast, those from high-trusting groups appear mostly indifferent about scientists’ characteristics. Our results highlight how increasing the presence of underrepresented groups among scientists can increase trust. This means expanding representation across several divides—not just gender and race/ethnicity but also rurality and economic status."

    "abstract": "Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are interactive tools that communicate information about elections, yet their effectiveness in enhancing political knowledge and participation remains understudied. Moreover, traditional VAAs may disproportionately attract politically engaged users with already well-formed ideological views, limiting their potential to inform a broader and less engaged electorate. This paper introduces a “VAA Bot” that employs large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation to deliver balanced, personalized information drawn from official party platforms and public documents. We evaluate the VAA Bot’s impact across three experimental studies aimed at young politically unaffiliated adults. The findings provide evidence that the VAA Bot improves knowledge of party stances on issues of great importance to each user. However, the VAA Bot produces weak effects on downstream outcomes such as vote preferences and party evaluations among respondents whose primary issue position aligns closely with one of the parties. These findings contribute to ongoing debates about the role of political information in shaping behavior and clarify both the promise and the limitations of LLM-based tools for civic learning."

    "abstract": "Online political discussions are often dominated by a small group of active users, while most remain silent. This visibility gap can distort perceptions of public opinion and fuel polarization. Using a collective field experiment on Reddit, we examined factors predicting self-selection into silent “lurker” and active “power-user” roles and tested whether participation differentials can be reduced with norm- or incentive-based interventions. We recruited 520 United States participants, randomly assigned them to conditions in six private communities, and asked them to discuss 20 political issues over 4 weeks while completing weekly surveys. Lurking (posting nothing) was most common among users who perceived discussions as toxic, disrespectful, or unconstructive; these same perceptions also predicted power usership (more posting, conditional on not lurking). Experimentally, financial incentives for commenting reduced participation differentials, whereas we did not find effects from a civility norm treatment. These findings support preference- and incentive-based accounts of participation but suggest that light-touch interventions are unlikely to bridge participation gaps, let alone polarization."
