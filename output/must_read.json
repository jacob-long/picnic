    "abstract": "Amidst a global media landscape dominated by transnational conglomerates and tech giants, proximity media face the imperative to reassess their mission and relevance. As market dynamics may lead to news deserts, proximity public service media (PSM) are crucial in catering to underserved audiences with news and entertainment tailored to their nearby environment. This paper draws on insights from seven focus groups involving stakeholders of Radiotelevisión del Principado de Asturias (RTPA), a proximity PSM outlet in northern Spain, to delve into the perspectives of audiences, production companies and advertisers on RTPA's proximity focus and informational role. The findings reveal widespread appreciation for proximity among RTPA's stakeholders, delineated into three dimensions: physical, emotional and economic. Moreover, the expectations on and assessments of RTPA's informational role are rooted in general PSM values such as impartiality, quality and participation. It is concluded that there is a need to explore the values of PSM beyond normative approaches and including the insights of stakeholders, and that proximity PSM outlets must dynamically adapt their values to meet the unique needs of proximity communities."

    "abstract": "In this article, we review Alice Marwick’s book, The Private is Political: Networked Privacy and Social Media, published by Yale University Press in 2023. In the book, Marwick argues that the digital nature of the social media landscape fundamentally changes contemporary notions of privacy. We trace three specific elements of her argument, namely: (1) the design of networked technologies to connect and leak, (2) the subsequent differential harms on those historically marginalized, and (3) the need to shift from individualized to more contextual and structural understandings of privacy. We discuss the implications of these arguments not just for privacy, but for expression. We describe the tensions around freedom of expressions and content moderation online. Finally, we conclude with a reflection on these arguments for academic expression given the socio-technological context in which we work and the differential harms that impact academics from historically marginalized communities. Building on Marwick’s arguments, we call for a social, contextual, and structural approach for responding to the targeted harassment of academics to protect and ensure academic freedom for all."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the methods and practices used by self-identified fact-checkers situated on the fringe of the field of fact-checking to support their agenda for public recognition and legitimacy. Using a case study approach and selecting nine cases across five countries (Russia, Brazil, India, China, and Singapore), we identify the most common distinguishable attributes and tactics associated with this ambiguous collection of actors. In addition to identifying how fringe fact-checkers weaponize fact-checking practices and exploit or mimic the social standing of accredited fact-checkers, we critique examples where state-supported fact-checkers associated with authoritarian governance structures fact-check for national interests. We propose a spectrum of fact-checkers including those where public or general interest fact-checkers follow journalistic ideals and align with accredited communities of practice or non-accredited peer recognition, and a collection of fringe fact-checkers ranging from “special interest” actors promoting specific political agendas to hostile actors with disruptive, destructive, and openly propagandistic interests and aims to destabilize the global public sphere. The article contributes to current research and debates about the institutionalization of fact-checking and the understudied area of fact-checking impersonation, a problematic activity associated with misinformation and propaganda on platforms and the internet."

    "abstract": "The move from political fact-checking to a “public health” or debunking model of fact-checking, sustained by policies and funding from platforms, highlights important tensions in the case of Covid-19. Building on findings from studies focused on journalistic role performance, we investigated how professional fact-checkers in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa conceived of and performed their professional roles when addressing Covid-19 vaccination topics. Interviews with fact-checkers from six well-established, Meta-affiliated, International Fact-Checking Network-accredited organizations operating in these regions indicated that fact-checkers recognized the diversification of tasks and new roles associated with addressing problematic content from social media users. However, fact-checkers expressed unanimous commitment to prioritizing political and media watchdog activities in response to problematic Covid-19 vaccine information spreading from elite sources. To compare these role conceptions with role performance, we conducted a content analysis of Covid-19 vaccine content posted in 2021 to these fact-checkers’ Facebook accounts. We found that content was mostly associated with explainers or debunking content (addressing hoaxes or rumors about Covid-19 vaccines from non-elite social media users). In particular, the abundance of explainers, compared with other genres of fact-checking content, aligns fact-checkers with professional roles as civic service providers, educators, and “interpreters” of health information. Only a small proportion of the Covid-19 vaccine-related posts from each fact-checker contained verifications of claims from authoritative (elite “top-down”) sources (i.e., politicians, media, and health/science professionals). This study offers insights into a particularly tumultuous time of political activity in these regions and considers implications for practice innovation."

Inspired by the social contagion theory, we introduce the concept of narrative contagion—where a story shared by a person or organization prompts others to share their stories—and investigate its process and outcome in online cancer communities. Utilizing a large dataset of 849 Facebook posts, 47,291 comments, and 14,466 replies, our artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational analysis provides evidence for narrative contagion among individual users in organization-hosted cancer communities on Facebook. It also reveals different organizational message characteristics, such as emotional arousal, post topic, and request for storytelling, that affect user storytelling and emotional support in comments and replies. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of digital storytelling and its collective dynamics in online communities."

    "abstract": "This study examines the perception–reality gap regarding the influence of technological affordances on cybersexual harassment (CSH) between remote workers. While previous research has recognized the existence of gender stereotypes and discrimination in online spaces, little attention has been given to how technological affordances impact—or are perceived to impact—incidents of CSH. By employing a theoretical framework of technological affordances, this study reveals that users often perceive affordances differently from how they utilize them, indicating a misalignment between perception and behavior. Our analysis of interviews with 30 remote knowledge workers extends affordances theory by showing that affordances are not always applied in the ways they are perceived, and that power dynamics and structural inequalities outweigh technological affordances in shaping reporting behaviors. Addressing this perception–reality gap is crucial for developing interventions and policies that accurately reflect the realities of CSH experiences and promote a safe online work environment."

    "abstract": "Dating apps have changed the way people establish contact with potential romantic partners. However, more and more dating apps use algorithms to keep their users’ engagement high. Studies suggest that trust in algorithms can shape offline dating experiences. We theorize that excessive swiping, driven by fear of missing out, predicts trust. We also explore the role of decision fatigue. Findings from a two-wave panel study with N Time2 = 521 young dating app users suggest that the fear of missing out on potential romantic partners was positively related to decision fatigue on dating apps. Moreover, excessive swiping and decision fatigue were positively related to trust in algorithms. No reciprocal effects of trust in algorithms on excessive swiping or decision fatigue were observed. It seems that trust in algorithms might present some kind of relief strategy for compulsive behaviors such as excessively swiping, or for negative feelings such as decision fatigue."

This will more readily happen if their experiences are safe, secure, and positive. We analyze data from a nationally representative sample of 5005, 13- to 17-year-olds in the United States to measure their experiences of 12 specific harms on VR platforms, and which protective strategies they employed to prevent or respond to them. Girls were more likely to be sexually harassed and to experience grooming/predatory behavior, and were more likely to have been targeted specifically because of their gender. Finally, girls were more likely to engage in some specific protective measures online, but overall both boys and girls use platform safety mechanisms infrequently. We discuss enhancements in policy, content moderation, and feature sets that can serve to better safeguard youth in the metaverse."

Adopting a conditional effects approach, this research shows that transience-themed posts and motivation-themed posts on social media—which are both considered eudaimonic—are appreciated by different groups of people. Study 1 found a moderating influence of impermanence acceptance: People who had greater impermanence acceptance were more likely to have eudaimonic responses after viewing transience-themed posts than after viewing motivation-themed posts. The Japanese concept of mono no aware, or beauty in pathos, was used to motivate study 2. Study 2 found that people who viewed transience-themed posts experienced greater impermanence appreciation than people who viewed motivation-themed posts, but media theme did not influence impermanence awareness or impermanence acceptance."

Here, listening is considered as the receiving component of communication, and responsive behavior as its visible product. The focus is on public communication that followed Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. A total of 4,392 quote tweets (citing the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky’s tweets mentioning Ukraine’s possible membership in the European Union) were analyzed using the taxonomy of verbal response modes. Two major modes were identified: responses to the situation by sharing information and persuasion, and responses to Zelensky, Ukrainians, and the public by disclosing feelings and opinions. Interestingly, the different social roles of the public were associated with how much interaction was elicited. The listening public contributes to global deliberativeness; not strictly from an issue-oriented problem-solving perspective, but in the sense that they weave together analytical and social aspects of deliberative reflection."

SAE-GAMLSS relax the exponential family distributional assumption and allow each distributional parameter to depend on covariates. A bootstrap approach to estimate the MSE is proposed. The SAE-GAMLSS estimator shows a largely better performance than the well-known Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (EBLUP) under various simulated scenarios. Per-capita consumption of Italian and foreign households in Italian regions, in urban and rural areas, is estimated using SAE-GAMLSS. Results show that the well-known Italian North–South divide does not hold for foreigners."

To overcome some of these problems, the article introduces a new academic web tracking solution, WebTrack, an open-source tracking tool maintained by a major European research institution, GESIS. The design logic, the interfaces, and the backend requirements for WebTrack are discussed, followed by a detailed examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the tool. Finally, using data from 1,185 participants, the article empirically illustrates how an improvement in data collection through WebTrack leads to innovative shifts in the use of tracking data. As WebTrack allows for collecting the content people are exposed to beyond the classical news platforms, it can greatly improve the detection of politics-related information consumption in tracking data through automated content analysis compared to traditional approaches that rely on the source-level analysis."

To help do this, many governments used chatbots that provided personalized information guiding people on where, when and how to get vaccinated. We designed and tested a WhatsApp chatbot to understand whether two-way interactive messaging incorporating behaviourally informed functionalities could perform better than one-way message reminders. We ran a large-scale preregistered randomized controlled trial with 249,705 participants in Argentina, measuring vaccinations using Ministry of Health records. The behaviourally informed chatbot more than tripled COVID-19 vaccine uptake compared with the control group (a 1.6 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (1.36 pp, 1.77 pp)) and nearly doubled uptake compared with the one-way message reminder (a 1 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (0.83 pp, 1.17 pp)). Communications tools designed with behaviourally informed functionalities that simplify the vaccine user journey can increase vaccination more than traditional message reminders and may have applications to other health behaviours."

While earlier research has identified brain regions implicated in persuasion, these studies often relied on event-related analyses and frequently simplified persuasive communications. The present study investigates the neural basis of valuation change induced by a persuasive healthy eating call, employing naturalistic stimuli. Fifty healthy participants performed two blocks of a bidding task, in which they had to bid on sugar-containing, sugar-free, and nonedible products during functional MRI. In between the two blocks, they listened to a persuasive healthy eating call that influenced their bidding behavior. Intriguingly, participants who resisted persuasion exhibited increased synchronization of brain activity during listening in several regions, including default mode network structures. Additionally, intersubject functional connectivity among these brain regions was found to be weaker in persuaded individuals. These results emphasize the individualized nature of processing persuasive messages, challenging conventional interpretations of synchronized neural activity. Our findings support the emerging practice of tailoring persuasive messages in health promotion campaigns."

Historically, this literature focuses on how one individual’s expectations can shape another person’s self-views. Given the reciprocal nature of conversation, we wondered whether conversation partners’ self-views may mutually evolve. Using four-person round-robin conversation networks, we found that participants tended to have more similar self-views post-conversation than pre-conversation, an effect we term “inter-self alignment.” Further, the more two partners’ self-views aligned, the more they enjoyed their conversation and were inclined to interact again. This effect depended on both conversation partners becoming aligned. These findings suggest that the way we see ourselves is coauthored in the act of dialogue and that as shared self-views develop, the desire to continue the conversation increases."

    "abstract": "Lockdowns were implemented to reduce the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. However, it is unclear how severely curtailed physical interaction shapes individual behaviors that are considered vital for socioeconomic development. In this exploratory study, we investigate the behavior of college students who experienced a strict campus-wide lockdown and those who did not. Employing a combination of experimental and survey methodologies, we elicit students’ behavioral variables, which are then integrated with administrative records from the university. We find that those exposed to the lockdown were more likely to trust others and be honest; however, their creativity was lower. Exposure to the lockdown was not found to significantly affect students’ trustworthiness, risk preferences, or competitiveness. A follow-up study reveals that the lower creativity among students may be attributed to reduced communication frequency with friends during the lockdown, mediating the lockdown’s impact. Conversely, the effects of the lockdown on trust and honesty may operate through a direct pathway, independent of changes in daily activities during the lockdown. Further analysis reveals a gender-dependent trend, with lockdowns exerting a more pronounced influence on male students than their female counterparts. These results underscore the consequences of lockdowns and advocate for enhanced support networks, emphasizing the importance of communicating with friends in similar circumstances."

Using participants’ personal opinions and critiques, the AI mediator iteratively generates and refines statements that express common ground among the group on social or political issues. Participants ( N = 5734) preferred AI-generated statements to those written by human mediators, rating them as more informative, clear, and unbiased. Discussants often updated their views after the deliberation, converging on a shared perspective. Text embeddings revealed that successful group statements incorporated dissenting voices while respecting the majority position. These findings were replicated in a virtual citizens’ assembly involving a demographically representative sample of the UK population."

    "abstract": "Scholars warn that partisan divisions in the mass public threaten the health of American democracy. We conducted a megastudy ( n = 32,059 participants) testing 25 treatments designed by academics and practitioners to reduce Americans’ partisan animosity and antidemocratic attitudes. We find that many treatments reduced partisan animosity, most strongly by highlighting relatable sympathetic individuals with different political beliefs or by emphasizing common identities shared by rival partisans. We also identify several treatments that reduced support for undemocratic practices—most strongly by correcting misperceptions of rival partisans’ views or highlighting the threat of democratic collapse—which shows that antidemocratic attitudes are not intractable. Taken together, the study’s findings identify promising general strategies for reducing partisan division and improving democratic attitudes, shedding theoretical light on challenges facing American democracy."

    "abstract": "How do people around the world define democracy? Answering this question is critical as countries face democratic backsliding and authoritarian governments promote alternative notions of democracy. Indeed, some scholars argue that people from different backgrounds understand democracy differently. By contrast, we discovered very consistent views about what constitutes a “democratic” country from conjoint survey experiments conducted in Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, Thailand, and the United States. Across countries ( N = 6150) and diverse subgroups within countries, people similarly emphasized free and fair elections and civil liberties as being the key determinants of democracy. Countries that produce desirable social and economic outcomes are also considered more democratic, but these and other factors exert a smaller and less consistent effect than elections and civil liberties."
