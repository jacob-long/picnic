    "abstract": "In this article, we review Alice Marwick’s book, The Private is Political: Networked Privacy and Social Media, published by Yale University Press in 2023. In the book, Marwick argues that the digital nature of the social media landscape fundamentally changes contemporary notions of privacy. We trace three specific elements of her argument, namely: (1) the design of networked technologies to connect and leak, (2) the subsequent differential harms on those historically marginalized, and (3) the need to shift from individualized to more contextual and structural understandings of privacy. We discuss the implications of these arguments not just for privacy, but for expression. We describe the tensions around freedom of expressions and content moderation online. Finally, we conclude with a reflection on these arguments for academic expression given the socio-technological context in which we work and the differential harms that impact academics from historically marginalized communities. Building on Marwick’s arguments, we call for a social, contextual, and structural approach for responding to the targeted harassment of academics to protect and ensure academic freedom for all."

    "abstract": "While numerous studies have documented an association between mainstream media trust and mainstream media use, only little is known about potential causal mechanisms underlying the association. We theorize that selective exposure, social influence, and the reinforcing spirals model offer three possible mechanisms that may underlie the association. These possibilities were studied using random intercept cross-lagged panel models and latent curve models on a four-wave panel data set (n = 3,540). For mainstream media, the results show an asymmetrical reinforcing spiral, in which the effect of mainstream media trust on use can be considered as one of yielding maintenance, while the impact of media use on mainstream media trust to a limited degree is in line with the notion of a spiral gradually (though inconsistently) increasing trust over time. We also find that use of right-wing alternative media consistently and sometimes robustly leads to decreasing mainstream media trust."

This study utilizes standardized content analysis to examine the political values in applauded statements ( n = 1,722) from Ukraine’s major political talk shows. The results suggest that applauded statements embody a complex mix of identity- and governance-oriented values, signaling to the broader audience the preferred type of political debate among those within the studio. The study enhances the literature on public opinion cues by demonstrating the significance of analyzing their underlying content."

This critical reflection adopts a “research through design” process to examine AR’s technological and affective capabilities in the context of three community co-created AR campaigns. We discuss how AR can become both a conceptual and practical tool for creating conditions of self-identification and, potentially, empathy between audience and content. Further, we explore how people and place become a critical part of AR’s infrastructure through the practice of empathic feedback loops."

    "abstract": "Journalists are increasingly experiencing the negative consequences of online news transformations, such as trolling and harassment, as well as audience distrust. Despite acute need, intra-organisational efforts to support journalists’ online wellbeing have so far been limited. More recently, research has explored how journalists have turned to individual practices of disconnection, such as blocking, muting, or small breaks from online media to mediate the impacts of their everyday online labour (Bossio et al., 2024). Building on this research, this study explores how these individual practices are moving toward collective practices of disconnection. Using interviews with 21 journalists, this study traces how emergent collective practices might contribute to systemic change in journalism. We argue that in lieu of intra-organizational support, journalists seek to disconnect through informal sharing of experiences and support as well as collective efforts toward inter-organisational training and intra-organisational formalization mentoring programs."

The research also integrates Hartmut Rosa’s theory of resonance with the digital media environment: It suggests that while Rosa may reject digital technology in his view of resonance, digital technology, or YouTube in this case, can contribute to enhancing resonance, but only depending on how people practice it. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the importance of middle-aged women, who are not merely viewers, but rather active participants within the burgeoning YouTube scene. Lastly, we expand the current understanding of how audience groups may potentially exert agency, moving beyond the ideological binaries of submission versus resistance in the process of interpreting media texts. Our emphasis lies in the creativity embedded in Korean middle-aged women’s platform practices within their daily lives. This process is fuelled by a deep desire and will to find resonance with themselves, others, and the world."

    "abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of ghosting on the mobile dating app Tinder among Slovenia’s dating app users. Ghosting is defined as the unexpected unilateral termination of communication in interpersonal relationships exerted through digital platforms. Drawing upon data from the walkthrough of the mobile dating app Tinder and 26 semi-structured interviews with users living in Ljubljana (Slovenia), ghosting is conceptualized as an undesirable but normalized disconnection strategy on Tinder. We argue that choosing ghosting as a communication strategy emerges predominantly from two different contexts. Firstly, from the need to protect oneself from harassment and vulnerability, and secondly, as a reaction to the information overload in an environment that demands perpetual activity, availability, and interaction. Therefore, it manifests as a disconnection strategy on an interaction level or as a consequence of disconnecting from the platform itself. According to users, the desire to disconnect from others and exit the app is as high and ambiguous as the desire to connect and experience an ego boost or the excitement of interactions. Ghosting on Tinder, therefore, emerges as a response to general hyperconnectivity to navigate the increasing information overload and to a feeling of loss of the possibilities for safe and authentic connections in digital spaces."

Migrants subjected to the dual border-and-boundary work of Western host countries and their non-Western home countries make for complicated self–other boundary narratives. This study explores the everyday boundary work of migrants originating from Hong Kong, a former British colony, who have chosen to relocate to the UK through the British National (Overseas) (BN[O]) visa scheme. The scheme was catalysed by the 2019 political upheaval in Chinese Hong Kong and the UK–Hong Kong colonial affiliation. Through the lens of dis/connection assemblage, we conceptualise digital dis/connections as a form of boundary work and conduct in-depth interviews and thematic analysis of 14 BN(O)s. We demonstrate that digital disconnection can be seen as a socio-political practice related to identity regulation by situating BN(O)s’ digital media practices within the political projects of belonging in the UK, Hong Kong, and China. Through a matrix of disconnected approaches, BN(O)s shape boundaries around identity politics in terms of social positions, a sense of belonging, and social relations. The political meaning of digital disconnection is highlighted through its fracture of connected space-time and resilient management of social relationships&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;"

Integrating self-determination theory and self–other overlap, we conducted an experimental mixed-method study with 35 participants who experienced three VR stories focused on inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA): living with Alzheimer’s, blindness, and in a refugee camp. Findings indicate that while participants felt some autonomy with the VR headset, they experienced a lack of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the storytelling. Participants engaged in perspective-taking but often thought about those close to them who had similar experiences rather than themselves. Thus, a close other’s experience affected whether people engaged in perspective-taking. However, prior experience with IDEA topics did not predict cognitive effort, indicating that individuals with such experience do not exert more cognitive effort than those without it. Additionally, cognitive effort did not predict prosocial attitudes or behaviors. This study highlights the complexities of how previous experiences affect engagement with IDEA-centered VR, perspective-taking, and cognitive effort and suggests directions for future research."

Through a multimodal discourse analysis of the collected data, this study found three distinct linguistic strategies employed in “visual poverty” livestream: illocutionary strategy, discourse strategy, and nonverbal strategy. These strategies are designed to achieve three interactional goals: constructing a false identity, reinforcing credibility, and gaining economic benefits. Based on these findings, this study further analyzed why it is difficult to detect digital deception and proposed suggestions to prevent it. This study theoretically proposes online IDT and offers practical suggestions for preventing digital deception, bearing both theoretical and practical significance."

We conducted three online experiments ( N = 3,978), exposing participants to fact-checks identified as either human-generated or AI-assisted, simulating cases where AI fully generates the fact-check or automatically retrieves human fact-checks. Our findings indicate that the persuasive effect of fact-checking, specifically in increasing truth discernment, persists even among participants without a positive prior attitude toward AI. Additionally, in some cases, awareness of AI’s role reduced perceived political bias in fact-checks among Republicans. Finally, neither AI-generated nor human fact-checks significantly affected participants’ feelings toward or their perceptions of the competence of the targeted politicians."

To fill this void, this study takes a social compensation approach to exploring dating app users’ burnout experiences (i.e., emotional exhaustion, inefficacy, and depersonalization) over time. Four hundred ninety-three active single dating app users were surveyed over four waves across 12 weeks, with a final sample of 190. Multilevel growth curve models showed that dating app users experienced increased emotional exhaustion and inefficacy over time. Furthermore, depression, anxiety, and loneliness predicted more emotional exhaustion and inefficacy, while problematic dating app use predicted more emotional exhaustion and less inefficacy. The results suggest that dating apps may exacerbate existing difficulties with relationship initiation among vulnerable users by increasing their risk of burnout. Dating app burnout is a potential intervention target to improve users’ dating success."

We also examined the politicization effect by contrasting the United States and South Korea. Findings revealed that U.S. conservatives consuming broadcasted information exhibited stronger climate change beliefs, linking to increased risk perception and pro-environmental actions. However, YouTube did not show a significant association with beliefs in climate change, and neither did political orientation significantly moderate this relationship. In South Korea, political orientation did not play a significant role in the associations between YouTube and broadcast news use on climate change belief. Further theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Which type of online comments appeal to Chinese netizens? Using a survey experimental design, we examine the appeal of 4 distinct types of online comments on certain policies. We find that our survey respondents spend significantly more time in consuming emotional comments that deviate from official discourse. When it comes to the effect on attitude, however, we find that deviating-emotional comments are no more persuasive than deviating-informational comments.

Our knowledge about how citizens perceive and respond to polycrisis is limited. This paper presents a preregistered survey experiment from Denmark with 4,017 nationally representative respondents. We study crisis perceptions and willingness to act for the climate and Ukraine after concurrently priming both issues. Overall, threat perceptions increase, but so does inaction. Climate change drives increases in threat perception and worry, while the war in Ukraine drives a reduction in willingness to act and pay. The results challenge the “finite pool of worry” hypothesis, which presupposes that worry about new, urgent threats will crowd out worry about existing problems, especially in the case of climate change. Rather, willingness to act under polycrisis is issue-specific and shaped by concrete pocketbook costs, as the experimental evidence illustrates. The results also have important policy implications at a time when decision-makers frequently justify political action through polycrisis discourse."

To overcome some of these problems, the article introduces a new academic web tracking solution, WebTrack, an open-source tracking tool maintained by a major European research institution, GESIS. The design logic, the interfaces, and the backend requirements for WebTrack are discussed, followed by a detailed examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the tool. Finally, using data from 1,185 participants, the article empirically illustrates how an improvement in data collection through WebTrack leads to innovative shifts in the use of tracking data. As WebTrack allows for collecting the content people are exposed to beyond the classical news platforms, it can greatly improve the detection of politics-related information consumption in tracking data through automated content analysis compared to traditional approaches that rely on the source-level analysis."

    "abstract": "This article poses a simple question: can AI lie? In response to this question, the article examines, as its point of inquiry, popular AI chatbots, such as, ChatGPT. In doing so, an examination of the psychoanalytic, philosophical, and technological significance of AI and its complexities are located in relation to the dynamics of truth, falsity, and deception. That is, by critically considering the chatbot’s ability to engage in natural language conversations and provide contextually relevant responses, it is argued that what separates the AI chatbot from anthropocentric debates, which allude to some form of conscious recognition on behalf of AI, is the importance of the lie – an importance which a psychoanalytic approach can reveal. Indeed, while AI technologies can undoubtedly blur the line between lies and truth-speaking, in the case of the AI chatbot, it is detailed how such technology remains unable to lie authentically or, in other words, is unable to lie like a human. For psychoanalysis, the capacity to lie bears witness to the unconscious and, thus, plays an important role in determining the subject. It is for this reason that rather than uncritically accepting the chatbot’s authority – an authority that is easily reflected in its honest responses and frank admissions – a psychoanalytic (Lacanian) perspective can highlight the significance of the unconscious as a distorting factor in determining the subject. To help elucidate this argument, specific attention is given to introducing and applying Lacan’s subject of enunciation and subject of the enunciated. This is used to assert that what continues (for now) to set us apart from AI technology is not necessarily our ‘better knowledge’ but our capability to consciously engage in acts of falsehood that function to reveal the social nuances and significances of the lie."

The behaviourally informed chatbot more than tripled COVID-19 vaccine uptake compared with the control group (a 1.6 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (1.36 pp, 1.77 pp)) and nearly doubled uptake compared with the one-way message reminder (a 1 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (0.83 pp, 1.17 pp)). Communications tools designed with behaviourally informed functionalities that simplify the vaccine user journey can increase vaccination more than traditional message reminders and may have applications to other health behaviours."

    "abstract": "Dishonest behaviours such as tax evasion impose significant societal costs. Ex ante honesty oaths—commitments to honesty before action—have been proposed as interventions to counteract dishonest behaviour, but the heterogeneity in findings across operationalizations calls their effectiveness into question. We tested 21 honesty oaths (including a baseline oath)—proposed, evaluated and selected by 44 expert researchers—and a no-oath condition in a megastudy involving 21,506 UK and US participants from Prolific.com who played an incentivized tax evasion game online. Of the 21 interventions, 10 significantly improved tax compliance by 4.5 to 8.5 percentage points, with the most successful nearly halving tax evasion. Limited evidence for moderators was found. Experts and laypeople failed to predict the most effective interventions, though experts’ predictions were more accurate. In conclusion, honesty oaths were effective in curbing dishonesty, but their effectiveness varied depending on content. These findings can help design impactful interventions to curb dishonesty."

    "abstract": "Finding agreement through a free exchange of views is often difficult. Collective deliberation can be slow, difficult to scale, and unequally attentive to different voices. In this study, we trained an artificial intelligence (AI) to mediate human deliberation. Using participants’ personal opinions and critiques, the AI mediator iteratively generates and refines statements that express common ground among the group on social or political issues. Participants ( N = 5734) preferred AI-generated statements to those written by human mediators, rating them as more informative, clear, and unbiased. Discussants often updated their views after the deliberation, converging on a shared perspective. Text embeddings revealed that successful group statements incorporated dissenting voices while respecting the majority position. These findings were replicated in a virtual citizens’ assembly involving a demographically representative sample of the UK population."
