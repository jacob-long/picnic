    "abstract": "This study introduces the Dynamic Intermediary Model (D[X]IM) to address how knowledge processes have evolved with digital platforms by shifting from a dyadic to a triadic communication model of content flow with a potential intermediary. This intermediary, which can be a journalist, influencer, artificial agent, or another platform actor, provides services to the source and recipient of a message, thereby transforming traditional direct communication. It aims to better understand information diffusion in the networked public sphere by recognizing the intermediary’s role in altering source-recipient dynamics. The D[X]IM applies across different communication levels (macro, meso, and micro) and is designed for empirical research using diverse methodologies. It focuses on single instances of platform communication to explore the impact of intermediated communication. The article concludes with a research agenda and examples of how D[X]IM can be applied in empirical research.",

    "authors": "Yuchi Anthony Chen, Catalina L Toma",
    "abstract": "Social media activities do not occur in isolation, and it is possible that the well-being effects of an initial activity modify the effects of a subsequent one. This article examines this possibility by focusing on a specific, theoretically grounded sequence of social media activities: engaging with one’s own profile self-presentation (i.e., a self-affirmational activity) followed by browsing a superior peer’s profile (i.e., an activity eliciting upward social comparison). Two pre-registered experiments were conducted. Study 1 confirmed that both reviewing and crafting one’s own Instagram self-presentation provided self-affirmational benefits, reducing participants’ defensiveness and inducing positive affect. Study 2 showed that becoming self-affirmed by engaging with one’s own Instagram self-presentation diminished feelings of envy resulting from browsing a superior peer’s self-presentation. By conceptualizing and empirically testing the interdependence of social media activities, this research offers a framework for examining how sequences of social media activities jointly shape users’ psychological experiences.",

    "authors": "Xining Liao",
    "abstract": "Abstract: The present study explores how moral and threat language in news media influences public opinion within the context of the US–China relationship. Drawing on Moral Foundations Theory and Intergroup Threat Theory, I employed a computational approach combining the dictionary method with Large Language Models to identify moral and threat language in coverage of China by six major US news outlets from 2005 to 2022. I then analyzed the relationship between distinct types of moral and threat language and longitudinal polling data on Americans’ attitudes toward China. The results reveal a unified pattern: both liberal- and conservative-leaning outlets employed more binding than individualizing moral language, and emphasized realistic threats over symbolic threats when covering China. However, it is symbolic threat language that more strongly correlates with negative attitudes toward China. Furthermore, realistic threat language only predicted negative attitudes when accompanied by sufficient levels of moral language, with this relationship intensifying as moral language increased. The findings offer insights into the moral and threat dimensions of foreign news and public opinion towards foreign countries, highlighting a critical and complex interplay between these elements in a global context.",

    "authors": "Magdalena Wischnewski, Nicole Krämer",
    "abstract": "Abstract: In this study, we examine how readers perceive the credibility of polarizing news purportedly written by a machine. In particular, we study whether a machine attribution can decrease the polarization inflicted by the self-confirmation bias. To that end, we expect that attitude-confirming polarizing news is perceived as less credible when attributed to a machine than when attributed to a human author. We assume this is due to the lower source credibility of machines and less emotional involvement. In a preregistered online experiment, we presented N = 508 participants with a polarizing news article attributed either to a human author or a machine. The article also either confirmed or disconfirmed participants’ attitudes towards the polarizing issue. Our results show that participants did not differentiate between human and machine-attributed news. Moreover, we found no evidence that machine-attributed news affected the self-confirmation bias. However, we found that, while machine authors were perceived equally competent as human authors, they were perceived as less trustworthy. In addition, we found that the machine attribution induced less emotional involvement in terms of experienced enthusiasm but not experienced anger.",

    "abstract": "Co-present smartphone use—the use of smartphones in the presence of others—is a prevalent behavior in social contexts. However, the situational mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. While previous research has primarily conceptualized co-present smartphone use as a stable individual disposition and focused on person-level determinants, the role of specific situational characteristics has remained largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, the present study investigates co-present smartphone use from a situational perspective, aiming to gain insights into the situational predictors of co-present smartphone use. We conducted an experience sampling study with 87 participants, reporting on 829 social interactions to examine how co-present use is linked to different types of connection cues (technical, spatial, and mental). The findings show that a person's smartphone use during an interaction is related to the smartphone use of others present and the number of notifications received.",

    "authors": "Waqas Ejaz, Mary Sanford, Richard Fletcher",
    "abstract": "Despite the importance of climate news in shaping public engagement, little is known about how different types of media – mainstream and non-mainstream – relate to pro-climate behaviour, and what psychological processes condition these effects, particularly in cross-national contexts. This study addresses that gap by examining the emotional and evaluative mechanisms linking climate news use to pro-climate behavioural intentions (e.g., using less energy at home, flying less often, and repairing rather than replacing), and how these relationships vary across countries. Drawing on online survey data from 8,541 respondents across eight countries – Brazil, France, Germany, India, Japan, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, and the United States – we test a multi-group structural equation model with climate anxiety as a mediator and media trust as a moderator. Results show that mainstream news use is consistently associated with stronger behavioural intent across all countries. Non-mainstream media use has positive but more context-dependent effects, especially in settings where digital platforms dominate climate information. Climate anxiety emerges as a robust and universal predictor of behavioural intention, though it is not consistently shaped by media use – indicating that emotional responses may stem from sources beyond the news. Media trust amplifies the direct effects of mainstream news use but does not moderate the indirect pathway via anxiety. Overall, the findings reveal a surprising degree of cross-national consistency in how news use, media trust, and emotional responses shape climate engagement.",

While most extant work has focused on voters’ social identities and their related, expressive considerations about the social bases of parties, this article directs attention to two other considerations that may also influence the vote: voters’ evaluations of social groups, as suggested by reference group theory, and their instrumental considerations about the extent to which parties work to advance the interests of specific groups. Using both an observational ( N = 2,065) and a preregistered experimental study ( N = 7,090) about voter evaluations of social classes and the extent to which parties are seen as fighting for them in Denmark, the study shows how these considerations influence party choice over and above the influence of identity-based considerations. Thereby, the study is the first to show experimental evidence for the effect of group evaluations on vote choice.",

    "abstract": "Drone strikes are a fixture of US counter-terrorism policy, often advertised as ‘surgical’ alternatives to ground operations. Drone strikes’ effects, however, are less precise than proponents suggest. Using data from over 12 billion call detail records from Yemen between 2010 and 2012, we show that the US drone campaign significantly disrupted civilian lives in previously-unmeasured ways. Strikes cause large increases in civilian mobility away from affected areas and create immediate, durable displacement: mobility among nearby individuals increases 24 percent on strike days, and average distance from the strike region increases steadily for over a month afterward, signifying prolonged displacement for thousands of individuals. Strikes are disruptive regardless of whether they kill civilians, though effects are larger after civilian casualties. Our findings suggest that even carefully targeted drone campaigns generate collateral disruption that has not been weighed in public debate or policy decisions about the costs and benefits of drone warfare.",

    "abstract": "Debates about the nature of a deepening educational divide in politics tend to focus on education as an individual-level characteristic, whether as a marker of skill endowment, an experience instilling certain values, or the consequence of self-selection based on earlier socialization. We instead look at how education (both level and field) relates to political outcome variables as a feature of social networks. We take cleavage-theoretical perspectives on the educational divide one step further by treating individuals not as atomistic entities but as embedded in social structure. Using original surveys from Germany, the UK, and Switzerland, we show that educational divides are diminished in the presence of countervailing networks. Looking at vote preference and indicators of social closure like group identity, this study suggests that segregated social networks contribute to stabilizing contemporary cleavage structures, even as the mass social and political organizations that shaped twentieth century cleavage politics have declined.",

    "abstract": "Outliers commonly arise in real situations, particularly in small areas where outliers could occur due to model errors or survey errors. In this study, we investigate a robust approach for handling outliers in a multivariate small area model, where there are multiple response variables of interest. Specifically, we consider the multivariate Fay-Herriot (MFH) model, which commonly assumes multivariate normal distributions for area random effects and sampling errors. However, it is known that the normality assumption is usually sensitive to outliers or data with heavy tails. Therefore, we propose the multivariate t-distribution as the alternative underlying distribution, called the Mt-FH model. We also construct parameter estimation methods for the model by considering generalizations of the likelihood function and the EM algorithm to enhance the accuracy and avoid computational issues. In particular, we propose two parameter estimation methods for the model based on the (profile) Lq-likelihood approach and the expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm, called the MLq-ECM and profile MLq-ECM. We conduct a simulation study to investigate the efficiency of the Mt-FH model and the (profile) MLq-ECM methods in handling outliers and deviations of the data from the normality assumption. The outlier patterns considered in our study are the mean shift and variance shift patterns. The simulation results based on biases and mean squared errors suggest that the Mt-FH models can improve the MFH model in the presence of outliers. Finally, we assess the performance of the Mt-FH model through an analysis of the welfare variables in Thailand. The results based on the AIC and the percentage reduction of the MSE estimator highlight the advantages of the Mt-FH model over the MFH model. Furthermore, the integration of the MLq-ECM approach further strengthens the performance of the Mt-FH model.",

    "authors": "Emma Zaal, John Hoeks, Yfke Ongena",
    "abstract": "Social Desirability Bias (SDB), providing a favorable image of oneself in self-reports, is a persistent problem in survey research on sensitive topics. However, face-saving approaches appear promising in discouraging SDB. Specifically, face-saving survey item formulations aim to reduce the threat of judgment for norm-violations, thereby fostering a safer context for self-disclosure. This experimental study examined the use of face-saving to elicit more truthful responses to yes/no questions using a quota sample representative of the Dutch population. We included face-saving preambles that excused for or normalized sensitive behaviors (e.g., “It can easily happen that the limit for legal driving is exceeded when consuming alcohol”). We also included face-saving response options using degrees of truth (“occasionally”) or justifications for norm transgressions (e.g., “only when there was no other option”). There were three objectives. First, the design included a replication of a face-saving study regarding COVID-19, where we assessed the efficacy of a condition that combined a face-saving preamble with face-saving answer options (N = 303) against a control condition without any face-saving elements (N = 284). Second, we extended the replication’s design by including conditions to measure the effects of offering face-saving preambles (N = 281) and offering face-saving answer options in isolation (N = 283). Third, we investigated the effectiveness of face-saving using novel operationalizations on additional topics, including sustainability and responsible driving. The replication confirmed the effectiveness of the combined face-saving strategy. The extension that included all conditions (Ntotal = 1,151) revealed that offering face-saving answer options reduced SDB significantly, up to 23 percent. There was no main effect of including a preamble, nor was there an interaction effect of the two manipulations. These findings highlight the critical role that face-saving response options might play in improving the accuracy of self-reported data, while calling into question the usefulness of including face-saving preambles.",

However, whether ideological differences exist in views on the progressivity of social programs’ policy designs remains ambiguous. Using a conjoint experiment, I investigate how the progressivity of social programs’ distributional outcomes and tax sources impacts Americans’ social policy support. I find differences and similarities in the effects of progressive social policy designs on different ideological subgroups. Compared to conservatives, liberals are more supportive of social programs having progressive distributional results or tax sources and less supportive of social policies featuring regressive distributional consequences or tax sources. However, both liberals and conservatives prefer progressive social programs over those with regressive designs. This study helps explain the public’s preferences for social policies with progressive designs.",

This thriving literature—dealing with research on political stereotypes and projection around sociodemographic, psychological, and lifestyle traits—is disconnected and needs to be placed under a unifying framework. To achieve this, we introduce “Politicultural Linking,” a concept subsuming political inferences from apolitical cues and apolitical inferences from political cues. Through an extensive literature review of the works produced since 2009, we discuss and classify research on this topic, identifying common features, strengths, and weaknesses, and depicting a comprehensive conceptual framework. Moreover, we identify relevant gaps in the literature: the underexploration of inferences involving lifestyle preferences, the overrepresentation of US-based studies, the overlooked role of projection, and the lack of non-survey-based research. Consequently, we aim to set the agenda for future studies on this topic.",

    "abstract": "The rise of the “religious nones” has garnered significant interest among journalists and scholars. Whereas very few people reported that they were not affiliated with an established religious tradition just 20 years ago, currently as many as 30 percent of Americans claim no religion when asked their religious preference on public opinion surveys. This seismic shift in the religious composition of the country precipitates important questions about the attitudes, group identity, and political participation of religious nones in response to contemporary issues. In this paper, we present the results of a novel survey experiment (N = 1,013) designed to determine if issue and identity cues increase religious nones’ sense of group identification, group consciousness, linked fate, and willingness to engage in political behavior. We leverage a unique large-scale sample of nonreligious Americans to facilitate these tests. Our results suggest that relevant political messaging does little to activate collective identification or political engagement among the nonreligious. Our findings have important implications for the future of American politics, even as the number of religiously unaffiliated people continues to grow.",

We analyze a year-long, random sample of submissions and comments scored with established computational measures of incivility, and we link these scores to subreddit-level rule regimes and identity signaling. By distinguishing interpersonal impoliteness from democratic norm violations and by evaluating moderation complexity at the community level, this work clarifies when and how community governance relates to discourse quality and participation dynamics on Reddit.

Quantifying the uncertainty of such predictions is rarely considered, partly because prediction intervals are not defined for many of the algorithms used. However, generating and reporting prediction models without information on the uncertainty of the predictions carries the risk of overinterpreting their accuracy. Conventional methods for prediction intervals (e.g., those defined for ordinary least squares regression) are sensitive to violations of several distributional assumptions. In this tutorial, we introduce conformal prediction, a model-agnostic, distribution-free method for generating prediction intervals with guaranteed marginal coverage, to psychological research. We start by introducing the basic rationale of prediction intervals using a motivating example. Then, we proceed to conformal prediction, which is illustrated in three increasingly complex examples using publicly available data and R code.",

    "title": "Partisan or Principled? Explaining Political Differences in Attitudes About Violations of Democratic Norms",
    "authors": "Paul E. Teas",
    "abstract": "Although both Democrats and Republicans tend to be more tolerant of democratic norm violations that benefit their own party, this pattern is not always symmetrical, even when political stakes appear identical. Two experiments ( N = 2,352) tested competing explanations: that partisans differ in democratic commitment, their tendency to rationalize violations as legitimate, or the values they prioritize (e.g., voter access vs. election integrity). Both parties rationalized weaker opposition to beneficial violations as more democratic. However, Republicans in Study 1 were more responsive to partisan advantage without showing similarly greater democratic rationalization and more tolerant of mail-in voting restrictions regardless of partisan benefit. These differences disappeared in Study 2 when different violations were tested, suggesting such asymmetries are issue-specific rather than fixed. Overall, the findings suggest that partisan gaps in support for democratic norm violations reflect the politicization of particular practices more than stable differences in commitment to democracy.",

    "title": "Why more social interactions lead to more polarization in societies",
    "authors": "Stefan Thurner, Markus Hofer, Jan Korbel",
    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the number of close social connections increased substantially, at least by a factor of two. At the same time, societal opinions have become increasingly polarized in many Western countries. To explore whether these trends could be connected, we employ a simple computational model of society, where people—within their social networks—continuously compare and update their opinions. Here, we show that the model that is known to realistically capture both homophily and social balance exhibits a phase transition phenomenon where, above a critical social connectivity, an explosive transition toward strong polarization must occur. The model allows us to understand the empirical inflation of polarization during the last decades as a function of the observed increased values of social connectivity. In the presence of a small fraction of synchronized influencers, the transition becomes continuous; however, polarization then appears at lower connectivities. We discuss the implications of the presence of a phase transition in social polarization.",

    "title": "Divergent patterns of engagement with partisan and low-quality news across seven social media platforms",
    "authors": "Mohsen Mosleh, Jennifer Allen, David G. Rand",
    "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically X/Twitter, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here, we shed light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: X/Twitter, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sample, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right-wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative news posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts, consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: Across all platforms examined, a given user’s lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement, even though higher-quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds when accounting for poster-level variation and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting that user preferences—not algorithmic bias—may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",
