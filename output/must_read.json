    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been used to aid in deception detection and to simulate human data in social scientific research. Thus, it is important to consider how well these tools can inform both enterprises. We report 12 studies, accessed through the Viewpoints.ai research platform, where AI (gemini-1.5-flash) made veracity judgments of humans. We systematically varied the nature and duration of the communication, modality, truth-lie base rate, and AI persona. AI performed best (57.7%) when detecting truths and lies involving feelings about friends, although it was notably truth-biased (71.7%). However, in assessing cheating interrogations, AI was lie-biased by judging more than three-quarters of interviewees as cheating liars. In assessing interviews where humans perform at rates over 70%, accuracy plummeted to 15.9% with an ecological base-rate. AI yielded results different from prior human studies and therefore, we caution using certain large language models for lie detection.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of an accent rating study of Welsh in which 59 raters were asked to listen to speech samples of three speaker groups (Welsh home language speakers, immersion education learners, and adult learners). The study aimed to ascertain (a) whether these groups are identifiable based on their accents, (b) how raters evaluate the three speaker groups socially, and (c) what phonetic features they associate with them. The results revealed that all groups could be identified well above chance and received positive social evaluations. However, traditional speakers were correctly identified significantly more often and were perceived more favorably in the social evaluations. In the feature analysis, new speakers’ accents were largely described as deviant from traditional speakers’ although some distinctive patterns were also identified. These findings have important implications for discussions surrounding accent bias and the perception of new speakers’ accents in the context of minority language revitalization.",

    "abstract": "Despite an upsurge in social media studies, little is known about how cabinet ministers balance their multiple professional roles—as ministry heads, cabinet members, and party politicians—on social media platforms. In this article, we first develop an analytical framework, grounded in the principal–agent theory and earlier research on political communication, that differentiates between cabinet ministers’ different communicative roles as well as different communicative purposes on social media. Second, we add to the growing literature on government communication and social media by applying this framework to analyze Norwegian cabinet ministers’ social media communication. The data is based on a manual content analysis of 1,062 Facebook posts and an expansion of this data using machine learning to cover all the Facebook communication of all ministers from the Solberg cabinet (2013–2021). Based on almost 20,000 posts, the results indicate that social media caters to ministers’ needs both as party politicians and as heads of ministries, as Norwegian cabinet ministers use social media in two key ways: to inform as ministry heads and to brand themselves as party politicians. Further, we find that private self-personalization increases audience engagement. The results suggest that social media accentuates the party-political dimension of the cabinet minister’s role, thereby indicating potential consequences for government communication, cabinet unity, and decision-making that warrant further exploration.",

    "authors": "Sarah Lutz, Frank M. Schneider, Annabell Halfmann, Anna Freytag, Dorothée Hefner",
    "abstract": "In a digitally connected world, the perceived expectation to always stay available via mobile messenger services places unique demands on users. This paper addresses the question of how and when so-called availability pressure leads to variations in messenger users’ well-/ill-being. Drawing on the Integrative Model of Mobile Media Use and Need Experiences, it conceptualizes the satisfaction versus frustration of fundamental needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) as mediators and the health-promoting personality trait mindfulness as a moderator. This model was tested across a 7-day-long diary study ( N = 229) and a 2-factorial online experiment ( N = 166). Both pre-registered studies are in line with the model's assumption that availability pressure can lead to specific need experiences, which in turn predict different facets of well-/ill-being. Although we identified limited moderating effects, being mindful (Study 1) and cultivating mindfulness (Study 2) were positively related to need satisfaction and well-being and negatively related to need frustration and ill-being. This highlights the complex consequences of availability pressure and the importance of individual coping mechanisms. Future research should refine theoretical models like the Integrative Model of Mobile Media Use and Need Experiences and explore additional health-promoting personality traits to better understand digital well-being in the era of mobile connectivity.",

In this study, we attempt to provide a broad systemic analysis of fandom, using a survey of 4874 fans who use the fan fiction posting site, Archive of Our Own. Through our analysis, we examine the interplay of fan identity with their practices: what type of romantic content fans prefer and which platforms fans prefer to use. We find that both romantic content and platform preference are shaped by fans’ identities, which provides important insights into broad patterns of how identity impacts behavior among fan fiction writers and readers across fandoms.",

Using a 2 (news bias: liberal vs conservative) × 4 (comment bias: liberal, conservative, mixed, or apolitical) between-subjects experimental design, the study reveals that commenters are more susceptible to news bias that cues the issue stance of their preferred party. In contrast, lurkers are more affected by comment bias, interpreting comments as indicator of the general public opinion climate. These findings suggest a cascading process, wherein news bias influences commenters’ opinions, and commenters’ posts subsequently shape lurkers’ perceptions. Two cognitive mechanisms underlie these effects: Partisan cue-taking explains the influence of news bias on commenters, whereas the bandwagon heuristic accounts for the impact of comment bias on lurkers. This study highlights the multi-layered nature of public opinion formation in digitized news environments.",

    "abstract": "Following the end of the Cold War, the rise of democracy and globalization fostered optimism about global cooperation and economic integration but also sparked debates on equity, leading to challenges such as economic disparities, cultural displacement, and populist movements. Collective narcissism, a concept introduced to understand self-identity and politics amid perceived threats to status, describes beliefs that the in-group is exceptional but lacks external recognition and is associated with adverse outcomes. Drawing from the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects, this study investigates collective narcissism expressions on social media, focusing on the “Stop the Steal” movement after the 2020 US Presidential Election. Analyzing 11,836 original posts and their conversation threads, we studied the nature of collective narcissistic expression and its contagion effects. Results highlight national identity as a central theme, showing that such expressions spread through increased user engagement and are contagious from original posts to replies.",

The way in which media coverage (re)produces genders may affect individual and collective thinking and the perceptions of women in society. We analyse the representation of female scientists in German news media coverage of eight science-related risk issues and compare male and female experts regarding their relative scientific reputation, the number of references and the content of their statements. Our findings show that female scientific experts are less visible in German media coverage than their male colleagues and that they are underrepresented compared to the respective proportions in the relevant research areas. At the same time, our data relativize the extent of the gender visibility gap – after controlling for hierarchical position and scientific reputation, the differences become rather small. We find no evidence of discrimination against female scientific experts through journalistic selection routines.",

For those who noticed the disclosure, both brief and fuller depictions of a study’s preprint status enhanced the credibility of the reporting and the scientists behind the research. However, perceiving the science to be uncertain negatively mediated the effects of preprint disclosure on credibility appraisals among Republicans.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates change in international migrants’ political attitudes. It theorizes a novel attitudinal typology distinguishing polity‐specific attitudes influenced by national contexts and transnational attitudes forged by migratory experience. It applies the typology to four dimensions of political competition in contemporary Europe: redistribution, homosexuality, European integration, and immigration. The paper tests the new theory using cross‐sectional and panel data spanning nearly 380,000 observations from 104 sending and 28 destination countries. It introduces a new strategy to model cross‐classified hierarchical data, addresses issues inherent to group comparison, and pioneers two empirical inquiries into migrants’ self‐selection. The results show that migration prompts the acculturation of polity‐specific attitudes and the cosmopolitanization of transnational attitudes. Migrants adopt their host countries’ attitudes toward redistribution and homosexuality while developing a uniquely liberal outlook on European integration and immigration. These findings carry major implications for our understanding of attitudinal change and the dimensionality of the ideological space.",

    "authors": "Fabian Guy Neuner",
    "abstract": "Scholars increasingly conceptualize populism by whether politicians use people-centric and anti-elite appeals that pit a homogeneous people against a corrupt elite. These appeals reflect “thin” ideology because they offer no programmatic content and thus politicians must pair these appeals with more substantive positions, termed their “host” (or thick) ideology, which often consists of nativism on the right (e.g., espousing anti-immigrant positions) and socialism on the left (e.g., prioritizing redistribution). An emerging literature has thus sought to estimate whether populists garner support due to their thin ideology or their substantive host ideology. To date, no research has validated whether populism treatments (1) truly operationalize populist thin ideology, and (2) do so without manipulating host ideology. Results from three conjoint validation experiments fielded in both the United States and the United Kingdom show that thin ideology treatments successfully manipulate the underlying concepts but caution that some operationalizations also affect perceptions of host ideology.",

    "abstract": "This article constructs an approach to analyzing longitudinal panel data which combines topological data analysis (TDA) and generative AI applied to graph neural networks (GNNs). TDA is deployed to identify and analyze unobserved topological heterogeneities of a dataset. TDA-extracted information is quantified into a set of measures, called functional principal components. These measures are used to analyze the data in four ways. First, the measures are construed as moderators of the data and their statistical effects are estimated through a Bayesian framework. Second, the measures are used as factors to classify the data into topological classes using generative AI applied to GNNs constructed by transforming the data into graphs. The classification uncovers patterns in the data which are otherwise not accessible through statistical approaches. Third, the measures are used as factors that condition the extraction of latent variables of the data through a deployment of a generative AI model. Fourth, the measures are used as labels for classifying the graphs into classes used to offer a GNN-based effective dimensionality reduction of the original data. The article uses a portion of the militarized international disputes (MIDs) dataset (from 1946 to 2010) as a running example to briefly illustrate its ideas and steps.",

Utilizing data from the 2024 American National Election Studies pre-election survey, the analysis highlights political knowledge's dual roles—as both a potential catalyst for partisan animosity and a critical resource promoting democratic stability. Consistent with recent research, more politically knowledgeable individuals tend to express intensified negative feelings toward opposing political parties, and this tendency is particularly pronounced among individuals who attach less importance to their partisan identity. In the meantime, increased political knowledge is also significantly associated with reduced condonation of political violence, particularly among those who perceive their partisan identity as highly central to their self-concept. These findings highlight the dual-edged, context-dependent nature of political knowledge, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of its implications in contemporary democratic societies.",

    "abstract": "Health-related misinformation is widespread online and can adversely affect public well-being. This study examines whether media literacy can effectively combat health misinformation by influencing key stages of the misinformation process: initial credibility discernment, sharing decisions, and response to corrections. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in China with 693 respondents, assessing their ability to discern misinformation (using both mean-rating difference and receiver operating characteristic–based methods), willingness to share information, and continued belief in misinformation after corrections. Results indicated that higher media literacy was associated with better credibility discernment of health information. Media literacy did not significantly associate with sharing discernment; however, respondents with higher media literacy scores exhibited a stronger continued influence effect. Additionally, participants with greater credibility discernment were more discerning in sharing information, although neither discernment index was related to the magnitude of the continued influence effect. These findings highlight a double-edged sword: while media literacy enhances the recognition of false information, it may also engender confidence that makes individuals less receptive to valid corrections. Interventions aiming to combat health misinformation should account for both the beneficial and potentially counterproductive effects of media literacy. The widespread dissemination of health misinformation on the Internet has a detrimental effect on people's lives.",

This study investigates the relationship between selective and incidental exposure and political tolerance in the United States. Findings reveal that frequent selective exposure on social media is associated with lower political tolerance. In contrast, frequent incidental exposure is linked to higher political tolerance. Notably, political network diversity on social media serves as a moderator for incidental exposure, as its positive relationship with political tolerance is observed only among individuals with highly diverse political networks. However, it does not moderate for selective exposure. These findings suggest that two distinct forms of social media exposure are associated with dual patterns, indicating that while selective exposure is linked to a lack of political acceptance, incidental exposure—particularly when occurring within politically diverse social media networks—is associated with increased political tolerance. We conclude by discussing the (un)democratic implications of these findings.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing over-time dyadic data can be challenging, particularly when using multilevel models with complex random-effect structures. In this tutorial, we discuss the best practices of model specification for longitudinal dyadic multilevel modeling, providing a practical guide to specifying (and respecifying) random effects with both theoretical and practical considerations in mind. We begin by defining random effects in the context of repeated-measures dyadic data and address common issues such as nonconvergence. Then, using two models—the dyadic growth-curve and the stability and influence model—we demonstrate how to apply these guidelines in both SAS and R. The dyadic growth-curve model provides a straightforward example, whereas the stability and influence model illustrates common challenges when dealing with complex random-effect structures and convergence issues. In the first exercise, we explain how to customize the variance-covariance matrix for these analyses in SAS. In the second exercise, we adapt these analyses for R and discuss how to implement the sum-and-difference approach for indistinguishable dyads.
