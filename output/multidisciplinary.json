          "authors": "Bharat B. Biswal, Lucina Q. Uddin",
          "abstract": "Since the discovery of resting-state functional connectivity in the human brain, this neuroimaging approach has revolutionized the study of neural architecture. Once considered noise, the functional significance of spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations across large-scale brain networks has now been investigated in more than 25,000 publications. In this Review, we provide a historical overview and thoughts regarding potential future directions for resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) research, highlighting the most informative analytic approaches that have been developed to reveal the brain’s intrinsic spatiotemporal organization. We review the collaborative efforts that have led to the widespread use of rsfMRI in neuroscience, with an emphasis on methodological innovations that have been made possible by contributions from electrical and biomedical engineering, physics, mathematics and computer science. We focus on key theoretical and methodological advances that will be necessary for further progress in the field, highlighting the need for further integration with new developments in whole-brain computational modelling, more sophisticated approaches to brain–behaviour mapping, greater mechanistic insights from concurrent measurement of neurophysiology, and greater appreciation of the problem of generalization failure in machine learning applications. We propose that rsfMRI has the potential for even greater clinical relevance when it is fully integrated with population neuroscience and global health initiatives in the service of precision psychiatry.",

          "title": "The pivot penalty in research",
          "authors": "Ryan Hill, Yian Yin, Carolyn Stein, Xizhao Wang, Dashun Wang, Benjamin F. Jones",
          "abstract": "Scientists and inventors set the direction of their work amid evolving questions, opportunities and challenges, yet the understanding of pivots between research areas and their outcomes remains limited1,2,3,4,5. Theories of creative search highlight the potential benefits of exploration but also emphasize difficulties in moving beyond one’s expertise6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we introduce a measurement framework to quantify how far researchers move from their existing work, and apply it to millions of papers and patents. We find a pervasive ‘pivot penalty’, in which the impact of new research steeply declines the further a researcher moves from their previous work. The pivot penalty applies nearly universally across science and patenting, and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. Larger pivots further exhibit weak engagement with established mixtures of prior knowledge, lower publication success rates and less market impact. Unexpected shocks to the research landscape, which may push researchers away from existing areas or pull them into new ones, further demonstrate substantial pivot penalties, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pivot penalty generalizes across fields, career stage, productivity, collaboration and funding contexts, highlighting both the breadth and depth of the adaptive challenge. Overall, the findings point to large and increasing challenges in effectively adapting to new opportunities and threats, with implications for individual researchers, research organizations, science policy and the capacity of science and society as a whole to confront emergent demands.",

          "abstract": "Self-recognition is a fundamental cellular process across evolution and forms the basis of neuronal self-avoidance1,2,3,4. Clustered protocadherin (cPcdh) proteins, which comprise a large family of isoform-specific homophilic recognition molecules, have a pivotal role in the neuronal self-avoidance that is required for mammalian brain development5,6,7. The probabilistic expression of different cPcdh isoforms confers unique identities on neurons and forms the basis for neuronal processes to discriminate between self and non-self5,6,8. Whether this self-recognition mechanism also exists in astrocytes remains unknown. Here we report that γC3, a specific isoform in the Pcdhγ family, is enriched in human and mouse astrocytes. Using genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that γC3 acts autonomously to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse visual cortex. To determine whether γC3 proteins act by promoting recognition between processes of the same astrocyte, we generated pairs of γC3 chimeric proteins that are capable of heterophilic binding to each other, but incapable of homophilic binding. Co-expression of complementary heterophilic binding isoform pairs in the same γC3-null astrocyte restored normal morphology. By contrast, chimeric γC3 proteins individually expressed in single γC3-null mutant astrocytes did not. These data establish that self-recognition mediated by γC3 contributes to astrocyte development in the mammalian brain.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemistry is undergoing a resurgence in synthetic chemistry and boasts compelling advantages1. Repurposing natural enzymes through synthetic chemical strategies holds significant promise for exploring new chemical space2-6. Elegant strategies, including directed evolution7-10, artificial enzymes11, and photoenzymatic catalysis12,13 have demonstrated their capacities for expanding the applications of enzymes in both academia and industry. However, the integration of electrochemistry with enzymes has primarily been limited to replicating previously established enzyme functions14-16. Key challenges in achieving new enzyme reactivity with electricity include compatibility issues and difficulties in heterogeneous electron transfer. Here we report the reshaping of thiamine-dependent enzymes with ferrocene-mediated electrocatalysis to unlock an unnatural dynamic kinetic oxidation of α-branched aldehydes. This robust electroenzymatic approach yields various bioactive (S)-profens with up to 99% enantiomeric excess, is applicable with whole cells overexpressing the enzyme and using down to 0.05 mol% enzyme loadings. Mechanistic investigations reveal multiple functions of the electroenzyme in the precise substrate discrimination, accelerating racemization, and facilitating kinetically matched electron transfer events.",

Excess mROS production has been associated with several disease states2,3; however, the precise sources, regulation and mechanism of generation in vivo remain unclear, which limits translational efforts. Here we show that in obesity, hepatic coenzyme Q (CoQ) synthesis is impaired, which increases the CoQH2 to CoQ (CoQH2/CoQ) ratio and drives excessive mROS production through reverse electron transport (RET) from site IQ in complex I. Using multiple complementary genetic and pharmacological models in vivo, we demonstrate that RET is crucial for metabolic health. In patients with steatosis, the hepatic CoQ biosynthetic program is also suppressed, and the CoQH2/CoQ ratio positively correlates with disease severity. Our data identify a highly selective mechanism for pathological mROS production in obesity, which can be targeted to protect metabolic homeostasis.",

          "authors": "Antonio Falasconi, Harsh Kanodia, Silvia Arber",
          "abstract": "The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits 1–8 . Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres 9,10 . However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry 11–22 . Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level. Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements. Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets. Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry. We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits.",

          "authors": "Simone Marchi, Jun Korenaga",
          "abstract": "Terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—formed by the accretion of smaller objects. The Earth was probably the latest terrestrial planet to form and reached about 99% of its final mass within about 60–100 Myr after condensation of the first solids in the Solar System. This Review examines the disproportionate role of the last approximately 1% of planetary growth, or late accretion, in controlling the long-term evolution of the Earth and other terrestrial planets. Late accretion may have been responsible for shaping Earth’s distinctive geophysical and chemical properties and generating pathways conducive to prebiotic chemistry. Differences in the late accretion of a planet may provide a rationale for interpreting the distinct properties of Venus and Earth (for example, tectonism, atmospheric composition, water content), the surface dichotomy of Mars and the high core-to-silicate mass ratio of Mercury. Large collisions and ensuing processes are likely to occur and modulate the evolution of rocky exoplanets as well, and they should be considered in our quest to find Earth-like worlds.",

          "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a globally important seed oil, fibre and drug-producing plant species. However, a century of prohibition has severely restricted development of breeding and germplasm resources, leaving potential hemp-based nutritional and fibre applications unrealized. Here we present a cannabis pangenome, constructed with 181 new and 12 previously released genomes from a total of 144 biological samples including both male (XY) and female (XX) plants. We identified widespread regions of the cannabis pangenome that are surprisingly diverse for a single species, with high levels of genetic and structural variation, and propose a novel population structure and hybridization history. Across the ancient heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes, we observed a variable boundary at the sex-determining and pseudoautosomal regions as well as genes that exhibit male-biased expression, including genes encoding several key flowering regulators. Conversely, the cannabinoid synthase genes, which are responsible for producing cannabidiol acid and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, contained very low levels of diversity, despite being embedded within a variable region with multiple pseudogenized paralogues, structural variation and distinct transposable element arrangements. Additionally, we identified variants of acyl-lipid thioesterase genes that were associated with fatty acid chain length variation and the production of the rare cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabidivarin. We conclude that the C. sativa gene pool remains only partially characterized, the existence of wild relatives in Asia is likely and its potential as a crop species remains largely unrealized.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by fungal pathogens, poses serious threats to public health, wildlife and ecosystem stability 1 . Host–fungus interactions and environmental factors have been extensively examined 2–4 . However, the role of genetic variability in pathogens is often less well-studied, even for diseases such as white-nose in bats, which has caused one of the highest disease-driven death tolls documented in nonhuman mammals 5 . Previous research on white-nose disease has primarily focused on variations in disease outcomes attributed to host traits or environmental conditions 6–8 , but has neglected pathogen variability. Here we leverage an extensive reference collection of 5,479 fungal isolates from 27 countries to reveal that the widespread causative agent is not a single species but two sympatric cryptic species, each exhibiting host specialization. Our findings provide evidence of recombination in each species, but significant genetic differentiation across their genomes, including differences in genome organization. Both species contain geographically differentiated populations, which enabled us to identify the species introduced to North America and trace its source population to a region in Ukraine. In light of our discovery of the existence of two cryptic species of the causative agent of white-nose disease, our research underscores the need to integrate the study of pathogen variability into comprehensive disease surveillance, management and prevention strategies. This holistic approach is crucial for enhancing our understanding of diseases and implementing effective measures to prevent their spread.",

          "abstract": "Quantum error correction [1–4] is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors [5–8] have focused primarily on the surface code [9], which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. The color code [10] enables more efficient logic, but it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures like superconducting qubits is challenging, and realizations of color codes [11–19] have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor [8]. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of Λ3/5 = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and the color code may become more efficient than the surface code following modest device improvements. We test transversal Clifford gates with logical randomized benchmarking [20] and inject magic states [21], a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99 % with post-selection. Finally, we teleport logical states between color codes using lattice surgery [22]. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future.",

Prior studies identified type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) as initiators of dietary pTregs3. However, we now report that food-specific pTreg cells are exclusively induced by the recently identified RORγt APCs4–8 and not by cDCs. Instead, our data suggest that pTreg–cDC1 interactions in steady-state limit the expansion of food-specific CD8αβ T cells. This regulation breaks during infection or food poisoning, enabling dietary CD8αβ T cells to expand and acquire effector functions in response to mimicked food antigens. Unlike in typical infections, after the pathogen is cleared, dietary CD8αβ T cells do not expand in response to their corresponding dietary antigens. Thus, we propose that in response to dietary antigens, tolerance is mediated by a circuit of dedicated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells. When the host is challenged by infection, this circuit permits the transient expansion of protective effector responses without compromising the overall strategy of tolerance that ensures safe food consumption.",

Intensive human activities and accelerated climate change have altered surface albedo across spatial and temporal scales1,2,3, yet assessments of the effects of land use or land cover (LULC) and snow variations on land surface albedo are scarce at the global scale. As a result, the global land surface albedo dynamics over recent decades and their corresponding radiative forcing to the climate system remain poorly understood4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we quantify the individual and combined effects of snow cover dynamics, LULC conversions and non-conversion regions on albedo variations during 2001–2020 and estimate their induced radiative forcing. We show that the negative radiative forcing induced by the global land surface albedo change was −0.142 (−0.158, −0.114) W m−2 over the past two decades. The global snow-free land surface albedo increased by 2.2% (P < 0.001), with a negative radiative forcing of −0.164 (−0.186, −0.138) W m−2 (P < 0.001). The magnitude of this negative forcing is sevenfold larger than the positive forcing induced by snow dynamics, and equivalent to 59.9% of that caused by CO2 emissions from 2011 to 201910. The global radiative forcing due to albedo changes in LULC non-conversion regions is 3.9 to 8.1 times greater than that from LULC conversions. The radiative forcing induced by albedo changes highlights the important role of land surface dynamics in modulating global warming.",

Current tissue-derived organoids fail to reproduce the complex cellular composition and tissue architecture observed in vivo3. Here, we describe a multicellular organoid system composed of adult hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells that recapitulates the architecture of the liver periportal region and, when manipulated, models aspects of cholestatic injury and biliary fibrosis. We first generate reproducible hepatocyte organoids with functional bile canaliculi network that retain morphological features of in vivo tissue. By combining these with cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts, we generate assembloids that mimic the cellular interactions of the periportal region. Assembloids are functional, consistently draining bile from bile canaliculi into the bile duct. Strikingly, manipulating the relative number of portal mesenchymal cells is sufficient to induce a fibrotic-like state, independently of an immune compartment. By generating chimeric assembloids of mutant and wild-type cells, or after gene knockdown, we show proof-of-concept that our system is amenable to investigating gene function and cell-autonomous mechanisms. Taken together, we demonstrate that liver assembloids represent a suitable in vitro system to study bile canaliculi formation, bile drainage, and how different cell types contribute to cholestatic disease and biliary fibrosis, in an all-in-one model.",

          "abstract": "Specialized immune cells that reside in tissues orchestrate diverse biological functions by communicating with parenchymal cells1. The contribution of the innate immune compartment in the meninges and the central nervous system (CNS) is well-characterized; however, whether cells of the adaptive immune system reside in the brain and are involved in maintaining homeostasis is unclear2,3,4. Here we show that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain is a nucleus for parenchymal αβ T cells in the steady-state brain in both mice and humans. Using unbiased transcriptomics, we show that these extravascular T cells in the brain are distinct from meningeal T cells: they secrete IFNγ robustly and express tissue-residence proteins such as CXCR6, which are required for their retention in the brain and for normal adaptive behaviour. These T cells are primed in the periphery by the microbiome, and traffic from the white adipose and gastrointestinal tissues to the brain. Once established, their numbers can be modulated by alterations to either the gut microbiota or the composition of adipose tissue. In summary, we find that CD4 T cells reside in the brain at steady state and are anatomically concentrated in the SFO in mice and humans; that they are transcriptionally and functionally distinct from meningeal T cells; and that they secrete IFNγ to maintain CNS homeostasis through homeostatic fat–brain and gut–brain axes.",

In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states 3–5 and are believed to enable topological quantum computing 6,7 . One-dimensional anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here we observed emergent anyonic correlations in a one-dimensional strongly interacting quantum gas, resulting from the phenomenon of spin–charge separation 8–10 . A mobile impurity provides the necessary spin degree of freedom to engineer anyonic correlations in the charge sector and simultaneously acts as a probe to reveal these correlations. Starting with bosons, we tune the statistical phase to transmute bosons through anyons to fermions and observe an asymmetric momentum distribution 11–14 , a hallmark of anyonic correlations. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we observed dynamical fermionization of the anyons 15 . This study opens the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting 15–17 .",

Using induced neurons, we validate two candidate complexes whose interactions are supported by crosslinks and structural predictions: TMEM230 as a subunit of ATP8 and ATP11 lipid flippases 10 and TMEM9 and TMEM9B as subunits of the chloride–proton antiporters CLCN3, CLCN4 and CLCN5 (ref. 11 ).

          "abstract": "Air pollution affects climate through various complex interactions1. It perturbs the Earth’s radiative energy balance and alters the atmospheric oxidation capacity, which determines the lifetimes of short-lived climate forcers, such as methane1. A key mechanism in this dynamic is the impact of air pollutants on the hydroxyl radical (OH), the most important oxidant in the troposphere, which accounts for approximately 90% of the methane chemical sink2. However, a comprehensive quantification of the interactions between air pollutants, OH and methane over decadal timescales remains incomplete2. Here we develop an integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach to quantify how variations in key air pollutants influence the methane chemical sink and alter the methane budget. Our results indicate that, from 2005 to 2021, enhanced tropospheric ozone, increased water vapour and decreased carbon monoxide levels collectively contributed to a 1.3–2.0 Tg year−1 increase per year in the global methane sink, thereby buffering atmospheric methane growth rates. This increase in the methane sink was primarily concentrated in tropical regions and exhibited a north–south asymmetry. Periods of high methane growth were typically linked to abrupt OH level declines driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events such as mega wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study suggests a trade-off between O3 pollution control and methane removal mediated by OH and highlights the risk of increasing carbon monoxide emissions from widespread wildfires.",

However, how diverse cell types are organized within tissue niches for cohesive functioning remains largely unknown. Here we systematically characterized cross-tissue coordinated cellular modules in healthy tissues, uncovering their spatiotemporal dynamics and phenotypic associations, and examined their rewiring in cancer. We first compiled a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas from 35 human tissues, revealing substantial inter-tissue variability in cellular composition. By leveraging covariance in cellular abundance, we identified 12 cellular modules with distinct cellular compositions, tissue prevalences and spatial organizations, and demonstrated coordinated intercellular communication within cellular modules using in situ spatial and in vivo perturbation data. Among them, two immune cellular modules in the spleen showed contrasting chronological dynamics with ageing. Analysis of multicellular changes in the breast revealed a menopausal trajectory associated with fibroblast dynamics. Furthermore, interrogation across cancer types uncovered simultaneous rewiring of two types of multicellular ecosystem during tumour progression, including the loss of tissue-specific healthy organization and the emergence of a convergent cancerous ecosystem. These findings reveal fundamental organizing principles of multicellular ecosystems in health and cancer, laying a foundation for further investigations into tissue-level functional coordination across diverse contexts.",

          "abstract": "Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electronvolt (eV)-scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications1,2. A variety of such magnetic states with non-trivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d-wave, g-wave or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets3,4,5,6,7. Achieving voltage-based control of the non-uniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energy-efficient and compact devices for information storage and processing8,9. Spin-spiral type II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order that directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry-protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order10,11,12,13,14. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principles calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent an observation of p-wave magnetism in a spin-spiral type II multiferroic, which may lead to the development of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets.",

Torpor is caused by preoptic neurons that express a variety of peptides and receptors1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but no single genetic marker has been found for this population. Here we report that expression of the prostaglandin EP3 receptor (EP3R) marks a unique population of median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) neurons that are required for both torpor and lipopolysaccharide-induced fever8. The MnPO-EP3R neurons produce persistent fever responses when inhibited and prolonged hypothermic responses when activated either chemogenetically or optogenetically, even for brief periods of time. The mechanism for these prolonged responses appears to involve increases in intracellular levels of cAMP and calcium that may persist for many minutes up to hours beyond the termination of a stimulus. These properties endow the population of MnPO-EP3R neurons with the ability to act as a two-way switch for the hypothermic and hyperthermic responses that are required for survival.",

For electronic excitations in condensed media, dephasing is mediated by thermal lattice motion1,7,8. Therefore, taming the lattice influence is essential for creating collective electronic quantum states at high temperatures. Although there are occasional reports of high-Tc quantum effects across different platforms, it is unclear which lattice characteristics and electron–lattice interactions lead to macroscopically coherent electronic states in solids9. Here we studied intensity fluctuations in the macroscopic polarization during the emergence of superfluorescence in a lead halide perovskite10 and showed that spontaneously synchronized polaronic lattice oscillations accompany collective electronic dipole emission. We further developed an effective field model and theoretically confirmed that exciton–lattice interactions lead to a new electronically and structurally entangled coherent extended solitonic state beyond a critical polaron density. The analysis shows a phase transition with two processes happening in tandem: incoherent disordered polaronic lattice deformations establish an order, while macroscopic quantum coherence among excitons simultaneously emerges. Recombination of excitons in this state culminates in superfluorescence at high temperatures. Our study establishes fundamental connections between the transient superfluorescence process observed after the impulsive excitation of perovskites and general equilibrium phase transitions achieved by thermal cooling. By identifying various electron–lattice interactions in the perovskite structure and their respective role in creating collectively coherent electronic effects in solids, our work provides unprecedented insight into the design and development of new materials that exhibit high-temperature macroscopic quantum phenomena.",

Here we present a facile light-triggered doping strategy and develop a series of inactive photoactivable dopants (iPADs) for regionally controlled n-doping of OSCs. By converting iPADs into active dopants through ultraviolet (UV) exposure, controllable doping of various n-type OSCs with high electrical conductivity greater than 30 S cm−1 has been realized. Using iPADs can substantially improve the performances of OSCs in transistors, logic circuits and thermoelectrics. Also, regionally controlled doping is demonstrated in OSCs with a record resolution down to 1 μm. Overall, our strategy has achieved tunable doping levels in OSCs with high spatial resolution, which is expected to be highly suited for integrated circuits in both roll-to-roll and laboratory-scale environments.",

Geochemical data from ancient sediments indicate localized or ephemeral photosynthetic O2 production before the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) approximately 2.5–2.3 billion years ago (Ga), and currently suggest Archaean origins, approximately 3 Ga or earlier3,4,5,6,7,8,9. However, sedimentary records of the early Earth often suffer from preservation issues, and poor control on the timing of oxidation leaves geochemical proxy data for the ancient presence of O2 open to critique10,11,12,13. Here, we report rare Earth element data from three different Archaean carbonate platforms preserved in greenstone belts of the northwest Superior Craton (Canada), which were deposited by the activity of marine photosynthetic bacteria 2.87 Ga, 2.85 Ga and 2.78 Ga. All three indicate O2 production before the GOE in the form of significant depletions in cerium (Ce), reflecting oxidative Ce removal from ancient seawater, as occurs today14. Using 138La-138Ce geochronology, we show that La/Ce fractionation, and thus Ce oxidation, occurred at the time of deposition, making these the oldest directly dated Ce anomalies. These results place the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Mesoarchaean or earlier and bring an important new perspective on a long-standing debate regarding Earth’s biological and geochemical evolution.",

However, ex vivo manipulation and patient conditioning before transplantation are major hurdles that could be overcome by an in vivo approach. Here we demonstrate that in vivo gene delivery to HSPCs after systemic LV administration is enabled by the substantial trafficking of these cells from the liver to the bone marrow in newborn mice. We improved gene-transfer efficiency using a phagocytosis-shielded LV, successfully reaching bona fide HSPCs capable of long-term multilineage output and engraftment after serial transplantation, as confirmed by clonal tracking. HSPC mobilization further increased gene transfer, extending the window of intervention, although permissiveness to LV transduction declined with age. We successfully tested this in vivo strategy in mouse models of adenosine deaminase deficiency, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis and Fanconi anaemia. Interestingly, in vivo gene transfer provided a selective advantage to corrected HSPCs in Fanconi anaemia, leading to near-complete haematopoietic reconstitution and prevention of bone marrow failure. Given that circulating HSPCs in humans are also most abundant shortly after birth, in vivo HSPC gene transfer holds strong translational potential across multiple diseases.",

          "abstract": "Lakes are crucial for ecosystems1, greenhouse gas emissions2 and water resources3, yet their surface-extent dynamics, particularly seasonality, remain poorly understood at continental to global scales owing to limitations in satellite observations4,5. Although previous studies have focused on long-term changes6,7,8, comprehensive assessments of seasonality have been constrained by trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal resolution in single-source satellite data. Here we show that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally. By leveraging a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat-based datasets, combined with high-performance computing, we achieved monthly mapping of 1.4 million lakes (2001–2023). Our approach yielded basin-level median user’s and producer’s accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, when validated against the Global Surface Water dataset7. Seasonality-dominated lakes constitute 66% of the global lake area and approximately 60% of total lake counts, with over 90% of the world’s population residing in regions where such lakes prevail. During seasonality-induced extreme events, the impacts can exceed the combined magnitude of 23-year long-term changes and regular seasonal variations, doubling the contraction of 42% of shrinking lakes and fully offsetting the expansion of 45% of growing lakes. These results uncover previously hidden seasonal dynamics that are crucial for understanding hydrospheric responses to environmental changes9, protecting lacustrine systems10,11,12 and improving global climate models13,14. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating seasonality into future research and suggest that advancements in the fusion of multisource remote-sensing data offer a promising path forward.",

Because PDH is endothermic and requires high temperatures that favour sintering and coking, the challenge is to develop active and stable catalysts1-3 that are sufficiently stable10,11. Zeolite-supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been developed to balance activity, selectivity and stability12,13, and more recent work documented a PDH catalyst based on zeolite-anchored single rhodium atoms with exceptional performance and stability14. Here we show for silicalite-1 (S-1) that migration of encapsulated Pt-Sn2 clusters and hence agglomeration and anchoring within the zeolite versus agglomeration on the external surface can be controlled by adjusting the length of the S-1 crystals’ b-axis. We find that when this axis is longer than 2.00 μm, migration of Pt-Sn2 monomers during PDH results in intra-crystalline formation of (Pt-Sn2)2 dimers that are securely locked in the channels of S-1 and capable of converting pure propane feed to propylene at 550 °C for more than 6 months with 98.3% selectivity at 91% equilibrium conversion. This performance exceeds that of other Pt-based PDH catalysts and approaches that of the Rh-based catalyst. While synthesis requirements and cost are currently prohibitive for industrial use, we anticipate that our approach to controlling the migration and lockup of metals in zeolites may enable to development of other noble metal catalysts that offer extended service lifetimes in industrial applications15-17.",

This X-ray detection from an LPT reveals that these objects are more energetic than previously thought and establishes a class of hour-scale periodic X-ray transients with a luminosity of about 1033 erg s−1 linked to exceptionally bright coherent radio emission.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria defend themselves from viral predation using diverse immune systems, many of which target foreign DNA for degradation1. Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by leveraging DNA synthesis instead2,3. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene that encodes an antiviral effector protein, Neo4,5. It remains unknown whether similar mechanisms of defense are employed by other related DRT families. Focusing on DRT9, here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of DNA homopolymer synthesis. Viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell, driving abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal how a noncoding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and poly-dA synthesis. Remarkably, biochemical and functional experiments identify tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that likely prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of high-molecular weight protein-DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA by DRT9 in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers. Collectively, our work unveils a novel nucleic acid-driven defense system that expands the paradigm of bacterial immunity and broadens the known functions of reverse transcriptases.",

          "abstract": "The Singapore freshwater crab is, it’s fair to say, picky.\n\nA diminutive, nocturnal creature, Johora singaporensis lives only along a handful of hill streams in small pockets of relatively unvisited rainforest in and around the nature reserves of Singapore.\n\nNature Spotlight: Singapore\n\nThe city-state covers just 730 square kilometres — 16% of which is rainforest — yet is home to almost 6 million people. That doesn’t leave a lot of room for crabs. Plus, “there are very few hills in Singapore”, says Darren Yeo, a freshwater ecologist at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Because of its stringent habitat requirements, says Yeo, “this crab was bound to be endangered at some point”. Even so, Yeo was surprised when, in 2008, an undergraduate student in his department returned empty handed from a survey of one of three known locations of the crab. “That started the ball rolling, when people started pressing panic buttons,” says Yeo.\n\nSince Singapore was made a trading outpost by the British in 1819, scientists estimate 1 that human activities, such as deforestation, have led to an extinction rate of 37%. Now, however, the country’s central government is working to protect and develop the natural world as part of its city-planning strategy, which it says will improve mental health, keep urban temperatures down and safeguard the country’s environmental legacy.\n\nIt was through this strategy that the Singapore freshwater crab found a reprieve. Shortly after the discovery that its numbers were dwindling, a sophisticated conservation strategy kicked into gear. The National Parks Board (NParks), Singapore’s nature authority, formed a working group with representatives from academia, government agencies, non-governmental organizations and international conservation specialists. Together, they developed a captive-breeding programme for the crabs and released some of them at suitable sites to boost wild populations. Today, J. singaporensis is still endangered, but not facing imminent extinction.\n\nFieldwork revealed that the number of freshwater crabs was dwindling in Singapore. Credit: E.X.P. Toh\nPaving the way\n\nSingapore’s population grew by 2% last year, and by 5% the year before that. Like many high-income nations, its birth rate is decreasing, but it is courting international workers to make up the deficit and keep economic targets at 5% growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Of its 6 million people, 1.9 million are classed as non-residents, including foreign workers and students. The country’s economy is shepherded by its central government, which employs more than 150,000 people and maintains a tight grip on the country’s institutions. The government, which has been in power since independence in 1959, is listed as a ‘flawed democracy’ in the Economist Intelligence Unit 2024 Democracy Index, ranking between Sri Lanka and Guyana. Its GDP per capita, meanwhile, ranks as the highest in Asia, and compares with that of Norway.\n\nIn May, the country went to the polls to re-elect the People’s Action Party, which found itself unopposed in 5 of the 97 seats being contested. Only 2.8 million people were eligible to vote in the election, and the People’s Action Party’s biggest rival, the Workers’ Party, contested only 26 seats. Voting is compulsory in Singapore, and, according to a 2024 report 2 from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the country’s media industry is straightjacketed by an “elaborate network of laws governing traditional and online media”. “The laws give the government the right to order the publication of ‘corrections’ to online content that it considers to be erroneous, or to prevent a ‘diminution of public confidence’ in the government,” the report says.\n\nSingapore’s shoreline changed substantially between 1989 (left) and 2018 (right). Credit: Landsat/EROS/USGS\n\nSince 1960, Singapore has reclaimed around 150 square kilometres of land from the sea. In part, this is to meet demand for homes: around 80% of Singaporeans live in government-provided housing, nicknamed HDBs, after the Housing and Development Board, and many of those are in high-density skyscrapers. Singapore is the third most densely populated territory in the world, after Macau and the city-state of Monaco. Alongside this, the country’s economic success is buttressed by being the world’s busiest port outside China, hosting more than 3.11 billion tonnes in traffic last year.\n\nThis urban development and economic success has come at a cost for the natural environment: where once there was jungle, there is now city. Singapore has lost almost all of its primary rainforest, except for a small tract of land in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, which sits in the middle of the island and is part of one of the two main water catchment areas. Although some of the country’s remaining non-primary rainforests, including in the Central Catchment, are protected from development, their long-term fate is a concern for environmentalists.\n\nIn 2023, Desmond Lee, the country’s national development minister, said that nearly 100,000 homes were likely to be built by 2025. Woodland areas, including Pang Sua and Clementi Forest, are scheduled for development, although the government says that there is no immediate need for construction. “The land area we’re working with is so small, which means we have to be very smart about how we do it,” says Harvey Neo, who studies the urban environment from the leafy campus of the Singapore University of Technology and Design.\n\nHow farming could become the ultimate climate-change tool\n\nIn a bid to achieve its sustainability goals, the government has pledged to plant one million trees by 2030 and transplant 100,000 corals into its marine waters, which NParks said in 2024 would take at least 10 years to complete. Neither project is without controversy. “Nobody is tracking how many trees we are cutting down while we are planting a million trees,” says Andie Ang, a primatologist at Mandai Nature, a wildlife organization affiliated with Mandai Wildlife Reserve, and president of the environmental charity the Jane Goodall Institute Singapore. “How about those century-old trees that are being cut down for development?” One person told Nature, anonymously, that government representatives had initially suggested transplanting one million corals into local waters: a figure that the source said was unrealistic.\n\nAnother concern is the availability of information. Academics and civil-society groups say that they cannot access the same data that are available to government agencies. “There’s not always a one-to-one connectivity in terms of the data that civil society is privy to and the data that government and civil service is privy to, and very often that leads to miscommunication between these two parties,” says ecologist Sankar Ananthanarayanan at the NUS. Together with Ang, Ananthanarayanan co-authored the 2024 Singapore Terrestrial Conservation Plan, which outlines the views and concerns of the country’s environmental groups.\n\nCivil servants dispute this characterization. “At least 80% of our work is collaborative, because we can’t do it on our own,” says Lim Liang Jim, who runs the conservation division of NParks. Some species data might be withheld from the public to protect against poaching, he adds.\n\nOne recommendation put forward by the Terrestrial Conservation Plan is to improve communication and consultation around plans to clear forests for development. However, some people remain sceptical. “In a place like Singapore, usually by the time you know that a patch of forest is going to be developed, they’re going to do it, no matter what,” says Kalai Vanan Balakrishnan, who is chief executive of the non-profit organization the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES).\n\nA city in nature\n\nSingapore has a robust and detailed urban-planning system, however, and that means all proposed buildings are assessed for their environmental impact and contribution to the country’s green image. Government planning policies are stringent, and include a range of requirements, from mandatory environmental sustainability standards for all new buildings to improve energy performance and increase green construction practices to smaller obligations, such as incorporating planter boxes with vegetation on overhead pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe country is among the greenest cities in the world in terms of plant coverage. Treepedia, a remote-sensing urban tree-canopy monitoring project led by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab in Cambridge, and the World Economic Forum in Cologny, Switzerland, found that Singapore had the second-best canopy cover of street trees, after Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe government has a long-stated ambition of keeping urban spaces full of plant life — a series of policies bundled into the plan to create a ‘city in nature’. There are a variety of reasons behind this, says Tan Puay Yok, who studies urban greening and ecology at the NUS. “By placing greenery closer to where people live and closer to buildings, the buildings are shaded from solar radiation,” he says. “Cooling of the environment is one big thing.”\n\nOtter populations returned to Singapore, thanks to sustainability measures. Credit: CHINE NOUVELLE/SIPA/Shutterstock\n\nThe approach is effective: the 62-hectare Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in the centre of the island can be up to 3 °C cooler than high-density residential blocks nearby. This is valuable in a country where summer temperatures can reach 36 °C. “It’s very easy to feel it as you walk round the city”, says Chua Siew Chin, who studies forest ecology at NUS. “Singapore has warmed up a lot over the years; greening can help with that.”\n\nThere are psychological benefits, too. “We know that even just looking at greenery makes people feel better,” says Yok. Vegetation also provides noise mitigation and soaks up water from rainfall, he adds. “This all ties back to having that scientific understanding of how greenery benefits urban dwellers living in a dense city like Singapore.”\n\nMeet the researchers pioneering Spanish climate solutions",

Credit: Benjamin Cremel/AFP/Getty\n\nHail regularly pulverizes crops and smashes up homes around the world — but it remains a scientific mystery despite its menace. Researchers still don’t know why some storms make monster hailstones , whereas others drop only harmless fragments of ice.\n\nNow meteorologists hope to clear up some of the unknowns about hail, which causes tens of billions of dollars in damage annually in the United States alone. Over a six-week period, dozens of scientists will chase ice-dropping storms across the US Great Plains , in the biggest US study devoted to hail in four decades.\n\n“We have so few observations that that any observation of any hailstorm is going to give us new and exciting information,” says Rebecca Adams-Selin, an atmospheric scientist at the consultancy firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research in Lexington, Massachusetts. She is lead principal investigator of the field campaign, known as ICECHIP.\n\nHailstone nurseries\n\nHail forms during strong thunderstorms when upward-flowing winds carry raindrops to higher, colder regions of the atmosphere, where the drops freeze. Depending on how a hailstone is blown around during the storm, it can either grow or shrink before it falls to the ground. But the environment in which this happens is something of a black box.\n\nICECHIP is studying how baby hailstones form and accumulate ice as they move through a thunderstorm, and what conditions create the most damaging hail . The instruments researchers are using include a funnel-and-freezer combination to gather and store hailstones, panels studded with pressure sensors that convert hailstone impacts into kinetic energy, and a drone that appeared in last year’s tornado-chasing film Twisters .\n\nNight-time storm chasers stalk their prey on US Plains\n\nThe results should help people to better prepare for damage from incoming hail , says Ian Giammanco, a meteorologist at the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety in Richburg, South Carolina. That might mean designing better hail-resistant roofs, putting hail netting over vulnerable fruit trees or adjusting the angle of solar panels to allow hail to bounce off them . Such measures could help to contain the rising economic toll of hail damage. “This exponential growth in loss is unsustainable, and we’ve got to start figuring out ways to take a bite out of it,” he says.",

          "title": "Scientists with ADHD speak up: when fire meets focus",
          "authors": "Julian Nowogrodzki",
          "abstract": "Lis Gallant’s ADHD helps her to switch her attention rapidly to manage field site safety and data collection under intense volcanic conditions. Credit: Hawaiian Volcano Observatory/USGS\n\nFor volcanologist Lis Gallant, her first clue that she might have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) came during a conversation with a professor during her graduate studies. He noticed that her oral presentations were very detailed, but that her written work was, as she puts it, “ugh”. So, he asked her about her writing process. Gallant, now at the University of Hawai’i at Hilo, told him: “I sit down for five minutes and hammer some stuff out and then wander away.” To which he replied, “That’s not right,” she recalls, laughing.\n\nHow to be a brilliant ally to your neurodivergent lab mate\n\nADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting the frontal lobe of the brain. People with ADHD are usually worse at focusing on mundane tasks, and better at focusing on things they find interesting, than are neurotypical people. In a research career, the condition can be both a boon and a burden. ADHD can distract a scientist from their to-do list, but also enable them to focus intensely on what they love. In recent years, there’s been a growing awareness of ADHD, especially about how it can present differently, depending on whether someone is raised as a girl or a boy.\n\nThe ways in which ADHD manifests are almost as varied as the people who have it. So, too, are the tools they find most effective to deal with it. “Every neurodivergent person is different, which means that you need to figure out what works for you,” says Richard Littauer, a computer scientist at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand who has ADHD and autism.\n\nSix researchers with ADHD spoke to Nature about their experiences and how they set up strategies for success. Many of these can help any researcher who feels overwhelmed by time-management challenges.\n\nAn extra weight\n\nMany challenges come with having ADHD. Coping with them can feel like “this extra weight of management”, says Lynn Kamerlin, an evolutionary biochemist at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who has ADHD, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nMany people with ADHD benefit from stimulants such as a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, sold under the brand name Adderall, or from other medications. “As soon as I got on the right medication, I was like, ‘This is how a ‘normal’ brain works? Not screaming at itself?’” Gallant says. Katherine Morton, a postdoctoral researcher in toxicology at the University of Rochester in New York, says that her anxiety also improved greatly once she was on medication. But each person is unique: medication doesn’t work for Littauer, and Kamerlin has a rare medication allergy that rules out most stimulants for her.\n\nWith or without medication, a key challenge is task management. People with ADHD are best at paying attention to things that are urgent or deeply interesting to them, and can easily forget about everything else or get overwhelmed by deciding what to prioritize. Kamerlin is half-Persian and half-Swedish, or, as she says, from “one culture that’s chronically late and one that’s chronically early”, respectively. One early clue that she had ADHD was how much she struggled with being on time.\n\n“My to-do list, it’s still a really big trigger for me,” says Kamerlin. If it gets too long, it becomes overstimulating, and she spends “almost as much time panicking as actually getting stuff done”. The panic and overstimulation can feed procrastination. Gallant put off writing her master’s thesis and then wrote the first draft in five days — not a strategy she recommends.\n\nEvolutionary biochemist Lynn Kamerlin. Credit: Billy Howard/Georgia Research Alliance\n\nGallant now has several strategies for managing to-do lists. Having ‘accountability buddies’ helps. Every day, she checks in with friends from her graduate course, some of whom are also neurodivergent, to discuss situations and goals that they are stuck on and to break them down into smaller tasks. Similarly, to get her writing done as a graduate student, Morton joined a writing group started by a friend who also has ADHD. Having neurodivergent accountability buddies helped, because they had as much incentive to keep the group going as she did, she says. The group met at coffee shops and used the Pomodoro method: 20-minute bouts of work, followed by 5-minute talking breaks.\n\nGallant also sticks to pen-and-paper to-do lists instead of using digital versions. Even if she never looks at the paper to-do list again, she says, the act of writing it down helps her to remember, something that is borne out in research ( F. R. Van der Weel and A. L. H. Van der Meer Front. Psychol. 14 , 1219945; 2024 ).\n\nMany people with ADHD, including Gallant, do well with deadlines. But now that she is mid-career, “I can tell that a lot of deadlines are fake — I’ve seen through the veil,” she says. “I can’t lie to myself and tell myself that this deadline that’s soft is hard.” Having collaborators with diverse skill sets and work structures — for example, some are without teaching obligations and have more time for big-picture thinking — helps, “because I am not the only person driving a project forward”.\n\nChristin Monroe is a chemistry educator at Landmark College in Putney, Vermont, an institute that is designed specifically for neurodivergent undergraduate students. Monroe finds that people with ADHD, herself included, must be “more deliberate about planning time”. She has sometimes felt that the extra planning doesn’t ‘count’ as hours of work, because neurotypical peers don’t necessarily need to do it, but she thinks it’s important for people with ADHD to treat the time they spend planning as a legitimate part of their jobs.\n\nEnergy and empathy\n\nDespite these time-management hurdles, ADHD brings many strengths that are well-suited to research: an abundance of energy, ideas and an ability to juggle a lot. “I’m very fast when I’m focused,” says Kamerlin. “I think very fast, I talk very fast.” Littauer has been in his PhD programme for nine months and has already published one white paper and has eight scientific papers in review. Monroe says she is really good at starting projects but not so great at completing them, so she finds that her best collaborators are people who are good at finishing and polishing projects and papers.\n\nHow I’m learning to navigate academia as someone with ADHD\n\nMorton’s ADHD gives her a fine attention to detail, and to patterns in experiments that others miss. For example, when she worked in a mosquito laboratory, one experiment involved deleting a large chunk of DNA that affected the strength of the insects’ flight muscles. Everyone thought the experiment had failed because the mosquitoes, which were kept thousands to a cage, looked normal. Only Morton noticed a handful of mosquitoes at the bottom of a cage that were hopping instead of flying. Their flight muscles were weaker, and the experiment had worked.\n\nGallant says her ADHD makes her “really well suited to doing work in hazardous conditions”, which, for a volcanologist, is invaluable in field situations. It helps her to keep her team safe, for example, when they land in an active eruption site, with lava flowing towards them, and they have ten minutes to collect data. Her brain can switch rapidly between assessing how quickly the lava is moving, assembling instruments, collecting data and monitoring her team members.\n\nSeveral studies have found that people with ADHD are more sensitive to injustice than are neurotypical people ( R. Bondü and G. Esser Eur. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry 24 , 185–198; 2015 ), and Gallant has noticed this in herself as a strong commitment to justice, equity and diversity work. “My brain functions kind of like a spiderweb: I can see all the connections,” she says. “One small thing here will make me angry about the whole system. That’s really great in terms of thinking about solving problems.” And it’s “really infuriating” to see so many connected problems that others gloss over.\n\nGallant says that her ADHD also improves her mentoring and teaching of students. “It has made me a more empathetic professor, because I remember struggling with things.”\n\nDeliberate structure\n\nThe scientists who spoke to Nature find various ways to structure their work lives around their neurodivergence. “It’s a big time investment to understand who you are, but you reap the benefits many times over,” Kamerlin says.\n\nMonroe’s school algebra teacher introduced her to a trick that she uses to this day. The teacher noticed that she would rush through her tests and fail them, although she’d solve algebra problems for fun in her own time. “Why don’t you just take it twice?” she recalls her teacher suggesting. “That’s been a style I’ve adapted for a lot of things. I need to get that ‘shitty first draft’ done to feel like I can relax.”",

          "abstract": "More than 1,000 scientists took to the streets yesterday in Buenos Aires and other cities in Argentina wearing gas masks like those in the Argentine Netflix series ‘The Eternaut’. Playing on the post-apocalyptic television show’s theme — that oppression can be overcome by unity — they protested the collapse of science, or ‘scienticide’ in the country , which they say was initiated by the administration of President Javier Milei.\n\n‘There will be nothing left’: researchers fear collapse of science in Argentina\n\nSince Milei took office in late 2023, he has made massive cuts to government spending , in part to reduce the country’s deficit and bring down inflation. As a consequence, many scientific activities in Argentina have ground to a halt for lack of payment, about 1,300 employees in the science sector have been laid off and researchers have left for jobs abroad owing to low salaries.\n\nResearch funding has completely stopped, Fernando Stefani, a physicist at the University of Buenos Aires who marched at the protest, told Nature . “It hasn’t been fulfilled in any way — zero,” even for research contracts that had already been approved and were in progress, he said. The National Agency for the Promotion of Research, Technological Development and Innovation, which is the main funder of research projects in Argentina, hasn’t made any calls for new projects since late 2023 either.\n\nArgentina’s main science agency, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), which funds about 280 research institutes across the country and employs most of its scientists, has been paying salaries and not much more, sources say. Some researchers who spoke to Nature aren’t sure whether they will be able to feed laboratory animals in the coming weeks. And even though salaries are being paid, they have dropped by about 40% since Milei took office. “The salaries of younger researchers are on the verge of poverty levels, and those of older researchers are not enough for a decent life,” Stefani said.\n\nAlthough Milei’s actions have brought year-on-year inflation down to its lowest level in three years, the prices of food and goods have risen. And government spending cuts have left people without many basic services. “The research system is simply being allowed to be destroyed through inaction and underfunding,” Stefani said.\n\nA protester on a subway platform holds a sign that says “Without science there is no future”.

Still, “it’s like death by starvation”, Lidia Szczupak, a neuroscientist at the University of Buenos Aires’s CONICET-funded Institute of Physiology, Molecular Biology and Neurosciences who also marched yesterday, told Nature . “Our salary is very poor — we are carrying on for the love” of science, she added.\n\nCONICET did not respond to Nature ’s request for comment by the time this story published.\n\nChainsaw government",

Credit: Kevin Carter/Getty\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order late last week , mandating the overhaul of research-integrity policies, to ensure that the federal government promotes “gold standard science” that is “transparent, rigorous, and impactful”. But many researchers fear that the order will do the opposite, by putting US scientists and science under the thumb of political appointees — and they are mobilizing opposition.\n\n‘Scientists will not be silenced’: thousands protest Trump research cuts\n\nThe order, titled “Restoring Gold Standard Science”, states that research-integrity issues, including high-profile retractions and an inability to reproduce many scientific studies , have caused the public to lose faith in science. It accuses Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, of misusing scientific evidence when crafting public policies on climate change, public-health guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic and more. The order comes as the Trump administration slashes funding for science across federal agencies and at major US research universities .\n\nAlthough many researchers agree that breaches of scientific integrity are important to address, some who spoke to Nature worry that language in the 23 May order opens the door to political interference in US science.\n\n“It all sounds very non-objectionable, but it’s extremely dangerous” in its details and subtext, says Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science-advocacy group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The order “steamrolls” long-standing efforts to create a buffer between science and politics, says Goldman, who helped to develop scientific-integrity policies under Biden that the latest order revokes. For instance, enforcement of the new research-integrity policies could be left up to political appointees rather than non-partisan career government employees, as was required under Biden.\n\nVictoria LaCivita, a spokeswoman for the US Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which coordinates science policy across the government, said to Nature in a statement that the order creates a path to rebuilding trust between the scientific community and the public “through common-sense scientific principles”. She also accused the Biden administration of incorporating “radical woke ideology” into the scientific enterprise by introducing diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. “If that’s not politicizing science, I don’t know what is,” she said.\n\nThe latest order has incensed some in the scientific community: nearly 4,900 scientists and others had signed an open letter at the time this story was published, arguing that it promotes a “Fool’s Gold” standard for science. “The Executive Order further consolidates political control over the Nation’s scientific infrastructure, co-opting the language of open science to implement a system under which direct presidential appointees are given broad latitude to designate many common and important scientific activities as scientific misconduct, and to penalize those involved accordingly,” the letter says.\n\nCompeting policies\n\nDuring Trump’s first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, researchers and public-policy specialists repeatedly accused his administration of undermining science and censoring government scientists. For instance, scientists at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were sidelined as the administration sought to weaken environmental and public-health regulations; later, in a survey, hundreds of researchers reported political interference in their work . Partially in response, Biden issued an executive order during his first week in office in 2021, calling on some 30 federal agencies to create or update scientific-integrity policies to shield government scientists from political interference.\n\nMichael Kratsios, head of the OSTP, has criticized the scientific community for quashing voices of dissent. Credit: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nTrump’s executive order revokes those policies while calling for the OSTP to issue guidance within the next 30 days on establishing new ones; federal agencies then have 60 days to develop policies and report back to the OSTP. Among other requirements, the order directs agencies to ensure that their policies “protect employees from efforts to prevent or deter consideration of alternative scientific opinions”. OSTP head Michael Kratsios and other Trump officials have said that scientific groupthink on topics such as climate change and the COVID-19 response has squashed valid opinions and caused harm.\n\nOne of the main fears among critics of the order is that Trump’s policies will allow agencies to put politically appointed officials in charge of investigations into allegations relating to research integrity. That could enable the administration to punish government scientists for failing to meet vague expectations to “transparently acknowledge and document uncertainties” when using data in agency decision-making. “This could be used as a cudgel to punish almost anyone. It’s just frightening,” says one senior government official who has worked on scientific-integrity issues under multiple administrations. The official requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nEmphasizing uncertainty",

Credit: John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty\n\nAs the US government slashes Harvard University’s funding, the damage to research at the institution is becoming clearer. Nature has learnt that researchers there have lost nearly 1,000 grants, worth more than US$2.4 billion.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nLast week, the administration of US President Donald Trump announced the terminations in a press release , but did not specify how many grants would be targeted, or list individual ones. Nature obtained the figures from various sources, including US funding-agency employees and an online tracking effort called Grant Watch .\n\nAn e-mail to Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) lists 193 grants worth nearly $150 million combined as being terminated, and one from the US Department of Defense (DoD) logs 56 grants worth $105 million. Other cuts are smaller: for instance, the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development each terminated three grants. But by far the largest tranche comes from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest funder of biomedical science : it is cutting more than 600 grants worth about $2.2 billion over multiple years. The cuts do not include awards to Harvard-affiliated hospitals.\n\nThrough research grants, the US government funds about 11% of Harvard’s annual $6.4-billion budget, and these cancellations will be devastating, researchers say. “Harvard cannot, even with its vast resources, just make up for this loss of federal funding,” says Joseph Loparo, a biological chemist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who lost two NIH grants for studying repair processes in DNA, totalling $4.3 million.\n\nIn the crosshairs\n\nHarvard is one of the most prestigious universities in the world, and the wealthiest — with its $53-billion endowment. The university has been a prime target for the Trump administration as it seeks to eradicate what it calls ‘woke’ ideology from US campuses. According to The New York Times , Trump posed the possibility of never paying Harvard its allotment of grant money during a private luncheon on 1 April. “Wouldn’t that be cool?” he asked. On Thursday, the US Department of Homeland Security made the extraordinary announcement that it had cancelled Harvard’s ability to enrol international students — a substantial revenue stream. Today, the university sued the administration, and a US judge quickly placed a temporary freeze on the policy until a hearing can be held.\n\nAlthough the Trump team has terminated grants at other research institutions — such as Columbia University in New York City — the cancellations at Harvard are exceptional in scale. The vast majority of the university’s NIH awards have been terminated, for example. And the cuts across multiple agencies include funding for stated priorities of the Trump administration, such as artificial intelligence and quantum physics. A grant for a quantum materials centre originally worth $20 million was axed, along with several multimillion-dollar grants for quantum computing. Many of these grants have multi-institution collaborators whose funding situations are now unclear.\n\nAlan Garber, Harvard’s president, arrives for a graduation ceremony at the university. Credit: Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty\n\nThe Trump team has alleged that Harvard and other universities have fostered an environment of antisemitism. In e-mails it sent justifying the grant terminations, the administration said that Harvard has also engaged in “race discrimination” in admissions .\n\nIn April, government officials presented Harvard with a list of demands that must be met for the university to continue receiving federal money, some of which would give the government oversight of its admissions and hiring practices. Harvard denied the request publicly, saying that it would be a violation of academic freedom. In response, the administration froze the institution’s research grants. Harvard sued on 21 April, arguing that the government was withholding federal funding “as leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard”.\n\nWhen asked for a response to last week’s terminations, a Harvard spokesperson pointed Nature to public comments made by university president Alan Garber on 14 May : “We stand behind our thousands of outstanding faculty, postdoctoral, staff, and student researchers. Together they continue to make revolutionary discoveries, cure illness, deepen our understanding of the world, and translate that understanding into impact … It is crucial for this country, the economy and humankind that this work continue.”\n\nThe DoD did not respond to Nature ’s request for comment, and the NSF declined to comment. Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said in a statement: “Harvard has turned their once-great institution into a hot-bed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators. They have repeatedly failed to take action to address the widespread problems negatively impacting American students and now they must face the consequences of their actions.” A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the NIH, stated that “the HHS is taking decisive action to uphold civil rights and protect taxpayer investments in higher education”.\n\nLaboratory losses\n\nScientists at Harvard who have lost funding spoke to Nature about the impact of the terminations on their research.\n\nHow Trump’s attack on universities is putting research in peril\n\nDavid Charbonneau, an exoplanet researcher at Harvard, had a multi-year NSF grant worth $538,000 terminated with one year to go. The grant funded operation of the Arizona-based Tierras Observatory, which records tiny dips in light from stars — a telltale sign of an exoplanet passing in front of them. Charbonneau has managed to secure funding from Harvard to pay the postdoctoral fellow who has been operating Tierras for the next year, but beyond that, it’s unclear what will happen. “How does cutting a research grant in astrophysics to look for planets orbiting other stars address antisemitism on campus?” Charbonneau asks.\n\nPostdocs and students are some of the primary targets of the administration’s cuts. The NSF cut a $43-million grant that included all of Harvard’s funding for the agency’s graduate-research fellowship programme . An NSF source who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press tells Nature that the fellowships have not been terminated, but that students cannot access the funds unless they transfer to a new institution.",

          "abstract": "I spend nearly as much time on planning and documenting experiments as I do on running them. Credit: Michael Copeland\n\nLast September, right after finishing my PhD in biomedical sciences, I joined BrainStorm Therapeutics as one of its co-founders and lead scientist.\n\nI stumbled across the biotechnology start-up company, based in San Diego, California, by happenstance: a recruiter for another job I’d applied for unsuccessfully was also recruiting for BrainStorm. A meeting with two of the company’s co-founders clarified for me that we were a good match: I had the niche scientific expertise they were looking for, and the company was exactly aligned with my interests and career goals. I’d known before starting my PhD that I wanted a career in industry, and I’d become increasingly drawn to the fast-paced start-up world.\n\nAnd Brainstorm’s mission, to overcome the more-than-90% failure rate of clinical trials involving neurological diseases, by using brain organoids for drug discovery, appealed to me. During my PhD at the University of California, San Diego, one of my projects focused on modelling human diseases using brain organoids.\n\nA brain organoid is essentially a tiny 3D sphere of brain cells that we grow from stem cells derived from a patient. The organoids act like mini brains, with multiple cell types and spontaneous electrical activity. In contrast to conventional disease models involving mice, which have largely failed to predict efficacy of treatments in humans, organoids present an all-in-human system to evaluate therapeutics using clinically relevant screening endpoints. BrainStorm uses brain organoids in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) to discover therapeutics for diseases including Parkinson’s and rare genetic epilepsies.\n\nFor me, landing this role is a great example of how luck often plays a major part in our career trajectories; sometimes you just have to be in the right place at the right time. It’s certainly not easy — by the time I spoke to the recruiter, I’d already spent several months unsuccessfully applying for jobs while wrapping up graduate school — but persistence is key.\n\nIn my first few months, I’ve seen first-hand how biotech is a wildly different beast from academia. It soon became clear that organizational skills, which I’ve written about for Nature’ s Careers section , are even more crucial in business than they were during my PhD. These skills, incidentally, served me well: I graduated in five years on the dot, well below the average for my laboratory, despite facing delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and twice going on strike as a member of the University of California academic workers’ union.\n\nTime management for entrepreneurs\n\nIn a previous article for Nature , I mentioned that one of the most challenging aspects of graduate school for me was that it’s easy to waste days on unimportant or unfocused work. This is doubly true as an entrepreneur. You’re your own boss, so there’s no one else to hold you accountable and ensure that you spend your time and energy wisely.\n\nJust like during graduate school, I manage my goals at an annual, a quarterly and a weekly level. I always start with the big picture: where do the other co-founders and I want our company to be, a year from now, and how should we be spending our time to accomplish this? These goals will inevitably shift, too, so it’s important to revisit the conversation regularly. I use a Notion page to track our high-level goals over time.\n\nI’ve learnt that a common challenge for biotech start-ups is to work out how much effort to devote to fundraising, as opposed to research. There’s no single answer that works for every company, but it’s important to regularly audit whether you’re balancing these tasks appropriately for your goals.\n\nI’ve continued to plan how I’ll spend every hour in my workdays, using the task-management tool Todoist and Google Calendar. I build this plan after our Monday-morning meetings, in which the team discusses goals for the week and divides up action items. Once a month, I look back at how I’ve spent my time and evaluate whether I need to make any adjustments.\n\nFor a start-up on a lean budget, time is your most valuable asset; guard it closely. Don’t be afraid to decline commitments that don’t align with your long-term vision.\n\nTime management for scientists\nAs I did in graduate school, I take 5 minutes first thing every morning to check my RSS-feed aggregator and bookmark any papers that I want to read later. I block out an hour or two on Friday mornings to read through these and take notes. I also like to set aside time for continued learning; there are a ton of free or low-cost online courses available from sites like Coursera, Udemy and edX. During my lunch break, I’ll often watch course videos on topics ranging from AI and programming to business and finance.\n\nI have a lot more meetings these days (internal discussions, investment pitches, networking events and so on) than I did in graduate school, so my calendar varies a lot, day-to-day. I try to batch meetings together in the first or the second half of the day, so that I can spend the other half focusing on research. I spend a large portion of my time growing organoids and running experiments, as well as writing code for AI disease-modelling work.\n\nAcademia is the Wild West when it comes to lab notebooks, in that nothing is standardized, but record-keeping becomes a lot more serious in industry (I think this is true in any company, even more so for one engaged in biomedical research). Maintaining a detailed electronic lab notebook is crucial for documenting inventions, ensuring regulatory compliance and building an organized data repository (this can be virtual) for investors. I spend nearly as much time planning and documenting my experiments as I do actually running them.",

          "abstract": "The year was 2013, and the release of a hotly anticipated zombie-apocalypse video game was on the horizon.\n\nThe game, called The Last of Us , invited players to explore what then seemed a fanciful scenario: a world devastated by a pandemic in which a pathogen kills millions of people.\n\nUnlike in many apocalypse fictions, the pathogen responsible wasn’t a bacterium or a virus, but a fungus called Cordyceps that infects humans and takes over their brains.\n\nWill bird flu spark a human pandemic? Scientists say the risk is rising\n\nThe writers at game studio Naughty Dog, based in Santa Monica, California, were inspired by real fungi — particularly Ophiocordyceps unilateralis , known as the zombie-ant fungus. The fungus infects insects and releases chemicals into the animals’ brains to change their behaviour. Ahead of the game’s release, Naughty Dog turned to scientists, including behavioural ecologist David Hughes, a specialist in zombie-ant fungi (he named one after his wife), to field questions from the media about the fungal and pandemic science that inspired the story. Hughes, who is at the Pennsylvania State University in University Park, has since moved to studying climate change and food security.\n\nThe Last of Us spawned a sequel game in 2020 and a critically acclaimed television show, the second season of which concludes on 25 May on HBO.\n\nHughes spoke to Nature about his experience consulting on the game and why COVID-19 changed our appetite for zombies.\n\nWhat was your involvement with the game?\n\nNaughty Dog studios asked me and a few other people who were notable in this space, including psychologists, to talk about whether we could have a global pandemic. Of course, in the intervening period, we all learnt that the answer was yes.\n\nThey asked us to go around Europe and do a series of lectures to stave off critique and provide support to the idea that infections that jump from one species into another — zoonotic infections — are not only possible, but actually they’re the predominant mechanism by which humans are infected with new parasites that cause disease. I had the good fortune to go to the studios and see the artistry that was involved, and meet the team and the voice actors of the video game.\n\nBehavioural ecologist David Hughes advised the game’s writers. Credit: Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences at Penn State\nWhat did you make of the science in the game?\n\nI was really impressed by how much the game’s writers got into the science of it and started to understand things like fungi and slime moulds, and just trying to think about the ways in which these organisms do their business. They really took it by themselves and incorporated those elements into the game.\n\nI think they were even mail-ordering slime moulds so they could just leave it out on a petri dish and examine it. And you see that throughout the game. And now in the TV programme, in the intros, they have these slime balls. The writers were geeky, and understanding fungi is not complex, so they ran with it.\n\nDid you play the games?\n\nI tried and I failed miserably! I’m just a typical hopeless scientist.\n\nA scene from the show showing Cordyceps fungus growing out of the body of a human it has infected. Credit: Liane Hentscher/HBO\nIs the idea of a Cordyceps pandemic realistic?\n\nIt is not unrealistic that fungi can infect humans if they come from animals. It is unrealistic to think that they could cause the behavioural changes in humans. The writers took liberties. They had different stages about how the infection changes over time. That’s all fanciful, of course.\n\nLooking at the second season of the TV show, it was interesting that they have this communicative nature of the spores or the fungal hyphae. That’s interesting because we know fungi are connected like that over many kilometres — for example, the mycorrhizal fungi, which are underneath root systems in trees, do that effectively.",

          "abstract": "Anatomy of a Train Wreck: The Rise and Fall of Priming Research Ruth Leys Univ. Chicago Press (2024)\n\nIn 1996, psychologists reported that people walk more slowly after reading words associated with ageing, such as ‘grey’ and ‘old’. This delightfully unexpected finding — an example of a phenomenon called social priming, in which stimuli such as meaningful words unconsciously influence behaviour — became one of the most influential results in the field of social psychology ( J. A. Bargh et al. J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 71 , 230–244; 1996 ).\n\nIt also heralded a reproducibility crisis . In 2012, another team of psychologists reported that it had tried and failed to replicate the result. Despite a vigorous defence of the original study in now-deleted blogposts by its lead author, John Bargh, most psychologists have since concluded that what they came to call the elderly effect is probably not real. As other results in the field also toppled, the crisis stimulated fierce debate about how to study the ways in which humans think and behave .\n\nWhat’s next for psychology’s embattled field of social priming\n\nThis revealing episode is the subject of Anatomy of a Train Wreck , in which historian of science Ruth Leys asks how a supposed breakthrough in a provocative and influential research field turned out, ultimately, to be a cautionary tale. Packed with compelling research, her engaging account will be of interest to anyone curious about psychology and influences on human behaviour.\n\nLeys begins by examining one of the dominant strands of social psychology in the 1970s and 80s, attribution research. Investigations of how people understand their own and others’ behaviours, as the result of either one’s character or of circumstances, suggested that people are sometimes ignorant of why they take the actions that they do. For instance, people tend to make up explanations — insisting, say, that they chose one of two identical objects because they had ‘noticed’ that one was of higher quality.\n\nThis work laid the foundations for theories of social priming by seeming to show that actions are not — or at least, not always — the product of conscious decision-making, but can be the result of unconscious processes.\n\nConforming to expectations\n\nLeys then carefully recounts social priming’s troubles. Critics argued that the elderly effect was a consequence of participants conforming to experimenters’ expectations about how they would behave, rather than responding to the cue words alone. Avoiding inadvertently influencing participants is a familiar methodological difficulty in psychology experiments, which Bargh insisted his team had addressed. Nonetheless, repeated attempts to replicate the finding failed. So did efforts to replicate many other examples of social priming — such as the ‘professor effect’, in which thinking of a professor while taking a test supposedly improves results.\n\nReplication games: how to make reproducibility research more systematic\n\nLeys goes beyond this history to question theories that underpin the fields of social psychology and cognitive science. Her critique is influenced by the philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe’s classic work on the theory of human action, Intention (1957). Like Anscombe, Leys highlights the difference between reasons and causes when it comes to explaining and justifying actions.\n\nBehaviours make sense in light of people’s reasons — they might buy ice cream because they want to eat ice cream, for instance. By contrast, actions needn’t make sense in light of causes — someone could buy ice cream because they are hypnotized, say, regardless of their wants and needs. Leys argues that many social psychologists, including Bargh, have missed this difference; they focus exclusively on the causes of actions and ignore people’s reasons. And, she continues, social-priming experiments fail to replicate, in part, because people always have unique reasons for their actions, which depend on their individual histories. For instance, she suggests, whether people walk more slowly when they read a word such as ‘old’ depends on what they want and believe: after all, they could equally well walk faster to help an old person.\n\nA person’s behaviour is shaped by context.

HKU stands ready to welcome affected students at Harvard who wish to explore options and pathways for continuing their studies with us,” a spokesperson for HKU told Nature .\n\nHong Kong University of Science and Technology has also invited current and prospective international undergraduates and postgraduates at Harvard and other US universities to transfer, and at least one other Hong Kong-based university has offered similar support.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security terminated Harvard’s ability to enrol and host international students on 22 May. A press release from the department stated that the university had “created an unsafe campus environment by permitting anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators to harass and physically assault individuals, including many Jewish students”.\n\nOn Friday, Harvard filed a lawsuit against the government, challenging the decision. A judge in Massachusetts temporarily blocked the government’s policy.\n\nHarvard hosts more than 7,000 international undergraduate and postgraduate students with visas. “Thousands of international students and scholars have done nothing wrong. It is extreme cruelty for the government to make innocent people collateral damage,” says Suo.\n\nGrants cut\n\nHarvard has become a target of the administration of US President Donald Trump. In April, the government demanded that Harvard grant it greater oversight of university admissions and hiring practices in order to continue receiving federal money. Harvard declined. The government has since cut billions of dollars’ worth of federal funding from the university, in the form of close to 1,000 grants previously given to researchers , according to an analysis by Nature .",

          "abstract": "Taking a risk by opening the door to a new research field can have negative consequences for scientists, at least in the short term, a study shows. Credit: Dwayne Senior/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nShifting to a different research field can have negative consequences for a scientist, according to an analysis 1 . A team assessed millions of scientific papers and concluded that, when a scientist moves away from their original area of expertise, their publications receive fewer citations than their previous work. The larger the shift, the greater the effect — a phenomenon the authors of the study have named the ‘pivot penalty’.\n\nRenewal of NIH grants linked to more innovative results, study finds\n\nThe study, published today in Nature , also investigates cases in which an external event such as a disease outbreak drives the shift in focus. The findings suggest potential consequences for the recent US research-funding cuts — targeted at research topics including misinformation and the health of minority groups — that could push scientists to change fields.\n\n“When you move out of the area in which you’re trusted, you lose that recognition,” says Kieron Flanagan, a science-policy specialist at the University of Manchester, UK, adding that he is not surprised by the results of the analysis. But the sheer amount of data that the team evaluated sets the study apart, he says.\n\n“I hadn’t seen an analysis of that particular issue done at that scale,” says James Wilsdon, director of the Research on Research Institute in London.\n\nQuantifying the pivot\n\nThe authors measured scientific pivots by scrutinizing the reference sections of 25.8 million research papers published between 1970 and 2015. They compared the citations in a paper with those cited by the same author in the previous three years; specifically, they analysed the journals in which the cited papers were published.\n\nGiven that journals are mostly topic-specific, this shows the scientific fields that a researcher typically draws from, says Dashun Wang, a computational social scientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and a co-author of the study. “If, all of a sudden, I’m citing journals that I’ve never cited, it’s an indication that I’m doing something very different than what I usually do,” Wang says.\n\nAccording to the analysis, a pivot is large if, for instance, a researcher moves from crime-data assessment to forecasting the spread of COVID-19. By contrast, a small pivot would be moving from research on bat-derived influenza viruses to studying the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe researchers found that, the larger the pivot size, the less likely a paper is to rank among the top 5% most-cited papers published in its field that year. They also determined that it was more difficult for scientists to get their papers published after a pivot (see ‘When risks don’t pay off’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\n“It’s a very strong relationship, and it’s pretty universal,” says co-author Benjamin Jones, an economist at Northwestern University, who points out that the trend holds for patents as well. The team analysed 1.7 million patents granted in the United States from 1980 to 2015 and found a similar phenomenon when evaluating the technology areas listed in a patent’s citations.\n\nThe authors were motivated to investigate research pivots because of the massive shift towards studying COVID-19 during the pandemic . “We thought, ‘this is great that everyone wants to help, but how helpful will it be when people are jumping in from areas further and further away [from COVID-19]?’,” Jones says. The analysis found that, even though COVID-19 research was in high demand and papers on the topic were more likely to be published in high-impact journals during the pandemic, researchers coming into the area from outside fields still experienced the pivot penalty.",

Credit: Addy Graham/University of Arizona\n\nChina has sent a probe on an ambitious mission to grab rocks from a near-Earth asteroid and return them to Earth before making a final visit to a distant comet.\n\nTianwen-2 blasted off from Xichang launch centre in southern China at 1:31 am Beijing time today.\n\n“Watching it tear through the sky, in that moment, my heart truly swelled with emotion,” says Su Yan, chief designer of the mission’s data-collection system at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) in Beijing, who witnessed the launch from Xichang.\n\n“I was thrilled to hear about the successful launch,” adds Mikael Granvik, a planetary scientist at Luleå University of Technology in Kiruna, Sweden.\n\nThe spacecraft is now on its way to Kamo‘oalewa, an asteroid between 40 and 100 metres wide. The asteroid’s small size and fast spin — a full rotation takes only 28 minutes — will make gathering samples challenging.\n\nOther countries have brought back samples from asteroids. Japan nipped bits off asteroids Itokawa and Ryugu , and the United States snatched samples from Bennu . China has previously returned samples from the Moon’s near and far sides.\n\nKamo‘oalewa is considered a quasi-satellite of Earth: it dances around the planet in an oscillating orbit, but is too far away to be tied to Earth by gravity, as the Moon is. The asteroid basically hangs around Earth’s vicinity, says Li Chunlai , a planetary scientist at the NAOC.\n\nBy studying samples from Kamo‘oalewa, researchers hope to determine whether it was once part of the Moon — and was chipped away during a collision event — or has escaped from the asteroid belt that circles between Mars and Jupiter. “This is still debatable,” says Marco Fenucci, a mathematician who studies the dynamics of small astronomical bodies at the European Space Agency, near Rome. No asteroids in the Solar System are known to come from the Moon. “I am really excited for what is to come and to see what surprises this asteroid will reveal,” says Fenucci, following news of the successful launch. He expects researchers will learn a lot about asteroids of Kamo‘oalewa’s size from the mission.\n\nThe samples will also help researchers to understand how asteroids form and evolve, says Li.\n\nThree options\n\nAs Tianwen-2 heads towards Kamo‘oalewa, it will make a few tweaks to its course, open up its solar-panel wings and test its scientific instruments. It is scheduled to arrive at its first stop in the middle of next year, and stay there for about nine months, according to posts on social media.\n\nThe Tianwen-2 team doesn’t quite know what to expect when the craft arrives at Kamo‘oalewa, so has planned three approaches for collecting samples. The first strategy involves the probe descending to about one metre above the asteroid, and hovering while a robotic arm extends to collect material from the surface. The spacecraft could also extend a sampling probe that brushes up loose material. And if conditions permit, the spacecraft will land on the asteroid with its three legs and anchor itself with the robotic arm to collect material.",

          "title": "‘A funeral for our careers’: Trump’s science cuts spill onto Canadian turf",
          "authors": "Brian Owens",
          "abstract": "As US science policy continues to shift under the administration of President Donald Trump, the impacts are rippling beyond the nation’s borders. In Canada, researchers are feeling the heat. Canadian academics are some of the Americas’ top research collaborators, and receive funding from US agencies, either directly or through international partnerships. As a result, they have not been spared the funding cuts and job losses that are plaguing their US counterparts.\n\nTo Jeff Cardille, a landscape ecologist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, the trend is clear: all US-funded international projects he’s involved in have been cut since January. These studies focused on deforestation and land-use changes, but Cardille is reluctant to give more details, to avoid putting his colleagues’ jobs in jeopardy.\n\n“It feels strange,” he says. “Two months ago, I would have been thrilled to talk” about the work. “Now, I don’t feel comfortable even mentioning these things existed.”\n\nThe loss of these projects disrupts not only his work, but also that of his students who were planning to make them part of their scientific training. “I just recruited a graduate student from Mexico, now I don’t know what I can promise her in terms of research experience,” he says.\n\nElena Bennett, an ecologist at McGill University (and Cardille’s wife), is also aware of several international projects that have been shut down, including some that she was involved in. She is similarly hesitant to say more.\n\n“Some were just told ‘you’re done, move on’,” says Bennett. “Others are unsure if they’re still going to get funding, if they still have jobs. Everything is on hold until we see how this will shake out.”\n\nThe uncertainty, and the seemingly random nature of the cuts and firings, are taking a toll on those affected. “Every time I get on a Zoom call there is another person crying,” says Cardille. “Every meeting feels like a funeral for our careers.”\n\nEcologist Elena Bennett has witnessed the discontinuation of some projects. Credit: Yannick Peterhans / USC Wrigley Institute\nLong-standing links\n\nThere is a long history of close partnerships and collaboration in science between Canada and the United States, says Chad Gaffield, chief executive of the U15, a group of some of Canada’s most research-intensive universities, in Ottawa. But in recent years, many countries have begun to focus more on their own domestic capacity to underpin their sovereignty, allowing them to engage internationally without leaving them vulnerable to geopolitical shifts.\n\n“There’s no doubt the world of research is global, but as we learnt in the pandemic, we’re not living in a global village,” he says. “However intertwined we are, borders still make a big difference.”\n\nResearchers in Canada receive funding from a variety of US funding agencies, but the largest share comes from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. In the 2023 fiscal year, Canada received more than 90 NIH awards, which amounted to roughly Can$60 million (US$45 million). The total research budget of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) is around Can$1.3 billion.\n\nResearchers at McGill University and its affiliates currently lead 7 projects funded by the NIH and collaborate on another 86 that are led by institutions in the United States, according to a university spokesperson. In the 2023 fiscal year, around 2% of McGill’s total research funding came from US funders, says Dominique Bérubé, McGill’s vice-president of research and innovation, so the direct financial effects of any cuts on the university will be limited. “Cuts to that total won’t impact the university in a major way, but it might impact individuals who are more connected to their US collaborators,” she says.\n\nMcGill University leads seven NIH-funded projects and collaborates on dozens more led by U.S. institutions. Credit: Gabriel Mello/Getty\n\nOther institutions, such as the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada, are in a similar situation. “Of UBC’s total research funding, only about 1% comes from the US NIH,” says a university spokesperson. The University of Toronto is aware of a few cancelled grants and is continuing to monitor the situation closely, says a spokesperson. But, they add: “At this point, it is too early to fully assess the impact of the current uncertainties for our researchers receiving funding from US government sources, as well as for any research collaborations with colleagues in the United States.”\n\nVincent Poitout, vice-rector of research at the University of Montreal, says that the university gets between about Can$4 million and $5.5 million a year from the NIH. “It’s not an insignificant amount at all,” he says. Part of Poitout’s own research on diabetes is funded by a portion of a four-year NIH grant, known as a sub-award, held by a colleague at the University of California, Davis. This year’s portion of the award arrived in mid-April, about a month later than usual. The timing was fortuitous: an NIH policy issued on 1 May stipulates that all grants that include foreign sub-awards must be paused until a new formula for such awards is issued in the autumn. “Thankfully, our own grant seems to be safe, but others have been cut,” he says.\n\nHowever, Poitout says that uncertainty around whether the funding will continue after the autumn is almost worse than knowing it will be cut, especially for the postdoctoral researcher and master’s student who are working on the grant. “It’s starting to create chaos, making people so worried they’re paralysed,” he says. “But I’ll never have my students pay the price, I’ll find a way to continue their training.”\n\nIt is not just the potential loss of grant money that is affecting researchers in Canada, says Sarah Laframboise, executive director of the campaign group Evidence for Democracy in Ottawa. She says that the cuts to funding and staff are disrupting a lot of key connections in joint research projects, with Canadian researchers sometimes abruptly losing contact with their US counterparts.\n\nShe says that big cuts to staff at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has made fisheries-management collaborations more difficult and could disrupt the data sharing that Canada relies on for weather forecasting and disaster management. “The loss of that data will be very detrimental to not only researchers but everyday Canadians as well,” Laframboise says.\n\nSarah Laframboise worries about the Trump administration’s restrictions on certain fields of research.\n\nLaframboise is also concerned about the Trump administration’s crackdown on research areas that are considered to be ‘political’, such as anything related to climate, environment, race and gender. Many funders, including the NIH, now have lists of words that could trigger a review of grant applications.\n\n“I worry about the politicization of these words and subject areas, and whether those ideological shifts might come into Canada,” she says.\n\nThat concern is not unfounded. Some researchers in Canada who are working on US-funded projects have been sent a questionnaire to determine how their work aligns with the Trump administration’s political agenda, including questions about whether the work contains components on climate justice; diversity, equity and inclusion; or gender ideology. In April, a Canadian cancer-research group involved in an NIH clinical-trials network was forced to remove gender-inclusive language from its trial protocols.\n\nThis message has also made its way into the country’s political discourse. During campaigning for the Canadian election in April, the leader of the Canadian Conservative Party, Pierre Poilievre, pledged to end the “imposition of woke ideology in the allocation of federal funds for university research”. On 28 April, the Conservatives lost the election to the Liberal Party led by Mark Carney, who took a harder line against Trump.\n\nRecruitment opportunity\n\nAlthough the turmoil in the United States has extended to Canada, there is a silver lining — it has provided a potential opportunity to attract talented US researchers looking for international career options. A March poll on the Nature website found that more than three-quarters of respondents were considering leaving the United States for Europe or Canada because of the disruptions caused by Trump’s administration.\n\n“We’ve been very dependent on the US system, however there might be an important opportunity for Canada to re-establish itself in many areas of research,” says Bérubé. Online discussions have started to circulate, centring on how Canada could capitalize on an exodus of talent from the United States. Poitout says that he has already been contacted by some US colleagues about a potential move.\n\nCanada already has programmes in place to attract foreign research talent. The Canada Excellence Research Chairs (CERC) offer either Can$1 million or Can$500,000 per year for 8 years, specifically designed to draw world-class researchers who are interested in relocating their laboratories to a Canadian university. The programme is not offered every year, but the latest competition opened in January 2025, with around 25 positions available.",

          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "The increasing digitization of microscope slides is making pathology more amenable to advances in AI. Credit: Getty\n\nIf you’ve ever had a biopsy, you — or at least, your excised tissues — have been seen by a pathologist. “Pathology is the cornerstone of diagnosis, especially when it comes to cancer,” says Bo Wang, a computer scientist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nBut pathologists are increasingly under strain. Globally, demand is outstripping supply, and many countries are facing shortages. At the same time, pathologists’ jobs have become more demanding. They now involve not only more and more conventional tasks, such as sectioning and staining tissues, then viewing them under a microscope, but also tests that require extra tools and expertise, such as assays for genes and other molecular markers. For Wang and others, one solution to this growing problem could lie in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI tools can help pathologists in several ways: highlighting suspicious regions in the tissue, standardizing diagnoses and uncovering patterns invisible to the human eye, for instance. “They hold the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility and also efficiency,” Wang says, “while also enabling new research directions for mining large-scale pathological and molecular data.”\n\nChatGPT for science: how to talk to your data\n\nOver the past few decades, slides have increasingly been digitized, enabling pathologists to study samples on-screen rather than under a microscope — although many still prefer the microscope. The resulting images, which can encompass whole slides, have proved invaluable to computer scientists and biomedical engineers, who have used them to develop AI-based assistants. Moreover, the success of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek has inspired researchers to apply similar techniques to pathology. “This is a very dynamic research area, with lots of new research coming up every day,” Wang says. “It’s very exciting.”\n\nScientists have designed AI models to perform tasks such as classifying illnesses, predicting treatment outcomes and identifying biological markers of disease. Some have even produced chatbots that can assist physicians and researchers seeking to decipher the data hidden in stained slices of tissue. Such models “can essentially mimic the entire pathology process”, from analysing slides and ordering tests to writing reports, says Faisal Mahmood, a computer scientist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. “All of that is possible with technology today,” he says.\n\nBut some researchers are wary. They say that AI models have not yet been validated sufficiently — and that the opaque nature of some models poses challenges to deploying them in the clinic. “At the end of the day, when these tools go into the hospital, to the bedside of the patient, they need to provide reliable, accurate and robust results,” says Hamid Tizhoosh, a computer scientist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “We are still waiting for those.”\n\nBuilding foundations\n\nThe earliest AI tools for pathology were designed to perform clearly defined tasks, such as detecting cancer in breast-tissue biopsy samples. But the advent of ‘foundation’ models — which can adapt to a broad range of applications that they haven’t been specifically trained for — has provided an alternative approach.\n\nAmong the best-known foundation models are the large language models that drive generative-AI tools such as ChatGPT. However, ChatGPT was trained on much of the text on the Internet, and pathologists have no comparably vast resource with which to train their software. For Mahmood, a potential solution to this problem came in 2023, when researchers at tech giant Meta released DINOv2, a foundation model designed to perform visual tasks, such as image classification 1 . The study describing DINOv2 provided an important insight, Mahmood says — namely, that the diversity of a training data set was more important than its size.\n\nBy applying this principle, Mahmood and his team launched, in March 2024, what they describe as a general-purpose model for pathology, named UNI 2 . They gathered a data set of more than 100 million images from 100,000 slides representing both diseased and healthy organs and tissues. The researchers then used the data set to train a self-supervised learning algorithm — a machine-learning model that teaches itself to detect patterns in large data sets. The team reported that UNI could outperform existing state-of-the-art computational-pathology models on dozens of classification tasks, including detecting cancer metastases and identifying various tumour subtypes in the breast and brain. The current version, UNI 2, has an expanded training data set, which includes more than 200 million images and 350,000 slides (see go.nature.com/3h5qkwb ).\n\nA second foundation model designed by the team used the same philosophy regarding diverse data sets, but also included images from pathology slides and text obtained from PubMed and other medical databases 3 . (Such models are called multimodal.)\n\nArtificial intelligence in digital pathology — time for a reality check\n\nLike UNI, the model — called CONCH (for Contrastive Learning from Captions for Histopathology) — could perform classification tasks, such as cancer subtyping, better than could other models, the researchers found. For example, it could distinguish between subtypes of cancer that contain mutations in the BRCA genes with more than 90% accuracy, whereas other models performed, for the most part, no better than would be expected by chance. It could also classify and caption images, retrieving text in response to image queries and vice versa, to produce graphics of the patterns seen in specific cancers. However, it was not as accurate in these tasks as it was for classification. In head-to-head evaluations, CONCH consistently outperformed baseline approaches even in cases where very few data points were available for downstream model training.\n\nUNI and CONCH are publicly available on the model-sharing platform Hugging Face (see go.nature.com/44g24w2 ). Researchers have used them for a variety of applications, including grading and subtyping neural tumours called neuroblastomas, predicting treatment outcomes and identifying gene-expression biomarkers associated with specific diseases. With more than 1.5 million downloads and hundreds of citations, the models have “been used in ways that I never thought people would be using them for”, Mahmood says. “I had no idea that so many people were interested in computational pathology.”\n\nOther groups have developed their own foundation models for pathology. Microsoft’s GigaPath 4 , for instance, is trained on more than 170,000 slides obtained from 28 US cancer centres to do tasks such as cancer subtyping. mSTAR (for Multimodal Self-taught Pretraining), designed by computer scientist Hao Chen at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and his team, folds together gene-expression profiles, images and text 5 . Also available on Hugging Face (see go.nature.com/3ylmauf ), mSTAR was designed to detect metastases, to subtype cancers and to perform other tasks.\n\nNow, Mahmood and Chen’s teams have built ‘copilots’ based on their models. In June 2024, Mahmood’s team released PathChat — a generalist AI assistant that combined UNI with a large language model 6 . The resulting model was then fine-tuned with almost one million questions and answers using information derived from articles on PubMed, case reports and other sources. Pathologists can use it to have ‘conversations’ about uploaded images and generate reports, among other things. Licensed to Modella AI, a biomedical firm in Boston, Massachusetts, the chatbot received breakthrough-device designation from the US Food and Drug Administration earlier this year.\n\nSimilarly, Chen’s team has developed SmartPath, a chatbot that Chen says is being tested in hospitals in China. Pathologists are going head to head with the tool in assessments of breast, lung and colon cancers.\n\nBeyond classification tasks, both PathChat and SmartPath have been endowed with agent-like capabilities — the ability to plan, make decisions and act autonomously. According to Mahmood, this enables PathChat to streamline a pathologist’s workflow — for example, by highlighting cases that are likely to be positive for a given disease, ordering further tests to support the diagnostic process and writing pathology reports.\n\nFoundation models, says Jakob Kather, an oncologist at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, represent “a really transformative technological advancement” in pathology — although they are yet to be approved by regulatory authorities. “I think it’ll take about two or three years until these tools are widely available, clinical proven products,” he says.\n\nAn AI revolution?\n\nNot everyone is convinced that foundation models will bring about groundbreaking changes in medicine — at least, not in the short term.\n\nOne key concern is accuracy. Specifically, how to quantify it, says Anant Madabhushi, a biomedical engineer at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Owing to a relative lack of data, most pathology-AI studies use a cross-validation approach, in which one chunk of a data set is reserved for training and another for testing. This can lead to issues such as overfitting, meaning that an algorithm performs well on data similar to the information that the model has encountered before but does poorly on disparate data.\n\n“The problem with cross-validation is that it tends to provide fairly optimistic results,” Madabhushi explains. “The cleanest and best way to validate these models is through external, independent validation, where the external test set is separate and distinct from the training set and ideally from a separate institution.”\n\nWhy tumour geography matters — and how to map it\n\nFurthermore, models also might not perform as well in the field as their developers suggest they do. In a study published in February 7 , Tizhoosh and his colleagues put a handful of pathology foundation models to the test, including UNI and GigaPath. Using a zero-shot approach, in which a model is tested on a data set it hasn’t yet encountered (in this case, data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, which contains around 11,000 slides from more than 9,000 individuals), the team found that the assessed models were, on average, less accurate at identifying cancers than a coin toss would be — although some models did perform better for specific organs, such as the kidneys.",

London, then New York City — at that time, I could find the financial support and intellectual environment I needed only by moving abroad.\n\nToday, many scientists in the United States are experiencing cuts to government research funding and face a similar reckoning . I’ve seen the evidence. I’m now back in Portugal, working as chief executive of the Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine (GIMM) in Lisbon. In the past 2 months, more than 30 junior researchers at US institutions have written to me to ask about job opportunities — 10 times what I would normally expect.\n\nEuropean countries must work together to become the global destination for scientific talent.\n\nHow the United States became a science superpower — and how quickly it could crumble\n\nSome efforts are under way . A European Union initiative offers incentives and protections to researchers affected by political instability or funding cuts. Programmes in France aim to host displaced or returning scientists.\n\nBut most of these initiatives are fragmented. A coordinated strategy is crucial to lure the brightest minds.\n\nCERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, shows what can be achieved. It was created in the 1950s by physicists, who persuaded governments to invest in shared infrastructure and long-term collaboration.

Funding for national priorities such as environmental and genomics research was paired with competitive working conditions — including fast-tracked immigration and world-class infrastructure.\n\nAnd China’s Thousand Talents and Ten Thousand Talents programmes have lured thousands of scientists with generous start-up funding — often exceeding US$500,000 and guaranteed for five to ten years — as well as the promise of autonomy over their research agenda and budget.\n\nCuts to US science will take a generation to repair — leaders must speak up now\n\nHow can Europe emulate these successes? More funding is key. Last year, two reports recommended that the budget for the European Framework Programme, which funds research and development across the EU, be doubled, from almost €100 billion (US$112 billion) for the 2021–27 cycle to between €200 billion and €220 billion for 2028–34 (see go.nature.com/3zqdjte and go.nature.com/4mpgdgh ). This would enable institutions to offer competitive salaries, state-of-the-art infrastructure and long-term career support.",

Credit: University of Jyväskylä\n\nMicroscopic images of tissue samples can be generated so convincingly by artificial intelligence (AI) that journal editors, peer reviewers and readers are being warned to take a much closer look when reading papers.\n\nA study that presented people with real and fake histological images — used to study the microscopic structure of tissues — found that many participants could not tell the difference. To make it easier to spot the fakes, the authors are urging journal editors to require raw data from researchers wanting to publish papers containing such images.\n\nIn the study, 816 undergraduate students at German universities were given eight genuine and eight fake histological images, and were asked to identify which were real. Of the 290 participants who said they hadn’t seen such images before, 55% could classify them correctly. Among the 526 participants who were familiar with such images, 70% classified them correctly, according to the study, published in Scientific Reports last November 1 .\n\n“I was really surprised how little it took to generate images that looked like true histology,” says study co-author Ralf Mrowka, a nephrologist at Jena University Hospital in Germany.\n\nResearchers and publishers use many tools and techniques to spot fake images . There are several AI-based systems on the market that can detect common signatures of doctored images such as the replication, deletion or splicing of part of the image, for example. But those approaches can’t reliably detect AI-generated images, Mrowka says.\n\nSuch tools are in development. For example, in March, the Vienna-based company ImageTwin announced that it is beta-testing a software function to detect AI-generated images . But it’s going to be difficult for these tools to keep up with rapidly advancing image-generation technology, Mrowka warns.\n\nThe fabrications have reached a level of quality “that will give editors, reviewers and readers a hard time”, he says. “Once I have trained an AI model to generate this type of data, I can generate endless new fake images” and also make modifications to them, he adds.\n\nA challenge for peer reviewers\n\nChhavi Chauhan, founder of Samast AI, a technology company in Cary, North Carolina, says she was surprised that the study categorized undergraduates as experts, despite having limited experience with histological images. She thinks the results might vary if the participants were actual specialists.\n\nChauhan, who is also director of scientific outreach at the American Society for Investigative Pathology in Rockville, Maryland, adds that the fact that the student participants were told there was a mix of real and fake histological images put them in a much better position to spot the fakes than peer reviewers of papers would be. When peer reviewers are assessing manuscripts, many wouldn’t scrutinize the histological images as closely as they would in a scenario where they knew there were fakes, she says.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nSome image-generation tools, such as Google DeepMind's SynthID, insert watermarks , which peer reviewers can be trained to look for. But it’s easy to bypass that feature in freely available tools, Mrowka says.",

          "abstract": "The dangers of wildfire smoke and other pollutants have been investigated at the Human Studies Facility. Credit: Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nA US laboratory that has been instrumental in documenting the impact of air pollution on human health is being shut down by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Scientists are rallying to save it.\n\nUS environmental agency halts funding for its main science division\n\nLocated on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), the Human Studies Facility is home to nine sealable chambers where government and academic scientists can safely test the physiological effects of wildfire smoke , vehicle exhaust fumes and other pollutants on willing human participants, often university students seeking cash.\n\nThe US government’s General Services Administration, which manages federal properties, cancelled its long-standing lease with the university in February, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which runs the lab, is now moving out of the state-of-the-art facility. The decision has sparked alarm in the research community that relies on the lab for its work, which scientists say cannot be replicated anywhere else in the United States.\n\n“We need this capability,” says Dan Costa, a former EPA toxicologist whose division used the chambers to collect data that supported air-pollution regulations crafted by the agency. “Virtually all of the air-quality standards that we have today are built around evidence from this exposure facility.”\n\nThe EPA did not respond to Nature ’s queries about the future of the facility, or scientists’ concerns over its abrupt shutdown.\n\nOn the chopping block\n\nThe decision to not renew the lease comes as the Trump team works to downsize the US government . The Department of Government Efficiency, launched by billionaire Elon Musk, says that the administration has terminated 563 leases worth US$262 million for facilities used by federal agencies, including the EPA.\n\nThe annual budget for running the Human Studies Facility, which opened in 1995, has been in the range of $3 million to $4 million in recent years, Costa says.\n\nA White House budget proposal released earlier this month would cut the EPA’s budget by more than half in the 2026 fiscal year, which begins in October. But sources inside the agency indicate that the administration has already moved to halt funding and wind down lab operations in the EPA’s main science arm, the Office of Research and Development, which includes the exposure lab.\n\nA pivotal lab\n\nThe Human Studies Facility and predecessor labs have played a pivotal part in the regulation of US air pollution. Here, researchers have tested hypotheses about the physiological effects on humans of breathing in particulate matter, chemicals and more in a controlled environment, multiple researchers told Nature . Experiments with human volunteers — at rest or on exercise bicycles, with or without face masks — yield direct evidence that cannot be provided by epidemiological studies and animal experiments.\n\nTrump gutted two landmark environmental reports — can researchers save them?\n\n“It’s a three-legged stool, and these different lines of evidence are mutually reinforcing,” says one EPA epidemiologist, who relies on the clinical exposure data to help verify work analysing vast public-health data sets. Without experimental data that can help to provide a mechanistic understanding of how pollution affects the human body, it’s going to be more difficult for the agency to craft safety regulations, says the scientist, who — like others in this story — was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nOver the years, experiments at the facility have shown that breathing in fine particles from fossil-fuel combustion harms the heart as much as, if not more than, the lungs. And some of the most important toxicology data on smoke inhalation have come from the human-exposure chambers, says Mary Rice, a pulmonologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.",

Credit: Du Cane Medical Imaging Ltd/Science Photo Library\n\nSpecial-agent immune cells carry information about the gut and fat tissue deep into the brain. This surveillance system, uncovered in mice, is crucial to the brain’s control of behaviour such as pursuit of food , researchers report today in Nature 1 .\n\nSimilar immune cells are known to populate the membranes covering the brain, but the newly identified cells have molecular traits that give them entry into the core of the organ. Their function is shaped by diet and the microbiome ; without them, even hungry mice are slow to eat.\n\n“It’s very exciting to see that from an organ that was considered completely isolated from the immune system,” says Michal Schwartz, a neuroimmunologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, who was not involved in the study.\n\nNeighbourhood watch\n\nAlmost every organ in the body houses its own immune cells . Researchers have long thought that most of the healthy brain’s ‘adaptive’ immune cells — those that target specific pathogens — reside in the meninges , the three protective membranes enclosing the brain.\n\nPrevious studies have hinted that adaptive immune cells called T cells might dwell inside the brain itself under stable conditions. But determining whether these cells are truly distinct from those in the meninges has been a challenge, says Tomomi Yoshida, a neuroimmunologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and a co-author of the latest work. “They didn’t really compare and contrast that element,” she says.\n\nGuardians of the brain: how a special immune system protects our grey matter\n\nTo gain a more definitive answer, Yoshida and her colleagues spent five years searching for T cells across the entire mouse brain. They found that T cells are concentrated in a hotspot in the subfornical organ, a structure in the centre of the brain that regulates a range of bodily processes, including eating and drinking . The scientists then sampled tissue from the human subfornical organ, where they also found T cells.\n\nIn both mouse and human brains, the subfornical T cells were distinct from those found in the meninges. They produced more proteins that enabled them to reside in brain tissue and secreted more immune-signalling proteins known as cytokines under normal conditions.\n\nCuriously, the researchers found that the T cells from inside mouse brains were very similar to those in the animals’ fat deposits. To understand this similarity, they gave some mice a high-fat diet. These mice ended up with more T cells in their fat and brain tissues than did mice that ate standard food — evidence of a link between fat mass and brain T-cell populations. After mice on the same diet fasted for 48 hours, the number of T cells in their brains rose and the number in their fat fell, suggesting that food intake affects the number of T cells travelling to the brain.",

          "abstract": "The requirement of evidence\n\nI was the one who found the cache of old books, including Principles of Archaeology , so I am leading the dig. Books can survive for decades if the storage conditions are favourable, as they were in the partially collapsed basement. Perhaps it fell down as the result of an earthquake? We know about earthquakes from our personal experiences, aka data, of the earth quaking.\n\nIt turns out archaeology is the study of the past through physical remains. Plenty of people have tried to figure out what happened to the People from Before, but I am using this ‘science of archaeology’. I have chosen the dig site to be one of their dumps. In The Before, each human was so rich they discarded tonnes of trash in their lifetimes. Yes, it boggles the mind. According to archaeology, we should dig straight down, and as we do so, we should uncover evidence of their past lives. We must study these physical remains objectively and hypothesize and draw scientific conclusions about their lives and what happened to them.\n\nThe nature of evidence\n\nThe top level of the dump is a mixture of sand and other minerals, dead leaves and unidentifiable organic matter — so, in other words, soil.\n\nThe second level of the dump is a fine grey ash with a lot of specks of metal. One of my assistants raises the hypothesis that this ash is from a volcano or meteor strike.\n\nBut in preparation for the dig, I studied various substances we might be expected to find, and I know this ash is cremated human remains. I point out some of the small bone fragments to make my case. Eventually, my whole team agrees.\n\nThe ash is important data; it is probably the remains of the People from Before. At the end of their era, there was a massive die-off. Why? This is the primary mystery we are attempting to solve.\n\nThe layer of ash is very thick, but I hypothesize that the evidence we seek is underneath.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nAfter several days of digging we finally make it through the ash layer. We uncover a layer made of their thin rectangular technological devices. These are primarily black plastic with the largest at 30 inches (we carefully measure). There are many, many smaller devices, all about 6 inches tall by 3 inches wide. According to our knowledge of The Before, these are called computers and store data and information. We all wonder why there are so many. We do not know.\n\nAn assistant hypothesizes that they needed many devices because they possessed a huge amount of data. Perhaps this is true, but we have never been able to access any of these data. This technology layer is useless to us.\n\nWe keep digging and eventually make it to the layer underneath the technology. I warn my fellow archaeologists to be on the special lookout for newspapers, magazines and books. They all nod. I don’t know why I tell them this; they know. Books and the like from Before are our most precious resources.\n\nThis layer contains more diverse materials, from bags made of plastic to dishes, clothing, toys and furniture made of plastic; along with some ceramics, glass, wood, fabric, metal and other materials.\n\nAn assistant yells, “I found something!”\n\nWe all stop our digging and traipse over to him.\n\nHands shaking, he’s holding out a single sheet of paper, somehow covered in plastic. It’s very colourful with blue, green, red and black letters and shapes; it’s as if it were brand new.\n\nThe words on the page are easy to read: “Get the latest cutting-edge brain-computer for free! Yes, you heard right! We are giving away the newest microelectrode array technology! Free tech! Free installation! Perfectly safe! With low-cost monthly data plans! Don’t miss out! Don’t get left behind! Text now!” The bottom of the sheet has a bunch of numbers and a larger square made of smaller black and white squares.\n\nInterpreting the evidence\n\nHypotheses depend on evidence; this sheet seems like important evidence. Its vertical position in the dump also seems important. But archaeology is new to me — and everyone else — so I’m not quite sure of the significance.\n\nWe take a break, and an assistant passes around the sheet. We all study it. We marvel at the pristine condition. We hypothesize.\n\n“Is it an advertisement for this brain-computer thing?” someone asks.\n\n“I guess,” I said. “But are they saying they’re going to put things in people’s brains? Why would they do that?” I feel like I almost understand this archaeology stuff, but I do not understand the People from Before at all.\n\n“And what’s a data plan?” an assistant asks.",

          "title": "Cancer-fighting immune cells could soon be engineered inside our bodies",
          "authors": "Cassandra Willyard",
          "abstract": "When Bruce Levine and his colleagues began attempting to engineer immune cells to fight cancer in the 1990s, few people thought they would succeed. “The wider community was very sceptical,” says Levine, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. When they presented their research at meetings, “we were in the last session on the last day, in a room no one could find”.\n\nToday, these engineered immune cells, called CAR T cells, are among the most powerful therapies oncologists have to treat many types of blood cancer. And studies suggest that they might hold promise for brain cancer and other solid tumours , as well as autoimmune and other diseases . One research firm estimates that the value of the CAR-T-therapy market, expected to hit US$11 billion this year, will grow to nearly $190 billion by 2034.\n\nBut CAR-T therapies come with a serious downside — they are laborious to make and difficult to administer. After removing the immune cells, called T cells, from a person’s blood, physicians ship them off to a manufacturer, where technicians genetically engineer the cells to carry a specialized protein called a chimeric antigen receptor (hence ‘CAR T’) on their surface. The cells are grown and amplified into hundreds of millions more cells, frozen and returned to the hospital for re-infusion. Because of the complexity, only about 200 centres in the United States offer the therapy.\n\nThe race to supercharge cancer-fighting T cells\n\n“This whole process, it’s just inefficient,” says Saar Gill, a haematologist and oncologist also at the Perelman School of Medicine. “If I’ve got a patient with cancer, I can prescribe chemotherapy and they’ll get it tomorrow.” With commercial CAR T, however, people have to wait weeks for treatment. That delay, along with the high cost of the therapy, plus the need for chemotherapy before people receive the CAR T cells, means many people who could benefit from CAR T never receive it. “We all want to get to a situation where CAR T cells are more like a drug,” says Gill.\n\nSome biotechnology companies have an answer: alter T cells inside the body instead . Treatments that deliver a gene for the CAR protein to cells in the blood could be mass produced and available on demand — theoretically, at a much lower price than current CAR-T therapies. A single dose of commercial CAR-T therapy costs around $500,000. A vial of in vivo treatment might cost an order of magnitude less.\n\nThe idea has some high-profile proponents. The founders of Capstan Therapeutics, a company in San Diego, California, that is focused exclusively on in vivo cell therapies, include CAR-T pioneers Levine and Carl June, as well as Drew Weissman, who won a Nobel prize for his work on messenger RNA vaccines. CRISPR–Cas9 pioneer and Nobel prizewinner Jennifer Doudna has co-founded a separate company, Azalea Therapeutics in Berkeley, California, that is developing in vivo CAR T. And big pharma is taking notice. In March, the biopharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca agreed to pay up to $1 billion for the Belgium-based in vivo CAR-T company EsoBiotec, which launched its first human trial of an in vivo CAR-T therapy in January.\n\nAlthough human trials have just begun, many researchers are excited about the potential of a simpler iteration of CAR T. “If it’s efficacious and safe, it could really challenge the current paradigm,” says Joseph McGuirk, a haematologist and oncologist who studies cellular therapies at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. And “we need to challenge the current paradigm”.\n\nBringing the outside in\n\nMany of the in vivo CAR-T therapies under development have taken pages from the ex vivo playbook. Similar to the approved therapies, in vivo approaches aim to destroy white blood cells called B cells, and so treat cancers that form in these cells. (CAR-T therapies destroy healthy B cells, too, but people can live without these cells.)\n\nAs with ex vivo , many in vivo therapies rely on an engineered version of a lentivirus to grab onto T cells and deliver the gene for the CAR protein into the cell’s genome (see ‘Made within’). But engineering cells inside the body is a tricky business. With ex vivo , the T cells have been removed from the body, so researchers don’t have to worry about introducing the gene into other cell types. But in the body, many cells share common receptors, so researchers have to find ways to specifically target T cells — or other immune cells that could join the fight.\n\n“The stumbling block is, how do you get it to the right cell, the right place, right time?” says Michel Sadelain, a genetic engineer and director of the Columbia Initiative in Cell Engineering and Therapy at Columbia University in New York City and another CAR-T pioneer.\n\nEach company has developed its own approach to solving this problem, and each has tweaked its vector in different ways. For example, Interius BioTherapeutics in Philadelphia, co-founded by Gill, is testing a vector that latches onto CD7, a protein found only on T cells and natural killer cells.\n\nUmoja Biopharma in Seattle, Washington, is testing a lentiviral vector decorated with a protein that targets three receptors on T cells at once. The company has evidence from animal models that this strategy is more effective than targeting just one receptor, and hopes that it will more closely mimic what happens when a T cell becomes activated naturally, after an infection, for example.\n\nIf effective, such approaches could simplify manufacturing and get CAR-T therapy to more people more quickly. McGuirk notes that when the ex vivo CAR-T therapy Carvykti (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) was approved in 2022 for people with multiple myeloma, the manufacturer had limited production capacity, leading to long waiting times.\n\n“We had 50 patients at one time on our wait list,” says McGuirk. “More than half of those patients died before we could get them a slot for manufacturing.”\n\nDo cutting-edge CAR-T-cell therapies cause cancer? What the data say\n\nIn addition to simplifying production, there is another potential advantage to in vivo treatment. With ex vivo approaches, people receive chemotherapy before CAR-T treatment to eliminate unedited T cells and make space for the edited ones to proliferate. The idea is to create a blank slate. But with in vivo approaches, people would forgo the pre-treatment chemotherapy. “We don’t want to kill the very T cells that we hope to transduce,” says Gill. That would eliminate chemotherapy-related side effects, such as a greater risk of infections. It might also mean that people who are too ill to receive chemotherapy could still be eligible for CAR-T therapy.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear, however, whether in vivo CAR T delivered through a viral vector can eliminate all the side effects that come with ex vivo approaches. After infusion, CAR T cells multiply in the body and release chemicals that ramp up the immune system. In some cases, they can cause an inflammatory storm known as cytokine release syndrome . “It’s like a train that is running out of control,” says Adrian Bot, chief scientific officer at Capstan Therapeutics.\n\nSome researchers suspect this might be less of a problem with in vivo approaches. That’s because the engineered T cells will be multiplying in the presence of other immune cells, including cells that could help to put the brakes on a runaway immune response, says Yi Lin, a haematologist and oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. As a result, the side effects might be milder, she says.\n\nEven so, these in vivo approaches are unlikely to eliminate the concerns that have arisen in the past couple of years about secondary cancers caused by CAR-T therapies. Although the risk is low, many countries require CAR-T therapies to carry a warning label detailing this risk. The issue is that lentiviral vectors permanently integrate the CAR gene into the genome of the T cell. Each time the cell divides, it produces more CAR T cells. That means T cells might go on attacking their targets for long periods — years, in some cases.\n\nAlthough that could be an advantage, researchers don’t have much control over where in the genome the lentivirus inserts the gene. If it lands in the wrong spot, it could prompt the formation of secondary cancers. Companies can screen for this problem with ex vivo therapies but not with in vivo .\n\nTurning to RNA\n\nInstead of viral vectors, Capstan and several other companies are turning to nanoparticles to ferry RNA into T cells. The RNA enters the cell’s cytoplasm, where its genetic information is used to make the CAR protein for only a short time. Although the therapy needs to be administered in multiple doses, it could prove to be safer. At the first sign of a serious problem, physicians could stop administering the treatment, and the CAR protein would go away in a few days or less.",

They had Hunter syndrome , a rare, incurable disease — predominantly affecting boys — in which a gene for an important enzyme is missing. Guilt compounded her grief when her attempts to resuscitate her youngest brother failed. She was just 19 years old.\n\nGordon went on to discover how merciless genetics can be. Her own three sons were all born with the condition. When her two eldest hit their second birthdays, the symptoms started to emerge: a thickening of facial features, loss of language, hearing and movement and other impacts to mental and physical development.\n\nBut she sees hope for her sons that was denied to her brothers. Her children are enrolled in a clinical trial testing a technology to carry a replacement for the missing enzyme, called iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), into the brain. Early results indicate improvement in some of the condition’s cognitive and physical symptoms. Gordon’s eldest sons are no longer deaf and they have started to run around. They are meeting developmental milestones she’d never dared to hope for. Her two-year-old, who started the therapy when he was just three months old, is showing none of the early symptoms. “When I look at them, I realize they have a chance of an actual future,” says Gordon.\n\n‘Big leap’ for Parkinson’s treatment: symptoms improve in stem-cells trials\n\nRegular infusions of replacement IDS has been the standard of care for the past two decades, and it protects important organs such as the liver and kidneys from damage. But without help, the large enzyme can’t make it through the protective barrier that separates the blood from one of the most important organs — the brain.\n\nFor Gordon’s children, that help comes from an innovative molecular transport system, a chemical tag attached to IDS that shuttles it through the tightly joined cells that make up the blood–brain barrier. Several such shuttles, which take advantage of natural transport systems in the brain, are now being developed. With the ability to move large biological drugs — including antibodies, proteins and the viruses used in gene therapy — these shuttles promise to revolutionize neuropharmacology. And that’s not just for rare diseases such as Hunter syndrome, but also for cancer , Alzheimer’s disease and other common brain disorders.\n\nThe field is in its infancy, and much is left to discover about how to target large therapeutic molecules to the exact spots in the brain where they’re needed, says James Gorman, principal investigator of the Wyss Institute Brain Targeting Program at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. Nevertheless, the excitement is palpable. “It seems like every major company in this space has a programme to develop brain shuttles,” he says.\n\nDazia Gordon’s three sons receive regular injections of an enzyme that has been designed to cross the blood–brain barrier.

Its hefty metabolic and other needs are supplied by around 650 kilometres of large and small blood vessels that are lined with a layer of tightly packed endothelial cells. This lining forms the blood–brain barrier that keeps out toxic molecules while allowing passage to those that the brain requires. Oxygen and other small, fat-soluble molecules simply diffuse through. But some molecules such as iron and glucose require specialized transporters that are embedded in the endothelial cells.\n\nPharmaceutical developers have generally tried to keep drugs for the brain small and fat-soluble enough to pass through the blood–brain barrier unhindered. Some small synthetic drugs take advantage of transporters — for example, the Parkinson’s disease drug levodopa hitches a ride on a transporter that normally grants access to an amino acid.\n\nBut a different approach is required for large biological drugs , which offer fresh ways of interrupting disease processes — such as breaking up clumps of proteins, replacing missing enzymes and fixing or replacing malfunctioning genes. These medicines don’t cross easily.\n\nThis key protein could be responsible for brain ageing\n\nIn the past four years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several antibodies that target the amyloid proteins that form brain plaques in Alzheimer’s disease. They are the first therapies to tackle the disease’s underlying pathology, but less than 0.1% of an intravenous dose gets through the blood–brain barrier.\n\n“With so little antibody getting into the brain, high doses have to be given — a waste of material, and a likely source of side effects that are occasionally serious,” says neurobiologist Dag Sehlin at Uppsala University in Sweden.\n\nHow this small amount of antibody penetrates the brain’s fortress had been a mystery until the past year or so. Research now indicates that its route is indirect, seeping into the cerebrospinal fluid from blood vessels in the brain sac where the barrier is somewhat less tight 1 .\n\nThis route is far from optimal. When small molecules cross the blood–brain barrier directly, they flow into the tiniest of capillaries that serve brain cells. When large molecules enter the cerebrospinal fluid, they tend to hang around the outside of the arterial blood vessels that carried them there, where a lot of the brain’s amyloid also settles. That presents two problems. The antibodies don’t distribute to deeper parts of the brain and they can attack the amyloid alongside the blood vessels, causing inflammation and small bleeds that can be life-threatening.\n\nScientists have been searching for better, direct routes into the brain for more than 25 years, says Azad Bonni, who heads neuroscience research and development at pharmaceutical company Roche in Basel, Switzerland, “but things are only now really taking off”.\n\nThe most advanced approach attempts to exploit the system involved in ensuring the brain’s supply of iron, which is required for many important enzymes and is carried through the blood by the protein transferrin (see ‘Crossing the divide’). This large iron-bearing molecule is shuttled across the blood–brain barrier by transferrin receptors on endothelial cells.\n\nSource: S. Edavettal et al. Med 3 , 860–882 (2022)\n\nWith enough protein-engineering skills, almost any therapeutic biological agent could be helped through the barrier by attaching it to a molecular construct that targets the receptor in the same way that transferrin does, says Bonni. The construct usually includes a small part of an antibody made to bind to the receptor.\n\n“It took many years of research work to figure out how to make a safe brain shuttle,” says Bonni. Researchers had to ensure that it wouldn’t interfere with the normal function of the transferrin receptor; that it wouldn’t get stuck inside the endothelial cells; and that the therapeutic agent it’s shuttling still works when it reaches its target.\n\nThe brain’s hall pass\n\nShuttle-based therapies are under active development for an array of brain conditions. “It’s now abundantly clear that we can get these drugs across the blood–brain barrier,” says Gorman. “The big frontier facing us is how to efficiently get them where they need to go within the brain for different diseases and with different cargoes.”\n\nSome diseases lend themselves particularly well to brain shuttles. Hunter syndrome has been one of the first to benefit. It is part of a family of rare genetic conditions known as lysosomal storage diseases. Lysosomes are subcellular waste-processing centres that contain enzymes (including IDS), which break down a cell’s waste products.\n\nCells consider foreign proteins, such as therapeutic IDS, as waste, and direct them straight to the lysosome, says Gorman, “which is perfect — because that is where the replacement enzyme needs to be”.\n\nEngineered nose bacteria sneak drugs into the brain",

          "authors": "Hannah Hackney",
          "abstract": "Hannah Hackney knew just enough about coding for artificial intelligence to be a useful teacher. Credit: MTStock Studio/Getty\n\nIn the lab at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, where I am a PhD student, my colleagues and I study the optical and electronic properties of organic molecules. Most of this work is based on chemical synthesis, but we complement it with the occasional use of software to predict and rationalize molecules’ properties.\n\nRecently, I wanted to understand how a specific reaction mechanism could explain why some molecules are much more stable than others that seem very similar. As I took on this project, I realized that my computational skills were not up to the task: I would need to learn to code so I could manage and process the large volumes of data that I was rapidly producing.\n\nFortunately, high-quality educational resources have never been more plentiful or accessible. I had already casually tried coding in my free time, relying mostly on free apps, YouTube videos and books. A colleague suggested that I try using artificial intelligence (AI) instead. I was amazed at how useful I found the free tools based on large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, for self-teaching, and how dramatically they accelerated my learning.\n\nI had experimented with ChatGPT before, but this was the first time I found it valuable enough to use in my work and daily life. The results of various other tasks hadn’t been sophisticated enough to be useful. For example, when I asked for ideas for reactions that I could try out to synthesize target molecules, it provided methods that I found either obvious or mistaken. When I fed it point-by-point notes to translate into the first draft of a document, I had to edit the prose too much to feel that it had really saved me effort.\n\nThe margins of existing knowledge\n\nI think the reason I find LLMs useful for coding, but unhelpful for many other tasks, is that there’s a sweet spot where the information that they produce is most likely to be useful for learning. I’ve spent years doing chemical synthesis on complex systems, so I’m an expert in the field, and understand the subtleties better than AI might (at least for now). As a result, I was disappointed when consulting AI for insight into difficult reactions.\n\nFor coding, self-teaching with AI works well for me because it’s much closer to the margins of my existing knowledge and experience. The idea that we learn best when we fit new concepts into what we already know is well established in theories of education. The early-twentieth-century Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky wrote about the “zone of proximal development”, a sweet spot where the learner can enjoy the guidance of a “more knowledgeable other”.\n\nI was already aware of the basic concepts and syntax of coding, having completed a couple of small introductory courses. This basic knowledge provided valuable foundations, which would have been difficult to establish without direction. I could then enjoy the guidance of my ‘more knowledgeable other’.\n\nDemocratization of learning\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of AI is that it enables a style of education that is usually very resource intensive — rapid question-and-answer. In most educational settings, it’s impractical to have a teacher on hand to answer every question or produce large volumes of personalized content. But the inherently conversational mode of a tool based on an LLM means that it replicates the speed and ease of a personal tutor.\n\nIt also streamlines the process of seeking information. Even if you are learning through a course, such as a set of videos or a book, it can take a lot of time and effort to find the answers to specific questions. For example, your question might be answered in an article, but with an explanation not suited to your skill level, so you have to spend more time searching for context or definitions. Or you might post on a forum asking for help and spend hours or days waiting for an answer.\n\nWith an LLM, you can tune the tone or skill level of an explanation, or ask follow-up questions about specific terms or concepts. The short feedback time helped me to enter a flow state, which created a sense of control and kept me motivated.\n\nAI provides the ‘scaffolding’\n\nI was initially surprised to learn that most of the popular free LLM-based tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek, can produce adequate code for simple tasks from a written input. This created a valuable opportunity to work on higher-level coding skills, including structure, design and debugging, which are not usually explored when you’re learning the basics.\n\nMost programmers will tell you that it is not specific knowledge of syntax and functions that makes a good coder. It’s bigger-picture, higher-order critical-thinking skills. Fortunately, most scientists and researchers have already developed many relevant skills: logical and algorithmic thinking, a sense of organization and long-range order, attention to detail and anticipation of possible failures.",

          "abstract": "In September 2022, during the Woman, Life, Freedom movement in Iran — sparked by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini — I resigned from my Iranian university position in protest . I was on a research visit to Mexico at the time, and couldn’t return home.\n\nScience became my refuge and lifeline. I moved to Italy, then Germany and now Canada, taking up temporary positions to continue my work on dark matter and black holes.\n\n‘I could not keep silent’: Iranian physicist resigns to join protests\n\nI am one of the few fortunate exiled scientists. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 122 million people worldwide are forcibly displaced. But there are no data on how many scholars are among these, or how many are silenced or cut off from their research by war, persecution, political unrest and violations of academic freedom — sometimes because of their work, or simply for expressing dissent or belonging to a marginalized group. Most support programmes focus on established researchers, often leaving graduate students and early-career researchers without help, visibility or a pathway to continue their education and research.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has revealed a troubling inconsistency in global academic solidarity. Some institutions and governments rallied to offer scholarships and support to Ukrainian students and researchers, yet similar opportunities are rarely offered to those experiencing crises elsewhere.\n\nFor displaced people, the challenges extend far beyond leaving home. Eligibility criteria for support are often too stringent. Many people flee at short notice and cannot retrieve degrees or transcripts required by host institutions as proof of qualifications. Their former universities might have been destroyed or closed, or be unwilling to provide documents owing to political pressures. Without these, even the most accomplished scholars can find themselves unable to apply for fellowships or academic positions.\n\nVisa insecurity is another barrier. Scholars from conflict regions often hold passports that make travel difficult. Their visa applications are subject to extensive delays or denials. Background checks can last months or sometimes more than a year, causing scholars to miss out on job opportunities and fellowships. These hurdles disrupt academic careers and send a damaging message: it’s too risky to support scholars from unstable or repressive regions.\n\nThese Gaza scientists are keeping research alive amid war, destruction and uncertainty\n\nEven when visas are secured, most fellowships are temporary. And they often emphasize research excellence to the detriment of other aspects of academic life. Many at-risk scholars are not granted faculty-member status, leaving them unable to teach, supervise students or contribute to departmental life. This causes a deep sense of disconnection from the academic community they once helped to build.\n\nLayered on top of this are isolation from family, friends and support networks, mental-health challenges and the constant pressure to prove one’s worth in an unfamiliar system. Despite being resilient, many at-risk scholars describe feeling invisible — trapped between the trauma of displacement and the unrealistic demands placed on them.\n\nTo genuinely support these scholars, institutions must adopt concrete, inclusive policies. First and foremost is recognition. A clear and expansive definition of who qualifies as an at-risk scholar is needed — one that includes graduate, postdoctoral and non-tenure-track researchers as well as those with established academic careers.",

Credit: Tom McHugh/Science Photo Library\n\nA small genetic change makes the bacterium that caused the plague less fatal but possibly more transmissible, allowing for greater disease spread in smaller populations 1 , a study in Science reports.\n\nThe bacterium Yersinia pestis caused the Black Death — killing up to 50 million people in the mid-fourteenth century — as well as an earlier plague across the Mediterranean in the sixth century ad . The bacteria still circulate in low levels in parts of the United States, Africa and Asia, and are typically transmitted to humans by infected fleas carried by rats or other rodents.\n\nPrevious research found that some strains of Y. pestis had reduced amounts of pla 2 , a gene associated with disease severity, but it was unclear why, says Ravneet Sidhu, a palaeogeneticist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and a co-author of the latest work. “Our findings in this study characterize a case in which a pandemic-causing pathogen has independently evolved to cause what we believe is a slightly weaker form of the disease,” she says.\n\nMice mortality\n\nTo understand the impact of the genetic change, the team infected mice with modern strains of Y. pestis that had normal levels of pla , had reduced levels of the gene or were unable to express it at all. When the bacteria were injected beneath the skin to mimic the form of plague that affects lymph nodes, mice infected with the reduced- pla strain lived for almost two days longer than did those infected with the normal strain. Mortality also decreased from 100% with the normal strain to 85% with the reduced- pla strain. However, when the team infected mice intravenously or through the nose to mimic blood- or lung-based infections, the pla -reduced strain was as fatal as the normal strain.\n\nThe team also looked at the genomes of ancient and modern strains of Y. pestis to find out how prevalent pla depletion was. Between 30% and 50% of ancient strains obtained from previously published studies showed signs of depletion, as did three modern strains, isolated from a human and two rats in 1994. Wanting to understand why pla was depleted, the researchers analysed the genetic data from these ancient and modern strains. They found that the reduction was caused by deletion of a 2,100-base-pair-long region of DNA containing the pla gene in one region of the genome, and the integration of a DNA molecule called a plasmid carrying the gene into other regions.\n\nSidhu says the team hypothesized that pla depletion occurred because repeated outbreaks of the plague decreased the density of rodent populations. Increasing the time for which rats were infectious would have given them more time to travel between fragmented populations, increasing the chance of them spreading the disease, she adds.",

Longo\n\nScientists have discovered an ancient protein that has the rare property of being ‘ambidextrous’ — it can function in mirror-image forms. The molecule could be a relic of a time when life based on mirror-image molecules existed on Earth.\n\nMany chemicals have a handedness, or chirality, and can exist in two mirror-image forms. But the building blocks of life tend to stick to one or the other. Sugars in nucleic acids such as DNA are right-handed — causing the DNA double helix to twist to the right, if you were looking down its axis — whereas the amino acids that build proteins are left-handed.\n\nI told AI to make me a protein. Here’s what it came up with\n\nScientists think that a preference for right-handed DNA and left-handed proteins could have helped to maintain the stability and function of biomolecules early in life’s evolution.\n\nLiam Longo, a protein historian at the Tokyo Earth-Life Science Institute, was examining a protein fragment, or peptide, that recognizes nucleic acids and is commonly found in DNA repair enzymes. He noticed that the structure was symmetrical around a central axis, and suspected that both left- and right-handed versions of the protein could bind DNA.\n\nThe symmetrical segment — called a helix-hairpin-helix motif — is common in proteins that can manipulate and bind DNA and RNA and is found across the tree of life, suggesting that it existed in an early ancestor of all cells, says Longo.\n\nForwards, backwards, this way, that way\n\nTo test his hunch about the molecule’s ambidexterity, Longo and his colleagues created ‘right-handed’ versions of the peptide, including an ‘ancestral’ form potentially similar to the one found in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of today’s cells.\n\nThe mirror-image peptides bound to DNA nearly as well as their twins, and normal, left-handed versions were able to bind mirror-image DNA. Further experiments showed that both left- and right-handed versions grabbed DNA molecules in similar ways. A study describing the phenomenon is published 1 in Angewandte Chemie .",

Some scholars argue that this presumed broadening of moral concern is driven by our increasing capacity to recognize, through reason, that the suffering of strangers matters as much as the suffering of those we love. Yet, recent research complicates this story. In several domains, younger children start out with a more expansive moral circle than older children and adults. Younger children are more likely than their older counterparts to judge relationally, physically and phylogenetically distant others as worthy of help or protection. These findings suggest, counterintuitively, that development may not widen our moral circle but may sometimes narrow it. This Perspective raises the possibility that, rather than focusing on overcoming biases against caring for distant others, we should also recognize that, in some domains, we possess an early-emerging tendency to care for them.",

We show that people expect rule-conformity and view it as socially appropriate. Rule-breaking is contagious but remains moderate. Pro-social motives and extrinsic incentives increase rule-conformity, but unconditional rule-following and social expectations explain most of it.

To prevent a response to self-DNA, cGAS activity is tightly regulated. Dysregulation of cGAS underpins interferonopathies, such as Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, as well as Lupus and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease. Thus, cGAS and its product cGAMP are therapeutic targets. However, if cGAS functions independently of cGAMP signaling is undefined. Here, we identified an alternative signaling pathway that cGAS engages independent of cGAMP synthesis. We demonstrate that alternative cGAS signaling promotes hyperexpression of CXCL1 and enhanced neutrophil recruitment that facilitates viral dissemination during herpes simplex encephalitis. Our study reports of an alternative cGAS response independent of cGAMP, highlighting a previously uncharacterized scaffold function for cGAS.",

          "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) begins with the assembly of clathrin onto the plasma membrane. These structures grow and stabilize to form clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which invaginate and accumulate cargo. Finally, through membrane fission, CCPs detach to form clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Mechanisms governing the transition of CCPs from flat-to-curved structures have been a matter of debate. GAK and its chaperone protein, Hsc70, are well known to mediate clathrin release from CCVs, and several studies have observed a late burst of GAK recruitment as CCVs form. Other studies have proposed that early recruitment of GAK–Hsc70 could function to provide the necessary energy source to remodel nascent flat clathrin lattices, replacing hexagons with pentagons and enabling a gain of curvature and invagination of the growing CCP; however, direct functional evidence is lacking. Here, we show that GAK knockdown inhibits CCP stabilization and invagination. Furthermore, mutations in the J domain of GAK that abolish Hsc70 recruitment to and activation at CCPs lead to the accumulation of GAK at CCPs, hinder CCP stabilization and invagination, and result in a striking increase in the proportion of highly transient, abortive CCPs. These findings support the hypothesis that GAK–Hsc70 promotes the turnover and remodeling of nascent clathrin assemblies required for curvature development during CME.",

          "abstract": "Life history traits influence marine species dispersal and habitat colonization. Medusozoans (jellyfish and siphonophores) exhibit diverse life cycles, evolved from an ancestral cycle alternating between a benthic polyp and a pelagic medusa. Despite their ecological importance, factors shaping medusozoan distribution remain poorly understood. By integrating metabarcoding and environmental data from the Tara Oceans expedition with life history traits, we provide global evidence supporting the longstanding hypothesis that benthic polyp presence/absence is a key factor influencing the distribution and abundance of planktonic medusozoans in the surface ocean. We inferred on a time-calibrated phylogeny of Medusozoa multiple transitions to a fully planktonic (holoplanktonic) life cycle, either through polyp loss, acquisition of drifting polyps, or development of polyps parasitizing pelagic organisms. We could associate each transition with a shift toward offshore habitats and the emergence of globally dominant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), whose abundance far exceeds that of any nonholoplanktonic medusozoans in the planktonic realm. The prevalence of holoplanktonic medusozoans in terms of abundance and diversity is broadly observed in coastal and offshore environments, peaking over greater bathymetric depths in tropical and subtropical regions. We show that holoplanktonic and nonholoplanktonic groups interact with distinct yet compositionally similar planktonic communities. Holoplanktonic OTUs occupy more peripheral positions in a plankton interactome, suggesting greater flexibility in biotic interactions, an adaptive trait in rapidly changing planktonic ecosystems. These findings highlight how life cycle evolution shaped the global distribution of medusozoans and suggest that variations in life history may significantly influence how medusozoans respond to global environmental changes.",

          "abstract": "NMR-based metabolic biomarkers provide comprehensive insights into human metabolism; however, extracting biologically meaningful patterns from such high-dimensional data remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a manifold-fitting-based framework to analyze metabolic heterogeneity within the UK Biobank population, utilizing measurements of 251 NMR biomarkers from 212,853 participants. Initially, our method clusters these biomarkers into seven distinct metabolic categories that reflect the modular organization of human metabolism. Subsequent manifold fitting to each category unveils underlying low-dimensional structures, elucidating fundamental variations from basic energy metabolism to hormone-mediated regulation. Importantly, three of these manifolds clearly stratify the population, identifying subgroups with distinct metabolic profiles and associated disease risks. These subgroups exhibit consistent links with specific diseases, including severe metabolic dysregulation and its complications, as well as cardiovascular and autoimmune conditions, highlighting the intricate relationship between metabolic states and disease susceptibility. Supported by strong correlations with demographic factors, clinical measurements, and lifestyle variables, these findings validate the biological relevance of the identified manifolds. By utilizing a geometrically informed approach to dissect metabolic heterogeneity, our framework enhances the accuracy of population stratification and deepens our understanding of metabolic health, potentially guiding personalized interventions and preventive healthcare strategies.",

          "abstract": "The tight link between brain and skull formation is a fundamental aspect of vertebrate evolution and embryogenesis. Their developmental synchronization is essential for structural and functional integration. The brain and skull shape coevolution is evident along the vertebrate phylogeny; however, the genetic basis underlying their close evolutionary and developmental relationship remains little explored. Here, we reveal the evolution and function of the MN1 gene that was previously found to be associated with significant shape variation in the mouse skull and the formation of cranial bones. We show that the vertebrate MN1 gene evolved from an ancestral deuterostome sequence. In vertebrates, the MN1 gene structure, synteny, and spatiotemporal expression pattern are remarkably conserved, indicating that the gene carries out a core function. Using a newly generated mouse knock-out model, we demonstrate in vivo that Mn1 integrated into an ancient molecular machinery and controls the expression of the Cyp26 genes in the developing hindbrain, thereby tuning the retinoic acid levels and patterning of the developing central nervous system. This study thus showcases the emergence of a novel gene function from an ancestral sequence and its role in generating a macroevolutionary innovation. The data expand our knowledge of brain and skull codevelopment and coevolution and highlight the role of this regulatory loop in craniofacial human syndromes.",

The clinical benefit from EGFR-targeted therapies is usually short-lived, with resistance being driven by tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these limitations, we developed Targeted Apoptotic Immune Modulators (TAIM), a nonviral nanoparticle platform for the targeted delivery of polyinosine:polycytosine (polyIC), to simultaneously induce tumor cell death and activate antitumor immunity. The first TAIM compound, TAR001, was designed as a systemic treatment against metastatic EGFR-positive solid cancers. Here, we present TAR001’s multifaceted mode of action. We demonstrate that TAR001 is selective toward EGFR-overexpressing cancers, provoking a pattern recognition response, apoptosis, cytokine secretion, and antitumor immunity. TAR001 modulates the TME, recruiting and activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Systemic delivery of TAR001 markedly extends survival and inhibits tumor growth in multiple murine tumor models. TAR001 represents an innovative, safe, multimodal treatment approach with the potential to benefit patients with metastatic head and neck, non–small cell lung cancer, colorectal, renal, and triple-negative breast cancers. This unique modality utilizes a broad range of mechanisms to overcome the tumor’s ability to escape apoptosis and immune cell activation.",

          "abstract": "Evolution is often uneven in its pace and outcomes, with long periods of stasis interrupted by abrupt increases in morphological and ecological disparity. With thousands of gene histories, phylogenomics can uncover the genomic signatures of these broad macroevolutionary trends. Diatoms are a species-rich lineage of microeukaryotes that contribute greatly to the global cycling of carbon, oxygen, and silica, which they use to build elaborately structured cell walls. We combined fossil information with newly sequenced transcriptomes from 181 diverse diatom species to reconstruct the pattern, timing, and genomic context of major evolutionary transitions. Diatoms originated 270 Mya, and after &gt;100 My of relative stasis in morphology and ecology, a radiation near the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary led to the diversity of habitats and cell wall architectures characteristic of modern diatoms. This transition was marked by a genome duplication and high levels of gene tree discordance. However, short generation times increase the probability of coalescence between speciation events, minimizing the impacts of incomplete lineage sorting and implicating sequence saturation and gene tree error as the main sources of discordance. Nevertheless, a rigorous tree-based approach to ortholog selection resulted in strongly supported relationships, including some that were uncertain previously. Three pulses of accelerated speciation were detected, two of which were associated with the evolution of novel traits and ecological transitions. The first 100 My of diatom evolution was a slow-burning fuse that led to a burst of innovations in ecology, morphology, and life history that are hallmarks of contemporary diatom assemblages.",

While extensively studied for Newtonian liquids, how far a non-Newtonian drop can spread upon impacting a solid substrate remains an open question. Here, by combining simulations, experiments, and scaling analyses, we establish a general framework for predicting the maximum spreading of drops of generalized Newtonian liquids, encompassing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening behaviors. Through an analysis of the energy budget at maximum spreading, we identify a characteristic shear rate that governs the viscous dissipation during drop impact. The finding allows us to map the spreading of non-Newtonian drops onto that of Newtonian drops, revealing the quantitative dependence of the maximum spreading diameter on various impact parameters and rheological properties of liquids. Our study addresses the long-standing challenge of understanding the impact dynamics of non-Newtonian drops, and provides valuable guidance for designing non-Newtonian liquids to achieve desired impact outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Nav1.8 voltage-gated sodium channels are strongly expressed in human primary pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors) and a selective Nav1.8 inhibitor VX-548 (suzetrigine) has shown efficacy for treating acute pain in clinical trials. Nociceptors also express other sodium channels, notably Nav1.7, raising the question of how effectively excitability of the neurons is reduced by inhibition of Nav1.8 channels alone. We used VX-548 to explore this question, recording from dissociated human dorsal root ganglion neurons at 37 °C. Applying VX-548 at 10 nM (about 25 times the IC 50 determined using cloned human Nav1.8 channels at 37 °C) had only small effects on action potential threshold and upstroke velocity but substantially reduced the peak and shoulder. Counterintuitively, VX-548 shortened the refractory period—likely reflecting reduced potassium channel activation by the smaller, narrower action potential—sometimes resulting in faster firing. Generally, repetitive firing during depolarizations was diminished but not eliminated by VX-548. Voltage clamp analysis suggested two reasons that repetitive firing often remains in 10 to 100 nM VX-548. First, many neurons had such large Nav1.8 currents that even 99% inhibition leaves nA-level Nav1.8 current that could help drive repetitive firing. Second, Nav1.7 current dominated during initial spikes and could also contribute to repetitive firing. The ability of human neurons to fire repetitively even with &gt;99% inhibition of Nav1.8 channels may help explain the incomplete analgesia produced by even the largest concentrations of VX-548 in clinical studies.",

          "abstract": "Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) mediates early signaling events in immunity by coupling membrane receptors to immune responses. Syk comprises a tandem SH2 (tSH2) regulatory module—two SH2 domains connected by a structured linker—and a kinase domain. The association of tSH2 with a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated motif (dpITAM) on membrane immunoreceptors is central to controlling Syk’s signaling activity. tSH2-dpITAM association is regulated by Y131-phosphorylation on linker A, distant from the Syk–immunoreceptor binding sites. A unique thermodynamic signature was reported to control this protein–protein interaction by phosphorylation, yet the molecular mechanism for the phosphorylation effect is unknown. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation affords the detail needed to fill this knowledge deficiency. Long MD simulations revealed a highly correlated interdomain electrostatic network (distance correlation coefficients &gt; 0.75) that is lost upon Y131-phosphorylation. Some of the strongly correlated interdomain pairs carry the same charge or are separated by distances greater than a salt-bridge pair. The strong interdomain connectivity accounts for the single, narrow free energy basin in the domain-structure conformational landscape for unphosphorylated tSH2. Linker phosphorylation disrupts this network and yields a broader free energy landscape with multiple networks formed by the same group of residues adopting alternative interdomain conformations. A salt dependence of NMR rotational tumbling times substantiates the electrostatic nature of tSH2 domain–domain coupling. Syk tandem SH2 is thus a sensor whose conformational plasticity is sensitive to Y131 phosphorylation. This phospho-sensing response provides the basis for an entropically driven regulatory mechanism that is so-far unique to Syk–immunoreceptor protein–protein association.",

          "abstract": "Greening immediately after etiolated-seedling’s emergence from the soil is critical for plants to initiate their autotrophic life cycle through photosynthesis. The greening process relies on a complex transcriptional network that fine-tunes the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and prevents premature development of chloroplasts. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis HOOKLESS1 (HLS1) as a key regulator of light-induced cotyledon greening. Our results demonstrated that HLS1 is essential for the proper expression of greening-related genes controlling chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development. Loss of HLS1 severely disrupts the Pchlide-to-Chlide transition and impairs reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging in etiolated seedlings upon light exposure, leading to catastrophic ROS burst and even photobleaching. Biochemical assays revealed that HLS1 is a histone acetyltransferase mediating the deposition of H3K9ac and H3K27ac marks at multiple greening-related genes, thereby promoting their transcriptional activation. Genetic analysis further confirmed that HLS1’s promotive effect on the greening process is fully dependent on its histone acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, the loss of HLS1 also interrupts the promotive effect of ethylene signaling on the greening process by reducing the binding of ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3 to the promoter region of POR genes, thus inhibiting the activation effect of ethylene signaling on the expression of PORs . Collectively, our study reveals that HLS1 acetylates histones to activate greening-related genes, optimizing chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development during dark-to-light transition in seedlings.",

Within the NLR family, NLRP12 was recently identified as a key regulator of PANoptosis, which is an innate immune, lytic cell death pathway initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes. While NLRP12 activation is critical for maintaining homeostasis, aberrant activation has been implicated in a broad range of disorders, including cancers and metabolic, infectious, autoinflammatory, and hemolytic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms of NLRP12 activation remain poorly understood. Here, we identified hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) as a regulator of NLRP12-mediated PANoptosis. HCK expression was significantly upregulated in response to NLRP12-PANoptosome triggers. Moreover, Hck knockdown inhibited NLRP12-mediated PANoptosis. Computational analyses identified residues in the putative interaction interface between NLRP12 and HCK, suggesting that HCK likely binds NLRP12 in the region between its NACHT domain and pyrin domain (PYD); removal of the NLRP12 PYD abrogated this interaction in vitro. Overall, our work identifies HCK as a regulator of NLRP12-mediated PANoptosis, suggesting that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating inflammation and pathology.",

          "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions and major sources of genomic instability. Studies have suggested that DSBs induce local transcriptional silencing that consequently promotes genomic stability. Several factors have been proposed to actively participate in this process, including Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Here, we found that disrupting PRC1 clustering disrupts DSB-induced gene silencing. Interactome analysis of PHC2, a PRC1 subunit that promotes the PRC1 clustering, found several nucleoporins found in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Similar to PHC2, depleting the nucleoporins also disrupted the DSB-induced gene silencing. We found that some of these nucleoporins, such as NUP107 and NUP43, which are members of the Y-complex of NPC, localize to DSB sites. The presence of nucleoporins and PHC2 at DSB regions was interdependent, suggesting that they act cooperatively in the DSB-induced gene silencing. We further found two structural components within NUP107 to be necessary for the transcriptional repression at DSBs: ATM/ Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related-mediated phosphorylation at the Serine37 residue within the N-terminal disordered tail and the NUP133-binding surface at the C-terminus.

          "abstract": "The eukaryotic leading-strand DNA polymerase ε (Polε) is a dual-function enzyme with a proofreading 3′-5′ exonuclease ( exo ) site located 40 Å from the DNA synthesizing pol site. Errors in Polε proofreading can cause various mutations, including C-to-G transversions, the most prevalent mutation in cancers and genetic diseases. Polε interacts with all three subunits of the PCNA ring to assemble a functional holoenzyme. Despite previous studies on proofreading of several Pol’s, how Polε—or any Pol complexed with its sliding clamp—proofreads a mismatch generated in situ has been unknown. We show here by cryo-EM that a template/primer DNA substrate with a preexisting mismatch cannot enter the exo site of Polε–PCNA holoenzyme, but a mismatch generated in situ in the pol site yields three bona fide proofreading intermediates of Polε–PCNA holoenzyme. These intermediates reveal how the mismatch is dislodged from the pol site, how the DNA unwinds six base pairs, and how the unpaired primer 3′-end is inserted into the exo site for cleavage. These results unexpectedly demonstrate that PCNA imposes strong steric constraints that extend unwinding and direct the trajectory of mismatched DNA and that this trajectory is dramatically different than for Polε in the absence of PCNA. These findings suggest a physiologically relevant proofreading mechanism for the human Polε holoenzyme.",

The proper execution of ribosome biogenesis likely depends on the material properties of the nucleolus. However, these material properties remain poorly understood due to the challenges of in vivo measurements. Here, we use micropipette aspiration (MPA) to directly characterize the viscoelasticity and interfacial tensions of nucleoli within transcriptionally active Xenopus laevis oocytes. We examine the major nucleolar subphases, the outer granular component (GC) and the inner dense fibrillar component (DFC), which itself contains a third small phase known as the fibrillar center (FC). We show that the behavior of the GC is more liquid-like, while the behavior of the DFC/FC is consistent with that of a partially viscoelastic solid. To determine the role of ribosomal RNA in nucleolar material properties, we degrade RNA using RNase A, which causes the DFC/FC to become more fluid-like and alters interfacial tension. Together, our findings suggest that RNA underlies the partially solid-like properties of the DFC/FC and provide insights into how material properties of nucleoli in a near-native environment are related to their RNA-dependent function.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the intricate interplay among neutral landscape structure, mutation rate, recombination rate, and population dynamics in shaping evolutionary robustness. We provide a comprehensive framework that elucidates how different evolutionary forces interact to influence genotypic robustness and localization within haploid and diploid populations. We demonstrate that in haploid populations, high mutation rates relative to recombination typically drive the population toward regions of increased eigencentrality, a graph-theoretic measure of centrality which is correlated while not identical to mutational robustness. On the other hand, recombination increases the localization of the population to a smaller region of genotypic space, while high values of recombination relative to mutation can introduce shifts in distribution away from regions of high eigencentrality and toward attractors of the recombination dynamics. Diploid dynamics further complicate these interactions, showing reduced alignment with eigencentrality under both high mutation and recombination rates, with the exception of structured diploid landscapes where dynamics are still aligned with increasing eigencentrality. Our findings underscore the nuanced dependencies of evolutionary outcomes on both local and global landscape structures as well as evolutionary parameters.",

These claims have been made in the apparent absence of any awareness of the theoretical framework of evolutionary biology that has existed for decades. The numerical indices being promoted suffer from numerous conceptual and quantitative problems, to the point of being devoid of meaning, with the authors even failing to recognize the distinction between mutation and selection. Moreover, the promulgators of these new laws base their arguments on the idea that natural selection is in relentless pursuit of increasing organismal complexity, despite the absence of any evidence in support of this and plenty pointing in the opposite direction. Evolutionary biology embraces interdisciplinary thinking, but there is no fundamental reason why the field of evolution should be subject to levels of unsubstantiated speculation that would be unacceptable in any other area of science.",

          "abstract": "Natural ice plays salient roles in making the Earth habitable and sustainable. Previously overlooked, its role in chemical processes is now of emerging interest, particularly due to the freeze concentration effect, which can substantially promote chemical reactions during ice formation. We demonstrate here that ice formation can serve as a dynamic and unique pathway for mineral genesis. Freezing solutions containing dissolved manganese and carbonates produced rhodochrosite (Mn II CO 3 ) even under slightly undersaturated conditions. At room temperature, by contrast, this occurred when the solution saturation level was increased by ca. 30,000 times. The cryogenic rhodochrosite formed spherical aggregates of nano-polycrystallites, distinctly different from the cubic monocrystalline particles observed at room temperature. The distinct feature likely resulted from the combined effects of the intensified supersaturation induced by the freeze concentration effect and the low temperatures within liquid-like layers, conditions that make liquid-like layers an exceptional environment for mineral genesis, unlike typical natural water systems. The cryogenic rhodochrosite formation was successfully demonstrated using in situ, real-time X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), enabling direct observation of freeze-induced solid formation. Our findings reveal that freeze-induced crystallization may be an active mineralization pathway, potentially influencing elemental cycles within the cryosphere and contributing to minerals with distinguishing properties and reactivities in the environment.",

Atp8b1 G308V/G308V mouse model, unbiased RNAseq, high-resolution-stimulation emission depltion (STED)-microscopy, and Crispr-Cas9 generated ATP8B1 −/− knockouts in hepatocytes/monocytes/macrophages were used to determine role of ATP8B1 in phosphatidylinositol,4-5-bisphosphate (PIP2) trafficking and inflammation. Human ATP8B1, purified from Sf9 insect cells and reconstituted in proteoliposomes, was used to test cell-free PIP2 flip. Various in-vitro techniques were used for testing direct interaction between PIP2 and ATP8B1. ATP8B1 maintains PIP2 at the inner leaflet of plasma membrane (PM). ATP8B1 flips PIP2 in cells, without altering flip of PE or bulk-endocytosis. ATP8b1 flips PIP2 in a cell-free system. ATP8B1 deletion promotes bile-salt-mediated cholesterol extraction from hepatocytes in a PIP2-dependent manner. PIP2 directly binds to the P-loop of ATP8B1. Unbiased RNAseq showed upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in ATP8b1 −/− immune cells. ATP8B1 −/− monocytes/macrophages showed aberrant lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cleavage of GSDMD, formation of GSDMD pores, and interleukin-1beta (IL1β) release. Inflammation-resolving efferocytosis was impaired in ATP8B1 −/− macrophages. Biophysical properties of PM were altered in ATP8b1 −/− cells, with the mechanism being disrupted localization of PIP2. Atp8b1 G308V/G308V mice exposed to LPS showed higher plasma IL1β and lower survival rates vs. WT mice. ATP8B1 maintains PIP2 at the inner leaflet of PM. ATP8b1 directly flips and binds PIP2.

Despite most hippocampal synapses being contacted by an astrocyte, there are no current theories that explain how neurons, synapses, and astrocytes might collectively contribute to memory function. We demonstrate that fundamental aspects of astrocyte morphology and physiology naturally lead to a dynamic, high-capacity associative memory system. The neuron–astrocyte networks generated by our framework are closely related to popular machine learning architectures known as Dense Associative Memories. Adjusting the connectivity pattern, the model developed here leads to a family of associative memory networks that includes a Dense Associative Memory and a Transformer as two limiting cases. In the known biological implementations of Dense Associative Memories, the ratio of stored memories to the number of neurons remains constant, despite the growth of the network size. Our work demonstrates that neuron–astrocyte networks follow a superior memory scaling law, outperforming known biological implementations of Dense Associative Memory. Our model suggests an exciting and previously unnoticed possibility that memories could be stored, at least in part, within the network of astrocyte processes rather than solely in the synaptic weights between neurons.",

We designed an RNA sequencing study to compare the transcriptional profile of HCMV infection in the presence and absence of these genes using the Tohoku Hospital Pediatrics-1 (THP-1) monocytic cell line model for latency. Relative to primary cell models, THP-1 cells offer the strength of a homogenous population that uniformly silences gene expression and will synchronously reexpress viral genes following stimulation to differentiate, which models early phases of viral reactivation. The loss of UL138 resulted in elevated levels of viral gene expression and in spontaneous adhesion of distinct cell populations that support HCMV gene expression and genome synthesis. The loss of UL135 resulted in diminished viral gene expression during an initial burst that occurs as latency is established and in no expression of eleven viral genes from the UL b ′ region even following differentiation and reexpression of viral genes. Transcriptional network analysis revealed host transcription factors (TFs) with potential to regulate the UL b ′ genes in coordination with pUL135. We show that the cellular TF peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma binds to the viral genome and influences the expression of UL133-UL138 locus genes. Our results define roles for UL135 and UL138 in regulation of patterns of viral gene expression for the establishment of latency and reexpression of viral genes for reactivation and reveal insights into differentiation-linked mechanisms of transcriptional control of the HCMV genome.",

          "abstract": "The human cortex undergoes immense change in the first years of life, doubling in thickness within the first year and evidencing the greatest change within the first 5 y. While substantial research has identified the early postnatal period as a sensitive period in cortical development, research to date lacks the temporal resolution necessary to identify which aspects of cortical change predict later neural and cognitive function. This study leveraged a rich longitudinal dataset of cortical thickness in 50 children who were scanned up to 11 times between birth and 6 y. We used nonlinear multilevel modeling to explore patterns of cortical change across the brain during this period and distinguish whether different phases of change would predict performance and brain activation during a working memory task children completed at approximately 9 y. Cortical thickness across the brain showed a large increase from birth through 12 mo, a decrease from 12 to 18 mo, and a small increase from 18 mo to 6 y, mirroring patterns of early neural proliferation, pruning, and sustained growth. Performance and neural activation during the working memory task were associated with smaller peak (i.e., 12 mo) thickness and a marginally less steep 12 to 18-mo decline in thickness in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) of the frontal lobe, in line with evidence demonstrating concurrent links between frontal lobe structure and working memory. These findings validate theories of cortical growth developed in preclinical models using human data and demonstrate that prefrontal cortex development in infancy uniquely predicts neurocognitive function 9 y later.",

These quinone antioxidants function as radical scavenging agents that prevent the propagation of lipid peroxidation and the induction of ferroptosis. Although several small-molecule inhibitors of FSP1 have been developed and found to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis, our understanding of their molecular mechanisms remains limited and no structures of FSP1 in complex with its inhibitors have been solved. Here, we solve the cocrystal structure of FSP1 in complex with the FSP1 inhibitor FSEN1, revealing that FSEN1 binds within the FSP1 substrate-binding pocket. FSEN1 makes key interactions with a critical phenylalanine, which is absent in mouse FSP1, providing an explanation for the selectivity of FSEN1 for human FSP1. These conclusions are supported by mutagenesis of FSP1 and biochemical and cellular assays of FSP1 function. Our findings provide the first cocrystal structure of FSP1 in complex with an inhibitor, enhancing our understanding of the mechanism of FSP1 inhibition and enabling future rational medicinal chemistry efforts to advance FSP1 inhibitors as therapeutics.",

The toxicity and giant ER sheet formation were abolished by deleting lcf1 or slc1 gene, indicating that the incorporation of C15:0 into glycerophospholipids causes giant ER sheet formation. The giant ER sheets disrupted the correct migration of Mid1, a protein determining the cell division site, and physically blocked septum formation, hindering correct cell separation.

          "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can lead to a variety of clinical outcomes, including severe congenital abnormalities. The phosphatidylserine receptors AXL and TIM-1 are recognized as critical entry factors for ZIKV in vitro. However, it remains unclear whether and how ZIKV regulates these receptors during infection. In this study, we investigated AXL and TIM-1 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells, glioblastoma U87 cells, and embryonic stem cell-derived trophoblasts following ZIKV infection. We found that both the Asian strain FSS13025 and the African strain MR766 of ZIKV downregulate AXL, with a milder effect on TIM-1. We identified several ZIKV proteins, notably envelope (E), NS2A, NS3, and NS4B, that contribute to this downregulation. Notably, treatment with lysosomal inhibitor NH 4 Cl or the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine mitigated the AXL/TIM-1 downregulation, indicating autophagy’s involvement in the process. Importantly, this downregulation facilitates sustained viral replication and promotes viral spread by preventing superinfection and limiting cell death, which is also associated with impaired innate immune signaling. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which ZIKV downregulates entry factors to enhance prolonged viral replication and spread.",

Here, we isolated and identified a green water-soluble protein from the integument of bush-cricket Tettigonia cantans . De novo sequencing and cloning revealed a severely fragmented form of vitellogenins, ubiquitous and multifunctional, but still largely enigmatic glycolipoproteins essential for embryonic development and lacking structural characterization. The distinctive color of the identified chromoprotein results from binding of a remarkable combination of farnesylated bilins (recently identified, tentative heme A catabolites) and xanthophylls, which commensurably absorb light in the 600 to 700 nm and 400 to 550 nm spectral regions and thereby produce a hue that perfectly mimics foliage. The high-resolution crystal structure of this unique ~80 kDa dichromophoric protein, which we named “dibilinoxanthinin” (DBXN), revealed two DBXN protomers, each consisting of three polypeptides, with a novel fold enclosing a large hydrophobic cavity that accommodates two bilins, two luteins, and four phosphatidylcholines, all anchored by hydrogen bonds and giving DBXN unique biochemical and optical properties. Among the green insects tested, some contained yellow and blue chromophores in separate fractions, while others had green proteins similar to DBXN, although not necessarily of the same size. Surprisingly, we isolated and identified a larger vitellogenin proteoform with DBXN-like absorption, from the green huntsman spider Micrommata virescens . These data illustrate striking variations in the DBXN-related pigmentation mechanism among different green arthropods and suggest that vitellogenins may have undergone neofunctionalization, reflecting their potential for functional diversification.",

Our experimental results reveal the presence of a self-reproduction process during which chemically active polymer protocells are chemically and autonomously generated in a light-stimulated one-pot reaction that starts from a homogeneous blend of non-self-assembling molecules and which, as observed microscopically, form vesicular objects that grow and multiply (reproduce) during irradiation with green light (530 nm) as the reaction proceeds. By using a filtration-based protocol, our experiments demonstrate that the self-reproduction process occurs concomitantly with the PISA process and results in a nonlinear increase in the number of polymer vesicles during photopolymerization which can only be ascribed to their reproduction via polymeric spores ejected from previously existing first-generation vesicles. The second and subsequent generations’ vesicles also self-reproduce and continue the process of population growth.",

          "abstract": "Cancers are shaped by somatic mutations, microenvironment, and patient background, each altering gene expression and regulation in complex ways, resulting in heterogeneous cellular states and dynamics. Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from expression data can help characterize this regulation-driven heterogeneity, but network inference requires many statistical samples, limiting GRNs to cluster-level analyses that ignore intracluster heterogeneity. We propose to move beyond coarse analyses of predefined subgroups by using contextualized learning, a multitask learning paradigm that uses multiview contexts including phenotypic, molecular, and environmental information to infer personalized models. With sample-specific contexts, contextualization enables sample-specific models and even generalizes at test time to predict network models for entirely unseen contexts. We unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, and Neighborhood Selection) and estimate context-specific GRNs for 7,997 tumors across 25 tumor types, using copy number and driver mutation profiles, tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics as model context. Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict GRNs for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation. Finally, contextualized networks enable GRN-based precision oncology by providing a structured view of expression dynamics at sample-specific resolution, explaining known biomarkers in terms of network-mediated effects and leading to subtypings that improve survival prognosis.

          "abstract": "Voltage-gated calcium (Ca V ) channels are pivotal in cellular signaling due to their selective calcium ion permeation upon membrane depolarization. While previous studies have established the highly selective permeability of Ca V channels, the detailed molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we use extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanisms governing ion permeation and valence selectivity in Ca V 1 channels. Employing the electronic continuum correction method, we simulated a calcium conductance of approximately 9 to 11 pS, aligning closely with experimental measurement. Our simulations uncovered a three-ion knock-on mechanism critical for efficient calcium ion permeation, necessitating the binding of at least two calcium ions within the selectivity filter (SF) and the subsequent entry of a third ion. In silico mutation simulations further validated the importance of multi-ion coordination in the SF for efficient ion permeation, identifying two critical residues, D706 and E1101, that are essential for the binding of two calcium ions in the SF. Moreover, we explored the competitive permeation of calcium and sodium ions and obtained a valence selectivity favoring calcium over sodium at a ratio of approximately 35:1 under the bication condition. This selectivity arises from the strong electrostatic interactions of calcium ions in the confined SF and the three-ion knock-on mechanism. Our findings provide quantitative insights into the molecular underpinnings of Ca V channel function, with implications for understanding calcium-dependent cellular processes.",

However, the high-yield biochemical isolation and visualization of endogenous NLGNs is hampered by the lack of efficient antibodies. Thus, to reveal their subcellular distribution, binding partners, and synaptic function, NLGNs were extensively manipulated using knock-down, knock-out, or overexpression approaches, leading to controversial results. As an alternative to the manipulation of NLGN expression level, we describe here the generation of a knock-in (KI) mouse strain in which native NLGN1 was N-terminally tagged with a small biotin acceptor peptide (bAP) that can be enzymatically biotinylated by the exogenous delivery of biotin ligase. After showing that KI mice exhibit normal behavior as well as similar synaptic number, ultrastructure, transmission properties, and protein expression levels when compared to wild type counterparts, we exploited the fact that biotinylated bAP-NLGN1 can be selectively isolated or visualized using high-affinity streptavidin conjugates. Using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, we show that bAP-NLGN1 binds PSD-95 and gephyrin and populates both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, challenging the historical view that NLGN1 is exclusively localized at excitatory synapses. Using superresolution optical and electron microscopy, we further highlight that bAP-NLGN1 forms in the synaptic cleft a subset of nanodomains, which contain each a few NLGN1 dimers and whose number positively scales with the postsynapse size. Overall, our study not only provides an extensively characterized KI mouse model which will be available to the scientific community but also an unprecedented view of the nanoscale organization of endogenous NLGN1.",

In this study, we used machine-learning potential molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the initial stage of polyhydride formation in calcium hydrides. Upon contact with high-pressure H 2 , the surface of CaH 2 melts, leading to CaH 4 formation. This surface melting proceeds via CaH 4 liquid phase as an intermediate state. High pressure reduces not only the hydrogenation (CaH 2 (s) + H 2 (l) ↔ CaH 4 (s)) enthalpy but also the enthalpy for liquid polyhydride formation (CaH 2 (s) + H 2 (l) ↔ CaH 4 (l)). Consequently, this surface melting process becomes more favorable than the fusion of the polyhydride bulk. Thus, high pressure not only shifts the equilibrium toward the polyhydride product but also lowers the activation energy, thereby promoting the hydrogenation reaction. From these thermodynamic insights, we propose structure-search criteria for polyhydride synthesis that are both computationally effective and experimentally relevant. These criteria are based on bulk properties, such as polyhydride (product) melting temperature and pressure-dependent hydrogenation enthalpy, readily determined through supplementary calculations during structure prediction workflows.",

          "abstract": "A recent study has suggested that the stimulus responses of cortical neural populations follow a critical power law. More precisely, the power spectrum of the covariance matrix of neural responses follows a power law with an exponent indicating that the neural manifold lies on the edge of differentiability. This criticality is hypothesized to balance expressivity and robustness in neural encoding, as population responses on a nondifferential fractal manifold are thought to be overly sensitive to perturbations. However, contrary to this hypothesis, we prove that neural coding is far more robust than previously assumed. We develop a theoretical framework that provides an analytical expression for the Fisher information of population coding under the small noise assumption. Our results reveal that, due to its intrinsic high dimensionality, population coding maintains reliability even on a nondifferentiable fractal manifold, despite its sensitivity to perturbations. Furthermore, the theory reveals that the trade-off between energetic cost and information makes the critical power-law coding the optimal neural encoding of sensory information for a wide range of conditions. In this derivation, we highlight the essential role of a neural correlation, known as differential correlation, in power-law population coding. By uncovering the nontrivial nature of high-dimensional information coding, this work deepens our understanding of criticality and power laws in both biological and artificial neural computation.",

Notably, Il18r1 is also predicted to be expressed and functional in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), since epithelial IL18R1 deficiency contributes to worsened outcomes upon inflammatory challenge. However, the nature of Il18r1 + IECs, and their subsequent role in epithelial-intrinsic IL-18 signaling is poorly characterized. Here, we show that, in the murine small intestine, the IL-18 receptor is expressed by rare IECs that we identified to be a subset of enterochromaffin cells (ECC). While these cells are the major producers of serotonin in the intestine, we found no evidence that IL-18 regulated serotonin metabolism or release. Rather, upon radiation-induced injury, Il18r1 + cells appeared in the crypt base and took on a revival stem cell (revSC) program, marked by mixed expression of YAP/TAZ and enteroendocrine genes signatures. Functionally, irradiated Il18 −/− mice display reduced epithelial proliferation and altered differentiation in the small intestine, characterized by increased Paneth cells (PC) and elevated Wnt3 levels, which was partially recapitulated in Il18 −/− ileal organoids. In sum, we identified an Il18r1 + population in the epithelium and revealed a role for IEC-intrinsic IL-18 signaling during injury.",

          "abstract": "The directed movement of eukaryotic cells is critical for processes such as development and immune responses. While much is known about chemoattraction, much less is known about chemorepulsion. The eukaryotic amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum secretes a 60 kDa chemorepellent protein called AprA to cause cells at the edge of a colony to move away from the colony. In addition to AprA, cells secrete a &lt;10 kDa chemorepellent. Here, we show that the &lt;10 kDa chemorepellent is a polymer of phosphates (polyphosphate; polyP). D. discoideum cells move by activating cortical Ras at one edge of the cell to initiate pseudopod formation. AprA induces repulsion by inhibiting Ras activation and pseudopod formation on the side of the cell closest to the source of AprA, without affecting the overall frequency of pseudopod formation. In contrast, polyP activates Ras at multiple regions of the cortex and increases pseudopod formation frequency, especially at the side of the cell furthest from the source of polyP. At least 20 signal transduction proteins are needed for both AprA and polyP repulsion, 9 are needed by polyP but not AprA, and 4 are needed by AprA but not polyP. Together, these results indicate that proliferating D. discoideum cells use two different chemorepellents, that one of the repellents is the unusual molecule polyphosphate, and that the two repellents activate partially overlapping and partially different pathways to induce repulsion by two basically different mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "In eukaryotic genomes, DNA is packaged into nucleosomes to form chromatin. The incorporation of canonical or variant histones into nucleosomes confers different properties and influences chromatin structure to regulate cellular processes, including recombination. During meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed and repaired as interhomolog crossovers. Nucleosome occupancy is generally associated with low crossover frequency, but it remains unclear which histone variants are involved in this process. In Arabidopsis , three variants of H2A coexist: H2A.X, H2A.Z, and H2A.W. Here, we show that H2A.W7 has a suppressive role on meiotic recombination. Genome-wide mapping of the crossover landscape revealed increased centromere-proximal recombination in h2a.w7 . Moreover, H2A.W7 can be recruited to the 3a crossover hotspot via 21-24-nucleotide siRNAs during RNA-directed DNA methylation, causing increased nucleosome occupancy and decreased crossover frequency. Cytological analysis reveals that H2A.W7 restricts heterochromatin clustering during meiosis, which can form a mechanism to limit interhomolog recombination. Conversely, the linker histone H1, of which its loading is known to be restricted by H2A.W, promotes heterochromatin clustering and crossover on a heterochromatic genetic interval. Our study reveals a role for H2A.W7 in repressing crossover formation in Arabidopsis .",

Rhesus macaques, randomly cued to attend to a target object amid distracters, were rewarded for detecting a color change in the target. While spatial attention does not affect the object tuning curves of V4 cells, the direction of MS significantly influenced object representations in V4 throughout the entire trial. Specifically, intervals following an MS toward the target exhibited superior stimulus decoding and sharper tuning curves compared to intervals following an MS away from the target. Furthermore, MSs directed toward the target enhanced neuronal responses to behaviorally relevant color changes, leading to faster reaction times. This sharpening effect stems from both a refreshing of the initial sensory response and an amplification of attention effects. The firing rate enhancement associated with spatial attention is delayed until the occurrence of the first MS directed toward the target. Subsequently, a positive effect of attention on firing rate, influenced by MS direction, was found throughout the trial across deep and superficial layers of V4, lateral pulvinar, and IT cortex. In summary, these findings underscore a crucial link between covert attention, object processing, and their coordination with MSs.",

Microtubule growth, shortening, and transitions between them are linked to GTP hydrolysis. Recent evidence suggests that flexible tubulin protofilaments at microtubule ends adopt a variety of shapes, complicating structural analysis using conventional techniques. Therefore, the link between GTP hydrolysis, protofilament structure and microtubule polymerization state is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of microtubule ends using coarse-grained modeling supported by atomistic simulations and cryoelectron tomography. We show that individual bent protofilaments organize in clusters, transient precursors to the straight microtubule lattice, with GTP-bound ends showing elevated and more persistent cluster formation. Differences in the mechanical properties of GTP- and GDP-protofilaments result in differences in intracluster tension, determining both clustering propensity and protofilament length. We propose that conformational selection at microtubule ends favors long-lived clusters of short GTP-protofilaments that are more prone to forming a straight microtubule lattice and accommodating new tubulin dimers. Conversely, microtubule ends trapped in states with unevenly long and stiff GDP-protofilaments are more prone to shortening. We conclude that protofilament clustering is the key phenomenon that links the hydrolysis state of single tubulins to the polymerization state of the entire microtubule.",

The diarrheal disease cholera is caused by strains from a phylogenetically confined group within the Vibrio cholerae species, the pandemic cholera group (PCG), making it an ideal model system to tackle this puzzling phenomenon. Comprehensive analyses of over 1,840 V. cholerae genomes, including environmental isolates from this study, reveal that the species consists of eleven groups, with the PCG belonging to the largest and located within a lineage shared with environmental strains. This hierarchical classification provided us with a framework to unravel the ecoevolutionary dynamics of the genetic determinants associated with the emergence of toxigenic V. cholerae . Our analyses indicate that this phenomenon is largely dependent on the acquisition of unique modular gene clusters and allelic variations that confer a competitive advantage during intestinal colonization. We determined that certain PCG-associated alleles are essential for successful colonization whereas others provide a nonlinear competitive advantage, acting as a critical bottleneck that clarifies the isolated emergence of PCG. For instance, toxigenic strains encoding non-PCG alleles of a) tcpF or b) a sextuple allelic exchange mutant for genes tcpA , toxT , VC0176 , VC1791 , rfbT, and ompU , lose their ability to colonize the intestine. Interestingly, these alleles do not play a role in the colonization of newly established model environmental reservoirs.

In vertebrates, these functions are mediated by specialized pigment cells known as chromatophores of which, uric acid crystal–forming leucophores remain the least understood, with little known about their molecular mechanisms. A key question in pigment cell biology is whether different crystal chemistries require distinct molecular pathways, or whether similar cellular processes drive the formation of diverse crystals. This study was designed to unravel the uncharacterized process of uric acid crystallization in leucophores and compare them to guanine crystal formation in iridophores and pterin formation in xanthophores. The results of our transcriptomic, ultrastructural, and metabolomic analyses, demonstrate that leucophores share molecular pathways with iridophores, particularly those connected to organelle organization and purine metabolism, but express discrete genes involved in uric acid biosynthesis and storage. Additionally, leucophores share intracellular trafficking and pterin biosynthesis genes with xanthophores, suggesting universally conserved processes. Ultrastructural studies reveal star-like fibrous structures in leucosomes, which likely serve as scaffolds for unique one-dimensional uric acid assemblies that radiate from the core and act as efficient light scatterers. These findings provide insights into leucophore cell biology and the specialized mechanisms driving molecular crystalline assembly, and reveal that while some cellular processes are conserved, the specific chemistry of each crystal type drives the evolution of distinct molecular pathways.",

While several monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ have shown reductions in amyloid burden, their impact on cognitive function remains controversial, with the added risk of inflammatory side effects. Dysregulated stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, yet the biological interaction between this pathway and Aβ, as well as their combined influence on AD progression, is poorly understood. Here, we show that while microglia play a protective role in clearing extracellular Aβ, excessive Aβ engulfment triggers the cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial DNA for cGAS–STING cascade. This creates a negative feedback loop that not only exacerbates neuroinflammation but also impairs further Aβ clearance. To address this, we present a nanomedicine approach termed “Aβ-STING Synergistic ImmunoSilencing Therapy (ASSIST)”. ASSIST comprises STING inhibitors encapsulated within a blood–brain barrier (BBB)-permeable polymeric micelle that also serves as an Aβ scavenger. Through a multivalent interaction mechanism, ASSIST efficiently destabilizes Aβ plaques and prevents monomer aggregation, subsequently promoting the engulfment of the dissociated Aβ by microglia rather than neurocytes. Furthermore, the STING signaling induced by excessive Aβ uptake is blocked, reducing inflammation and restoring microglial homeostatic functions involved in Aβ clearance. Intravenous administration of ASSIST significantly reduces Aβ burden and improves cognition in AD mice, with minimal cerebral amyloid angiopathy or microhemorrhages. We provide a proof-of-concept nanoengineering strategy to target the maladaptive immune feedback loop arising from conventional immunotherapy for AD treatment.",

Mechanistically, host-derived C3 lyses the mosquito midgut symbiont Elizabethkingia anophelis ( E. anophelis )—a bacterium that intrinsically suppresses parasite development by blocking the zygote-to-ookinete transition. Strikingly, host-derived C3 in mosquitoes appears to be activated by the alternative pathway, and inhibiting Factor B with Iptacopan (LNP023) reduced Plasmodium falciparum ( P. falciparum ) infection, while increased the efficacy of anti-Pfs25 antibodies to blocking P. falciparum transmission in the standard membrane-feeding assay. Therefore, this study describes a strategy of the malaria parasite to utilize host complement C3 to promote its transmission and provides us with an avenue to block malaria transmission and improve the blocking efficacy of anti-Pfs25 antibodies by the inhibition of C3 activation.",

Despite its therapeutic significance, structural insights into DP1 activation mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined high-resolution structures of human DP1 in both inactive and active states, with the latter captured in complex with its endogenous agonist PGD2 or the synthetic agonist BW245C, bound to the stimulatory G protein, Gs. Our structures, coupled with functional and mutagenesis studies, unveiled unique structural features of DP1, including an alternative activation mechanism, ligand-selectivity determinants, and G protein coupling characteristics. These molecular insights provide a rational framework for designing selective DP1-targeted therapeutics, both agonists and antagonists, with enhanced specificity and reduced off-target effects, opening broad avenues for treating DP1-associated disorders.",

          "abstract": "Necroptosis is an inflammatory programmed cell death pathway triggered by RIPK3 activation through one of the upstream RHIM-domain-containing proteins including RIPK1, TRIF, and ZBP1. Whether necroptosis can be activated independent of the upstream signaling pathways leading to inflammatory pathogenesis remains ambiguous. Here, we revealed a mechanism in which a viral protein mediates direct RIPK3 activation resulting in severe inflammatory pathogenesis in patients. The nonstructural protein NSs of a pathogenic hemorrhagic virus, SFTSV, interacts with the RIPK3 kinase domain and forms biocondensate to promote RIPK3 autophosphorylation and necroptosis activation in an RHIM-independent manner. In parallel, sequestration of RIPK3 within the NSs–RIPK3 condensate inhibited RIPK3-mediated apoptosis and promoted viral replication. Infection with an SFTSV NSs mutant virus not forming NSs condensate triggered pronounced apoptosis resulting in reduced viral replication and decreased fatality in vivo. Blocking SFTSV-triggered necroptosis through depletion of MLKL or treatment with a RIPK3-kinase inhibitor reduced viral inflammatory pathogenesis and fatality in vivo. In contrast, blocking SFTSV-triggered apoptosis through depletion of RIPK3 resulted in enhanced viral replication and increased fatality in vivo. The virus-triggered necroptosis correlated with severe inflammatory pathogenesis and lethality in virus-infected patients. The NSs–RIPK3 condensate may represent a necroptosis activation mechanism that promotes viral pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "A major focus of human genetics is to map severe disease mutations. Increasingly, that goal is understood as requiring huge numbers of people to be sequenced from every broadly defined genetic ancestry group, so as not to miss “ancestry-specific variants.” Here, we consider whether this focus is warranted. We start from first principles considerations, based on models of mutation–drift-selection balance, which suggest that since severe disease mutations tend to be strongly deleterious, and thus evolutionarily young, they will be kept at relatively constant frequency through recurrent mutation. Therefore, highly pathogenic alleles should be shared identically by descent within extended families, not broad ancestry groups, and sequencing more people should yield similar numbers regardless of ancestry. We test the model predictions using gnomAD genetic ancestry groupings and show that they provide a good fit to the classes of variants most likely to be highly pathogenic, notably sets of loss of function alleles at strongly constrained genes. These findings clarify that strongly deleterious alleles will be found at comparable rates in people of all ancestries, and the information they provide about human biology is shared across ancestries.",

          "abstract": "Melanocyte development involves key pathways that are often recapitulated during melanoma initiation, highlighting the importance of understanding these regulatory processes. Our study identifies mgat4b , a glycosyl transferase involved in selective N -glycan branching enriched in pigment progenitors, as a regulator of directional cell migration and establishment of melanocyte stem cell (McSC) pool during early development. Single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing analysis in zebrafish upon targeted disruption of mgat4b reveals, that migratory melanocyte progenitors marked by galectin expression fail to persist. Lectin affinity proteomic analysis reveals the glycosylation of key melanocyte proteins GPNMB, KIT, and TYRP1 to be under the control of MGAT4B in melanocytic cells. Additionally, mislocalization of Junctional plakoglobin (JUP) explains the observed defects in cell adhesion and migration to be regulated by MGAT4B but not its isozyme MGAT4A. Our meta-analysis further reveals that melanoma patients with both the BRAF V600E mutation and elevated MGAT4B levels have significantly worse survival outcomes compared to those with only the BRAF V600E mutation. By leveraging the zebrafish MAZERATI platform to model BRAF V600E driver mutation in vivo, we show that mgat4b mutant cells fail to aggregate and initiate tumors. RNA profiling of the transformed melanocytes revealed cell–cell junction, adhesion, and ECM binding to be probable contributing factors that resulted in the failure of tumor onset. Using a small-molecule inhibitor we demonstrate that complex N -glycosylation inhibits early-stage melanoma progression. Our study underscores the importance of selective N -glycan branching in both melanocyte development and melanoma initiation, suggesting MGAT4B as a promising therapeutic target for melanoma treatment.",

Our findings indicate remarkably consistent Zn and K isotope compositions across all lunar basalt types, despite significant variations in Th content. This consistency suggests a relatively homogeneous isotopic composition of volatile elements within the Moon, unaffected by subsequent impact events that formed major basins. Our results suggest that the estimates of MVE abundance and isotopic compositions from the Apollo returned samples are likely representative of the bulk Moon, supporting a globally volatile-depleted lunar interior.",

However, modern Dicer orthologs exhibit divergent helicase functions that affect their ability to contribute to antiviral defense. Moreover, mechanisms that couple ATP hydrolysis to Dicer helicase movement on dsRNA remain enigmatic. We used biochemical and structural analyses of ancestrally reconstructed Dicer helicases to map evolution of dsRNA binding affinity, ATP hydrolysis and translocation. Loss of affinity for dsRNA occurred early in Dicer evolution, coinciding with a decline in translocation activity, despite preservation of ATP hydrolysis activity. Ancestral nematode Dicer also exhibited significant decline in ATP hydrolysis and translocation, but studies of antiviral activities in the modern nematode Caenorhabditis elegans indicate Dicer retained a role in antiviral defense by recruiting a second helicase. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses of an ancient metazoan Dicer allowed capture of multiple helicase states revealing the mechanism that connects each step of ATP hydrolysis to unidirectional movement along dsRNA. Our study rationalizes the diversity in modern Dicer helicases by connecting ancestral functions to observations in extant enzymes.",

          "abstract": "Ethanol rapidly stimulates the liver to synthesize the hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which then acts on the brain to elicit a multifaceted protective response. We show that in mice, this induction of FGF21 occurs at the level of gene transcription and is regulated by two byproducts of ethanol metabolism, glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and acetyl-CoA. Using cell-based reporter and thermal shift binding assays, we show that G3P binds to a conserved domain and activates the transcription factor carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), which regulates the Fgf21 gene promoter. The stimulation of Fgf21 gene transcription by ethanol also requires its metabolism to acetyl-CoA and correlates with histone acetylation. Accordingly, a p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase inhibitor blocks histone acetylation, ChREBP recruitment, and transcriptional activation at the Fgf21 promoter. Together, these findings reveal a dual regulatory mechanism driven by both G3P and acetyl-CoA that explains ethanol’s robust stimulatory effect on Fgf21 and possibly other ChREBP target genes in the liver.",

This review summarizes evidence that uses causal inference methods to reveal mechanisms that may lead to brain drain, gain, or circulation. Collectively, the weight of the evidence suggests that migration opportunities often increase human capital stock in origin countries and produce downstream beneﬁcial effects through remittances; foreign direct investment and trade linkages; transfers of knowledge, technology and norms; and return migration.

However, plants acclimate their respiratory response to temperature on longer timescales, potentially weakening the carbon-climate feedback. The magnitude of this acclimation is uncertain despite its importance for predicting future climate change. We develop an optimality-based theory dynamically linking stem respiration with leaf water supply to predict its thermal acclimation. We show that the theory accurately reproduces observations of spatial and seasonal change. We estimate the global value for current annual stem CO 2 efflux as 27.4 ± 5.9 PgC. By 2100, incorporating thermal acclimation reduces projected stem respiration without considering acclimation by 24 to 46%, thus reducing land ecosystem carbon emissions.",

We found a positive correlation between these deleterious variants and ancestry. Brazilian genomes are a global haplotype mosaic shaped by nonrandom mating, with peak admixture in the 18th and 19th centuries. Within this diversity, ancestry-specific haplotypes exhibit an uneven spatiotemporal distribution. We also identified putatively selected genes in this diverse population, primarily linked to fertility, immune response, and metabolic traits.",

In this work, we report a technology for intracellular protein editing, drawing from split intein–mediated protein splicing, genetic code expansion, and endogenous protein tagging. This approach enables us to rapidly and site-specifically install residues and chemical handles into a protein. We demonstrate the power of this platform to edit cellular proteins, inserting epitopes, protein-specific sequences, and noncanonical amino acids. Notably, we use an endogenous tagging approach to apply our protein editing technology to endogenous proteins with minimal perturbation.

BRAF regulation, involving monomeric autoinhibition and activation by dimerization, has been intensely scrutinized, but mechanisms enabling oncogenic mutants to evade regulation remain unclear. By using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant. These mutations disrupted wild-type BRAF's autoinhibited state, mediated by interactions between the cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, thereby shifting the kinase domain into a preactivated conformation. This structural change likely results from helix αC displacement. PLX8394, a BRAF inhibitor that stabilizes helix αC in an inactive conformation, restored the autoinhibited conformation of oncogenic BRAF, explaining the properties of this class of compounds.",

We found that the nondiapause phenotype in polyvoltine strains results from a specific deletion that disrupts an alternative isoform of CYCLE. We further demonstrated that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to a functional diversity in modulating circadian rhythms and diapause, which has been preserved in Lepidoptera for at least 110 million years.

Here, we performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5 ASB7 E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, CDK1 phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration.

We mapped, validated, and dated key genes associated with seed coat color evolution ( VaPAP1 for loss of mottled black and VaANR1 for gain of red colors). The frequency increases of variants affecting key domestication syndrome substantially predated the wild-cultigen divergence. Together, our results resolve the conflict between genetic and archaeological evidence about adzuki origins and reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of archaeobotanically unobservable traits, consistent with a role of early weak selection during domestication.",

In this work, we show that gcu s encode phage resistance systems, many of which are newly discovered. Bacteriophage resistance integron cassettes (BRiCs) can be combined and mixed with resistance cassettes to produce multiphage or drug and phage resistance. The fitness costs of BRiCs are variable and dependent on the genetic context and can be modulated by changing the order of cassettes in the array.

Cancer-restricted ncHLAp displayed robust immunogenic potential in a sensitive ex vivo T cell priming platform. ncHLAp-reactive, T cell receptor–redirected T cells exhibited tumoricidal activity against patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids.

Using phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), we generated CAST variants with &gt;200-fold average improved integration activity. The evolved CAST system (evoCAST) achieves ~10 to 30% integration efficiencies of kilobase-size DNA cargoes in human cells across 14 tested genomic target sites, including safe harbor loci, sites used for immunotherapy, and genes implicated in loss-of-function diseases, with undetected indels and low levels of off-target integration. Collectively, our findings establish a platform for the laboratory evolution of CASTs and advance a versatile system for programmable gene integration in living systems.",

          "abstract": "During tissue formation, dynamic cell shape changes drive morphogenesis while asymmetric divisions create cellular diversity. We found that the shifts in cell morphology that shape tissues could concomitantly act as conserved instructive cues that trigger asymmetric division and direct core identity decisions underpinning tissue building. We performed single-cell morphometric analyses of endothelial and other mesenchymal-like cells. Distinct morphological changes switched cells to an “isomorphic” mode of division, which preserved pre-mitotic morphology throughout mitosis. In isomorphic divisions, interphase morphology appeared to provide a geometric code defining mitotic symmetry, fate determinant partitioning, and daughter state. Rab4-positive endosomes recognized this code, allowing them to respond to pre-mitotic morphology and segregate determinants accordingly. Thus, morphogenetic shape change sculpts tissue form while also generating cellular heterogeneity, thereby driving tissue assembly.",

          "abstract": "Glaciers adapt slowly to changing climatic conditions, with long-term implications for sea-level rise and water supply. Using eight glacier models, we simulated global glacier evolution over multicentennial timescales, allowing glaciers to equilibrate with climate under various constant global temperature scenarios. We estimate that glaciers globally will lose 39 (range, 15 to 55)% of their mass relative to 2020, corresponding to a global mean sea-level rise of 113 (range, 43 to 204) mm even if temperatures stabilized at present-day conditions. Under the +1.5°C Paris Agreement goal, more than twice as much global glacier mass remains at equilibration (53% versus 24%) compared with the warming level resulting from current policies (+2.7°C by 2100 above preindustrial). Our findings stress the need for stringent mitigation policies to ensure the long-term preservation of glaciers.",

These 1D-HEO nanoribbons exhibit high structural stability at elevated temperatures (to 1000°C), elevated pressures (to 12 gigapascals), and long exposure to harsh acid or base chemical environments. Moreover, they exhibit notable mechanical properties, with an excellent modulus of resilience reaching 40 megajoules per cubic meter. High-pressure experiments reveal an intriguing transformation of the 1D-HEO nanoribbons from orthorhombic to cubic structures at 15 gigapascals followed by the formation of fully amorphous HEOs above 30 gigapascals, which are recoverable to ambient conditions. These transformations introduce additional entropy (structural disorder) besides configurational entropy. This finding offers a way to create low-dimensional, resilient, and high-entropy materials.",

          "abstract": "Coherently controlling the motion of single atoms in optical tweezers would enable new applications in quantum information science. To demonstrate this, we first prepared atoms in their motional ground state using a species-agnostic cooling mechanism that converts motional excitations into erasures, errors with a known location. This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrated. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we performed mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection through local shelving into motional superposition states. We lastly entangled the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generated hyperentanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.",

In this study, we synthesized an ionic salt from C 60 , 4-(1′,5′-dihydro-1′-methyl-2′ H -[5,6] fullereno-C 60 - I h -[1,9-c]pyrrol-2′-yl) phenylmethanaminium chloride (CPMAC), and used it as the electron shuttle in inverted PSCs. The CH 2 -NH 3 + head group in the CPMA cation improved the ETL interface, and the ionic nature enhanced the packing, leading to a ~threefold increase in the interfacial toughness compared with that of C 60 . Using CPMAC, we obtained ~26% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with ~2% degradation after 2100 hours of 1-sun operation at 65°C. For minimodules (four subcells, 6 square centimeters), we achieved a PCE of ~23% with &lt;9% degradation after 2200 hours of operation at 55°C.",

          "abstract": "The role of the Great Acceleration in transitioning the Earth into a new system state invites questions about the acceleration mechanism itself. Here, we use socioeconomic and environmental datasets from Roman Western Anatolia (first c. BCE to seventh c. CE) to investigate the possible mechanisms of globalization-driven acceleration. After the Roman conquest, Anatolia experienced a rapid transition to profoundly anthropogenic landscapes, reaching hitherto unknown levels of agricultural production that remained stable for several centuries. At the socioeconomic level, as revealed by our application of social network analysis to the numismatic data, the growth dynamics continued, leading to ever greater integration. When international conflict in the seventh c. CE disrupted the connectivity, the anthropogenic landscapes rewilded. This dual-system behavior, critical transition followed by equilibrium in the socioecological realm and continued growth in the socioeconomic realm, suggests that the observed postacceleration stabilization necessitated differential balancing of negative and positive feedbacks in each domain.",

This study investigates this topic using representative samples of 4127 Afghans living through the latter stages of the War in Afghanistan and its aftermath. We find that the life satisfaction of Afghans dropped significantly following the conclusion of the War in Afghanistan in 2022, with two-thirds reporting a life satisfaction rating of 0 or 1 on a 0-to-10–point scale. When compared to data from two international well-being datasets together covering more than 170 countries between 1946 and 2022, the mean life satisfaction score in Afghanistan following the Taliban regaining power ( M  = 1.28) is the lowest ever recorded. The mean hope score in the country also dropped to a critically low level ( M  = 1.02) in 2022. Wars are devastating, but the conclusion of war can appear worse from the perspectives of civilians despite the de-escalation of physical violence.",

We examined the impact of TC exposure on infant mortality by linking recently developed TC wind field data with 1,682,249 nationally representative infant survival records from 2002 to 2021 across seven LMICs. We found that, on average, exposure to TCs in utero or in the first year of life led to 4.4 additional infant deaths per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 8.4; 11% increase compared to the sample average infant mortality rate). This average effect was mainly driven by excess mortality in Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, and Haiti, with small and statistically insignificant effects in all other study countries. Further investigation is warranted to understand the mechanisms through which TCs affect infant mortality and why some countries’ children fare better after TC exposure than others.",

Poisson regression models adjusted for demographic and temporal factors showed higher incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for severe outcomes in the most deprived areas compared to the least. We note higher IRRs for severe outcomes for all non-white relative to white ethnicities. The magnitude of IRRs for both deprivation and ethnicities declined from the wild-type to the omicron periods for severe outcomes. For infections, we observed IRRs above one for non-white ethnicities during the wild-type and alpha periods. Vaccination significantly reduced risks across all groups. For severe outcomes, preexisting health inequalities led to large and persistent disparities. For infections, measures must be structured with ethnicity and deprivation in mind early in a pandemic.",

          "abstract": "Action sequencing is fundamental to behavior. A critical decision for survival and reproduction is whether to repeat a current action or switch to a different one. However, the neural mechanisms governing action repetition and switching remain largely unknown. In mice trained to perform heterogeneous action sequences, we found that the M1-DLS circuit regulates action repetition, while the PrL-DMS pathway controls action switching. These distinct functions arise from preferential innervation of striatal D1-SPNs by M1 and D2-SPNs by PrL, respectively. In a Shank3 knockout mouse model of ASD, the D1/D2 innervation ratio in the PrL-DMS pathway was reversed, leading to impaired action switching and repetitive behaviors. Genetic restoration of Shank3 in the DMS rescued both physiological and behavioral deficits. These findings reveal how the brain orchestrates action sequencing in health and disease.",

          "abstract": "Chronic stress exposure is a primary contributor to the development of anxiety disorders, closely associated with hippocampal dysfunction. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS), we observed a notable increase in the activity, rather than its overall expression level, of hippocampal Rap1, a small guanosine triphosphatase belonging to the Ras superfamily. Pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) effectively mitigated CRS-induced anxiety. Cell type–specific manipulation of Rap1 activity revealed that Rap1 dysfunction in vHPC pyramidal neurons (PNs), but not in astrocytes or interneurons, contributed to CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the heightened Rap1 activity in vHPC PNs augmented their intrinsic excitability through Kv4.2 phosphorylation at the Thr 607 site, which contributes to the onset of anxiety-like behaviors in mice following CRS. Overall, our study reveals a previously undescribed anxiogenic effect of Rap1 and highlights it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in stress-related mental disorders.",

          "abstract": "Broadband photodetection, especially for the high-intensity pulsed lasers, has garnered increasing interest in photophysics and applied sciences driven by the development of pulsed lasers. However, direct broadband photodetection of high-intensity pulsed lasers, with precisely capturing their spatiotemporal properties, has been hampered by low saturation intensity or damage threshold of traditional optoelectronic materials. Here, we demonstrate that strategic enhancement of excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) layered hybrid perovskite can enable robust high-order multiphoton absorption (MPA) optoelectronics with achieving strong four-photon absorption (4PA) and five-photon absorption (5PA) nonlinearities as well as efficient electronic properties simultaneously. This effectively overcomes the limitations of mainstream photodetectors. Our approach facilitates direct photodetection and high-precision imaging of high-intensity femtosecond lasers (21.5 GW/cm 2 ) across a broad wavelength range of 800 to 2300 nanometer. These results offer valuable insights into advancing high-order nonlinearity-based optoelectronics and provide practical solutions for direct measurement tools of intensive lasers, filling the blank of high-precision characterization of intense-field laser phenomena.",

We show that oligomeric Aß (oAß) induces the expression of Hif1a and Egln3 in microglia in vitro, together with the transcription of the type I interferon signature (IFNS) genes in a PHD3-dependent manner. We identify FOXO3 as a repressor of IFNS, whose abundance decreases upon PHD3 induction in response to oAß. In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlates with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature, an increase in microglia proximity to Aß plaques and phagocytosis of both Aß and small plaques. PHD3 deficiency mitigated the Aß plaque–associated neuropathology and rescued behavioral deficits of an AD mouse model. Last, we demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression in the absence of Aß pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and behavioral alterations. Together, our data strongly indicate that the inactivation of the PHD3-FOXO3 axis controls the microglial IFNS in a cell autonomous manner, improving AD outcome.",

          "abstract": "Digital twins, which replicate real-world entities through computational models, are transforming manufacturing and automation. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled data-driven digital twin development using discrete-time data and finite-depth models on digital hardware, these approaches face significant limitations. They struggle to capture continuous-time dynamics and model complex systems, and suffer from substantial time and energy overheads due to physically separated storage and processing as well as frequent analog-digital (A/D) conversions. Here, we propose a memristive neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for digital twins. Our approach is intrinsically time-continuous using infinite-depth neural networks to model complex dynamics. Fully analog memristor arrays collocate storage and computation, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck and reducing A/D conversion requirements. We experimentally validate our solver on digital twins of HP variable-resistor model and Lorenz96 dynamics, demonstrating a 166.5-fold/369.3-fold speedup and a 499.0-fold/673.9-fold improvement in energy efficiency, respectively. This work paves the way to future digital twins for Industry 4.0.",

          "abstract": "Linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibiotic, is widely used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and drug-resistant Gram-positive infections. However, prolonged use is associated with severe hematologic toxicity, the underlying mechanisms of which remain incompletely understood, particularly regarding the role of linezolid metabolites. Our clinical study indicates that elevated exposure to PNU142586, a primary metabolite of linezolid, is associated with an increased risk of linezolid-induced toxicity, even in the absence of renal impairment. To elucidate its mechanism, we identify DNA topoisomerase 2-α (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-β (TOP2B) as primary targets of PNU142586 at molecular, cellular, and in vivo levels. PNU142586 disrupts replication and transcription by impeding DNA binding to TOP2A and TOP2B with a favorable conformation for cleavage and by inhibiting adenosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis, ultimately leading to antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study thus provides mechanistic insight into linezolid-induced hematologic toxicity and offers a foundation for safer antibiotic development and improved clinical monitoring through biomarker identification.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the regulation of N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A), the prominent internal modification in mRNA, fosters the development of potential therapeutic strategies for human cancers. While the m 6 A demethylases FTO and ALKBH5 are recognized for their crucial roles in various cancers, their impact on lymphoid leukemia remains uncertain. Using T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model system, we identify FTO as a unique vulnerability in T cell leukemia. Knockout of FTO , but not ALKBH5 , significantly suppresses leukemia initiation and progression. Mechanistic analysis reveals that FTO heightens ELK3 mRNA stability in an m 6 A-dependent manner. Elevated ELK3 in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of glycolytic genes. Pharmacological inhibition of FTO suppresses ELK3 expression, hampers glycolysis and manifests remarkable antileukemia efficacy. Our findings unravel the crucial role of FTO in T-ALL and highlight the FTO-ELK3 axis as a key nodule during leukemogenesis, thereby providing a fundamental basis to harness selective FTO antagonist for T-ALL therapeutics.",

We reveal that preceramic hunter-gatherers represent a previously unknown basal lineage that derives from the initial South American radiation. These hunter-gatherers do not carry differential affinity to ancient North American groups nor contribute genetically to ancient or present-day South American populations. By 2000 years ago, the local genetic ancestry is replaced by populations from Central America associated with the Herrera ceramic complex and survives through the Muisca period despite major cultural changes.

However, whether small nucleolar RNAs participate in the regulation of ISC self-renewal remains unclear. Here, we identified a small nucleolar RNA ( Snora54 ) that was highly expressed in the nucleolus of ISCs. Snora54 knockout enhanced the self-renewal capacity of ISCs and intestinal regeneration. Mechanistically, in a steady state, highly expressed Snora54 anchored the nucleolar protein Lyar in the nucleolus of ISCs, preventing Lyar from translocation into the nucleoplasm. Thereby, Lyar failed to recruit on the Notch2 promoter region in the nucleoplasm to promote Notch2 transcription, leading to suppression of ISC self-renewal. By contrast, with deletion of Snora54 , Lyar translocated to the nucleoplasm of ISCs where it enriched on the Notch2 promoter to initiate its transcription resulting in the activation of Notch2 signaling pathway. Therefore, Snora54 negatively regulates self-renewal of ISCs and gut regeneration via suppression of Notch2 signaling.",

Here, we show that hair follicle SCs (HF-SCs) sense mechanical forces through cell adhesion and maintain quiescence in a PIEZO1-dependent mechanism. PIEZO1 interacts with E-cadherin in HF-SCs, and mechanical pulling of E-cadherin with a force of ~20 pN triggers PIEZO1-dependent, localized calcium flickers. Deletion of Piezo1 leads to reduced cumulative calcium influx and compromises quiescence. Single-cell genomic analyses identify a transcriptional network involving AP1 and NFATC1, which functions downstream of PIEZO1 and regulates the expression of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton genes to reinforce the unique mechanical property of HF-SCs. These findings establish the force threshold necessary for PIEZO1 activation and reveal PIEZO1-dependent calcium influx as a key mechanism for sensing mechanical cues in the niche and regulating HF-SC activity.",

In humans, learning and memory are severely disrupted by mutations in the potassium channel Slack (KCNT1, Slo2.2). We find that pharmacological stimulation of this channel and a constitutively active Slack mutation stimulate mRNA translation of a reporter for β-actin mRNA in cell lines and increases the synthesis of β-actin in the neurites of cortical neurons. Moreover, channel activation promotes the binding of two key mRNA translation regulators, FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) and CYFIP1 (cytoplasmic FMR1–interacting protein 1), to the channel itself, releasing both from eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), where they normally inhibit initiation of translation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for Slack activity–dependent regulation of translation and suggests that the effects of Slack mutations on this process may explain the severe intellectual disabilities associated with these mutations.",

Using over 9 years of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, we present the first observations of present-day sputtering in the martian upper atmosphere. By correlating argon densities with solar electric fields, we find that sputtered rates of argon are over four times higher than model predictions. We also present evidence of enhanced sputtering during a solar storm, offering a glimpse at more intense conditions in the early solar system.

Using confirmatory factor analysis, psychophysical experiments, and resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging methods, our study demonstrated that events have an independent storage space within WM, named as event cache, with distinct neural correlates compared to object storage in WM. We found the cerebellar network to be the most essential network for event cache, with the left cerebellum Crus I being particularly involved in encoding and maintaining events.

Through weighted correlation network analysis of 3164 lipid species from 930 samples, we identified 16 structurally distinct lipid clusters co-occurred across diverse oceanographic conditions. The highest lipid diversity was observed in the polar oceans, where plankton uses chain shortening for cold acclimation. Conversely, in the surface of tropical and subtropical oceans, plankton showed enrichment in non-phosphorus lipids, likely responding to warm temperature, with potential implications for the elemental stoichiometry of the biological pump. In the subsurface of these regions, highly unsaturated lipids were enriched, suggesting phytoplankton adaptation to low light and contributing unsaturated fatty acids to tropical and subtropical ocean food webs.",

          "abstract": "The Tijuana River, at the US-Mexico border, discharges millions of gallons of wastewater daily—sewage, industrial waste, and runoff—into the Pacific Ocean, making it the dominant source of coastal pollution in this region. This study examines how such wastewater influences coastal aerosols by tracking spatial gradients from near the border northward. Using benzoylecgonine (a nonvolatile cocaine metabolite) as a sewage tracer, we find that wastewater compounds—including a mixture of illicit drugs, drug metabolites, and chemicals from tires and personal care products—become aerosolized and are detectable in both water and air. Spatial analyses confirm that most measured chemicals concentrate in aerosols near the Tijuana River, potentially exposing local populations to tens of nanograms per hour (e.g., octinoxate and methamphetamine) via inhalation. This airborne pathway highlights a largely overlooked source of atmospheric pollution, emphasizing the need to reassess health risks in coastal regions as global water contamination continues to escalate.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of dissipative Kerr solitons in nonlinear resonators has revolutionized the generation of on-chip coherent optical frequency combs. The formation of dissipative Kerr solitons in conventional single resonators hinges on balancing the resonator dissipation against the parametric gain and balancing the resonator dispersion against the resonance frequency shifts introduced by the Kerr nonlinearity. Here, we theoretically introduce a previously unidentified class of non-Hermitian soliton combs that are enabled by engineering the dissipation and dispersion of a coupled resonator array with nonreciprocal couplings. We show that these non-Hermitian soliton combs allow unprecedented postfabrication agile reconfigurability of the soliton comb spectrum, where the number of comb lines, as well as their frequency spacing, can be markedly tuned by simply tuning the hopping phases between resonators. Such reconfigurable non-Hermitian combs generated using coupled resonator arrays could enable new functionalities for a multitude of comb applications.",

          "abstract": "β-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP)–cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for amyloid-β (Aβ) generation and is considered promising drug target for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The co-chaperone BAG3 (Bcl-2–associated athanogene 3) plays an important role in maintaining intracellular protein homeostasis by regulating heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Here, we reported that BAG3 expression was significantly elevated in AD. It interacted with and stabilized BACE1 by delaying its degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal pathways. BAG3 E455K and BAG3 R480A mutations reduced their interaction with BACE1. SPOT peptide arrays revealed that BACE1 carboxyl-terminal peptide fragments bound to the RQ domain of BAG3. This interaction can be disrupted by BACE1-derived peptide (Tat-BACE1 480-494 ), leading to decreased BACE1 stability. In APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, Tat-BACE1 480-494 reduced BACE1 levels, decreased Aβ production, and improved synaptic and cognitive deficits. These findings indicate that BAG3 forms complex with HSP70 and BACE1 to stabilize BACE1, suggesting that Tat-BACE1 480-494 , may represent an ideal class of neuroprotective therapeutics against AD.",

Closed-basin brines, which generate ~40% of global lithium production, often have a circumneutral pH; however, during the evaporative concentration required for lithium production, the evaporated brines become acidic. Using primary geochemical and boron isotope data from the Salar de Uyuni (SDU), Bolivia combined with a modeling approach, we show that boron enrichment, which commonly co-occurs with lithium in closed-basin brines, is the primary factor in controlling the pH of brines from the SDU. We demonstrate that boron in global lithium- and boron-rich brines from closed basins exerts a similar influence on brine pH. The unique boron enrichments and its speciation can explain large proportions of alkalinity in these brines (~98% at the SDU), where evaporation alters the dissociation of boric acid, which triggers the formation of acidic evaporated brines.",

However, current ion delivery platforms lack precise administration over distribution and retention time within the tumor microenvironment, leading to high systemic toxicity and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy. Here, local electrochemical immunotherapy is developed by implanting a tumor microenvironment–activated Zn//MnO 2 battery, which uses body fluid as an electrolyte and endogenous glutathione as a redox mediator to promote sustained generation and localized retention of electrochemical products (Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ ). These elements trigger the ICD effect through reactive oxygen species accumulation and stimulate the STING pathway to activate immune cells effectively. Strategic placement of this battery around subcutaneous tumor sites results in a 99.6% growth inhibition rate after a 14-day treatment. This work demonstrates a powerful electrochemical tool for drug-free cancer immunotherapy, which may open an avenue for sustained and localized delivery of immune agonists.",

          "abstract": "Vanadium oxides (VOs) are promising cathode materials for aqueous batteries due to their high theoretical capacity, but they face challenges such as sluggish kinetics and V dissolution. To overcome these issues, we introduce a universal alcohol-based molecule coupling (AMC) method to regulate amorphousness and inhibit V dissolution in VOs (VO 2 , V 2 O 5 , and V 6 O 13 ), resulting in high-performance cathodes. The strategy enables alcohol molecules with different chain lengths (ethanol, isopropanol, and isobutanol) to couple with VOs by forming V─OH bonds under Lewis acid–based interactions, inducing controlled amorphization. Among these, isopropanol coupling stands out by enabling the formation of short-range ordered amorphous structure (SOA-VO/Ipr). This structure enhances the reaction kinetics and suppresses V dissolution. As a result, the SOA-VO/Ipr cathode achieves 219.4 mAh g −1 at 100 A g −1 , retains 92.6% capacity over 10,000 cycles, and delivers 228.8 mAh g −1 at 9.1 A g −1 under high loading (21.9 mg cm −2 ) over 3500 cycles, demonstrating a promising method for durable zinc-ion batteries.",

Using a mouse gambling task with a reinforcement-learning model, we described individual decision-making profiles as a combination of three archetypal strategies: Optimizers, Risk-averse, and Explorers. These strategies reflected stable differences in the parameters generating decisions (sensitivity to the reward magnitude, to risk, or to punishment) derived from a reinforcement-learning model of animal choice. Chemogenetic manipulation showed that dorsomedial striatum (DMS) neurons substantially affect decision-making, while the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum neurons (DLS) have lesser or no effects, respectively. Specifically, DMS dSPNs decrease risk aversion by increasing the perceived value of risky choices, while DMS iSPNs emphasize large gains, affecting decisions depending on decision-making profiles. Hence, we propose that striatal populations from different subregions influence distinct decision-making parameters, leading to profile-dependent choices.",

Thus, structural data for seven time frames were sorted into groups of molecular events along the reaction coordinate. They range from chromophore isomerization to the formation of Meta-F, the intermediate that precedes the functional relevant secondary structure transition of the tongue.

The metafilm features a sandwich structure with fluorinated ethylene propylene/indium tin oxide outer layers for raindrop-induced electricity generation and thermochromic core layers for self-regulated heating and cooling. It achieves an optical contrast exceeding 63% in the visible spectrum, enabling sub-ambient cooling in hot conditions and above-ambient heating when cold. In addition, it demonstrates efficient droplet-induced electricity generation, delivering a high-voltage output of 208 volts with exceptional long-term stability.

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter plays a key role in coordinating metabolic homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial metabolic pathways and calcium signaling. However, a comprehensive analysis of uniporter-regulated mitochondrial pathways has remained unexplored. Here, we investigate consequences of uniporter loss and gain of function using uniporter knockout cells and fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), which we demonstrate to have elevated mitochondrial calcium levels. We find that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism and the urea cycle are uniporter-regulated pathways. Reduced uniporter function boosts expression of BCAA catabolism genes and the urea cycle enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase. In contrast, high uniporter activity in FLC suppresses their expression. This suppression is mediated by the transcription factor KLF15, a master regulator of liver metabolism. Thus, the uniporter plays a central role in FLC-associated metabolic changes, including hyperammonemia. Our study identifies an important role for the uniporter in metabolic adaptation through transcriptional regulation of metabolism and elucidates its importance for BCAA and ammonia metabolism.",

Here, we report a tough underwater robot that exhibits an accurate, three-dimensional, and multimodal motion. Counterintuitively, the soft robot is composed of polymers that are not photo-mechanically responsive but are powered by the ambient fluid. The unique feature notably widens the pool of material selection and allows further treatment to strengthen the polymer matrix without concerns of trade-off between the mechanical properties with the actuation capability.

NAECs were differentiated, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and in vitro RSV infection. Gene expression of NAECs from children with a wheeze phenotype indicated abnormal differentiation and basal cell activation of developmental pathways, plasticity in precursor differentiation, delayed onset of maturation, increased diversity of RSV receptors, and blunted antiviral immune responses to in vitro RSV infection. The most marked changes in differentiation were observed in NAECs from children with both wheeze and RSV in the first year of life.

Because Kv1 channels have a highly conserved PDZ-binding motif, we used CRISPR-based genome editing to screen 18 PDZ domain-containing proteins identified in our previous AIS proximity proteome for their AIS localization. Among these, we found that the scaffolding proteins SCRIB and PSD93 are highly enriched at the AIS. Using CRISPR-mediated knockout, cell surface clustering assays, and coimmunoprecipitation, we show that SCRIB and PSD93 bind to and are required for AIS Kv1 channel clustering, whereas SCRIB links the AIS Kv1 channel protein complex to the master AIS scaffolding protein AnkyrinG.

The structure reveals a substrate interaction surface on the AMBRA1 WD40 domain that specifically binds to the C-terminal region of D-type cyclins. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr 286 residue in the C-terminal phosphodegron site of D-type cyclins.

However, there have been no self-consistent models that quantify whether this process can generate the required field intensities. Our impact and magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that for an initial maximum surface field of only 2 microtesla, plasmas created from basin-forming impacts can amplify a planetary dipole field at the basin antipode to ~43 microtesla.

Exhaust emission standards, forcing improvements in combustion and exhaust after-treatment technology, considerably decreases combustion-related PM 2.5 emitted by modern cars. A549 cancerous alveolar and BEAS-2B normal bronchial epithelial cells were exposed at the air-liquid interface to the total aerosol or gas phase of either fresh or photochemically aged tailpipe emissions from a gasoline EURO 6d car equipped with a gasoline particulate filter. Diluted fresh emissions contained particle number concentrations comparable to low ambient air levels and induced no detectable cytotoxicity. Photochemical aging led to the formation of secondary aerosols and caused significant cytotoxicity. While the aged aerosol induced significant DNA damage, oxidative stress was more associated with volatile secondary species. Our results call for the consideration of the exhaust emission atmospheric transformation processes in future emission standards toward health effect-driven emission regulations.",

Here, we demonstrate in situ tunable, room-temperature polariton condensation in individual states of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger topological lattice by using an open-cavity configuration with an organic polymer layer. Changing the cavity length in combination with vibron-mediated relaxation in the polymer allows us to achieve selective polariton condensation into different states of the band structure, unveiled by nonlinear emission, linewidth narrowing, energy blue shift, and extended macroscopic coherence. Furthermore, we engineer the bandgap and the edge state localization by adjusting the interaction between adjacent lattice sites. Our results demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of the platform for the investigation of quantum fluids in complex potential landscapes and topological effects at room temperature.",

          "abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons influence diverse behaviors with varied firing patterns, yet the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We introduce a multiplexed genetically encoded sensor–based imaging and voltammetry method to simultaneously record synaptic, perisynaptic, and extrasynaptic dopaminergic transmission at mouse central neurons. Using this method alongside a genetically encoded sensor–based image analysis program, we found that heterogeneous dopaminergic firing patterns create various transmission modes, encoding frequency, number, and synchrony of firing pulses using neurotransmitter quantity, releasing synapse count, and synaptic and/or volume transmission. Under both tonic and low-frequency phasic activities, transporters effectively reuptake dopamine at perisynaptic sites, confining dopamine within synaptic clefts to mediate synaptic transmission. In contrast, under high-frequency, particularly synchronized firing activity or transporter inhibition, released dopamine may overwhelm transporters, escaping from synaptic clefts via one to three outlet channels, triggering volume transmission. Our study illuminates a collaborative mechanism of synaptic enclosures, properties, and transporters that defines the coding principles of activity pattern–dependent dopaminergic transmission modes.",

Herein, we developed a series of two-component OIMH amorphous glasses consisting of (TPG) 2 MnBr 4 (TPG + , triphenylguanidium) and A 2 MnBr 4 (A, organic molten cation), named α G (A x TPG y ). The high glass-formation ability (GFA) in (TPG) 2 MnBr 4 provides a platform to modulate the crystallization of another molten A 2 MnBr 4 by homogeneous melting. Moreover, the GFA modulation allows controlled in situ crystallization of α G (A x TPG y ) and the formation of transparent glass-crystal composites with higher luminescence efficiency. For instance, the light yield of α G (PTP 99 TPG 1 ) (PTP + , propyltriphenylphosphonium) is improved from 18,800 to 35,140 photons per mega–electron volt after annealing at 55°C, showing huge application potentials in radiation detection and high-resolution x-ray imaging.

Our model demonstrates robust recycling of synaptic vesicles that maintains consistent synaptic release, even during sustained high-frequency firing. We also show how the cytosolic proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 cooperate to regulate recruitment of reserve pool vesicles during sustained firing to maintain transmission, as well as the potential of selective vesicle active zone tethering to ensure rapid vesicle replenishment while minimizing reserve pool recruitment. We also monitored vesicle usage in isolated hippocampal neurons using pH-sensitive pHluorin, demonstrating that reserve vesicle recruitment depends on firing frequency, even at nonphysiologically high firing frequencies, as predicted by the model.",

We demonstrated the therapeutic potential of its pharmacological inhibition in glioblastoma using DDP_38003 (LSD1i), which selectively targets tumor-initiating cells (TICs) by hampering their adaptability to stress. Through biological, metabolic, and omic approaches, we now show that LSD1i acts as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor, activating the integrated stress response and altering mitochondrial structure and function. These effects impair TICs’ oxidative metabolism and generate reactive oxygen species, further amplifying cellular stress. LSD1i also impairs TICs’ glycolytic activity, causing their metabolic decline. TICs with enhanced glycolysis benefit from LSD1-directed therapy. Conversely, metabolically silent TICs mantain ER and mitochondrial homeostasis, adapting to stress conditions, including LSD1i treatment. A dropout short hairpin RNA screening identifies postglycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment to proteins inositol deacylase 1 (PGAP1) as a mediator of resistance to LSD1i. Disruptions in ER and mitochondrial balance holds promise for improving LSD1-targeted therapy efficacy and overcoming treatment resistance.",

Tumor vasculature also plays a pivotal role in immunoregulation and antitumor immunity. Here, we show that small GTPase Rab27 controls the vascular morphogenesis and permeability for blood content and immune effectors. Thus, in Rab27a/b double knock out (Rab27-dKO) mice, the brain vasculature is abnormally scarce, while the blood vessels become dysmorphic and hyperpermeable in the context of brain tumors, including syngeneic glioblastoma. These defects are reflected in rearrangements of endothelial cell subpopulations with underlying diminution of venous endothelial subtype along with changes in gene and protein expression. Notably, Rab27-dKO brain endothelial cells exhibit deficient tight junctions, whereby they enable large-scale extravasation of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor mass. We show that Rab27-regulated vascular T cell infiltration can be exploited to enhance adoptive T cell therapy in syngeneic brain tumors.",

Overexpression of PTMA in primary mouse and rat cardiomyocytes significantly promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and similarly enhanced proliferation in human iPSC–derived cardiomyocytes. Conditional knockout of Ptma in cardiomyocytes impaired neonatal heart regeneration. AAV9-mediated overexpression of Ptma extended the neonatal proliferative window and showed therapeutic promise for enhancing adult heart regeneration. Mechanistically, PTMA interacted with MBD3, inhibiting its deacetylation activity within the MBD3/HDAC1 NuRD complex. This inhibition increased STAT3 acetylation, which positively regulated STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of its target genes.

To further understand the low current density observed in human Na V 1.9, we created chimeras with Na V 1.5 and identified a role for the C-tail—specifically the IQ motif and EF-hand—in regulating current densities, likely due to a weak affinity for calmodulin. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated that, unlike other Na V channel subtypes, calmodulin binding to the C-tail is likely too weak to occur under physiological conditions. Markedly, the pre-IQ region did not influence channel expression but was responsible for conferring the characteristic depolarized voltage dependency of inactivation of Na V 1.9. Our findings provide insights into the unique gating mechanisms of Na V 1.9 and demonstrate the robustness of this platform for structure-function studies.",

By release control, instant short-term inflammation suppression is combined with sustained mechano-transduction signal inhibition. This dynamically modulates immune responses and delays En1 + fibroblast activation via the YAP-TEAD pathway, ultimately facilitating scarless wound regeneration. Genomic analyses showed that the enhanced reepithelization and mechanoregulation by MLVgel during different wound phases are indispensable for its therapeutic outcomes.

          "abstract": "Genomes adapt dynamically to alterations in the signaling milieu, including inflammation that transiently or permanently disrupts genome function. Here, we elucidate how a progenitor cell genome senses and responds to inflammation when the developmental and transcriptional regulator GATA2 is limiting, which causes bone marrow failure in humans and mice and predisposes to leukemia in humans. GATA2 low murine progenitors are hypersensitive to inflammatory mediators. We discovered that the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 conferred transcriptional activation in GATA2 low progenitors in response to Interferon-γ and Toll-Like Receptor 1/2 agonists. In a locus-specific manner, inflammation reconfigured genome activity by promoting PU.1 recruitment to chromatin or tuning activity of PU.1-preoccupied chromatin. The recruitment mechanism disproportionately required IKKβ activity. Inflammation-activated genes were enriched in motifs for RUNX factors that cooperate with GATA factors. Contrasting with the GATA2-RUNX1 cooperativity paradigm, GATA2 suppressed and RUNX1 promoted PU.1 mechanisms to endow the progenitor genome with inflammation-sensing capacity.",

          "abstract": "Traditional dynamic random access memory (DRAM) technology faces grand challenges in power consumption due to the constant data refresh and in density due to the physical limit for dimension scaling. Recently, two-transistor zero-capacitor (2T0C) DRAM based on amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) exhibits long data retention owing to its extremely low off-state leakage current. Furthermore, the low thermal budget of the IGZO channel enables the monolithic three-dimensional (3D) stacking for higher bit density beyond the planar scaling limit. However, the demonstration of 3D stacking for IGZO has been limited to 2T0C DRAM single cell. In this work, an 8 by 8 3D stacked IGZO 2T0C DRAM array was designed and manufactured with optimized electrical characteristics, exhibiting 3-bit storage with over 100-second retention time. Furthermore, a neural network model has been demonstrated to achieve an accuracy of 94.95% in image recognition, providing for promising pathway toward computing in memory to overcome the “memory wall.”",

Although exciton transport reported in 2D materials barely exceeds 1 to 2 micrometers, coherent coupling of excitons with photons to form polaritons enables extended transport lengths and offers opportunities to use photonic mode engineering for tailored transport. Conventional vertical cavity or waveguide polaritons, however, are challenging to tune and integrate into photonic circuits. We report the transport of transition metal dichalcogenide polaritons in 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode engineering, and integration. We achieve an order-of-magnitude enhancement in transport length compared to bare excitons and reveal transport dependence on polariton dispersion and population dynamics, which are controlled via photonic crystal design and pump intensity. Stimulated relaxation observed in the system suggests the potential for forming superfluid polaritons with frictionless transport. These findings establish 2D photonic crystal polaritons as a versatile platform for advancing photonic energy transport technologies.",

Notably, macrophage hitchhiking delivery of β-elemene–loaded GeSNSs not only achieves high accumulation in tumor regions and suppresses tumor growth under ultrasound treatment, but also effectively remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by improving M1-like macrophage polarization and enhancing the populations of mature dendritic cells, CD4 + , and CD8 + lymphocytes, thereby facilitating enhanced sonodynamic chemoimmunotherapy.

Enhancing single-photon emission by engineering their photonic environment is essential for improving overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often limited by the need for ultraprecise emitter placement within conventional photonic cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré pattern, we propose a multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated flatband. Theoretical analysis reveals that, with nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity simultaneously has a high Purcell factor and large tolerance over the emitter’s position, breaking the constraints of conventional cavities. We then experimentally demonstrate various cavity quantum electrodynamic phenomena with a quantum dot in moiré cavity. A large tuning range (up to 40-fold) of quantum dot’s radiative lifetime is achieved through strong Purcell enhancement and inhibition effects.

Strikingly, neural patterns evoked by predicted shapes in CA2/3, pre/parasubiculum, and the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) were negatively correlated to patterns evoked by the same shapes when actually presented. Using layer-specific analyses, we ask: In which direction are predictions communicated between the hippocampus and neocortex? Superficial layers of the MTL cortex project to the hippocampus, while the deep layers receive feedback projections. Informational connectivity analyses revealed that communication between CA2/3 and PHC was specific to the deep layers of PHC.

By tuning the polymer fraction and nanoparticle size, we optimize condensation and droplet formation. As vapor pressure increases, voids fill with condensate, which subsequently exudes onto the surface as microscopic droplets.

GLF-MINFLUX allowed live-cell single-protein tracking with 7.8-nanometer precision at ~200-microsecond temporal resolution, revealing distinct diffusion behaviors and rates between the basal membrane and filopodia.

To elucidate the drivers of mantle redox variation, we performed mixed reaction experiments between carbonatite melt and Fe 0 -bearing peridotite at 9 to 21 gigapascals under varying redox conditions. Comparing our results with sublithospheric diamond inclusions, we find that majorite and ferropericlase inclusions from the Amazonia Craton reflect a predominantly reduced, nonplume mantle environment, while majorites from the Kaapvaal Craton indicate a fully oxidized plume setting. In nonplume environments, carbonatite melts are progressively consumed until fully frozen as reduced carbon. Attachment of these materials to the cratonic keel further enhances craton stability. In plume environments, carbonatite melts surpass the redox buffering capacity of Fe 0 , leading to an oxidized, CO 2 -rich melt-bearing mantle. Impregnation of these melts into the lithosphere weakens the cratonic keel, resulting in lithosphere delamination, surface uplift, and widespread volcanism.",

Variant polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) exists as several subtypes, which are “writers” of ubiquitylation on histone H2A K118 and K119, crucial for transcriptional repression during development and cell identity determination. The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by variant PRC1 complexes couples to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until it reaches a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2, and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity.",

S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2 hi TAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance. Targeting S1P synthesis with a NEK2 inhibitor or S1P antagonist disrupted the immunosuppressive function of macrophages, shifted regulatory T cells (T regs ) to T H 17 cells, and increased the number and activity of tumor-infiltrating T effectors, thereby enhancing antitumor efficacy in synergy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.",

We measured the length of 134 wild clown anemonefish every month and monitored temperature at the scale of their anemone for five lunar months. Our results show that clown anemonefish shrink in response to heat stress and individuals that shrink also display relatively more catch-up growth. Further, shrinking is modulated by social rank and size, and individuals that shrink more often and in a coordinated fashion with their breeding partner have higher survival during the heat stress event. In conclusion, a plastic individual growth response to heat stress, constrained by the social environment, can lead to short-term survival benefits.

          "abstract": "Lightning discharges can produce transient gamma-ray emissions called terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), which originates from electrons accelerated to relativistic energies in strong electric fields. However, it is not yet understood how lightning produces an enormous number of relativistic electrons in dense atmospheres. We present that, thanks to a ground-based observation with optical, radio frequency and high-energy measurements focused on television transmission towers in Kanazawa, Japan, a TGF and a cloud-to-ground discharge of −56 kA occurred when a downward negative leader was colliding with an upward positive leader from the tower. Because the cloud-to-ground current followed the TGF by 30 μs, the TGF started when two leaders approached each other. Our results indicate that an immense number of electrons were produced and accelerated to relativistic energies in a strong and compact electric-field region between the two leaders.",

          "abstract": "An organism’s survival depends on its ability to anticipate forthcoming events and detect discrepancies between the expected and actual sensory inputs. We analyzed data from mice performing a visual go/no-go change-detection task where the sequence of stimulus presentations was intermittently interrupted by omission of a stimulus. The omission of a visual stimulus did not elicit discernable spiking responses in visual cortical neurons. Instead, firing rates between image presentations, including the omission period, ramped linearly and without interruption at the time of the omitted image. Several neuron types in visual cortex neurons were identified with various responses to images and their omissions. A minority of cells in nonvisual areas, including the hippocampus, increased their firing rates at the omitted stimulus onset even when these neurons did not respond to the images. Our study elucidates the origin of omission responses in the visual cortex and sheds light on the role of hippocampal and subcortical circuits in omission detection.",

Using aerosol mass spectrometry over multiple years in LA illustrates the controlling dynamics of AN and their evolution over the past decades. These data suggest that much of the nitric acid (HNO 3 ) production required to produce AN in LA occurs during the nighttime via heterogeneous hydrolysis of N 2 O 5 . Further, we show that US Environmental Protection Agency–codified techniques for measuring total PM 2.5 fail to quantify the AN component, while low-cost optical sensors demonstrate good agreement. While previous studies suggest that declining NO x has reduced AN, we show that HNO 3 formation is still substantial and leads to the formation of many tens of micrograms per cubic meter of AN aerosol. Continued focus on reductions in NO x will help meet the PM 2.5 standards in the LA basin and many other regions.",

Here, we reveal a previously unidentified mechanism by which CD40L-expressing CD8 + T cells induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In murine models, up to 50% of tumor-specific CD8 + T cells expressed CD40L, and conditional CD40L ablation in CD8 + T cells alone led to tumor formation. Mechanistically, CD40L + CD8 + T cells can induce cell death in CD40-expressing cancer cells by triggering caspase-8 activation. We demonstrate that a gene signature for resistance to CD40 signaling–induced cell death strongly correlates with worse survival in different human cancer cohorts. Our results introduce CD40L as a rather counterintuitive, noncanonical cytotoxic factor that complements the capabilities of CD8 + T cells to combat cancers and has the potential to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies.",

Although fragrances contain terpenes capable of generating OH through ozonolysis, the much larger amount of ethanol solvent acts as a large OH sink.

We observe measurement resolution at the nanometer (attosecond) scale with only O (10 4 ) photon pairs, despite the presence of background and loss. Our nondestructive thickness measurement of a metallic thin film agrees with atomic force microscopy, which often achieves better resolution via destructive means.

Using WGMAF, molecular responders had a median overall survival (OS) of 319 days compared to 126 days for nonresponders [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.11–0.79, P  = 0.011]. For ARTEMIS-DELFI, patients with low scores after therapy initiation had longer median OS than patients with high scores (233 versus 172 days, HR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.046–0.31, P  &lt; 0.0001).

Here, using single-cell RNA and neutrophil SMART RNA sequencing, we showed that CCR5 + neutrophils were significantly increased in patients with depression and preferentially migrated to the hippocampus in a mouse model of depression. Infiltrated neutrophils engulf neuronal spines and subsequently promote depressive symptoms in male mice. Furthermore, by genetic or pharmacologic disruption, we identified a chemotactic effect of the astrocyte-derived chemokine CCL5 on mediating the infiltration of CCR5 + neutrophils and behavioral disorders in male depressed mice. Our findings therefore highlight the critical role of neutrophils in depression pathogenesis and astrocytes in mediating the dysregulation of innate immune responses and suggest that inhibition of CCL5/CCR5-mediated neutrophil infiltration represents a potential therapeutic strategy for noninfectious brain diseases such as depression.",

This study investigates the effects of laser peak power and ENZ mode excitation on hot electron relaxation in TCOs. Our experimental analysis theoretically supported by a hydrodynamic model reveals that increasing laser pulse intensity extends hot electron relaxation time by more than 200%, while ENZ mode excitation increases it by more than 40% in representative TCO ENZ materials. This research demonstrates the controllable modulation of ultrafast ENZ nonlinearity via pulse peak power and ENZ mode field enhancement.

Mice expressing mutant Leu 115 Arg CSPα/DNAJC5 are viable but develop motor deficits.

In condensed matter systems, interactions between collective modes offer avenues for nonlinear coherent manipulation of coupled excitations and quantum phases. Antiferromagnets, with inherently coupled magnon modes, provide a promising platform for nonlinear control of spin waves and magnetization. However, nonlinear magnon-magnon interactions have been only partially elaborated, leaving key gaps in the prospects for potential ultrahigh-bandwidth magnonic signal processing. Here, we excite two distinct coherent magnon modes in an antiferromagnet and find that the magnon mode with a lower frequency undergoes amplification when the higher-frequency mode is driven. We unveil the nonlinear excitation pathways of this stimulated parametric downconversion process by using polarization-selective two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy. Our work provides fundamental insights into nonlinear magnonics in antiferromagnets, laying the groundwork for forthcoming spintronic and magnonic devices.",

Even with evolutionary opportunities presented by a disrupted ecosystem, low-diversity groups prior to the extinction or those originating in the Cenozoic rarely reach higher ranks today, implying long-term diversity ceilings to certain ecological roles. Clades that survived the extinction tend to dominate functions today, 66 million years post-extinction, but both relative richness and phylogenetic structure of those functional groups have been significantly shuffled. Thus, neither the composition of the pre-extinction biota nor the set of taxa that survived the extinction fully accounts for the functional and phylogenetic structure of today’s biota.

We show that SCAR/WAVE contribution to M. truncatula root hair or Arabidopsis thaliana trichome formation is dependent on two central intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Differential functionalities of M. truncatula SCAR proteins were furthermore associated with the presence/absence of a 42–amino acid sequence within the IDR that affected protein stability.
