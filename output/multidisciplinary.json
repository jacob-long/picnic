          "authors": "Felix C. Raps, Ariadna Rivas-Souchet, Chey M. Jones, Todd K. Hyster",
          "abstract": "C–N bond formation is integral to modern chemical synthesis due to the ubiquity of nitrogen heterocycles in small-molecule pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Alkene hydroamination with unactivated alkenes is an atom economical strategy for constructing these bonds. However, these reactions are challenging to render asymmetric when preparing fully substituted carbon stereocenters. Here, we report a photoenzymatic alkene hydroamination to prepare 2,2-disubstituted pyrrolidines by a Baeyer-Villiger Monooxygenase. Five rounds of protein engineering afforded a mutant, providing excellent product yield and stereoselectivity. Unlike related photochemical hydroaminations, which rely on the oxidation of the amine or alkene for C–N bond formation, this work exploits a through-space interaction of a reductively generated benzylic radical and the nitrogen lone pair. This antibonding interaction lowers the oxidation potential of the radical, enabling electron transfer to the flavin cofactor. Experiments indicate that the enzyme microenvironment is essential in enabling a novel C–N bond formation mechanism with no parallel in small molecule catalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the substrate in the enzyme active site which further support this hypothesis. This work is a rare example of an emerging mechanism in non-natural biocatalysis, where an enzyme has access to a mechanism that its individual components do not. Our study showcases the potential of enhancing emergent mechanisms using protein engineering to provide unique mechanistic solutions to unanswered challenges in chemical synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Underrepresented minority (URM) faculty face challenges in many domains of academia, from university admissions to grant applications. We examine whether this translates to promotion and tenure (P&T) decisions. Data from five US universities on 1,571 faculty members’ P&T decisions show that URM faculty received 7% more negative votes and were 44% less likely to receive unanimous votes from P&T committees. A double standard in how scholarly productivity is rewarded is also observed, with below-average h-indexes being judged more harshly for URM faculty than for non-URM faculty. This relationship is amplified for faculty with intersectional backgrounds, especially URM women. The differential treatment of URM women was mitigated when external reviewers highlighted candidates’ scholarship more in their review letters. In sum, the results support the double standard hypothesis and provide evidence that different outcomes in P&T decision-making processes contribute to the sustained underrepresentation of URM faculty in tenured faculty positions.",

A potential mechanism for linking memory components is phase precession, during which neurons fire progressively earlier in time relative to theta oscillations. However, no direct link between phase precession and memory has been established. Here we recorded single-neuron activity and local field potentials in the human medial temporal lobe while participants (n = 22) encoded and retrieved memories of movie clips. Bouts of theta and phase precession occurred following cognitive boundaries during movie watching and following stimulus onsets during memory retrieval. Phase precession was dynamic, with different neurons exhibiting precession in different task periods. Phase precession strength provided information about memory encoding and retrieval success that was complementary with firing rates. These data provide direct neural evidence for a functional role of phase precession in human episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Although online reviews are used by many people to make decisions, these reviews may be biased. On the basis of 1.2 billion observations across five leading online review platforms and two lab studies (n = 1,172 and n = 1,165; US respondents fluent in English), we provide evidence for a consistent and systematic gender rating gap: women’s mean online review ratings are significantly more favourable than men’s. We suggest that although men and women, on average, generally do not differ in their ‘real’ attitudes, their ratings do differ when it comes to online reviews. Our lab studies revealed that such differences are due to gender differences in the propensity to share negative attitudes online, possibly due to women’s greater concern about social consequences. Our findings highlight the need for societal change to create conditions in which people, particularly women, feel comfortable publicly expressing genuine attitudes, especially in cases of dissatisfaction, without being concerned about the consequences.",

In our narrative summary and both pairwise and network meta-analyses, we identified anti-smoking campaigns, health warnings and tax increases as the most effective tobacco policies for promoting smoking cessation. Flavour bans and free/discounted nicotine replacement therapy also showed statistically significant positive effects on quit rates. The network meta-analysis results further indicated that smoking bans, anti-tobacco campaigns and tax increases effectively reduced smoking prevalence. In addition, flavour bans significantly reduced e-cigarette consumption. Both the narrative summary and the meta-analyses revealed that smoking bans, tax increases and anti-tobacco campaigns were associated with reductions in tobacco consumption and sales.

          "authors": "Natalie Struwe, Esther Blanco, James M. Walker",
          "abstract": "The long tradition of research on cooperation includes a well-established finding that individuals respond to the degree of conflict between self- and collective interests (that is, the relative benefits from cooperation) in providing public goods. Existing empirical evidence builds upon settings where participants make multiple decisions or strategically consider alternative scenarios. Here, we consider a decision setting where participants face a one-time (single-decision) setting. One-time cooperative encounters often occur in volunteering or donating to immediate needs for crisis relief. For these distinct and highly relevant settings, we report a lack of responsiveness to increases in cooperation benefits, thereby highlighting limits to our understanding of the determinants of one-time cooperation encounters. Across two studies, n = 2,232 individuals participate in treatments where we vary across participants the relative benefit from contributing to a public good (that is, the marginal per capita return, the MPCR). We examine decisions from alternative participant pools (UK general population vs. students), implementations varying the physical distance between participants (online vs. in the laboratory), and more complex decision settings considering group-to-group interactions including not only providers but also donors to public goods. Throughout, neither average contribution levels, nor the distribution of contributions are significantly affected by the increases in cooperation benefits. The mechanism behind these results can be explained by the close correlation between expectations of other’s cooperation and own cooperation, and the fact that these expectations do not increase with higher benefits from cooperation.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the historical perception and value of teacher personalities reveals key educational priorities and societal expectations. This study analyzes the evolution of teachers’ ascribed Big Five personality traits from 1800 to 2019, drawing on millions of English-language books. Word frequency analysis reveals that conscientiousness is the most frequently discussed trait, followed by agreeableness, openness, extraversion, and neuroticism. This pattern underscores society’s focus on whether teachers are responsible. Polarity analysis further indicates a higher prevalence of low neuroticism descriptors (e.g., patient and tolerant) in descriptions of teachers compared to the general population, reinforcing the perception of teachers as stable and dependable. The frequent use of terms like “moral”, “enthusiastic”, and “practical” in describing teachers highlights the positive portrayal of their personalities. However, since the mid-20th century, there has been a notable rise in negative descriptors related to openness (e.g., traditional and conventional), coupled with a decline in positive openness terms. This shift suggests an evolving view of teachers as less receptive to new ideas. These findings offer valuable insights into the historical portrayal and societal values attributed to teacher personalities.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, many jurisdictions have moved toward legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide, alongside a near-universal increase in public acceptance of medical aid in dying. Here, we draw on a comprehensive quantitative review of current laws on assisted dying, experimental survey evidence, and four decades of time-series data to explore the relationship between these legislative transitions and change in moral attitudes. Our analyses reveal that existing laws on medical aid in dying impose a common set of eligibility restrictions, based on the patient’s age, decision-making capacity, prognosis, and the nature of their illness. Fulfillment of these eligibility criteria elevates public moral approval of physician-assisted death, equally in countries with (i.e., Spain) and without (i.e., the United Kingdom) assisted dying laws. Finally, historical records of public attitudes toward euthanasia across numerous countries uncovered anticipatory growth in moral approval leading up to legalization, but no accelerated growth thereafter. Taken together, our findings suggest that the enactment of medical aid in dying laws, and their specific provisions, crystallize patterns in moral intuition.",

Bacterial type II topos, gyrases and topo IV, are primary drug targets for fluoroquinolones, a class of clinically relevant antibacterials requiring metal ions for efficient drug binding. While the presence of metal ions in topos has been elucidated in biochemical studies, accurate location and assignment of metal ions in structural studies have historically posed significant challenges. Recent advances in X-ray crystallography address these limitations by extending the experimental capabilities into the long-wavelength range, exploiting the anomalous contrast from light elements of biological relevance. This breakthrough enables us to confirm experimentally the locations of Mg 2+ in the fluoroquinolone-stabilized Streptococcus pneumoniae topo IV complex. Moreover, we can unambiguously identify the presence of K + and Cl - ions in the complex with one pair of K + ions functioning as an additional intersubunit bridge. Overall, our data extend current knowledge on the functional and structural roles of metal ions in type II topos.",

          "abstract": "Using angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, sum-frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations, we verify that the glass transition temperature ( T g ) of polymer glass is lower near the free surface. However, the experimental T g -gradients showed a linear variation with depth ( z ) from the free surface, while the simulated equilibrium T g -gradients exhibited a double exponential z -dependence. In typical simulations, T g is determined based on the relaxation time of the system reaching a prescribed threshold value at equilibrium. Conversely, the experiments determined T g by observing the unfreezing of molecular mobility during heating from a kinetically arrested, nonequilibrium glassy state. To investigate the impact of nonequilibrium effects on the T g -gradient, we reduced the thermal annealing time in simulations, allowing the system to fall out of equilibrium. We observe a decrease in the relaxation time and the emergence of a modified z -dependence consistent with a linear T g -gradient near the free surface. We further validate the impact of nonequilibrium effects by studying the dependence of the T g on the heating/cooling rate for polymer films of varying thickness ( h ). Our experimental results reveal significant variations in the T g -heating/cooling rate dependence with h below the bulk T g , which are also observed in simulation when the simulated system is not equilibrated. We explain our findings by the reduction in mass density within the inner region of the system under nonequilibrium conditions, as observed in simulation, and recent research indicating a decrease in the local T g of a polymer when placed next to a softer material.",

          "abstract": "Approximately two-thirds of the estimated one-billion metric tons of methane produced annually by methanogens is derived from the cleavage of acetate. Acetate is broken down by a Ni-Fe-S-containing A-cluster within the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) to carbon monoxide (CO) and a methyl group (CH 3 + ). The methyl group ultimately forms the greenhouse gas methane, whereas CO is converted to the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) by a Ni-Fe-S-containing C-cluster within the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Although structures have been solved of CODH/ACS from acetogens, which use these enzymes to make acetate from CO 2 , no structure of a CODH/ACS from a methanogen has been reported. In this work, we use cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of a methanogenic CODH and CODH/ACS from Methanosarcina thermophila ( Met CODH/ACS). We find that the N-terminal domain of acetogenic ACS, which is missing in all methanogens, is replaced by a domain of CODH. This CODH domain provides a channel for CO to travel between the two catalytic Ni-Fe-S clusters. It generates the binding surface for ACS and creates a remarkably similar CO alcove above the A-cluster using residues from CODH rather than ACS. Comparison of our Met CODH/ACS structure with our Met CODH structure reveals a molecular mechanism to restrict gas flow from the CO channel when ACS departs, preventing CO escape into the cell. Overall, these long-awaited structures of a methanogenic CODH/ACS reveal striking functional similarities to their acetogenic counterparts despite a substantial difference in domain organization.",

          "abstract": "One of the most dramatic changes occurring on our planet is the ever-increasing extensive use of artificial light at night, which drastically altered the environment to which nocturnal animals are adapted. Such light pollution has been identified as a driver in the dramatic insect decline of the past years. One nocturnal species group experiencing marked declines are moths, which play a key role in food webs and ecosystem services such as plant pollination. Moths can be easily monitored within the illuminated area of a streetlight, where they typically exhibit disoriented behavior. Yet, little is known about their behavior beyond the illuminated area. Harmonic radar tracking enabled us to close this knowledge gap. We found a significant change in flight behavior beyond the illuminated area of a streetlight. A detailed analysis of the recorded trajectories revealed a barrier effect of streetlights on lappet moths whenever the moon was not available as a natural celestial cue. Furthermore, streetlights increased the tortuosity of flights for both hawk moths and lappet moths. Surprisingly, we had to reject our fundamental hypothesis that most individuals would fly toward a streetlight. Instead, this was true for only 4% of the tested individuals, indicating that the impact of light pollution might be more severe than assumed to date. Our results provide experimental evidence for the fragmentation of landscapes by streetlights and demonstrate that light pollution affects movement patterns of moths beyond what was previously assumed, potentially affecting their reproductive success and hampering a vital ecosystem service.",

In the ADQ framework, a pixel/voxel-wise metric reflecting heterogeneous intertubule alignment was proposed with improved sensitivity over previous efforts and further incorporated with temporal features to map dynamic microtubule rearrangements. The ADQ framework was verified by assessing microtubule remodeling in drug-induced (de)polymerization, lysosome transport, and migration. Different remodeling patterns from two migration modes were successfully revealed by the ADQ framework, with a front–rear polarization for individual directed migration and a contact site–centered polarization for cell–cell interaction-induced migration in an immune response model. Meanwhile, these migration modes were found to have consistent orientation changes, which exhibited the potential of predicting migration trajectory.",

          "abstract": "The endometrium undergoes substantial remodeling in each menstrual cycle to become receptive to an implanting embryo. Abnormal endometrial receptivity is one of the major causes of embryo implantation failure and infertility. MicroRNA-124-3p is elevated in both the serum and endometrial tissue of women with chronic endometritis, a condition associated with infertility. MicroRNA-124-3p also has a role in cell adhesion, a key function during receptivity to allow blastocysts to adhere and implant. In this study, we aimed to determine the function of microRNA-124-3p on endometrial epithelial adhesive capacity during receptivity and effect on embryo implantation. Using a unique inducible, uterine epithelial-specific microRNA overexpression mouse model, we demonstrated that elevated uterine epithelial microRNA-124-3p impaired endometrial receptivity by altering genes associated with cell adhesion and polarity. This resulted in embryo implantation failure. Similarly in a second mouse model, increasing microRNA-124-3p expression only in mouse uterine surface (luminal) epithelium impaired receptivity and led to implantation failure. In humans, we demonstrated that microRNA-124-3p was abnormally increased in the endometrial epithelium of women with unexplained infertility during the receptive window. MicroRNA-124-3p overexpression in primary human endometrial epithelial cells (HEECs) impaired primary human embryo trophectoderm attachment in a 3-dimensional culture model of endometrium. Reduction of microRNA-124-3p in HEECs from infertile women normalized HEEC adhesive capacity. Overexpression of microRNA-124-3p or knockdown of its direct target IQGAP1 reduced fertile HEEC adhesion and its ability to lose polarity. Collectively, our data highlight that microRNA-124-3p and its protein targets contribute to endometrial receptivity by altering cell polarity and adhesion.",

          "abstract": "In proliferating bacteria, growth rate is often assumed to be similar between daughter cells. However, most of our knowledge of cell growth derives from studies on symmetrically dividing bacteria. In many α-proteobacteria, asymmetric division is a normal part of the life cycle, with each division producing daughter cells with different sizes and fates. Here, we demonstrate that the functionally distinct swarmer and stalked daughter cells produced by the model α-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus can have different average growth rates under nutrient-replete conditions despite sharing an identical genome and environment. The discrepancy in growth rate is due to a growth slowdown associated with the cell cycle stage preceding DNA replication (the G1 phase), which initiates in the late predivisional mother cell before daughter cell separation. Both progenies experience a G1-associated growth slowdown, but the effect is more severe in swarmer cells because they have a longer G1 phase. Activity of SpoT, which produces the (p)ppGpp alarmone and extends the G1 phase, accentuates the cell cycle-dependent growth slowdown. Collectively, our data identify a coupling between cell growth, the G1 phase, and asymmetric division that C. crescentus may exploit for environmental adaptation through SpoT activity. This coupling differentially modulates the growth rate of functionally distinct daughter cells, thereby altering the relative abundance of ecologically important G1-specific traits within the population.",

Nevertheless, the behavior of these events worldwide and their responses to climatic warming are underexplored. Here, we show a global escalation in the frequency, duration, peak intensity, and severity of SCDHWs, as well as an increase in affected land area, from 1980 to 2023. The increasing trends, which are particularly prominent since the early 2000 s, and projected to persist throughout this century, are dominated by summertime SCDHWs and enhanced by El Niño. Intensive soil warming as well as climatologically lower soil temperatures compared to air temperatures lead to localized hotspots of escalating SCDHW severity in northern high latitudes, while prolonged duration causes such hotspots in northern South America. Transformation of natural ecosystems, particularly forests and wetlands, to cropland as well as forest degradation substantially enhance the strength of SCDHWs. Global SCDHWs consistently exhibit higher frequencies, longer durations, greater severities, and faster growth rates than CDHWs in all aspects from 1980 to 2023. They are undergoing a critical transition, with droughts replacing heatwaves as the primary constraint. We emphasize the significant intensification of SCDHWs in northern high latitudes as well as the prolonged duration of SCDHWs in the Southern Hemisphere, posing an underrated threat to achieving carbon neutrality and food security goals.",

          "abstract": "A central question for neuroscience is how to characterize brain representations of perceptual and cognitive content. An ideal characterization should distinguish different functional regions with robustness to noise and idiosyncrasies of individual brains that do not correspond to computational differences. Previous studies have characterized brain representations by their representational geometry, which is defined by the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), a summary statistic that abstracts from the roles of individual neurons (or responses channels) and characterizes the discriminability of stimuli. Here, we explore a further step of abstraction: from the geometry to the topology of brain representations. We propose topological representational similarity analysis, an extension of representational similarity analysis that uses a family of geotopological summary statistics that generalizes the RDM to characterize the topology while de-emphasizing the geometry. We evaluate this family of statistics in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for model selection using both simulations and functional MRI (fMRI) data. In the simulations, the ground truth is a data-generating layer representation in a neural network model and the models are the same and other layers in different model instances (trained from different random seeds). In fMRI, the ground truth is a visual area and the models are the same and other areas measured in different subjects. Results show that topology-sensitive characterizations of population codes are robust to noise and interindividual variability and maintain excellent sensitivity to the unique representational signatures of different neural network layers and brain regions.",

To assess the differential phenotype and metabolism of NK cells in the lung, human BALF, and peripheral blood were evaluated by flow cytometry and SCENITH TM . Published RNA-sequencing datasets of human lung and blood NK cells were repurposed to determine their differential gene expression. We identified CD49a + CD69 + CD103 +/− CD56 bright CD16 − trNK cells in human BALF samples and metabolic profiling revealed that lung CD56 bright CD16 − NK cells’ glycolytic capacity and dependence on glucose is significantly higher than matched peripheral blood counterparts.

          "authors": "Jessica S. Dudley, Marilyn B. Renfree, Günter P. Wagner, Oliver W. Griffith",
          "abstract": "In the first live-bearing mammals, pregnancy was likely short and ended with a brief period of inflammatory maternal–fetal interaction. This mode of reproduction has been retained in many marsupials. While inflammation is key to successful implantation in eutherians, a key innovation in eutherians is the ability to switch off this inflammation after it has been initiated. This extended period, in which inflammation is suppressed, likely allowed for an extended period of placentation. Extended placentation has evolved independently in one lineage of marsupials, the macropodids (wallabies and kangaroos), with placentation lasting beyond the 2 to 4 d seen in other marsupial taxa, which allows us to investigate the role of inflammation response after attachment in the extension of placentation in mammals. By comparing gene expression changes at attachment in three marsupial species, the tammar wallaby, opossum, and fat-tailed dunnart, we show that inflammatory attachment is an ancestral feature of marsupial implantation. In contrast to eutherians, where attachment-related (quasi-) inflammatory reaction is even involved in epitheliochorial placentation (e.g., pig), this study found no evidence of a distinct attachment-related reaction in wallabies. Instead, only a small number of inflammatory genes are expressed at distinct points of gestation, including IL6 before attachment, LIF throughout placentation, and prostaglandins before birth. During parturition, a more distinct inflammatory reaction is detectable, likely involved in precipitating the parturition cascade similar to eutherians. We suggest that in wallaby, extended gestation became possible by avoiding an inflammatory attachment reaction, which is a different strategy than seen in eutherians.",

          "abstract": "Copper homeostasis mechanisms are critical for bacterial resistance to copper-induced stress. The Escherichia coli multicopper oxidase copper efflux oxidase (CueO) is part of the copper detoxification system in aerobic conditions. CueO contains a methionine-rich (Met-rich) domain believed to interact with copper, but its exact function and the importance of related copper-binding sites remain unclear. This study investigates these open questions by employing a multimodal and multiscale approach. Through the design of various E. coli CueO (EcCueO) variants with altered copper-coordinating residues and domain deletions, we employ biological, biochemical, and physico-chemical approaches to unravel in vitro CueO catalytic properties and in vivo copper resistance. Strong correlation between the different methods enables evaluation of EcCueO variants’ activity as a function of Cu+ availability. Our findings demonstrate the Met-rich domain is not essential for cuprous oxidation, but it facilitates Cu+ recruitment from strongly chelated forms, acting as transient copper binding domain thanks to multiple methionines. They also indicate that the Cu6/7 copper-binding sites previously observed within the Met-rich domain play a negligible role. Meanwhile, Cu5, located at the interface with the Met-rich domain, emerges as the primary and sole substrate-binding active site for cuprous oxidation. The Cu5 coordination sphere strongly affects the enzyme activity and the in vivo copper resistance. This study provides insights into the nuanced role of CueO Met-rich domain, enabling the functions of copper-binding sites and the entire domain itself to be decoupled. This paves the way for a deeper understanding of Met-rich domains in the context of bacterial copper homeostasis.",

Here, we examine the firing of identified CINs during reward-guided decision-making in freely moving rats and compare this firing to dopamine release. Relationships between CINs, dopamine, and behavior varied strongly by subregion. In the dorsal–lateral striatum, a Go! cue evoked burst–pause CIN spiking, followed by a brief dopamine pulse that was unrelated to RPE. In the dorsal–medial striatum, this cue evoked only a CIN pause, that was curtailed by a movement-selective rebound in firing. Finally, in the ventral striatum, a reward cue evoked RPE-coding increases in both dopamine and CIN firing, without a consistent pause. Our results demonstrate a spatial and temporal dissociation between CIN pauses and dopamine RPE signals and will inform future models of striatal information processing under both normal and pathological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Inflammation is a protective response to pathogens and injury. To be effective it needs to be resolved by endogenous mechanisms in order to avoid prolonged and excessive inflammation, which can become chronic. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are a group of lipids derived from omega-3 fatty acids, which can induce the resolution of inflammation. How SPMs exert their anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects is, however, not clear. Here, we show that SPMs such as protectins, maresins, and D-series resolvins function as biased positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of the prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) receptor EP4 through an intracellular binding site. They increase PGE 2 -induced G s -mediated formation of cAMP and thereby promote anti-inflammatory signaling of EP4. In addition, SPMs endow the endogenous EP4 receptor on macrophages with the ability to couple to G i -type G-proteins, which converts the EP4 receptor on macrophages from an anti-phagocytotic receptor to one increasing phagocytosis, a central mechanism of the pro-resolving activity of synthetic SPMs. In the absence of the EP4 receptor, SPMs lose their anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal an unusual mechanism of allosteric receptor modulation by lipids and provide a mechanism by which synthetic SPMs exert pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory effects, which may facilitate approaches to treat inflammation.",

          "abstract": "Systems consolidation is a common feature of learning and memory systems, in which a long-term memory initially stored in one brain region becomes persistently stored in another region. We studied the dynamics of systems consolidation in simple circuit architectures with two sites of plasticity, one in an early-learning and one in a late-learning brain area. We show that the synaptic dynamics of the circuit during consolidation of an analog memory can be understood as a temporal integration process, by which transient changes in activity driven by plasticity in the early-learning area are accumulated into persistent synaptic changes at the late-learning site. This simple principle naturally leads to a speed-accuracy tradeoff in systems consolidation and provides insight into how the circuit mitigates the stability-plasticity dilemma of storing new memories while preserving core features of older ones. Furthermore, it imposes two constraints on the circuit. First, the plasticity rule at the late-learning site must stably support a continuum of possible outputs for a given input. We show that this is readily achieved by heterosynaptic but not standard Hebbian rules. Second, to turn off the consolidation process and prevent erroneous changes at the late-learning site, neural activity in the early-learning area must be reset to its baseline activity. We provide two biologically plausible implementations for this reset that propose functional roles in stabilizing consolidation for core elements of the cerebellar circuit.",

          "abstract": "Predictive coding is a fundamental function of the cortex. The predictive routing model proposes a neurophysiological implementation for predictive coding. Predictions are fed back from the deep-layer cortex via alpha/beta (8 to 30 Hz) oscillations. They inhibit the gamma (40 to 100 Hz) and spiking that feed sensory inputs forward. Unpredicted inputs arrive in circuits unprepared by alpha/beta, resulting in enhanced gamma and spiking. To test the predictive routing model and its role in consciousness, we collected data from intracranial recordings of macaque monkeys during passive presentation of auditory oddballs before and after propofol-mediated loss of consciousness (LOC). In line with the predictive routing model, alpha/beta oscillations in the awake state served to inhibit the processing of predictable stimuli. Propofol-mediated LOC eliminated alpha/beta modulation by a predictable stimulus in the sensory cortex and alpha/beta coherence between sensory and frontal areas. As a result, oddball stimuli evoked enhanced gamma power, late period (&gt;200 ms from stimulus onset) spiking, and superficial layer sinks in the sensory cortex. LOC also resulted in diminished decodability of pattern-level prediction error signals in the higher-order cortex. Therefore, the auditory cortex was in a disinhibited state during propofol-mediated LOC. However, despite these enhanced feedforward responses in the auditory cortex, there was a loss of differential spiking to oddballs in the higher-order cortex. This may be a consequence of a loss of within-area and interareal spike-field coupling in the alpha/beta and gamma frequency bands. These results provide strong constraints for current theories of consciousness.",

Global anthropogenic emission inventories report increases in Northern Hemispheric (NH) Hg emissions during the last three decades, in contradiction with the observed decline in atmospheric Hg concentrations at NH measurement stations. Many factors can obscure the link between anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric Hg concentrations, including trends in the reemissions of previously released anthropogenic (“legacy”) Hg, atmospheric sink variability, and spatial heterogeneity of monitoring data. Here, we assess the observed trends in gaseous elemental mercury (Hg 0 ) in the NH and apply biogeochemical box modeling and chemical transport modeling to understand the trend drivers. Using linear mixed effects modeling of observational data from 51 stations, we find negative Hg 0 trends in most NH regions, with an overall trend for 2005 to 2020 of −0.011 ± 0.006 ng m −3 y −1 (±2 SD). In contrast to existing emission inventories, our modeling analysis suggests that annual NH anthropogenic emissions must have declined by at least 140 Mg between the years 2005 and 2020 to be consistent with observed trends. Faster declines in 95th percentile Hg 0 values than median values in Europe, North America, and East Asian measurement stations corroborate that the likely cause is a decline in nearby anthropogenic emissions rather than background legacy reemissions. Our results are relevant for evaluating the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, demonstrating that existing emission inventories are incompatible with the observed Hg 0 declines.",

Like other herpesvirus-encoded GPCRs, KSHV-GPCR is characterized by its constitutive activity by coupling to various G proteins.

We measured reproductive outputs, body composition, daily energy expenditure, and oxidative stress at peak lactation and over lifetime. We found that reproduction had an immediate and negative effect on survival due to problems encountered during parturition for some females. However, there was no statistically significant residual effect on survival once breeding had ceased, indicating no trade-off with somatic maintenance.

The RNA helicase YTHDC2 is required to shut down components of the mitotic program to facilitate a proper switch from mitosis to meiosis in mouse germ cells. Here, we show that YTHDC2 has a second essential role in promoting meiotic progression in late spermatocytes. Inducing conditional knockout of Ythdc2 during the first wave of spermatogenesis, after initiation of meiotic prophase, allowed YTHDC2 -deficient germ cells to advance to the pachytene stage and properly express many meiotic markers. However, the YTHDC2 -deficient spermatocytes mis-expressed a number of genes, some up-regulated and some down-regulated, failed to transition to the diplotene stage, and then quickly died. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that YTHDC2 interacts with several RNA-binding proteins in early or late spermatocytes, with many of the interacting proteins, including MEIOC, localizing to granules, similar to YTHDC2. Our findings suggest that YTHDC2 collaborates with other RNA granule components to facilitate proper progression of germ cells through multiple steps of meiosis via mechanisms influencing posttranscriptional regulation of RNAs.",

Mechanically, the lysosome-localized protein LAMTOR1 is up-regulated, and the interaction between LAMTOR1 and cGAS is enhanced upon exposure to DNA fragments, boosting the accumulation and digestion of cGAS in lysosomes through the receptor protein p62. LAMTOR1 deficiency increases cGAS abundance and promotes activation of the cGAS–STING pathway, leading to subsequent production of type I interferons induced by cytosolic DNA stimulation. Loss of LAMTOR1 synergizes with immunotherapy and chemotherapy to inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing mice by promoting the infiltration of effective T lymphocytes.

          "abstract": "Well-differentiated low-grade lung neuroendocrine tumors (lung carcinoids or LNETs) are histopathologically classified as typical and atypical LNETs, but each subtype is still heterogeneous at both the molecular level and its clinical manifestation. Here, we report genome-wide profiles of primary LNETs’ cis-regulatory elements by H3K27ac ChIP-seq with matching RNA-seq profiles. Analysis of these regulatory landscapes revealed three regulatory subtypes, independent of the typical/atypical classification. We identified unique differentiation signals that delineate each subtype. The “proneuronal” subtype emerges under the influence of ASCL1, SOX4, and TCF4 transcription factors, embodying a pronounced proneuronal signature. The “luminal-like” subtype is characterized by gain of acetylation at markers of luminal cells and GATA2 activation and loss of LRP5 and OTP. The “HNF+” subtype is characterized by a robust enhancer landscape driven by HNF1A, HNF4A, and FOXA3, with notable acetylation and expression of FGF signaling genes, especially FGFR3 and FGFR4, pivotal components of the FGF pathway. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of LNETs’ regulatory and developmental diversity but also spotlight the HNF+ subtype’s reliance on FGFR signaling. We demonstrate that targeting this pathway with FGF inhibitors curtails tumor growth both in vitro and in xenograft models, unveiling a potential vulnerability and paving the way for targeted therapies. Overall, our work provides an important resource for studying LNETs to reveal regulatory networks, differentiation signals, and therapeutically relevant dependencies.",

          "abstract": "The only known peptide-gated ion channels—FaNaCs/WaNaCs and HyNaCs—belong to different clades of the DEG/ENaC family. FaNaCs are activated by the short neuropeptide FMRFamide, and HyNaCs by Hydra RFamides, which are not evolutionarily related to FMRFamide. The FMRFamide-binding site in FaNaCs was recently identified in a cleft atop the large extracellular domain. However, this cleft is not conserved in HyNaCs. Here, we combined molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis and identified a putative binding pocket for Hydra-RFamides in the extracellular domain of the heterotrimeric HyNaC2/3/5. This pocket localizes to only one of the three subunit interfaces, indicating that this trimeric ion channel binds a single peptide ligand. We engineered an unnatural amino acid at the putative binding pocket entrance, which allowed covalent tethering of Hydra RFamide to the channel, thereby trapping the channel in an open conformation. The identified pocket localizes to the same region as the acidic pocket of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), which binds peptide ligands. The pocket in HyNaCs is less acidic, and both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions contribute to peptide binding. Collectively, our results reveal a conserved ligand-binding pocket in HyNaCs and ASICs and indicate independent evolution of peptide-binding cavities in the two subgroups of peptide-gated ion channels.",

          "abstract": "Habituation—a phenomenon in which a dynamical system exhibits a diminishing response to repeated stimulations that eventually recovers when the stimulus is withheld—is universally observed in living systems from animals to unicellular organisms. Despite its prevalence, generic mechanisms for this fundamental form of learning remain poorly defined. Drawing inspiration from prior work on systems that respond adaptively to step inputs, we study habituation from a nonlinear dynamics perspective. This approach enables us to formalize classical hallmarks of habituation that have been experimentally identified in diverse organisms and stimulus scenarios. We use this framework to investigate distinct dynamical circuits capable of habituation. In particular, we show that driven linear dynamics of a memory variable with static nonlinearities acting at the input and output can implement numerous hallmarks in a mathematically interpretable manner. This work establishes a foundation for understanding the dynamical substrates of this primitive learning behavior and offers a blueprint for the identification of habituating circuits in biological systems.",

However, toxic by-products accumulate in cultures due to inefficiencies in metabolic activities and nutrient utilization. In this study, we applied comprehensive 13 C stable-isotope tracing of amino acids and glucose to two Immunoglobulin G (IgG) producing Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines to identify secreted by-products and trace their origins. CHO cells were cultured in media formulations missing a single amino acid or glucose supplemented with a 13 C-tracer of the missing substrate, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to track labeled carbon flows and identify by-products. We tracked the sources of all secreted by-products and verified the identity of 45 by-products, majority of which were derived from glucose, leucine, isoleucine, valine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, and phenylalanine. In addition to by-products identified previously, we identified several metabolites including 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid, 2-aminobutyric acid, L-alloisoleucine, ketoisoleucine, 2-hydroxy-3-methylvaleric acid, desmeninol, and 2-aminobutyric acid. When added to CHO cell cultures at different concentrations, certain metabolites inhibited cell growth while others including 2-hydroxy acids, surprisingly, reduced lactate accumulation. In vitro enzymatic analysis indicated that 2-hydroxy acids were metabolized by lactate dehydrogenase suggesting a possible mechanism for lowered lactate accumulation, e.g., competitive substrate inhibition. The 13 C-labeling assisted metabolomics pipeline developed and the metabolites identified will serve as a springboard to reduce undesirable by-products accumulation and alleviate inefficient substrate utilization in mammalian cultures used for biomanufacturing and other applications through altered media formulations and pathway engineering strategies.",

          "abstract": "Memory effect refers to the phenomenon where past events influence a system’s current and future states or behaviors. In biology, memory effects often arise from intra- or intermolecular interactions, leading to temporally correlated behaviors. Single-molecule studies have shown that enzymes and DNA-binding proteins can exhibit time-correlated behaviors of their activity. While memory effects are well documented and studied in vitro, no such examples exist in cells to our knowledge. Combining single-molecule tracking (SMT) and single-cell protein quantitation, we find in living Escherichia coli cells distinct temporal correlations in the binding/unbinding events on DNA by MerR- and Fur-family metalloregulators, manifesting as memory effects with timescales of ~1 s. These memory effects persist irrespective of the type of the metalloregulators or their metallation states. Moreover, these temporal correlations of metalloregulator–DNA interactions are associated with spatial confinements of the metalloregulators near their DNA binding sites, suggesting microdomains of ~100 nm in size that possibly result from the spatial organizations of the bacterial chromosome without the involvement of membranes. These microdomains likely facilitate repeated binding events, enhancing regulator−DNA contact frequency and potentially gene regulation efficiency. These findings provide unique insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of protein–DNA interactions in bacterial cells, introducing the concept of microdomains as a crucial player in memory effect–driven gene regulation.",

Yet while regional crop production trends receive significant attention, relatively little is known about the local-scale crop switching that underlies these macrotrends. We characterized local crop-switching patterns across the United States using the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer, an annual time series of high resolution (30 m pixel size) remote-sensed cropland data from 2008 to 2022. We found that at multiple spatial scales, crop switching was most common in sparsely cultivated landscapes and in landscapes with high crop diversity, whereas it was low in homogeneous, highly agricultural areas such as the Midwestern corn belt, suggesting a number of potential social and economic mechanisms influencing farmers’ crop choices. Crop-switching rates were high overall, occurring on more than 6% of all US cropland in the average year. Applying a framework that classified crop switches based on their temporal novelty (crop introduction versus discontinuation), spatial novelty (locally divergent versus convergent switching), and categorical novelty (transformative versus incremental switching), we found distinct spatial patterns for these three novelty dimensions, indicating a dynamic and multifaceted set of cropping changes across US farms. Collectively, these results suggest that innovation through crop switching is playing out very differently in various parts of the country, with potentially significant implications for the resilience of agricultural systems to changes in climate and other systemic trends.",

To perform this mapping requires the identification of sequence features most informative about function. Here, we quantify the amount of information (in bits) that T cell receptor (TCR) sequence features provide about antigen specificity. We identify informative features by their degree of conservation among antigen-specific receptors relative to null expectations. We find that TCR specificity synergistically depends on the hypervariable regions of both receptor chains, with a degree of synergy that strongly depends on the ligand. Using a coincidence-based approach to measuring information enables us to directly bound the accuracy with which TCR specificity can be predicted from partial matches to reference sequences. We anticipate that our statistical framework will be of use for developing machine learning models for TCR specificity prediction and for optimizing TCRs for cell therapies. The proposed coincidence-based information measures might find further applications in bounding the performance of pairwise classifiers in other fields.",

          "abstract": "Replication stress describes endogenous and exogenous challenges to DNA replication in the S-phase. Stress during this critical process causes helicase–polymerase decoupling at replication forks, triggering the S-phase checkpoint, which orchestrates global replication fork stalling and delayed entry into G2. The replication stressor most often used to induce the checkpoint response in yeast is hydroxyurea (HU), a clinically used chemotherapeutic. The primary mechanism of S-phase checkpoint activation by HU has thus far been considered to be a reduction of deoxynucleotide triphosphate synthesis by inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), leading to helicase–polymerase decoupling and subsequent activation of the checkpoint, facilitated by the replisome-associated mediator Mrc1. In contrast, we observe that HU causes cell cycle arrest in budding yeast independent of both the Mrc1-mediated replication checkpoint response and the Psk1-Mrc1 oxidative signaling pathway. We demonstrate a direct relationship between HU incubation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in yeast and human cells and show that antioxidants restore growth of yeast in HU. We further observe that ROS strongly inhibits the in vitro polymerase activity of replicative polymerases (Pols), Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ε, causing polymerase complex dissociation and subsequent loss of DNA substrate binding, likely through oxidation of their integral iron–sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. Finally, we present “RNR-deg,” a genetically engineered alternative to HU in yeast with greatly increased specificity of RNR inhibition, allowing researchers to achieve fast, nontoxic, and more readily reversible checkpoint activation compared to HU, avoiding harmful ROS generation and associated downstream cellular effects that may confound interpretation of results.",

Improper e-waste disposal poses environmental and health risks, entailing substantial remediation and healthcare costs. Large efforts are applied for the recovery of Au from e-waste using complex processes which include the dissolution of Au, its adsorption in an ionic state and succeeding reduction to metallic Au. These processes themselves being complex and utilizing harsh chemicals contribute to the environmental impact of e-waste. Here, we present an approach for the simultaneous recovery and reduction of Au 3+ and Au + ions from e-waste to produce solid Au 0 forms, thus skipping several technological steps. We develop a nanoscale cross-dimensional composite material via self-assembly of two-dimensional graphene oxide and one-dimensional chitosan macromolecules, capable of acting simultaneously as a scavenger of gold ions and as a reducing agent. Such multidimensional architecture doesn’t require to apply any voltage for Au adsorption and reduction and solely relies on the chemisorption kinetics of Au ions in the heterogeneous GO/CS nanoconfinements and their chemical reduction on multiple binding sites. The cooperative phenomena in ionic absorption are responsible for the extremely high efficiency of gold extraction. The extraction capacity reaches 16.8 g/g for Au 3+ and 6.2 g/g for Au + , which is ten times larger than any existing gold adsorbents can propose. The efficiency is above 99.5 wt.% (current limit is 75 wt.%) and extraction ability is down to very low concentrations of 3 ppm.",

          "abstract": "The rise of antimicrobial failure is a global emergency, and causes beyond typical genetic resistance must be determined. One probable factor is the existence of subpopulations of transiently growth-arrested bacteria, persisters, that endure antibiotic treatment despite genetic susceptibility to the drug. The presence of persisters in infected hosts has been successfully established, notably through the development of fluorescent reporters. It is proposed that infection relapse is caused by persisters resuming growth after cessation of the antibiotic treatment, but to date, there is no direct evidence for this. This is because no tool or reporter currently exists to track the extent to which infection relapse is initiated by regrowth of persisters in the host. Indeed, once they have transitioned out of the persister state, the progeny of persisters are genetically and phenotypically identical to susceptible bacteria in the population, making it virtually impossible to ascertain the source of relapse. We designed pSCRATCH (plasmid for Selective CRISPR Array expansion To Check Heritage), a molecular tool that functions to record the state of antibiotic persistence in the genome of Salmonella persisters. We show that pSCRATCH successfully marks persisters by adding spacers in their CRISPR arrays and the genomic label is stable in persister progeny after exit from persistence. We further show that in a Salmonella infection model the system enables the discrimination of treatment failure originating from persistence versus resistance. Thus, pSCRATCH provides proof of principle for stable marking of persisters and a prototype for applications to more complex infection models and other pathogens.",

A new calculation of the isotope mass balance using a revised assessment of the inputs to the ocean-atmosphere system resolves the apparent discrepancy. Inputs include weathering of carbonate and old kerogen, geogenic methane oxidation, and volcanic and metamorphic degassing. Volcanic and metamorphic degassing comprise ≈23% of the total C input. Inputs from isotopically light OCpetro and CH 4-geo drive the mean δ 13 C of the input to =−8.0 ± 1.9‰, notably lower than the commonly assumed volcanic degassing value. The isotope mass balance model yields a modern burial flux =15.9 ± 6.6 Tmol y −1 . The impact of the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum isotope anomaly is an integrated excess deposition ≈ 4.3 × 10 6 Tmol between 18 and 11 Ma, which is both longer and larger than estimates for the total degassing by the Columbia River Basalt eruptions, implying a complex carbon system response to large eruptive events. Monte Carlo evaluation finds that late Cenozoic net growth of the carbonate reservoir is very likely while net growth of the C org reservoir is less certain but more likely than not. At present, subduction does not appear to keep up with net sedimentation and the overall masses of sedimentary carbonate and organic carbon are likely increasing. Growth in the sedimentary C org reservoir implies oxidation of the surface environment and likely increases in atmospheric pO 2 .",

Given that these cycles are less constrained on Mars than they are on Earth, the identification of carbonates has been a point of emphasis for rover missions. Here, we present carbon (δ 13 C) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotope data from four carbonates encountered by the Curiosity rover within the Gale crater. The carbon isotope values range from 72 ± 2‰ to 110 ± 3‰ Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite while the oxygen isotope values span from 59 ± 4‰ to 91 ± 4‰ Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (1 SE uncertainties). Notably, these values are isotopically heavy ( 13 C- and 18 O-enriched) relative to nearly every other Martian material. The extreme isotopic difference between the carbonates and other carbon- and oxygen-rich reservoirs on Mars cannot be reconciled by standard equilibrium carbonate–CO 2 fractionation, thus requiring an alternative process during or prior to carbonate formation. This paper explores two processes capable of contributing to the isotopic enrichments: 1) evaporative-driven Rayleigh distillation and 2) kinetic isotope effects related to cryogenic precipitation. In isolation, each process cannot reproduce the observed carbonate isotope values; however, a combination of these processes represents the most likely source for the extreme isotopic enrichments.",

          "abstract": "The cerebellum is critical for sensorimotor learning. The specific contribution that it makes, however, remains unclear. Inspired by the classic finding that for declarative memories, medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures provide a gateway to the formation of long-term memory but are not required for short-term memory, we hypothesized that for sensorimotor memories, the cerebellum may play an analogous role. Here, we studied the sensorimotor learning of individuals with severe ataxia from cerebellar degeneration. We dissected the memories they formed during sensorimotor learning into a short-term temporally-volatile component, that decays rapidly with a time constant of just 15 to 20 s and thus cannot lead to long-term retention, and a longer-term temporally-persistent component that is stable for 60 s or more and leads to long-term retention. Remarkably, we find that these individuals display dramatically reduced levels of temporally-persistent sensorimotor memory, despite spared and even elevated levels of temporally-volatile sensorimotor memory. In particular, we find both impairment that systematically worsens with memory window duration over shorter memory windows (&lt;12 s) and near-complete impairment of memory maintenance over longer memory windows (&gt;25 s). This dissociation uncovers a unique role for the cerebellum as a gateway for the formation of long-term but not short-term sensorimotor memories, mirroring the role of the MTL for declarative memories. It thus reveals the existence of distinct neural substrates for short-term and long-term sensorimotor memory, and it explains both the trial-to-trial differences identified in this study and long-standing study-to-study differences in the effects of cerebellar damage on sensorimotor learning ability.",

          "abstract": "Incomplete understanding of metastatic disease mechanisms continues to hinder effective treatment of cancer. Despite remarkable advancements toward the identification of druggable targets, treatment options for patients in remission following primary tumor resection remain limited. Bioengineered human tissue models of metastatic sites capable of recreating the physiologically relevant milieu of metastatic colonization may strengthen our grasp of cancer progression and contribute to the development of effective therapeutic strategies. We report the use of an engineered tissue model of human bone marrow (eBM) to identify microenvironmental cues regulating cancer cell proliferation and to investigate how triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines influence hematopoiesis. Notably, individual stromal components of the bone marrow niche (osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells) were each critical for regulating tumor cell quiescence and proliferation in the three-dimensional eBM niche. We found that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) impacted TNBC cell growth and responded to cancer cell presence with a shift of HSPCs (CD34 + CD38 − ) to downstream myeloid lineages (CD11b + CD14 + ). To account for tumor heterogeneity and show proof-of-concept ability for patient-specific studies, we demonstrate that patient-derived tumor organoids survive and proliferate in the eBM, resulting in distinct shifts in myelopoiesis that are similar to those observed for aggressively metastatic cell lines. We envision that this human tissue model will facilitate studies of niche-specific metastatic progression and individualized responses to treatment.",

          "abstract": "Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channels generate the cationic I h current in neurons and regulate the excitability of neuronal networks. The function of HCN channels depends, in part, on their subcellular localization. Of the four HCN isoforms (HCN1-4), HCN1 is strongly expressed in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons (PNs) in hippocampal area CA1 but also in presynaptic terminals of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV+ INs), which provide strong inhibitory control over hippocampal activity. Yet, little is known about how HCN1 channels in these cells regulate the evoked release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA from their axon terminals. Here, we used genetic, optogenetic, electrophysiological, and imaging techniques to investigate how the electrophysiological properties of PV+ INs are regulated by HCN1, including how HCN1 activity at presynaptic terminals regulates the release of GABA onto PNs in CA1. We found that application of HCN1 pharmacological blockers reduced the amplitude of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential recorded from CA1 PNs in response to selective optogenetic stimulation of PV+ INs. Homozygous HCN1 knockout mice also show reduced IPSCs in postsynaptic cells. Finally, two-photon imaging using genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicators revealed that HCN1 blockers reduced the probability that an extracellular electrical stimulating pulse evoked a Ca 2+ response in individual PV+ IN presynaptic boutons. Taken together, our results show that HCN1 channels in the axon terminals of PV+ interneurons facilitate GABAergic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 region.",

The rise of deep learning–based computational approaches presents a promising avenue to address this challenge. Here, we assess the performance of a deep learning approach through two benchmark tests aimed at predicting antibodies for the receptor-binding domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Three different strategies for constructing input sequence alignments are employed for predicting structural models of antigen–antibody complexes. In our initial testing set, which comprises known experimental structures, these strategies collectively yield a significant top-ranked prediction for 61% of cases and a success rate of 47%. Notably, one strategy that utilizes the sequences of known antigen binders outperforms the other two, achieving a precision of 90% in a subsequent test set of ~1,000 antibodies, balanced between true and control antibodies for the antigen, albeit with a lower recall of 25%. Our results underscore the potential of integrating deep learning methods with single B cell sequencing techniques to enhance the prediction accuracy of antigen–antibody interactions.",

          "abstract": "Acidic CO 2 electrolysis, enhanced by the introduction of alkali cations, presents a strategic approach for improving carbon efficiency compared to processes conducted in neutral and alkaline environments. However, a significant challenge arises from the dissolution of both organic acids and alkali cations in a strongly acidic feed stream, resulting in a considerable energy penalty for downstream separation. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) technology to separate organic acids and recover alkali cations from a strongly acidic feed stream (pH ~ 1). We show that organic acids, such as formic acid and acetic acid, are retained in molecular form in the separation chamber, achieving a rejection rate of over 90% under all conditions. Alkali cations, such as K + and Cs + , migrate to the cathode chamber in ionic form, with their removal and recovery significantly influenced by their concentration and the pH of the feed stream, but responding differently to the types and concentrations of organic acids. The energy consumption for the removal and recovery of K + is 4 to 8 times higher than for Cs + , and the charge efficiency is significantly influenced by the types of organic acid products and alkali cations. We conduct a series of electrochemical measurements and analyze the impedance spectroscopy, identifying that hindered mass transfer governed the electrode process. Our findings underscore the potential of FCDI as an advanced downstream separation technology for acidic electrocatalysis processes.",

          "abstract": "The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) makes it important to recognize their strengths and limitations. We argue that to develop a holistic understanding of these systems, we must consider the problem that they were trained to solve: next-word prediction over Internet text. By recognizing the pressures that this task exerts, we can make predictions about the strategies that LLMs will adopt, allowing us to reason about when they will succeed or fail. Using this approach—which we call the teleological approach—we identify three factors that we hypothesize will influence LLM accuracy: the probability of the task to be performed, the probability of the target output, and the probability of the provided input. To test our predictions, we evaluate five LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3, and Gemini 1.0) on 11 tasks, and we find robust evidence that LLMs are influenced by probability in the hypothesized ways. Many of the experiments reveal surprising failure modes. For instance, GPT-4’s accuracy at decoding a simple cipher is 51% when the output is a high-probability sentence but only 13% when it is low-probability, even though this task is a deterministic one for which probability should not matter. These results show that AI practitioners should be careful about using LLMs in low-probability situations. More broadly, we conclude that we should not evaluate LLMs as if they are humans but should instead treat them as a distinct type of system—one that has been shaped by its own particular set of pressures.",

          "abstract": "Fusicoccadiene synthase from Phomopsis amygdala (PaFS) is a bifunctional terpene synthase. It contains a prenyltransferase (PT) domain that generates geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from dimethylallyl diphosphate and three equivalents of isopentenyl diphosphate, and a cyclase domain that converts GGPP into fusicoccadiene, a precursor of the diterpene glycoside Fusicoccin A. The two catalytic domains are connected by a flexible 69-residue linker. The PT domain mediates oligomerization to form predominantly octamers, with cyclase domains randomly splayed out around the PT core. Surprisingly, despite the random positioning of cyclase domains, substrate channeling is operative in catalysis since most of the GGPP generated by the PT remains on the enzyme for cyclization. Here, we demonstrate that covalent linkage of the PT and cyclase domains is not required for GGPP channeling, although covalent linkage may improve channeling efficiency. Moreover, GGPP competition experiments with other diterpene cyclases indicate that the PaFS PT and cyclase domains are preferential partners regardless of whether they are covalently linked or not. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of the 600-kD “linkerless” construct, in which the 69-residue linker is spliced out and replaced with the tripeptide PTQ, reveals that cyclase pairs associate with all four sides of the PT octamer and exhibit fascinating quaternary structural flexibility. These results suggest that optimal substrate channeling is achieved when a cyclase domain associates with the side of the PT octamer, regardless of whether the two domains are covalently linked and regardless of whether this interaction is transient or locked in place.",

This translocation of C 55 -P is facilitated by DedA and DUF368 domain-containing family membrane proteins via unknown mechanisms. Here, we employ native mass spectrometry to investigate the interactions of UptA, a member of the DedA family of membrane protein from Bacillus subtilis , with C 55 -P, membrane phospholipids, and cell wall-targeting antibiotics. Our results show that UptA, expressed and purified in Escherichia coli , forms monomer–dimer equilibria, and binds to C 55 -P in a pH-dependent fashion. Specifically, we show that UptA interacts more favorably with C 55 -P over shorter-chain analogs and membrane phospholipids. Moreover, we demonstrate that lipopeptide antibiotics, amphomycin and aspartocin D, can directly inhibit UptA function by out-competing the substrate for the protein binding, in addition to their propensity to form complex with free C 55 -P. Overall, this study shows that UptA-mediated translocation of C 55 -P is potentially mediated by pH and anionic phospholipids and provides insights for future development of antibiotics targeting carrier lipid recycling.",

Although macaques have to accommodate similarly large fetuses, relative to their maternal birth canals, it was not known whether macaque mothers face birth difficulties similar to humans. Based on 27 y of demographic data from a semi-free-ranging, closely monitored population of Japanese macaques ( Macaca fuscata ), we found no birth-associated mortality in macaques. This differs from the situation in many human populations. We suggest three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses to explain these observations. i) The macaque fetal skull is similarly flexible as the human fetal skull. ii) The macaque pelvis and connective tissue show greater flexibility during birth. iii) The interplay between macaque pelvic shape and birth dynamics is smoother and incurs fewer complications than in humans.",

In Escherichia coli , BAM folds numerous substrates which vary considerably in size and shape. How BAM is able to efficiently fold such a diverse array of β-barrel substrates is not clear. Here, we develop a disulfide crosslinking method to trap native substrates in vivo as they fold on BAM. By placing a cysteine within the luminal wall of the BamA barrel as well as in the substrate β-strands, we can compare the residence time of each substrate strand within the BamA lumen. We validated this method using two defective, slow-folding substrates. We used this method to characterize stable intermediates which occur during folding of two structurally different native substrates. Strikingly, these intermediates occur during identical stages of folding for both substrates: soon after folding has begun and just before folding is completed. We suggest that these intermediates arise due to barriers to folding that are common between β-barrel substrates, and that the BAM catalyst is able to fold so many different substrates because it addresses these common challenges.",

Previous transient absorption (TA) studies suggested that Zea can participate in direct quenching via chlorophyll (Chl) to Zea energy transfer. However, the contamination of intrinsic exciton–exciton annihilation (EEA) makes the assignment of TA signal ambiguous. In this study, we present EEA-free TA data using Nicotiana benthamiana thylakoid membranes, including the wild type and three NPQ mutants ( npq1 , npq4 , and lut2 ) generated by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. The results show a strong correlation between excitation energy transfer from excited Chl Q y to Zea S 1 and the xanthophyll cycle during qE activation. Notably, a Lut S 1 signal is absent in the npq1 thylakoids which lack zeaxanthin. Additionally, the fifth-order response analysis shows a reduction in the exciton diffusion length (L D ) from 62 ± 6 nm to 43 ± 3 nm under high light illumination, consistent with the reduced range of exciton motion being a key aspect of plants’ response to excess light.",

It is highly expressed in cancer tissues and contributes to their malignant transformation. Degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system may help to prevent such overexpression of E2F1 and thereby to suppress carcinogenesis. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying E2F1 degradation may therefore inform the development of new cancer treatments. We here identified SCF FBXW7 as a ubiquitin ligase for E2F1 by comprehensive analysis. We found that phosphorylation of E2F1 at serine-403 promotes its binding to FBXW7 (F-box/WD repeat–containing protein 7) followed by its ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, calcineurin, a Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase, was shown to stabilize E2F1 by mediating its dephosphorylation at serine-403 and thereby preventing FBXW7 binding. Treatment of cells with Ca 2+ channel blockers resulted in downregulation of both E2F1 protein and the expression of E2F1 target genes, whereas treatment with the Ca 2+ ionophore ionomycin induced upregulation of E2F1. Finally, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 attenuated xenograft tumor growth in mice in association with downregulation of E2F1 in the tumor tissue. Impairment of the balance between the opposing actions of FBXW7 and calcineurin in the regulation of E2F1 abundance may therefore play an important role in carcinogenesis.",

Inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is the signature initiating event in the most common form of kidney cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Such tumors are usually driven by the excessive HIF2 activity that arises when the VHL gene product, pVHL, is defective. Given the pressing need for a robust immunocompetent mouse model of human ccRCC, we directly injected adenovirus-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding sgRNAs against VHL and other known/suspected ccRCC tumor suppressor genes into the kidneys of C57BL/6 mice under conditions where Cas9 was under the control of one of two different kidney-specific promoters ( Cdh16 or Pax 8) to induce kidney tumors. An AAV targeting Vhl, Pbrm1, Keap1 , and Tsc1 reproducibly caused macroscopic ccRCCs that partially resembled human ccRCC tumors with respect to transcriptome and cell of origin and responded to a ccRCC standard-of-care agent, axitinib. Unfortunately, these tumors, like those produced by earlier genetically engineered mouse ccRCCs, are HIF2 independent.",

          "abstract": "The Ca 2+ sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) triggers neurotransmitter release together with the neuronal sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex formed by syntaxin-1, SNAP25, and synaptobrevin. Moreover, Syt1 increases synaptic vesicle (SV) priming and impairs spontaneous vesicle release. The Syt1 C 2 B domain binds to the SNARE complex through a primary interface via two regions (I and II), but how exactly this interface mediates distinct functions of Syt1 and the mechanism underlying Ca 2+ triggering of release are unknown. Using mutagenesis and electrophysiological experiments, we show that region II is functionally and spatially subdivided: Binding of C2B domain arginines to SNAP-25 acidic residues at one face of region II is crucial for Ca 2+ -evoked release but not for vesicle priming or clamping of spontaneous release, whereas other SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 acidic residues at the other face mediate priming and clamping of spontaneous release but not evoked release. Mutations that disrupt region I impair the priming and clamping functions of Syt1 while, strikingly, mutations that enhance binding through this region increase vesicle priming and clamping of spontaneous release, but strongly inhibit evoked release and vesicle fusogenicity. These results support previous findings that the primary interface mediates the functions of Syt1 in vesicle priming and clamping of spontaneous release and, importantly, show that Ca 2+ triggering of release requires a rearrangement of the primary interface involving dissociation of region I, while region II remains bound. Together with biophysical studies presented in [K. Jaczynska et al. , bioRxiv [Preprint] (2024). https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.17.599417 (Accessed 18 June 2024)], our data suggest a model whereby this rearrangement pulls the SNARE complex to facilitate fast SV fusion.",

          "abstract": "Summer temperature extremes can have large impacts on humans and the biosphere, and an increase in heat extremes is one of the most visible symptoms of climate change. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed that would predict faster warming of heat extremes than typical summer days, but it is unclear whether this is occurring. Here, we show that, in both observations and historical climate model simulations, the hottest summer days have warmed at the same pace as the median globally, in each hemisphere, and in the tropics from 1959 to 2023. In contrast, the coldest summer days have warmed more slowly than the median in the global average, a signal that is not simulated in any of 262 simulations across 28 CMIP6 models. The observed stretching of the cold tail indicates that observed summertime temperatures have become more variable despite the lack of hot day amplification. The interannual variability and trend in the warming of both hot and cold extremes compared to the median can be explained from a surface energy balance perspective based on changes in net surface radiation and evaporative fraction. Tropical hot day amplification is projected to emerge in the future (2024–2099, SSP3-7.0 scenario), while Northern Hemisphere heat extremes are expected to continue to follow the median.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol consumption during adolescence has been associated with neuroanatomical abnormalities and the appearance of future disorders. However, the latest advances in this field point to the existence of risk profiles which may lead to some individuals into an early consumption. To date, some studies have established predictive models of consumption based on sociodemographic, behavioral, and anatomical–functional variables using MRI. However, the neuroimaging variables employed are usually restricted to local and hemodynamic phenomena. Given the potential of connectome approaches, and the high temporal dynamics of electrophysiology, we decided to explore the relationship between future alcohol consumption and electrophysiological connectivity measured by MEG in a cohort of 83 individuals aged 14 to 16. As a result, we found a positive correlation between alcohol consumption and the functional connectivity in frontal, parietal, and frontoparietal connections. Once this relationship was described, multivariate linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictive capacity of functional connectivity in conjunction with other neuroanatomical and behavioral variables described in the literature. Finally, the multivariate linear regression analysis determined the importance of anatomical and functional variables in the prediction of alcohol consumption but failed to find associations with impulsivity, sensation seeking, and executive function scales. In conclusion, the predictive traits obtained in these models were closely associated with changes occurring during adolescence, suggesting the existence of different paths in neurodevelopment that have the potential to influence adolescents’ relationship with alcohol consumption.",

We synthesized bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These molecules relocalized CDK9 to BCL6-bound DNA and directed phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. The resulting expression of pro-apoptotic, BCL6-target genes caused killing of diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells and specific ablation of the BCL6-regulated germinal center response. Genomics and proteomics corroborated a gain-of-function mechanism in which global kinase activity was not inhibited but rather redirected.

Recently discovered global epistasis, in which the fitness effects of mutations scale with the fitness of the background genotype, can improve predictions, but how the environment modulates this scaling is unknown. We measured the fitness effects of ~100 insertion mutations in 42 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in six laboratory environments and found that the global epistasis scaling is nearly invariant across environments. Instead, the environment tunes one global parameter, the background fitness at which most mutations switch sign. As a consequence, the distribution of mutational effects is predictable across genotypes and environments. Our results suggest that the effective dimensionality of genotype-to-phenotype maps across environments is surprisingly low.",

Although the TFs specifying the blastocyst’s lineages are well characterized, those playing earlier roles remain poorly defined. Using mouse models of the TF Nr5a2 , we show that Nr5a2 −/− embryos arrest at the early morula stage and exhibit altered lineage specification, frequent mitotic failure, and substantial chromosome segregation defects. Although NR5A2 plays a minor but measurable role during zygotic genome activation, it predominantly acts as a master regulator at the eight-cell stage, controlling expression of lineage-specifying TFs and genes involved in mitosis, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair. We conclude that NR5A2 coordinates proliferation, genome stability, and lineage specification to ensure correct morula development.",

The response maps onto the Arctic Oscillation and is strongest in the North Atlantic, where it resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Unexpectedly, these 1-year lagged teleconnections are at least as strong as the better-known simultaneous winter connections. However, the 1-year lagged response is opposite in sign to the simultaneous response such that 1 year later, El Niño is followed by a positive NAO, whereas La Niña is followed by a negative NAO. The lagged response may also interfere with simultaneous ENSO teleconnections. We show here that these effects are unlikely to be caused by residual aliasing of ENSO cycles; rather, slowly migrating atmospheric angular momentum anomalies explain both the sign and the timing of the extratropical response. Our results have implications for understanding ENSO teleconnections, explaining observed extratropical climate variability and interpreting seasonal to interannual climate predictions.",

State-of-the-art in situ four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) observations reveal the statistical correlation between grain rotation and grain growth or shrinkage. This correlation arises from shear-coupled grain boundary migration, which occurs through the motion of disconnections, as demonstrated by in situ high-angle annular dark-field STEM observations and the atomistic simulation–aided analysis.

We found that fungus-ant agriculture originated ~66 million years ago when the end-of-Cretaceous asteroid impact temporarily interrupted photosynthesis, causing global mass extinctions but favoring the proliferation of fungi. Subsequently, ~27 million years ago, one ancestral fungal cultivar population became domesticated, i.e., obligately mutualistic, when seasonally dry habitats expanded in South America, likely isolating the cultivar population from its free-living, wet forest–dwelling conspecifics.

We have developed catalysts, readily derived from the Cinchona alkaloid family of natural products, which can achieve this by virtue of their chiral amine structure. The catalyst, following single-electron oxidation, desymmetrizes meso -diols by selectively abstracting a hydrogen atom from one carbon center, which then regains a hydrogen atom by abstraction from a thiol. This results in an enantioselective epimerization process, forming the chiral diastereomer with high enantiomeric excess. Cyclic and acyclic 1,2-diols are compatible, as are acyclic 1,3-diols. Additionally, we demonstrate the viability of combining our approach with carbon-carbon bond formation in Giese addition. Given the increasing number of synthetic methods involving hydrogen atom transfer steps, we anticipate that this work will have a broad impact in the field of enantioselective radical chemistry.",

          "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an urgent public health threat with limited preventative options. In this work, we developed a messenger RNA (mRNA)–lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine targeting C. difficile toxins and virulence factors. This multivalent vaccine elicited robust and long-lived systemic and mucosal antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across animal models, independent of changes to the intestinal microbiota. Vaccination protected mice from lethal CDI in both primary and recurrent infection models, and inclusion of non-toxin cellular and spore antigens improved decolonization of toxigenic C. difficile from the gastrointestinal tract. Our studies demonstrate mRNA-LNP vaccine technology as a promising platform for the development of novel C. difficile therapeutics with potential for limiting acute disease and promoting bacterial decolonization.",

          "abstract": "The premise of cancer immunotherapy is that cancers are specifically visible to an immune system tolerized to healthy self. The promise of cancer immunotherapy is that immune effector mechanisms and immunological memory can jointly eradicate cancers and inoperable metastases and de facto vaccinate against recurrence. For some patients with hitherto incurable diseases, including metastatic melanoma, this promise is being realized by game-changing immunotherapies based on αβ T cells. Today’s challenges are to bring benefit to greater numbers of patients of diverse ethnicities, target more cancer types, and achieve a cure while incurring fewer adverse events. In meeting those challenges, specific benefits may be offered by γδ T cells, which compose a second T cell lineage with distinct recognition capabilities and functional traits that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. γδ T cell–based clinical trials, including off-the-shelf adoptive cell therapy and agonist antibodies, are yielding promising results, although identifiable problems remain. In addressing those problems, we advocate that immunotherapies be guided by the distinctive biology of γδ T cells, as elucidated by ongoing research.",

          "abstract": "Humans have been driving a global erosion of species richness for millennia, but the consequences of past extinctions for other dimensions of biodiversity—functional and phylogenetic diversity—are poorly understood. In this work, we show that, since the Late Pleistocene, the extinction of 610 bird species has caused a disproportionate loss of the global avian functional space along with ~3 billion years of unique evolutionary history. For island endemics, proportional losses have been even greater. Projected future extinctions of more than 1000 species over the next two centuries will incur further substantial reductions in functional and phylogenetic diversity. These results highlight the severe consequences of the ongoing biodiversity crisis and the urgent need to identify the ecological functions being lost through extinction.",

Here, we show that in the DRT2 defense system, the reverse transcriptase binds a neighboring pseudoknotted noncoding RNA. Upon bacteriophage infection, a template region of this RNA is reverse transcribed into an array of tandem repeats that reconstitute a promoter and open reading frame, allowing expression of a toxic repetitive protein and an abortive infection response. Biochemical reconstitution of this activity and cryo–electron microscopy provide a molecular basis for repeat synthesis.

We show that DRT2 systems encode an unprecedented immune pathway that involves de novo gene synthesis through rolling circle reverse transcription of a noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Programmed template jumping on the ncRNA generates a concatemeric cDNA, which becomes double-stranded upon viral infection. This DNA product constitutes a protein-coding, nearly endless open reading frame ( neo ) gene whose expression leads to potent cell growth arrest, restricting the viral infection.

          "abstract": "A broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves has been explored for wireless neuromodulation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, with long wavelengths, cannot provide submillimeter spatial resolution. Visible light, with its short wavelengths, suffers from strong scattering in the deep tissue. Microwaves have centimeter-scale penetration depth and have been shown to reversibly inhibit neuronal activity. Yet, microwaves alone do not provide sufficient spatial precision to modulate target neurons without affecting surrounding tissues. Here, we report a split-ring resonator (SRR) that generates an enhanced microwave field at its gap with submillimeter spatial precision. With the SRR, microwaves at dosages below the safe exposure limit are shown to inhibit the firing of neurons within 1 mm of the SRR gap site. The microwave SRR reduced seizure activity at a low dose in both in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy. This microwave dosage is confirmed to be biosafe via histological and biochemical assessment of brain tissue.",

Thus, contrast agents combining T 1 and T 2 effects are sought for multiparameter MRA with clinical promise, yet achieving a balance in T 1 and T 2 contrast enhancement effects remains a scientific challenge. Herein, we developed a hypersensitive multiparameter MRA strategy using dual-modality NaGdF 4 nanoparticles. Because of the longer tumbling time (τ R ), NaGdF 4 nanoparticles can improve the longitudinal relaxivity ( r 1 ), brightening vessels in T 1 -weighted sequences. Simultaneously, the regular arrangement of Gd 3+ in the crystal induces magnetic anisotropy, creating local static magnetic field heterogeneity and generating negative signals in T 2 -weighted sequences. Consequently, the efficacy of NaGdF 4 -enhanced high-resolution multiparameter MRA has been validated in diagnosing ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s disease in rodent models. In addition, the dual-contrast imaging has been realized on swine with a clinical 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, highly emphasizing the clinical translation prospect.",

Moreover, they often require multiple-step operations for production. Here, we use an additive manufacturing process based on continuous liquid interface production to create high-resolution (30-micrometer) three-dimensional elastomeric polyurethane lattices for use as dielectric layers in capacitive sensors. We show that the capacitive responses and sensitivities are highly tunable through designs of lattice type, thickness, and material-void volume percentage. Microcomputed tomography and finite element simulation are used to elucidate the influence of lattice design on the deformation mechanism and concomitant sensing behavior. The advantage of three-dimensional printing is exhibited with examples of fully printed representative athletic equipment with integrated sensors.",

Impressively, the mass activity (MA) reaches 2.99 A mg Pt −1 for ORR over g -Zn–N–C/PtCo, and 79.3% of the initial MA is maintained after 90K cycles in fuel cell.

Cortical bone of 323 known and unknown tobacco users was studied by an untargeted metabolomics assay using a liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry platform. We identified 45 discriminating molecular features that differed between tobacco consumers (15 up-regulated features) and nonconsumers (17 up-regulated features). Tobacco consumption leaves a metabolic record in human bone distinctive enough to identify its use in individuals of unknown tobacco consumption.

We found that erg3 channels stabilize the resting potential and dampen spontaneous activity in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and hippocampal CA1 neurons, whereas erg1 channels have suprathreshold functions. Lack of erg3 subunits induced hyperexcitability with increased action potential firing in PCs, but not in CA1 neurons. Notably, erg3 depletion caused depressive-like behavior with reduced locomotor activity, strongly decreased digging behavior, and shorter latencies to fall off a rotating wheel, while learning and memory remained unchanged. Our data show that erg K + channels containing erg3 subunits mediate a neuronal subthreshold K + current that plays important roles in the regulation of locomotor behavior in vivo.",

Here, our single-cell RNA sequencing data identify a subpopulation of macrophages expressing high levels of the phagocytic receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK + macrophages), which is closely associated with melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. Adoptive transfer of the MerTK + macrophages into recipient mice notably accelerated tumor growth regardless of macrophage depletion. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK + macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Specifically targeted delivery of AhR antagonist to tumor-associated macrophages with mannosylated micelles could suppress MerTK expression and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti–programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanism of MerTK + macrophages and provide strategies for improving the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy.",

We first show, computationally and experimentally, that an immiscible phase can be robustly positioned at the neck of human aneurysm models to seal and isolate the aneurysm’s cavity for further treatment, including in wide-neck aneurysms. We then demonstrate localized delivery and confined treatment, by selective staining of cell nuclei within the aneurysm cavity as well as by hydrogel-based embolization in patient-specific aneurysm models.

Plant-derived membrane interfaces, engulfing invasive hyphal projections of fungal and oomycete pathogens, are prominent junctures dictating infection outcomes. Understanding how pathogens transform these host-pathogen interfaces to their advantage remains a key biological question. Here, we identified a conserved effector, secreted by plant pathogenic oomycetes, that co-opts a host Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP), TOPGAP, to remodel the host-pathogen interface. The effector, PiE354, hijacks TOPGAP as a susceptibility factor to usurp its GAP activity on Rab8a, a key Rab GTPase crucial for defense-related secretion. By hijacking TOPGAP, PiE354 purges Rab8a from the plasma membrane, diverting Rab8a-mediated immune trafficking away from the pathogen interface. This mechanism signifies an uncanny evolutionary adaptation of a pathogen effector in co-opting a host regulatory component to subvert defense-related secretion, thereby providing unprecedented mechanistic insights into the reprogramming of host membrane dynamics by pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Rapid elimination of paternal mitochondria following fertilization is a conserved event in most animals, but its physiological significance remains unclear. We find that modest delay of paternal mitochondrial elimination (PME) in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos unexpectedly impairs mating and cognition of adult animals and alters their locomotion behaviors. Delayed PME causes decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in early embryos, which lead to impaired physiological functions of adult animals through an energy-sensing pathway mediated by an adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase, AAK-2, and a forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factor, DAF-16. Treatment of PME-delayed animals with MK-4, a subtype of vitamin K 2 that can improve mitochondrial ATP production, restores ATP levels in early embryos, and rescues physiological defects of adult animals. Our results suggest that moderate PME delay during embryo development adversely affects crucial physiological functions in adults, which could be evolutionarily disadvantageous. These observations provide mechanistic explanations for the need to swiftly remove paternal mitochondria early during embryo development.",

Sets of compounds that show conditional anticancer activity span different phases of global development and include non-oncology drugs. Comparisons of the synthetic and serum-derived components that comprise typical media trace sets of conditional phenotypes to nucleotide synthesis substrates.

Together, they form a trimeric DRP1-MiD-MFF complex. Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK)–mediated phosphorylation of MFF is necessary for mitochondrial fragmentation, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identify MFF as a target of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) at Lys 151 , MFF SUMOylation is enhanced following AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and that MFF SUMOylation regulates the level of MiD binding to MFF. The mitochondrial stressor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) promotes MFF SUMOylation and mitochondrial fragmentation. However, CCCP-induced fragmentation is impaired in MFF-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing non-SUMOylatable MFF K151R.

It is unknown, whether these HPV16-HS interactions depend on HS sulfation patterns. Thus, we probed potential roles of HS sulfations using cell-based functional and physicochemical assays, including single-molecule force spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that N-sulfation of HS is crucial for virus binding and structural activation by providing high-affinity sites, and that additional 6O-sulfation is required to mechanically stabilize the interaction, whereas 2O-sulfation and 3O-sulfation are mostly dispensable. Together, our findings identify the contribution of HS sulfation patterns to HPV16 binding and structural activation and reveal how distinct sulfation groups of HS synergize to facilitate HPV16 entry, which, in turn, likely influences the tropism of HPVs.",

Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs, the 21URNAs, are implicated in regulating coding sequences; the messenger RNA targets and biological processes they control during spermatogenesis are largely unknown. We demonstrate that loss of 21URNAs compromises homolog pairing and makes it permissive for nonhomologous synapsis resulting in defects in crossover formation and chromosome segregation during spermatogenesis. We identify Polo-like kinase 3 (PLK-3), among others, as a 21URNA target. 21URNA activity restricts PLK-3 protein to proliferative cells, and expansion of PLK-3 in pachytene overlaps with the meiotic defects. Removal of plk-3 results in quantitative genetic suppression of the meiotic defects. One discrete 21URNA inhibits PLK-3 expression in late pachytene cells.

If the π-states in these triangulene-based 2D polymers are half-occupied, then we predict that they are antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulators. Incorporating a boron or nitrogen heteroatom per monomer results in Stoner ferromagnetism and half-metallicity, with the Fermi level located at spin-polarized Dirac points. An unprecedented antiferromagnetic half-semiconductor is observed in a binary boron-nitrogen–centered 2D polymer. Our findings pioneer Stoner and Mott-Hubbard magnetism emerging in the electronic π-system of crystalline-conjugated 2D polymers.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge of nonlinear dynamics and network science is to understand how higher-order interactions influence collective dynamics. Although many studies have approached this question through linear stability analysis, less is known about how higher-order interactions shape the global organization of different states. Here, we shed light on this issue by analyzing the rich patterns supported by identical Kuramoto oscillators on hypergraphs. We show that higher-order interactions can have opposite effects on linear stability and basin stability: They stabilize twisted states (including full synchrony) by improving their linear stability, but also make them hard to find by markedly reducing their basin size. Our results highlight the importance of understanding higher-order interactions from both local and global perspectives.",

Inducible deletion of Mettl3 in murine keratinocytes results in spontaneous skin inflammation and increases susceptibility to cutaneous inflammation with activation of neutrophil recruitment. Therapeutically, restoration of m 6 A alleviates the disease phenotypes in mice and suppresses inflammation in human biopsy specimens. We support a model in which m 6 A modification stabilizes the mRNA of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme ELOVL6 via the m 6 A reader IGF2BP3, leading to a rewiring of fatty acid metabolism with a reduction in palmitic acid accumulation and, consequently, suppressing neutrophil chemotaxis in cutaneous inflammation.

Here, we devise orbit symmetry breaking in MXene (a low-cost scalability, biocompatible, and conductive two dimensionally layered material, which we refer to as OBXene), which exhibits low bioelectronic-tissue impedance, originating from the out-of-plane charge transfer. Furthermore, the Schottky-induced piezoelectricity stemming from the asymmetric orbital configuration of OBXene facilitates interlayered charge transport in the device.

Using a Xenopus model of retinitis pigmentosa, we found that Müller cells actively proliferate upon photoreceptor degeneration in old tadpoles but not in younger ones. Differences in the inflammatory microenvironment emerged as an explanation for such stage dependency. Functional analyses revealed that enhancing neuroinflammation is sufficient to trigger Müller cell proliferation, not only in young tadpoles but also in mice. In addition, we showed that microglia are absolutely required for the response of mouse Müller cells to mitogenic factors while negatively affecting their neurogenic potential. However, both cell cycle reentry and neurogenic gene expression are allowed when applying sequential pro- and anti-inflammatory treatments. This reveals that inflammation benefits Müller glia proliferation in both regenerative and nonregenerative vertebrates and highlights the importance of sequential inflammatory modulation to create a regenerative permissive microenvironment.",

In contrast, generation of the ADO knockout mouse revealed high tolerance for ADO depletion in adult tissues. To understand the mechanism underlying ADO’s essentiality in cancer cells, we characterized the cell proteome and metabolome following depletion of ADO. This revealed that ADO depletion leads to toxic levels of polyamines which can be driven by ADO’s substrate cysteamine. Polyamine accumulation in turn stimulated expression of proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) which resulted in mitochondrial hyperactivity and ROS production, culminating in cell toxicity. This work identifies ADO as a unique vulnerability in cancer cells, due to its essential role in maintenance of redox homeostasis through restraining polyamine levels and proline catabolism.",

Functional assays, both in vitro (cell proliferation, migration, colony, and tumorsphere formation) and in vivo (xenograft tumors), demonstrated the impact of SRSF6 modulation on critical cancer hallmarks.

Using soft x-ray laminography, we reconstruct with about 20-nanometer spatial (voxel) size the full three-dimensional spin texture of a skyrmion in an 800-nanometer-diameter and 95-nanometer-thin disk patterned into a 30× [iridium/cobalt/platinum] multilayered film. A quantitative analysis finds that the evolution of the radial profile of the topological skyrmion number is nonuniform across the thickness of the disk. Estimates of the micromagnetic energy densities suggest that the changes in topological profile are related to nonuniform competing energetic interactions.

We show that specific binding of a protein to its mRNA leader sequence substantially arrests scanning.

Activation of NOD1 in vivo augments antitumor immunity and enhances the effectiveness of anti–PD-1 therapy.

Although this concept was introduced over two decades ago, its observation was previously limited to electromagnetic waves.

Using deep learning protein design, we generate a specific and potent competitive peptide inhibitor of PP2A-B55 substrate interactions. With this inhibitor, we uncover that PP2A-B55 regulates the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex by binding to an α-helical recruitment module in the RNA binding protein 7 (RBM7), a component of the NEXT complex. Collectively, our findings provide a framework for the understanding and interrogation of PP2A-B55 function in health and disease.",

          "abstract": "Achilles tendinopathy is often attributed to overuse, but its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Disruption to the molecular structure of collagen is fundamental for the onset and progression of tendinopathy but has mostly been investigated in vitro. Here, we interrogated the in vivo molecular structure changes of collagen in rat Achilles tendons following treadmill running. Unexpectedly, the tendons’ collagen molecules were not mechanically unfolded by running but denatured through proteolysis during physiological post-run remodeling. We further revealed that running induces inflammatory gene expressions in Achilles tendons and that long-term running causes prolonged, elevated collagen degradation, leading to the accumulation of denatured collagen and tendinopathy development. For applications, we demonstrated magnetic resonance imaging of collagenase-induced Achilles tendon injury in vivo using a denatured collagen targeting contrast agent. Our findings may help close the knowledge gaps in the mechanobiology and pathogenesis of Achilles tendinopathy and initiate new strategies for its imaging-based diagnosis.",

          "abstract": "The major female ovarian hormone, 17β-estradiol (E 2 ), can alter neuronal excitability within milliseconds to regulate a variety of physiological processes. Estrogen receptor-α (ERα), classically known as a nuclear receptor, exists as a membrane-bound receptor to mediate this rapid action of E 2 , but the ionic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that a membrane channel protein, chloride intracellular channel protein-1 (Clic1), can physically interact with ERα with a preference to the membrane-bound ERα. Clic1-mediated currents can be enhanced by E 2 and reduced by its depletion. In addition, Clic1 currents are required to mediate the E 2 -induced rapid excitations in multiple brain ERα populations. Further, genetic disruption of Clic1 in hypothalamic ERα neurons blunts the regulations of E 2 on female body weight balance. In conclusion, we identified the Clic1 chloride channel as a key mediator for E 2 -induced rapid neuronal excitation, which may have a broad impact on multiple neurobiological processes regulated by E 2 .",

          "abstract": "Obtaining atomic-level information on components in the cell is a major focus in structural biology. Elucidating specific structural and dynamic features of proteins and their interactions in the cellular context is crucial for understanding cellular processes. We introduce 19 F dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) combined with fast magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a powerful technique to study proteins in mammalian cells. We demonstrate our approach on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 5F-Trp-N NTD protein, electroporated into human cells. DNP signal enhancements of 30- to 40-fold were observed, translating into over 1000-fold experimental time savings. High signal-to-noise ratio spectra were acquired on nanomole quantities of a protein in cells in minutes. 2D 19 F- 19 F dipolar correlation spectra with remarkable sensitivity and resolution were obtained, exhibiting 19 F- 19 F cross peaks associated with fluorine atoms as far as ~10 angstroms apart. This work paves the way for 19 F DNP-enhanced MAS NMR applications in cells for probing protein structure, dynamics, and ligand interactions.",
