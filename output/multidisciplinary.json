          "title": "Classical theories of gravity produce entanglement",
          "authors": "Joseph Aziz, Richard Howl",
          "abstract": "The unification of gravity and quantum mechanics remains one of the most profound open questions in science. With recent advances in quantum technology, an experimental idea first proposed by Richard Feynman 1 is now regarded as a promising route to testing this unification for the first time. The experiment involves placing a massive object in a quantum superposition of two locations and letting it gravitationally interact with another mass. If the two objects subsequently become entangled, this is considered unambiguous evidence that gravity obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. This conclusion derives from theorems that treat a classical gravitational interaction as a local interaction capable of transmitting only classical, not quantum, information 2–8 . Here we extend the description of matter used in these theorems to the full framework of quantum field theory, finding that theories with classical gravity can then transmit quantum information and, thus, generate entanglement through physical, local processes. The effect scales differently to that predicted by theories of quantum gravity, and so it gives information on the parameters and form of the experiment required to robustly provide evidence for the quantum nature of gravity.",

          "abstract": "The landmark discovery that neutrinos have mass and can change type (or flavour) as they propagate—a process called neutrino oscillation 1–6 —has opened up a rich array of theoretical and experimental questions being actively pursued today. Neutrino oscillation remains the most powerful experimental tool for addressing many of these questions, including whether neutrinos violate charge-parity (CP) symmetry, which has possible connections to the unexplained preponderance of matter over antimatter in the Universe 7–11 . Oscillation measurements also probe the mass-squared differences between the different neutrino mass states (Δ m 2 ), whether there are two light states and a heavier one (normal ordering) or vice versa (inverted ordering), and the structure of neutrino mass and flavour mixing 12 . Here we carry out the first joint analysis of datasets from NOvA 13 and T2K 14 , the two currently operating long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments (hundreds of kilometres of neutrino travel distance), taking advantage of our complementary experimental designs and setting new constraints on several neutrino sector parameters. This analysis provides new precision on the $$\\Delta {m}_{32}^{2}$$ Δ m 32 2 mass difference, finding $$2.4{3}_{-0.03}^{+0.04}\\times 1{0}^{-3}\\,{{\\rm{eV}}}^{2}$$ 2.4 3 − 0.03 + 0.04 × 1 0 − 3 eV 2 in the normal ordering and $$-2.4{8}_{-0.04}^{+0.03}\\times 1{0}^{-3}\\,{{\\rm{eV}}}^{2}$$ − 2.4 8 − 0.04 + 0.03 × 1 0 − 3 eV 2 in the inverted ordering, as well as a 3 σ interval on δ CP of [−1.38π, 0.30π] in the normal ordering and [−0.92π, −0.04π] in the inverted ordering. The data show no strong preference for either mass ordering, but notably, if inverted ordering were assumed true within the three-flavour mixing model, then our results would provide evidence of CP symmetry violation in the lepton sector.",

          "abstract": "Humans and other animals use powerful reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms that have been discovered by evolution over many generations of trial and error. By contrast, artificial agents typically learn using hand-crafted learning rules. Despite decades of interest, the goal of autonomously discovering powerful RL algorithms has proven elusive7-12. In this work, we show that it is possible for machines to discover a state-of-the-art RL rule that outperforms manually-designed rules. This was achieved by meta-learning from the cumulative experiences of a population of agents across a large number of complex environments. Specifically, our method discovers the RL rule by which the agent's policy and predictions are updated. In our large-scale experiments, the discovered rule surpassed all existing rules on the well-established Atari benchmark and outperformed a number of state-of-the-art RL algorithms on challenging benchmarks that it had not seen during discovery. Our findings suggest that the RL algorithms required for advanced artificial intelligence may soon be automatically discovered from the experiences of agents, rather than manually designed.",

          "abstract": "The lithium-ion battery supply chain is critical for global decarbonization1,2, yet its geographically dispersed production stages pose substantial challenges for carbon management3,4. Here we developed a lithium cycle computable general equilibrium (LCCGE) model, integrating life-cycle thinking with global economic dynamics to systematically assess decarbonization pathways. Our analysis reveals a notable ‘value–emission paradox’ across the supply chain: downstream cathode production generates 42.56% of economic value from 34.82% of emissions, whereas upstream mining accounts for 38.52% of total emissions from only 18.78% of the value. A comprehensive scenario analysis shows that, although consumer-oriented recycling can reduce global emission intensity by 16.30% in 2060, it is far surpassed by integrated strategies. The highest global emission reduction (35.87%) is achieved by combining cross-regional cooperation on technology and trade with regionally tailored domestic circular economy policies. This synergistic approach proves highly effective in key manufacturing economies, yielding potential emission reductions of 39.14% in the USA, 37.28% in the European Union and 42.35% in China. By revealing the synergy of combining environmental, technological and trade levers through both global collaboration and local adaptation, our work provides a blueprint for decarbonizing complex global supply chains and establishes a framework for analysing their sustainability analysis.",

          "abstract": "The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , relies exclusively on Anopheles mosquitoes for transmission. Once ingested during blood feeding, most parasites die in the mosquito midgut lumen or during epithelium traversal 1 . How surviving ookinetes interact with midgut cells and form oocysts remains poorly understood, yet these steps are essential to initiate a remarkable growth process culminating in the production of thousands of infectious sporozoites 2 . Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of both parasites and mosquito cells across different developmental stages and metabolic conditions, we unveil key transitions and mosquito–parasite interactions that occur in the midgut. Functional analyses uncover processes that regulate oocyst growth and identify the Plasmodium transcription factor PfSIP2 as essential for sporozoite infection of human hepatocytes. Combining shared mosquito–parasite barcode analysis with confocal microscopy, we reveal that parasites preferentially interact with midgut progenitor cells during epithelial crossing, potentially using their basal location as an exit landmark. Additionally, we show tight connections between extracellular late oocysts and surrounding muscle cells that may ensure parasite adherence to the midgut. We confirm our major findings in several mosquito–parasite combinations, including field-derived parasites. Our study provides fundamental insight into the molecular events that characterize previously inaccessible biological transitions and mosquito–parasite interactions, and identifies candidates for transmission-blocking strategies.",

          "abstract": "Native ion channels play key roles in biological systems, and engineered versions are widely used as chemogenetic tools and in sensing devices1,2. Protein design has been harnessed to generate pore-containing transmembrane proteins, but the design of selectivity filters with precise arrangements of amino acid side chains specific for a target ion, a crucial feature of native ion channels3, has been constrained by the lack of methods for placing the metal-coordinating residues with atomic-level precision. Here we describe a bottom-up RFdiffusion-based approach to construct Ca2+ channels from defined selectivity filter residue geometries, and use this approach to design symmetric oligomeric channels with Ca2+ selectivity filters having different coordination numbers and different geometries at the entrance of a wider pore buttressed by multiple transmembrane helices. The designed channel proteins assemble into homogeneous pore-containing particles and, for both tetrameric and hexameric ion-coordinating configurations, patch-clamp experiments show that the designed channels have higher conductances for Ca2+ than for Na+ and other divalent ions (Sr2+ and Mg2+) that are eliminated after mutation of selectivity filter residues. Cryogenic electron microscopy indicates that the design method has high accuracy: the structure of the hexameric Ca2+ channel is nearly identical to that of the design model. Our bottom-up design approach now enables the testing of hypotheses relating filter geometry to ion selectivity by direct construction, and provides a roadmap for creating selective ion channels for a wide range of applications.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the chemical environment of pristine interfaces is a long-sought goal in electrochemistry, materials science and surface science. A substantial understanding of one such interface, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium anodes, originates from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)1,2. However, room temperature (RT) combined with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) can induce major SEI evolution from reactions and volatilization during XPS1,2. Thus, a technique is necessary for SEI stabilization. Here we develop cryogenic (cryo)-XPS with immediate plunge freezing and demonstrate SEI preservation. We discover substantially different SEI speciation and a thicker pristine SEI with cryo-XPS, free from RT-associated thickness reduction and alterations to important species, including LiF and Li2O, in UHV. This new access to pristine SEI composition enables performance correlations across diverse electrolyte chemistries. Primarily, we highlight the necessity of studying sensitive interfaces under cryogenic conditions.",

          "abstract": "The dynamics of quantum many-body systems is characterized by quantum observables that are reconstructed from correlation functions at separate points in space and time1,2,3. In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, however, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. To circumvent this limitation and enable access to relevant dynamics in experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented4. Here we experimentally measure the second-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC(2))5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 on a superconducting quantum processor and find that they remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long timescales. Furthermore, OTOC(2) manifests quantum correlations in a highly entangled quantum many-body system that are inaccessible without time-reversal techniques. This is demonstrated through an experimental protocol that randomizes the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution. The measured values of OTOC(2) are substantially changed by the protocol, thereby revealing constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in the configuration space. The observed interference mechanism also endows OTOC(2) with high degrees of classical simulation complexity. These results, combined with the capability of OTOC(2) in unravelling useful details of quantum dynamics, as shown through an example of Hamiltonian learning, indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.",

Extracellular fluid Ca2+ is regulated in vertebrates through endocrine systems that manage the vast Ca2+ reservoir in the bones3,4,5,6, but the Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms used by invertebrates, which lack bones, remain largely unclear. Here we identified a potent peptide hormone, Capa, which is responsible for regulating extracellular fluid Ca2+ levels in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Capa-deficient larvae exhibit low haemolymph Ca2+ levels, resulting in reduced locomotion and induced elongated pupae that mimic those of animals reared on a Ca2+-free diet. Capa secreted from specific neurosecretory cells acts on specialized Ca2+ storage compartments in the anterior Malpighian tubules, elevating haemolymph Ca2+. This endocrine mechanism governing Ca2+ regulation in terrestrial invertebrates resembles the parathyroid hormone system in vertebrates.",

As the size of emitting pixels shrinks, the intensity and uniformity of their emission are degraded while colour cross-talk and fabrication complexity increase, making ultra-high-resolution imaging challenging 2–4 . By contrast, electronic paper, which uses ambient light for visibility, can maintain high optical contrast regardless of pixel size, but cannot achieve high resolution 5,6 . Here we demonstrate electronic paper with electrically tunable metapixels down to ~560 nm in size (&gt;25,000 pixels per inch) consisting of WO 3 nanodisks, which undergo a reversible insulator-to-metal transition on electrochemical reduction. This transition enables dynamic modulation of the refractive index and optical absorption, allowing precise control over reflectance and contrast at the nanoscale. By using this effect, the metapixels can achieve pixel densities approaching the visual resolution limit when the display size matches the pupil diameter, which we refer to as retina electronic paper. Our technology also demonstrates full-colour video capability (&gt;25 Hz), high reflectance (~80%), strong optical contrast (~50%), low energy consumption (~0.5–1.7 mW cm – 2 ) and support for anaglyph 3D display, highlighting its potential as a next-generation solution for immersive virtual reality systems.",

Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits emerged as a leading platform and have been used in nearly all system-level demonstrations so far, ranging from optical communications2, parallel lidar3, optical frequency synthesis4, low-noise microwave generation5 to parallel convolutional processing6. Yet, transitioning to real-world deployment outside laboratories has been compounded by the difficulty of deterministic soliton microcomb generation, primarily due to strong thermal instabilities. Although a variety of techniques have been developed to initiate soliton generation, including pulsed pumping, fast scanning and auxiliary-laser pumping7,8,9,10,11, these techniques do not eliminate thermal effects and often compromise microcomb performance, either by adding additional complexity or by reducing the accessible soliton existence range. Here we overcome thermal effects and demonstrate deterministic soliton generation in Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits. We trace thermal effects to unexpected copper impurities within the waveguides, which originate from residual contaminants in CMOS-grade Si wafers and are gettered into Si3N4 during fabrication. By developing copper removal techniques, we substantially reduce copper concentration and thereby mitigate thermal effects. We demonstrate successful dissipative Kerr soliton generation with arbitrary laser scanning profiles and slow laser scanning. Our techniques can be readily applied to front-end-of-line processing of Si3N4 devices in foundries, removing a key obstacle to the deployment of soliton microcomb technology.",

          "abstract": "Social behaviour is substantially shaped by internal physiological states. Although progress has been made in understanding how individual states such as hunger, stress or arousal modulate behaviour 1–9 , animals experience multiple states at any given time 10 . The neural mechanisms that integrate such orthogonal states—and how this integration affects behaviour—remain poorly understood. Here we report how hunger and oestrous state converge on neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) to shape infant-directed behaviour. We find that hunger promotes pup-directed aggression in normally non-aggressive virgin female mice. This behavioural switch occurs through the inhibition of MPOA neurons, driven by the release of neuropeptide Y from Agouti-related peptide-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc AgRP neurons). The propensity for hunger-induced aggression is set by reproductive state, with MPOA neurons detecting changes in the progesterone to oestradiol ratio across the oestrous cycle. Hunger and oestrous state converge on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which sets the baseline activity and excitability of MPOA neurons. Using microendoscopy imaging, we confirm these findings in vivo, revealing that MPOA neurons encode a state for pup-directed aggression. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how multiple physiological states are integrated to flexibly control social behaviour.",

Here we show that the Escherichia coli ubiquitin ligase NleL is an inhibitor of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) extrusion, targeting caspase-4, ROCK1 and ROCK2 for proteasomal degradation. Genetic deletion of Rock1 and Rock2 from cultured IECs diminished inflammasome-induced IEC extrusion. Moreover, mice with Rock1- and Rock2-deficient IECs were less effective than wild-type mice at constraining the numbers of Citrobacter rodentium in the colon. Notably, NleL-deficient C. rodentium triggered more IEC extrusion than did wild-type C. rodentium, resulting in diminished colonization of the colon in infected mice.

          "abstract": "To ensure specificity, sensory neurons must select and express a single receptor from often vast gene families, adhering to the rule of ‘one receptor per neuron’. For example, each olfactory sensory neuron in mammals expresses only one odorant receptor (Or) gene1,2. In Drosophila, which has about 60 Or genes, this selection is deterministic3. By contrast, mice face the challenge of choosing one Or gene from over 1,000 options4. They solve this through a complex system of stochastic choices5,6,7,8,9. Ants also possess many Or genes, most of which are organized into tandem arrays similar to those in mammals, but their regulatory mechanisms have evolved independently. Here we show that, in the ant Harpegnathos saltator, each olfactory sensory neuron activates a single promoter within an Or gene array, producing a mature capped and polyadenylated mRNA. While the promoters of downstream genes in the array are inactive, all downstream genes are nonetheless transcribed due to transcriptional readthrough from the active promoter, probably caused by inefficient RNA polymerase II termination. This readthrough appears to suppress downstream promoters through transcriptional interference, resulting in aberrant non-capped transcripts that are not translated, ensuring that only the active gene is expressed. Simultaneously, long antisense transcription originating from the chosen Or promoter covers upstream genes, presumably silencing them. Ants therefore appear to have evolved a unique transcriptional-interference-based mechanism to express a single OR protein from an array of Or genes with functionally similar promoters.",

          "abstract": "Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common developmental abnormalities, affecting around 1% of live births1. Aneuploidy causes around 15% of CHDs, with trisomy 21 (also known as Down syndrome) being the most frequent form2. CHDs occur in around 50% of cases of Down syndrome, with an approximately 1,000-fold enrichment of atrioventricular canal (AVC) defects that disrupt the junction between the atria and ventricles3,4. The AVC contains unique myocardial cells that are essential for valvuloseptal development; however, the specific combination of dosage-sensitive genes on chromosome 21 that are responsible for Down syndrome-associated CHDs have remained unknown. Here, using human pluripotent stem cell and mouse models of Down syndrome, we identify HMGN1, a nucleosome-binding epigenetic regulator encoded on chromosome 21, as a key contributor to these defects. Single-cell transcriptomics showed that trisomy 21 shifts human AVC cardiomyocytes towards a ventricular cardiomyocyte state. A CRISPR-activation single-cell RNA droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) screen of chromosome 21 genes expressed during heart development revealed that HMGN1 upregulation mimics this shift, whereas deletion of one HMGN1 allele in trisomic cells restored normal gene expression. In a mouse model of trisomy 21, a similar transcriptional shift of AVC cardiomyocytes was restored by a reduction in Hmgn1 dosage, leading to rescue of valvuloseptal defects. These findings identify HMGN1 as a dosage-sensitive modulator of AVC development and cardiac septation in Down syndrome. This study offers a paradigm for dissecting aneuploidy-associated pathogenesis using isogenic systems to map causal genes in complex genetic syndromes.",

Here we introduce decoded quantum interferometry (DQI), a quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce optimization problems to decoding problems. When approximating optimal polynomial fits over finite fields, DQI achieves a superpolynomial speed-up over known classical algorithms. The speed-up arises because the algebraic structure of the problem is reflected in the decoding problem, which can be solved efficiently. We then investigate whether this approach can achieve a speed-up for optimization problems that lack an algebraic structure but have sparse clauses. These problems reduce to decoding low-density parity-check codes, for which powerful decoders are known2,3. To test this, we construct a max-XORSAT instance for which DQI finds an approximate optimum substantially faster than general-purpose classical heuristics, such as simulated annealing. Although a tailored classical solver can outperform DQI on this instance, our results establish that combining quantum Fourier transforms with powerful decoding primitives provides a promising new path towards quantum speed-ups for hard optimization problems.",

The simplest odd-parity spin splitting—p wave—was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems8,9,10,11,12. Recent theory has identified a distinct route to realize p-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations13,14, termed p-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realization of a metallic p-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalized conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localized magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space-inversion symmetry but approximately preserves time-reversal symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation—thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for p-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our p-wave magnet shows a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity13,14,15. Relativistic spin–orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (Hall conductivity >600 S cm−1, Hall angle >3%), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin-nodal planes found in the electronic structure of p-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the anomalous Hall effect. We establish metallic p-wave magnets as an ideal platform to explore the functionality of spin-split electronic states in magnets, superconductors, and in spintronic devices.",

Understanding how stony corals, the primary architects of both shallow and deep reef ecosystems, responded to past environmental challenges is key to predicting their future4. Here we describe a time-calibrated molecular phylogenetic analysis that includes hundreds of newly sequenced coral taxa, and sheds light on the deep-time evolution of scleractinian corals. We date the emergence of the most recent common ancestor of Scleractinia to about 460 million years ago and infer that it was probably a solitary, heterotrophic and free-living organism—or one that could reproduce through transverse division—thriving in both shallow and deep waters. Our analyses suggest that symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates was established around 300 million years ago and spurred coral diversification. However, only a few photosymbiotic lineages survived major environmental disruptions in the Mesozoic era. By contrast, solitary, heterotrophic corals with flexible depth and substrate preferences appear to have thrived in the deep sea despite these environmental disturbance events. Even though ongoing environmental changes are expected to severely affect shallow reefs5, our finding that stony corals have shown resilience throughout geological history offers hope for the persistence of some lineages in the face of climate and other environmental changes.",

Minimizing charge recombination at the buried interface of lead-tin (Pb-Sn) based NBG perovskite solar cells have proven particularly challenging, as conventional long-chain amine-based passivation strategies often induce carrier transport losses, thereby limiting both the fill factors (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) 3–5. Here, we developed a dipolar passivation strategy that reduces the trap density at the buried interface of mixed Pb-Sn perovskite while simultaneously enabling precise energy level alignment at the HTL/perovskite interface. This dipolar-induced passivation enhances ohmic contact, facilitating efficient hole injection into the HTL and repelling electrons from the HTL/Pb-Sn perovskite interface. This approach extends the carrier diffusion length to 6.2 μm and enables a substantial enhancement in the PCE of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells, achieving 24.9% along with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.911 V, a Jsc of 33.1 mA cm-2 and a high FF of 82.6%. Furthermore, the dipolar passivation effectively mitigates contact losses in the NBG subcell induced by the interconnecting layer of tandem devices, contributing to an outstanding PCE of 30.6% (certified stabilized 30.1%) in all-perovskite tandem solar cells.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), a public health concern worldwide, is at present regulated according to its mass concentration1. However, it is increasingly thought that mass concentration may not fully capture the physicochemical properties of PM linked to its health impact2. Consequently, it has been suggested to further investigate the adequacy of this metric as an unequivocal indicator of PM health effects3,4,5. The new European regulation on air quality introduced oxidative potential (OP) as a recommended parameter to be monitored at supersites1, to explore further deciphering information about PM reactivity and health impacts6,7. Here we use a database of almost 11,500 OP measurements from 43 locations across parts of Europe that were analysed with the two most commonly used OP assays8, OPAA and OPDTT, with a standardized protocol9,10. We find high spatial variability of OP across Europe, strongly influenced by site type, such as urban or rural. Accounting for OP alongside PM mass suggests that further improvements in urban air quality may require consideration, particularly near roads, where volumetric OP of PM10 exceeds background levels by a factor of 2.4 to 3.1, depending on the assay used. Analysis of mitigation strategies shows that traffic is a key source to target for effectively reducing OP in cities, whereas comprehensive reductions in PM from both traffic and biomass burning are required to also meet World Health Organization mass guidelines. Although the epidemiological evidence for OP health impacts is still evolving2,8, our findings may help inform the interpretation of future work.",

Despite this prevalence, conventional means of converting aromatic amines rely heavily on diazonium intermediates2, which pose significant safety risks due to the explosive nature of these salts3,4. Here, we report a direct deaminative strategy through the formation of N-nitroamines, allowing the direct conversion of inert aromatic C−N bonds into an array of other functional groups, C−X (C−Br, C−Cl, C−I, C−F, C−N, C−S, C−Se, C−O) and C−C bonds. This operationally simple, general protocol establishes a unified strategy for one-pot deaminative cross-couplings by integrating deaminative functionalization with transition-metal-catalyzed arylation, thereby streamlining synthesis and late-stage functionalization. The key advantages of this transformation over other deaminative functionalization methods lies in its versatility across nearly all classes of medicinally relevant heteroaromatic amines, as well as electronically and structurally diverse aniline derivatives, regardless of the position of the amino group. Mechanistic studies, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, suggest that the aryl cation equivalent reactivity of N-nitroamines is generally favoured in this deaminative process. This study highlights the significant potential of the direct deamination approach in synthetic chemistry, offering a safer alternative to the traditionally explosive and hazardous aryldiazonium chemistry.",

          "abstract": "Metal halide perovskites with remarkable optoelectronic properties have become a competitive candidate for supporting the efficiency progression of photovoltaics. As the latest record on power conversion efficiency (PCE) of research-cells being comparable to the commercialized silicon cells1-3, the industrialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is on the horizon4,5. Most high-efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells using self-assembled molecules (SAMs) face the challenges due to their aggregation and hydrophobicity. Here we report a “SAM-in-matrix” strategy to distribute partial SAMs into a stable matrix of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, which could break the original molecular stacking-induced aggregation. 2D lattice Monte Carlo simulation and experimental results reveal that such strategy can form efficient charge transport channels. This SAM-in-matrix hole transport layer (HTL)-based devices demonstrate universally higher efficiencies for various SAMs with compact surface coverage, decent conductivity, and greatly reduced buried nanovoids. Moreover, this strategy shows prominent applicational potential for scalable production. The SAM-in-matrix HTL on FTO/NiOx substrate facilitates the formation of large-area perovskite films with good crystalline quality and enhanced conductivity of NiOx. 1 m × 2 m large-area perovskite solar module is thus achieved with a certified record efficiency of 20.05%.",

Although personalized mRNA cancer vaccines sensitize tumours to ICIs by directing immune attacks against preselected antigens, personalized vaccines are limited by complex and time-intensive manufacturing processes10,11,12,13,14. Here we show that mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 also sensitize tumours to ICIs. In preclinical models, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines led to a substantial increase in type I interferon, enabling innate immune cells to prime CD8+ T cells that target tumour-associated antigens. Concomitant ICI treatment is required for maximal efficacy in immunologically cold tumours, which respond by increasing PD-L1 expression. Similar correlates of vaccination response are found in humans, including increases in type I interferon, myeloid–lymphoid activation in healthy volunteers and PD-L1 expression on tumours. Moreover, receipt of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines within 100 days of initiating ICI is associated with significantly improved median and three-year overall survival in multiple large retrospective cohorts. This benefit is similar among patients with immunologically cold tumours. Together, these results demonstrate that clinically available mRNA vaccines targeting non-tumour-related antigens are potent immune modulators capable of sensitizing tumours to ICIs.",

However, the explored superlattices are predominantly van der Waals (vdW) superlattices, constrained by weak interface coupling4,5. Here we present an efficient synthetic protocol that achieves a family of non-vdW superlattices of carbides and carbonitrides, featuring hydrogen bonding between layers through a stiffness-mediated rolling-up strategy. The crucial step involves customizing the bending stiffness of the atomic layers derived from MAX phases by creating metal vacancies in MX slabs, triggering their ordered rolling-up under rapid flexural deformation. Unlike vdW superlattices, our non-vdW superlattices with hydrogen bonding afford robust interlayer electronic coupling with highly concentrated charge carriers (1022 cm−3). Consequently, our superlattices exhibit a notable electrical conductivity of about 30,000 S cm−1, which is around 22 times that of the counterparts. When used in electromagnetic interference shielding, the optimal non-vdW superlattice film demonstrates a remarkable shielding effectiveness of 124 dB, surpassing that of any known synthetic materials with comparable thickness. The non-vdW superlattices are anticipated to markedly broaden the material platform, offering variable compositions and crystal structures for new developments in artificially stacked systems.",

          "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) convert extracellular signals into intracellular responses by signalling through 16 subtypes of Gα proteins and two β-arrestin proteins. Biased compounds—molecules that preferentially activate a subset of these proteins—engage therapy-relevant pathways more selectively1 and promise to be safer, more effective medications than compounds that uniformly activate all pathways2. However, the determinants of bias are poorly understood, and we lack rationally designed molecules that select for specific G proteins. Here, using the prototypical class A GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), we show that small molecules that bind to the intracellular GPCR–transducer interface change G protein coupling by subtype-specific and predictable mechanisms, enabling structure-guided drug design. We find that the intracellular, core-binding compound SBI-553 switches the G protein preference of NTSR1 through direct intermolecular interactions3,4,5, promoting or preventing association with specific G protein subtypes. Modifications to the SBI-553 scaffold produce allosteric modulators with distinct G protein selectivity profiles. Selectivity profiles are probe independent, conserved across species and translate to differences in activity in vivo. Our studies show that G protein selectivity can be tailored with small changes to a single chemical scaffold targeting the receptor–transducer interface. Moreover, given that this pocket is broadly conserved, our findings could provide a strategy for pathway-selective drug discovery that is applicable to the diverse GPCR superfamily.",

          "abstract": "Weighted ratings might help to identify the impact of a researcher’s contributions.Credit: Thawatchai Chawong/iStock via Getty\n\nThe h-index — a widely used measure of impact based on publications and citation count over time — treats all of an author’s papers equally, irrespective of whether they are a first, last or middle author. A browser extension called GScholarLens now aims to change that for Google Scholar users.\n\nLaunched earlier this year for the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers, the tool provides a weighted metric, called the Scholar h-index (Sh-index), which accounts for a researcher’s position in author lists.\n\nThe tool gives corresponding (or last) authors the highest weighting: 100% of the citations that their paper accumulates contributed to their Sh-index. First authors receive the second-highest weighting, of 90% of the total citations.\n\nSecond authors get a 50% weighting. Other co-authors get 25% if there are six or fewer authors, or 10% if there are seven or more authors, according to a preprint published in September1 by the tool’s creators.\n\nThe highest weighting is given to the first and last authors because, in most research fields, they are the people who contributed most to the paper, says GScholarLens co-creator Gaurav Sharma, a computational biologist at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad in Kandi. He adds that the weighting given to authorship positions might be tweaked in the future on the basis of user feedback.\n\nThe Sh-index was designed to help researchers, institutions and policymakers to create fairer and more-comprehensive evaluation systems that capture the nuance of authorship, says Sharma.\n\nFor example, if a researcher is a co-author on a few very highly cited papers and first or last author on several less-cited papers, their h-index will be high, but their Sh-index will be low, which could give a more accurate picture of their work. “Overall, productivity-wise, contributions of such authors are mostly collaborative in nature, where they often support large teams but seldom lead small or big projects,” says Sharma.\n\nA high h-index and low Sh-index could also help to identify individuals who might be engaging in unethical practices, such as gift or paid authorship — in which researchers become authors of papers without actually contributing to the work.\n\nCapturing the nuance\n\nFair credit for contributions is a major challenge in academic publishing. In a 2022 survey of around 47,000 researchers across Europe, just under 70% said they’d worked on projects for which some authors hadn’t contributed enough to deserve credit.\n\nAlberto Martín-Martín, an information scientist and bibliometrician at the University of Granada in Spain, says that he is sympathetic to the aims of GScholarLens. But he adds that he is not sure that the tool achieves its goal of making Google Scholar data more useful for research evaluation.\n\nSimply assigning different weights to study authors isn’t enough to capture the nuances of their contributions, says Martín-Martín, because authorship positions themselves aren’t perfect representations of contributions. For example, two researchers might perform the same task in different projects, and one could be assigned a second-author position whereas the other becomes one of the co-authors. He also notes that GScholarLens wrongly assumes that corresponding authors are always last in author lists, which is often not the case.",

          "abstract": "AI’s inclination to be helpful affects many of the tasks that researchers use LLMs for.Credit: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) models are 50% more sycophantic than humans, an analysis published this month has found.\n\nThe study, which was posted as a preprint1 on the arXiv server, tested how 11 widely used large language models (LLMs) responded to more than 11,500 queries seeking advice, including many describing wrongdoing or harm.\n\nAI Chatbots — including ChatGPT and Gemini — often cheer users on, give them overly flattering feedback and adjust responses to echo their views, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. Researchers analysing AI behaviours say that this propensity for people-pleasing, known as sycophancy, is affecting how they use AI in scientific research, in tasks from brainstorming ideas and generating hypotheses to reasoning and analyses.\n\n“Sycophancy essentially means that the model trusts the user to say correct things,” says Jasper Dekoninck, a data science PhD student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. “Knowing that these models are sycophantic makes me very wary whenever I give them some problem,” he adds. “I always double-check everything that they write.”\n\nMarinka Zitnik, a researcher in biomedical informatics at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, says that AI sycophancy “is very risky in the context of biology and medicine, when wrong assumptions can have real costs”.\n\nPeople pleasers\n\nIn a study posted on the preprint server arXiv on 6 October2, Dekoninck and his colleagues tested whether AI sycophancy affects the technology’s performance in solving mathematical problems. The researchers designed experiments using 504 mathematical problems from competitions held this year, altering each theorem statement to introduce subtle errors. They then asked four LLMs to provide proofs for these flawed statements.\n\nThe authors considered a model’s answer to be sycophantic if it failed to detect the errors in a statement and went on to hallucinate a proof for it.\n\nGPT-5 showed the least sycophantic behaviour, generating sycophantic answers 29% of the time. DeepSeek-V3.1 was the most sycophantic, generating sycophantic answers 70% of the time. Although the LLMs have the capability to spot the errors in the mathematical statements, they “just assumed what the user says is correct”, says Dekoninck.\n\nAI chatbots are already biasing research — we must establish guidelines for their use now\n\nWhen Dekoninck and his team changed the prompts to ask each LLM to check whether a statement was correct before proving it, DeepSeek’s sycophantic answers fell by 34%.\n\nThe study is “not really indicative of how these systems are used in real-world performance, but it gives an indication that we need to be very careful with this”, says Dekoninck.\n\nSimon Frieder, a PhD student studying mathematics and computer science at the University of Oxford, UK, says the work “shows that sycophancy is possible”. But he adds that AI sycophancy tends to appear most clearly when people are using AI chatbots to learn, so future studies should explore “errors that are typical for humans that learn math”.\n\nUnreliable assistance\n\nResearchers told Nature that AI sycophancy creeps into many of the tasks that they use LLMs for.\n\nYanjun Gao, an AI researcher at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, uses ChatGPT to summarize papers and organize her thoughts, but says the tools sometimes mirror her inputs without checking the sources. “When I have a different opinion than what the LLM has said, it follows what I said instead of going back to the literature” to try to understand it, she adds.\n\nZitnik and her colleagues have observed similar patterns when using their multi-agent systems, which integrate several LLMs to carry out complex, multi-step processes such as analysing large biological data sets, identifying drug targets and generating hypotheses.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide",

An immune-based therapy was more effective against this cancer in people who received an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine within 100 days of the start of their cancer treatment.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/SPL\n\nA vaccine that helps to fight cancer might already exist. People being treated for certain deadly cancers lived longer if they had received an mRNA-based vaccine against COVID-19 than if they hadn’t, finds an analysis of medical records.\n\nFollow-up experiments in mice show that the vaccines have this apparent life-extending effect not because they protect against COVID-19 but because they rev up the body’s immune system1. That response increases the effectiveness of therapies called checkpoint inhibitors, the animal data suggest.\n\n“The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine acts like a siren and activates the immune system throughout the entire body”, including inside the tumour, where it “starts programming a response to kill the cancer”, says Adam Grippin, a radiation oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, an co-author of the report published today in Nature. “We were amazed at the results in our patients.”\n\nThe findings, which Grippin and his colleagues hope to validate in a clinical trial, suggest further hidden capabilities of mRNA vaccines, even as the administration of US President Donald Trump has slashed about US$500 million in funding for research investigating the technology.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services, which cancelled the funding for mRNA research, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWorking in tandem\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors unleash the immune system to attack cancer cells. They have transformed the treatment of many cancers, but they fail in more than half of the people who receive them: some recipients’ immune systems remain too sluggish to attack cancer cells.\n\nTo address this gap, researchers have been developing personalized ‘cancer vaccines’. These would be used in tandem with checkpoint inhibitors to help an individual’s immune system to target the unique mutations found in their cancer cells. Although early results are promising, these treatments are still experimental and, once available, will probably be very expensive and difficult to access.\n\nInfographic: How does a cancer vaccine work?\n\nGrippin and his colleagues wondered whether the general immune boost that mRNA vaccines create could be enough to wake up the immune system. They found support for this theory in mice2, leading them to investigate whether the effect would carry over into people.\n\nThe researchers analysed the medical records of more than 1,000 people with lung cancer or melanoma. They found that, in people with a certain type of lung cancer, receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was linked to a near doubling in survival time, from 21 months to 37 months. Unvaccinated people with metastatic melanoma survived an average of 27 months; by the time data collection ended, vaccinated people had survived so long that the researchers couldn’t calculate an average survival time. People whose tumours had traits hinting that they were unlikely to respond to checkpoint inhibitors saw the biggest survival boost after vaccination.\n\nThis finding is “quite impressive”, says Benoit Van den Eynde, a tumour immunologist at the University of Oxford, UK. “I did not expect the effect to be that significant, and the data are very strong.”\n\nWindow of opportunity\n\nTiming matters: those who had received the jab within 100 days of starting treatment were more likely to benefit than were those who received it outside that window. Grippin has collected data, which are yet to be published, suggesting that receiving the vaccine within a 30-day window before or after treatment could elicit an even stronger boost, he says.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Li Jin/VCG via Getty\n\nJust as many of us are struck by the beauty of symmetrical patterns in nature and art, Chen-Ning Yang had a deep feeling for beauty and the role of symmetry in physics. It was work on a breakdown of symmetry that brought Yang fame. In 1956, he and theorist Tsung-Dao Lee dared to propose that there is a fundamental difference between left and right in the realm of physics. They predicted that the results of experiments in the real world and in a mirror one could sometimes be different. Experiments in subatomic physics soon confirmed this theory and, in 1957, the pair was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, making them the first Chinese-born Nobel laureates.\n\nYang’s work in theoretical physics spanned more than six decades, both in his native China and in the United States, where he lived for nearly 60 years. Proud of his Chinese heritage and grateful to the United States for enabling him to realize his potential, Yang was ultimately able to promote scientific cooperation between the two countries. He has died aged 103.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nYang’s interest in the role of symmetry in physics and chemistry began during his childhood in China. His father, who had a PhD from the University of Chicago, Illinois, was professor of mathematics at Tsinghua University in Beijing and introduced his son to the maths of symmetry. After war broke out between China and Japan in 1937, the family settled in Kunming in southwestern China, to where people working at Tsinghua and other universities in Beijing had been evacuated and where the institutions had merged temporarily.\n\nYang gained a bachelor’s from this amalgamated university, working on symmetry in molecules. A fellowship from Tsinghua then gave him the opportunity in 1945 to leave China and follow in his father’s footsteps to the University of Chicago, drawn by the reputation of nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi, winner of the 1938 physics Nobel prize. In particular, he appreciated how Fermi’s theoretical work was guided by observations in physics.\n\nThis was a trait that Yang followed throughout his own research, as he moved from Chicago to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Indeed, it was a puzzle in the physics of unstable subatomic particles discovered in cosmic radiation that set Yang and Lee, who had first worked together at Chicago, on the road to their Nobel prize.\n\nWhy bad philosophy is stopping progress in physics",

The approach has had success, identifying drugs that kill cancer cells, for example.\n\nIncreasingly, researchers are dreaming of more complex screening methods that could harness the past decade’s explosion in genomic data collected from individual cells. Such methods could, in theory, evaluate how compounds perturb entire networks of gene activity — a test that could open new avenues for drug discovery.\n\nBut, researchers typically screen tens of thousands of compounds or more for drug discovery, says Alex Shalek, a biomedical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. And it would be too expensive and laborious to integrate such large screens with complex assays, he says.\n\nPowerful antibiotics discovered using AI\n\nTo find a tractable way of harnessing newly available genomic data, Shalek teamed up with other researchers and Cellarity, a biotechnology company in Somerville, Massachusetts. (Shalek is also a paid consultant for the company.) Together, the team trained a deep-learning model called DrugReflector on publicly available data about how each of nearly 9,600 chemical compounds perturbs gene activity in more than 50 kinds of cells.\n\nThey used DrugReflector to find chemicals that can affect the generation of platelets and red blood cells — a characteristic that could be useful in treating some blood conditions. They then tested 107 of these chemicals to determine whether they had the predicted effect.\n\nOverall, the team found that DrugReflector was up to 17 times more effective at finding relevant compounds than standard, brute-force drug screening that depends on randomly selecting compounds from a chemical library. And when the researchers circled back to incorporate the data from their first round of screening into the model, its success rate doubled.",

          "authors": "Beth Woods",
          "abstract": "Each year, more than nine million people in the United States do not take their medicines as prescribed owing to cost concerns. People there pay up to four times as much for new medicines as do individuals in other high-income countries.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced a deal with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on 30 September, aimed at improving the affordability of drugs for people in the country. This is the first concrete step under Trump’s ‘most-favoured nation’ policy, which intends to align US medicine prices to those in other wealthy countries. But it is unlikely to deliver the promised reductions in drug costs, and the knock-on effects could adversely affect public health globally.\n\nAs part of the deal, some of Pfizer’s drugs will be offered in the United States through a direct-to-consumer website, referred to as TrumpRx, that is expected to launch in 2026 — cutting out intermediaries and securing lower prices.\n\nYet this probably won’t benefit the 92% of people with health insurance, who would be better off receiving medicines through their plans. And those who can’t afford insurance probably won’t be able to pay for expensive drugs either. For example, even with the agreed discount, Pfizer’s anti-inflammatory drug tofacitinib (sold under the brand name Xeljanz) will cost about US$3,600 a month.\n\nClaims that the deal will lower prices paid by Medicaid — a government programme providing health insurance to people with limited incomes and resources — have also been met with scepticism, because there is no evidence that it will improve on existing discounts. And from a financial perspective, the deal is not expected to affect pharmaceutical companies substantially. Pfizer’s stock price rose by nearly 15% in the five trading days after the announcement.\n\nTrump’s wider aim is to stop the ‘global freeloading’ of other high-income countries that, he says, benefit from low prices while accessing innovative drugs, the development of which has been funded mainly by US consumers. He argues that lowering prices in the United States and raising them elsewhere would be fairer and preserve industry revenues to support investments in research and development (R&D). But other wealthy nations shouldn’t be expected to make up for any shortfall in US industry revenues.\n\nDirectly linking what the US population pays to prices in other high-income countries, as proposed by Trump’s policy, might not be effective. Given the importance of the US market to the drug industry, strategies exist to avoid prices in other nations influencing those in the United States — private non-transparent agreements between pharmaceutical companies and health systems, for example. Firms could also decide not to sell their products in some countries to protect US revenues.\n\nIt is too early to gauge how effective the Trump administration’s mix of diplomatic pressure and tariff threats will be in persuading other governments to accept higher drug prices. But if the United States is even partially successful, the increased medical bill for other wealthy nations could severely compromise their ability to fund broader health priorities, not just new drugs. And the idea that such higher prices would be fair is misplaced. In England, for example, the population is already paying too much for medicines despite relatively stringent price regulations.\n\nInstead, to reduce drug costs, the United States must develop its own mechanism for price regulation. It could, for example, use approaches that directly tie drug prices to rigorous value assessments, such as those undertaken by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an independent non-profit organization in Boston, Massachusetts. This would require the Trump administration to engage with the complexity of the US market, in which high costs reflect a complex web of intermediaries and legal barriers to price negotiation. For example, despite reforms, Medicare — the US health-insurance programme for people aged 65 years and older — is allowed to negotiate drug prices for only a limited number of expensive drugs.",

          "abstract": "When civet cats eat coffee beans, they excrete them in clumps (shown) that can later be processed to make a pricey drink.Credit: Faiz Dila/Getty\n\nIt has been described as nutty, chocolatey, earthy and even fishy: a wildly expensive coffee that can sell for more than 100 times the price of regular brews, made from beans eaten and excreted by civet ‘cats’.\n\nScientists have long wondered what lies behind civet coffee’s unique flavour. A team now says that the digested beans contain high levels of two compounds commonly used as flavouring agents in dairy products — and these might contribute to the coffee’s distinctive taste1.\n\nWhy chocolate tastes so good: microbes that fine-tune its flavour\n\nCivet coffee is produced across Asia. Called Kopi Luwak in its origin country of Indonesia, it grabbed international attention after being featured in the 2007 film The Bucket List. Asian palm civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) eat the fruit or cherries of coffee shrubs, and the seeds (commonly called beans) can be picked from their scat. These are then roasted to make coffee with a unique flavour; the resulting beans can cost more than US$1,300 per kilogram, and the coffee up to $75 per cup.\n\nThese high prices drive civet-coffee tourism and incentivize farms that use caged civets to produce the brew. Several groups, including the UK-based charity The Civet Project, have highlighted serious animal-welfare concerns around these farms, noting that they might also foster viruses with the potential to cause pandemics.\n\nZoologist Palatty Allesh Sinu at the Central University of Kerala in India, and ecologist colleagues took a close look at the beans picked from civet poo across the Indian district of Kodagu, where the civets are wild. The team undertook the study not only to get a better handle on what makes civet coffee tasty, but also to promote animal welfare. “Once we know the enzymes involved in digestion and fermentation, we may be able to artificially make civet coffee” and leave the animals out of it, Sinu says.\n\nCoffee chemistry\n\nPrevious research has focused on what gives civet coffee its sought-after flavour, as well as how best to tell the real thing from fraudulent products. A 2004 study found civet-processed beans to be pitted and brittle from exposure to gastric juices2. And a 2019 paper found that roasted civet beans are lower in protein and higher in fat than are regular roasted beans3.\n\nThe latest work, published today in Scientific Reports1, compares unroasted coffee beans harvested from 68 civet scat samples with those picked straight from the plant, to see what the civets’ digestive systems do to the beans.\n\nAn Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus).Credit: Fletcher & Baylis/Science Photo Library",

Credit: Amirhossein Rashidi (AHR shots)\n\nWhen the National Astronomy Meeting, organized by the UK Royal Astronomical Society, descended on Durham University in July, Martina Veresvarska saw the gathering as an opportunity not just to talk shop, but also to indulge her baking hobby. The annual conference, usually held in the British Isles, is one of the largest of its kind in Europe.\n\nVeresvarska is a PhD candidate at the UK university’s Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy and a co-founder of the astronomy department’s charity bake-sale organization, Cakes for Good. At this year’s conference, Veresvarska and fellow astronomy PhD student Ciera Sargent ran their largest bake sale so far, helped by ten volunteer bakers from the department. During an organized coffee break at the meeting, the team catered for nearly 1,000 attendees and raised roughly £450 (a little over US$600) in just 30 minutes for the Great North Air Ambulance Service.\n\nCakes for Good is just one example of scientists coming together not only to foster community in their own departments, but also to raise money for charitable causes. For some, these efforts represent a small but powerful way to make a difference in their communities when their busy schedules or financial situations might otherwise prevent it.\n\nBuilding community\n\nVeresvarska arrived at Durham as a new PhD student in September 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Making connections with other students or faculty members proved difficult, even after lockdowns began to lift and the world started to open up again, she says.\n\nTo help rebuild a sense of community in the department, Veresvarska and her co-founders started Cakes for Good in April 2022. Instead of baking for the department and accepting money to cover the cost of ingredients, as had been done in the past, the Cakes for Good team decided to donate any money raised to charity.\n\n“We thought that letting others [in the department] decide what charities this should go to might be a good way to get people involved and interested,” Veresvarska says.\n\nCakes for Good ran its first charity bake sale in May 2022 to support humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Since then, it has run monthly bake sales throughout the academic year to support global causes such as Medical Aid for Palestinians and support for schoolgirls in rural Kenya. It has also donated money from the sales to local charities supporting transgender youth, refugees and asylum seekers and environmental conservation. Each sale earns about £180–200, and Cakes for Good has raised roughly £4,555 for charity since 2022.\n\nCakes for Good bake sales organized by astronomers at Durham University, UK, have raised thousands of pounds for range of charities.Credit: Cakes for Good\n\nAnything chocolate is usually a big seller, Veresvarska says. The only complaint has been that some of the baked goods are just too good, she jokes, adding: “I had someone tell me in January that it’s unfair that we hold the bake sale outside their door, because they’re on a diet.”\n\nWorking to develop community is also at the heart of a biannual bake sale run by the Chemistry Graduate Students Society (CGSS) at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, in collaboration with undergraduate chemistry clubs. Its first bake sale, in 2023, raised funds during Pride Month for a local organization, Spectrum, that offers a gathering place, as well as mental-health resources, for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nOf the society’s two bake sales each year, the first raises funds for Spectrum, the second for another local charity, such as the Women’s Crisis Services of Waterloo Region. The organizers say that, at each event, they raise roughly Can$500–800 (US$360–580). Cookies — chocolate chip, matcha or snickerdoodle, which are rolled with cinnamon and sugar before baking — are usually a big hit (see ‘University of Waterloo’s idiot-proof cookies for scientists’), along with loaf cakes such as banana bread, says Madison Donohoe, a PhD student and co-president of the CGSS.\n\nAt the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada, the CGSS runs a charity bake sale three times a year. For an entrance fee of just Can$2, staff, faculty members and students in the department can take as many baked goods as they like, usually from a selection of up to ten options.\n\nLucas Andrew, a chemistry PhD student and CGSS president at the UBC, says that queues often form about 20 minutes before the charity bakes appear. Recent treats have included matcha cheesecake and butter mochi, a cake made with coconut milk and glutinous rice flour that originated in Hawaii. At each event, the group raises Can$100–200 for local charities. Among these are the PHS Community Services Society, which provides housing and health-care services to vulnerable people in Vancouver, and RAVEN, which supports local Indigenous communities.\n\nChemistry graduates at the University of British Columbia in Canada run charity bake sales three times a year.Credit: Amirhossein Rashidi (AHR shots)\n\n“As grad students, we don’t generally have a lot of disposable income,” Andrew says. “You may not be able to often donate on your own to a charity, but the fact that we can come together as this community and contribute to these local initiatives is really, really nice.”\n\nTips for success\n\nIf you’d like to start your own charity bake sale, these bakers have some words of wisdom to share.\n\nGo where the people are. Attract customers by hosting bake sales at busy times and locations. For the University of Waterloo’s bake sale, this means between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the atrium of the Science Teaching Complex, where a lot of hungry students will be on a break from class, says Emily Wedde, co-president of the CGSS.",

But the fourth-year university student faces a cosmic challenge in reaching the next stage of her academic career: enrolling in a PhD programme.\n\nPreliminary survey data show that dozens of US graduate programmes in astronomy and physics are planning to admit smaller PhD cohorts than usual for the next academic year — or even no graduate students at all. To compensate, Sarían, who is studying astronomy at Ohio State University in Columbus, is applying to more graduate schools than she’d originally planned, perhaps as many as 20.\n\nSarían is far from alone in her predicament. Across scientific disciplines, US university departments are cutting the numbers of PhD candidates they plan to accept in the current application cycle, for students due to begin in 2026. Some plan to pause admissions altogether. Programmes “in even some of the most elite among elite institutions are taking this step out of an abundance of caution”, says Julie Posselt at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, who studies higher education. Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for instance, is significantly cutting PhD admissions across a swathe of departments ― and cutting admissions in at least one science department by roughly 75%, according to a 20 October story in the student newspaper The Harvard Crimson.\n\nThese nations are wooing PhD students amid US funding uncertainties\n\nThe cutbacks are being driven by several factors, including institutional decisions about which research fields to support. But the reductions are due in large part to the US political environment, researchers say. Since Donald Trump became president in January, his administration has frozen billions of dollars in research funding at targeted institutions, including Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and Harvard; although some of this has been reinstated, large deficits and uncertainties remain. The administration has also proposed massive cuts in federal support for research infrastructure. Trump’s administration is now asking all US universities to support its priorities, which include a ban on diversity programmes, in exchange for better access to federal research monies.\n\nMany researchers worry about the long-term effects of throttling the pipeline of trained scientists. “If this keeps up, it would be really devastating for the field, because this is where the next generation of experts comes from,” says Emily Levesque, an astronomer at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nNature asked the US Department of Education for comment, and received an automated reply saying the press office would not respond to queries until after the ongoing US government shutdown ends.\n\nThe turmoil continues\n\nEarlier this year, many university departments slashed their incoming PhD classes in a last-minute scramble as the Trump administration began cutting research funds. Now they are trying to work out how many students they can accommodate in an uncertain future.\n\nFew universities have revealed details of their graduate admissions plans for the 2026–27 academic year. But several grassroots surveys hint that broad cutbacks are in the works across both US institutions and research disciplines.\n\nLevesque and her colleagues surveyed more than 150 US astronomy and physics graduate programmes, and found that at least 33 of the 91 respondents planned to admit fewer or no graduate students for the academic year starting in the second half of 2026.\n\nMeet the early-career scientists planning to leave the United States\n\nMeanwhile, 40 of the 45 biology departments that responded to a separate survey — sent to roughly 80 biology programmes — said that they had already shrunk their anticipated PhD cohorts for the 2026–27 academic year or planned to do so. Kimberly Cooper, a developmental biologist at the University of California, San Diego, instituted the survey to share information between those responsible for admitting PhD students. “We were having all these conversations about what we do, and making the decisions, all in isolation,” she says. The response was so overwhelming that departmental representatives now meet in a monthly video call to share their experiences.",

          "authors": "Frank A. F. Winiberg, Laura Kreidberg, Julianne I. Moses, Carl J. Percival, Paul I. Palmer",
          "abstract": "In the 30 years since exoplanets were first reported1, telescopes have revealed thousands of them. One of the most surprising things about these objects, which orbit stars other than our Sun, has been their diversity: they range from scorching lava planets with atmospheres of vaporized rock to ocean worlds, and some might even look like Earth.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which was launched in 2021, has been revolutionizing our understanding of the atmospheres of these planets, showing details of clouds and haze that were previously unfathomable2. Scientists are starting to learn how winds and turbulence transport compounds on worlds beyond the Solar System3, and are seeing chemical processes that are unlike those found on Earth4.\n\nThis glowing speck is a freezing exoplanet six times the size of Jupiter\n\nSuch insights promise to tell us more about how planets form — and perhaps the origins of life. But many of the findings, such as hints of unfamiliar compounds, are proving challenging to understand.\n\nThe space-science community needs help from scientists in other fields to find answers. Here, we call for closer collaborations between exoplanet researchers and those who work on Earth’s and other planetary atmospheres, as well as stronger links between experimentalists, modellers and astronomers.\n\nFocus on photochemistry\n\nTo understand the molecules and processes at play in exoplanet atmospheres, it is crucial to consider photochemistry — chemical reactions driven by high-energy light from nearby stars. One of JWST’s first observations was of WASP-39 b, a hot and puffy gas giant the size of Jupiter, orbiting a Sun-like star some 215 parsecs (700 light years) away. The electromagnetic spectrum of its atmosphere revealed clear signatures of molecules that astronomers expected to find on such a planet — including carbon dioxide and water. But an unfamiliar opaque region at a wavelength near 4 micrometres puzzled them.\n\nBecause the data set was open source, hundreds of astronomers came together in 2022 in a frenzied collaboration, hosted on the messaging platform Slack, to identify the chemical species responsible for that opaque region. Scores of possibilities were tested before it became clear that it was sulfur dioxide. This was surprising, in that this compound should be rare in hydrogen-dominated gas giants5. Only one process was found to generate sulfur dioxide in high enough concentrations: photochemistry.\n\nSimilar mysteries will present themselves in the future. Modellers, working closely with theoretical and experimental chemists, must improve the photochemical models used to interpret these data accurately. Crucially, there is a lack of comprehensive data on how reaction rates and absorption cross-sections change with temperature and pressure for these exotic atmospheres, as well as a lack of data for molecules that are unfamiliar to our Earth-centric experience.\n\nThe 18-segment gold mirror of the James Webb Space Telescope. Credit: Desiree Stover/NASA\nMake models go further\n\nDetecting a particular molecule in an atmosphere is insufficient to deduce how it was formed. It could have been transported up from deep in the planet’s interior, or many compounds and chemical pathways could have led to its presence, possibly through reaction pathways different from those of the Solar System. But current models are anchored in the physics and chemistry of processes happening on planets local to us, from the gas giants to rocky terrestrials. The models might therefore be misrepresenting, or entirely missing, some chemical or physical processes at play in exoplanet atmospheres.\n\nPhysical factors that need to be better represented in models include the transport and exchange of molecules between a planet’s atmosphere and its surface or interior. The way in which a planet rotates — about its axis and around its host star — can affect its atmospheric chemistry. Some exoplanets, for example, orbit their host star in such a way that only one side is ever illuminated, resulting in a permanent, hot dayside and a permanent, cold nightside. This gives a very different distribution of gases to what is found on Earth. Better numerical models will improve the global framework that describes the physical movement and observable composition of these atmospheres.\n\nJWST’s best images: spectacular stars and spiralling galaxies\n\nAnother cornerstone of models are photochemical parameters, and these also need a careful look. They represent how molecules respond to incoming stellar radiation and how they react with each other — through which reactions, and how fast. To make things more complicated, these parameters can change with pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. The atmospheric environments of currently observed exoplanets diverge from those of planets in the Solar System, and therefore models must simulate a vast range of temperatures, pressures and chemical conditions. This means measuring or calculating parameters that will represent more accurately what happens in exoplanet atmospheres. Reaction parameters are ideally calculated from reaction rates that have been measured in laboratory experiments under conditions relevant to the planet of interest, or from theoretical simulations based on quantum mechanical first principles. However, there are known reactions that lack parameters (and therefore models often use best guesses), and probably a slew of reactions that have yet to be discovered.\n\nHere, we propose two pathways — experimental and theoretical — to expand the catalogue of reactions and their parameters specifically for exoplanets.\n\nExpand interdisciplinary research\n\nMost lab-based research into exoplanet atmospheres has focused on the light-absorption signatures of specific gases such as titanium oxide and phosphine6, or on haze particles, suspended in gas, that are produced from a variety of compounds and can affect the propagation of stellar radiation. Current experiments are conducted in chambers that can replicate the range of observed exoplanet atmospheric temperatures, pressures and chemical compositions, using lamps or plasma to simulate stellar radiation, stellar flares or lightning7.\n\nThese studies show the diversity and complexity of chemical products that can be generated from very simple exoplanet analogue atmospheres, and they provide optical parameters to help interpret observations. But photochemical models are used to predict the chemical make-up of atmospheres by leveraging entire reaction networks — sets of hundreds to thousands of individual reactions that connect different molecules to each other. The current lab studies have not provided the quantitative information needed to develop reaction networks for exoplanets.\n\nAnimation of the rotation of L 98-59 b, a terrestrial exoplanet orbiting a small, low-mass star.\n\nTo build up this capability, the exoplanet community must first identify the lab technologies required for the measurements they need, and there has already been significant progress8,9. To study reaction parameters, for example, scientists must ideally examine specific molecules as they react, and the products that they form.\n\nEquipment from labs that specialize in Earth-based atmospheric chemistry and combustion can be repurposed to some extent. Using combustion-science reactors and shock tubes, together with spectroscopic or mass-spectrometric detection techniques, would immediately widen the ranges of pressures and temperatures that can be studied. And rather than oxygen, which is abundant in Earth’s atmosphere, these techniques can be tuned to study species such as sulfur compounds and methane behave, which might be more abundant elsewhere. Similarly, expanding the user community of Earth-science labs to include exoplanet scientists would help to maximize the scientific return on this expensive infrastructure. In the longer term, however, exoplanet research needs dedicated facilities.\n\nJWST reveals first evidence of an exoplanet’s surprising chemistry\n\nNew techniques will also be required to measure exotic target molecules or particles specifically for exoplanets. The science will be shaped by, for example, the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory, which will focus on ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation, or the mid-infrared Large Interferometer for Exoplanets. These complementary space-based telescope concepts will help to provide the improved observational data needed to test and constrain the chemical and physical models of exoplanet atmospheres. This has been the case in other fields, for example, with the ion-imaging technique created at Sandia National Laboratories’ Combustion Research Facility in Livermore, California10. The technique records the velocity of charged particles that result from a molecule being broken apart by light or in a collision, and was originally developed to advance our knowledge of combustion. Future observations could motivate similar technological developments that will provide precise, molecular-level parameters to inform reaction networks used in the photochemical models of exoplanet science. What’s more, the development of technologies for exoplanet research would ultimately benefit the Earth-science and combustion-science communities, too.\n\nUse first principles\n\nThere are, however, reactions and molecules that are too difficult or dangerous to probe experimentally, even in lab settings. The extreme high and low pressures of exoplanet atmospheres, or reactions that are very slow, can be hard to study owing to the limitations of the instruments used. For slow reactions, minute changes in molecular concentration can be smaller than the random noise in the instrumentation; at low pressures, molecular densities might be below the detection limit.\n\nIn such cases, chemists can apply theoretical tools to calculate key parameters over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. With increasing computer power and the integration of artificial intelligence, such calculations are rapidly improving in terms of accuracy and efficiency11. Yet, reactions that involve large molecules or heavy atoms remain hard to predict accurately.",

          "abstract": "When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows...: Common Knowledge and the Science of Harmony, Hypocrisy and Outrage Steven Pinker Allen Lane (2025)\n\nHow do we know when others know what we know? Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker’s latest book, When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows, delves into how ‘common knowledge’ can cement or explode social relations.\n\nCommon knowledge — awareness of mutual understanding — can explain the emergence of social-media shaming mobs, academic cancel culture and revolutions that seem to erupt from nowhere. It drives how people coordinate with others and can explain everything from awkward first-date conversations to financial bubbles and stock-market crashes.\n\nPinker tells Nature why it helps to better understand the ways we get into each other’s heads — and what happens when we know that we have.\n\nWhat is common knowledge?\n\nIt is the state in which I know something, you know it, I know that you know it, you know that I know it, I know that you know that I know that you know it, and so on, ad infinitum. It differs from private knowledge, in which someone knows something without knowing whether anyone knows they know it.\n\nSupportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health\n\nThat’s a lot of ‘knowing’!\n\nCommon knowledge is usually tacit, and it can be generated at a stroke when we witness something that is conspicuous, public or self-evident — I see something while seeing you see it, and vice versa. From there, we can deduce that each observer knows that the other knows it, and so on, to as many levels as we care to reel out — a process that cognitive psychologists call recursive mentalizing.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nCommon knowledge is necessary for coordination: two or more people making arbitrary choices that benefit them, as long as they make the same choice. A classic example is a rendezvous. It’s not enough to know that your friend likes to go to Starbucks and so to head there, because he might know that you like to go to Pret A Manger and head there. It’s not even enough to know that he knows that you know that he likes Starbucks, and head there, because he knows that you know that he knows that you like Pret, which is where he might go.\n\nNothing short of common knowledge will get you to the same place at the same time. The obvious means of achieving this is a phone call, because direct speech is an excellent common-knowledge generator. The next best thing is common salience. The friends might gravitate to a nearby landmark, such as Nelson’s Column in London’s Trafalgar Square, because each can anticipate that it would pop into the mind of the other.\n\nWhat other examples are there?\n\nOur conventions depend on common knowledge, starting with language. The word ‘rose’ refers to a rose for no reason other than that everyone knows that everyone knows it does. Another convention is driving on the left rather than the right, or vice versa: there’s no reason to choose one side or the other, but every reason to choose the same side as everyone else. This convention is backed up by law, but that doesn’t matter: people have an incentive to follow the convention as long as they know that everyone else is following it.\n\nHow to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI\n\nEven legally binding conventions depend more on common knowledge than on enforcement, because no government has enough snitches and rooftop snipers to enforce every law. When ‘no smoking’ signs were first put up, people didn’t report violators to the smoking police, but they could stand their ground when asking a smoker to stop and expect them to give way, because the smoker expected the complainant to stand their ground.\n\nThis is also how we can have social and moral norms, such as not telling ethnic jokes, revealing certain body parts in public or insulting someone’s looks. The norms can persist by the common expectation that everyone knows that everyone knows there are certain things decent people just don’t do.\n\nHow can common knowledge fail?\n\nWhen there’s a public signal that a belief might no longer be commonly held, the doubt can be self-fulfilling. In a bank run, a rumour that the bank might not have enough reserves to cover withdrawals can drive people to withdraw their savings out of fear that other people are withdrawing theirs out of the same fear. That can crash the bank, and, as the doubts reverberate, the economy.\n\nWhen then-US president Franklin D. Roosevelt said in 1933, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself”, he was expressing a theorem of common knowledge. Other runaway phenomena, such as financial bubbles or hyperinflation — or even the hoarding of toilet paper during a pandemic — are also driven by common expectation.\n\nThese are old ideas, so why write the book?\n\nI was led into the study of common knowledge by my interest in language. A lot of speech can’t be interpreted at face value. For example, “If you could pass the salt, that would be brilliant” has a veiled imperative meaning: “Give me the salt.” I wanted to know why we don’t all just say what we mean.\n\nCommon knowledge is what aligns us in social relationships. Our rituals of ignoring the elephant in the room, not blurting out everything we think, framing criticism tactfully, and other exercises of social skill consist of judgements of whether to make some fact common knowledge or whether to avoid doing so.\n\nHow to end outrage and detoxify politics: share stories, not statistics\n\nDo you include any fresh ideas?\n\nI advance a hypothesis — which has driven my research over the past 15 years — that social relationships (such as friendship, romance, authority and transactional partnerships) are coordination games, ratified by common knowledge signals such as eye contact, laughter, dominance displays and direct speech.\n\nAnd I address the cognitive question of what goes on in people’s heads when they have common knowledge, given that multiple nested propositions about beliefs are cognitively strenuous.",

          "authors": "Gemma Conroy",
          "abstract": "A magnified image of a brain organoid with fluorescent labelling of various cell types.Credit: Thomas Hartung, Johns Hopkins University\n\nAdvanced tools and techniques are giving researchers a detailed look at the body’s defence system. From spotting single cells in action to improving or replacing animal models, the methods described below are helping immunologists to push the boundaries of their work in 2025.\n\nTHX mice: mouse on the outside, human on the inside\n\nSince the first mouse models with human cells and tissues were developed more than 40 years ago, they’ve become much better at mimicking the human immune system. But they’re still nowhere near accurate enough.\n\nOne major issue is that mice have more than 1,600 immune-response genes that do not match their human equivalents. And most ‘humanized’ mice (which have human genes, cells or tissues) don’t mount enough antibodies to fight infections, which is a problem for researchers who study vaccines and immune responses, says Paolo Casali, an immunologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. “They are not useful at all,” he says.\n\nNature Index 2025 Immunology\n\nA team led by Casali and his former graduate student Daniel Chupp, now an immunologist at Massachusetts biotechnology company Invivyd, has been trying to overcome this hurdle for decades, and their efforts are beginning to pay off. In a paper published last year1, the team introduced THX, a mouse model that replicates the human immune system.\n\nTo create THX, mice are injected with human stem cells that develop into immune components such as lymph nodes, antibodies and T and B cells (types of white blood cells). When given an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, they mounted a strong immune response — an important trait for vaccine research.\n\nTHX mice have caught the eye of several research groups in the United States and Europe. “I get e-mails almost every day,” says Casali. Among those groups is one led by James Voss, an immunologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, who plans to use the mice to advance his work on targeted HIV therapies. Voss and his team have used CRISPR gene-editing to reprogram human B cells to produce antibodies that can recognize and block many different strains of HIV. And although existing humanized mouse models have B cells, they fail to mount a strong enough antibody response, creating what Voss calls a “developmental block”. THX mice overcome this limitation, opening a new path for his research.\n\nOnce they reach the market, THX mice are expected to be relatively cheap and less labour-intensive to produce than other mouse models. This is because they don’t require complicated tissue engraftments, says Voss, who hopes to start using them in the coming months. “I’m very excited. I think this will be a real game-changer.”\n\nDifferent variants of the THX mouse model, which replicates the human immune system.Credit: Daniel Chupp (left); Carlos E. Rivera (Right)\nOrgan-on-chip and organoid systems: move over, mice\n\nSome researchers are doing away with animal models altogether by creating miniature versions of human organs and tissues. These systems, which include organ-on-chip platforms and organoid systems (cell cultures that mimic organ functions), are providing snapshots of the human gut, liver, lung and other organs in both sickness and health.\n\nIt’s a tantalizing prospect for drug development, because these systems could provide a more accurate model of human biology than animal models, says Thomas Hartung, a pharmacologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He adds that many drugs that have been approved over the past decade are based on human proteins and antibodies. “It makes no sense to test them in animal models.”\n\nTiny organ models are also helping researchers to better understand how systems in the body interact with each other and respond to disease. Linda Griffith, a bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and her colleagues have developed a model of the human gut to study how the organ’s microbes interact with immune cells and regulate inflammation. They have also created models for endometriosis and pancreatic cancer.\n\nBuilding systems like these — and trying to reproduce them — is difficult, and not something that many labs are able to do, says Griffith. She adds that scaling them up for mass production is also very complicated, because it requires intensive quality-control measures.\n\nDespite these hurdles, organ and tissue microsystems are likely to become more common in labs, at least in the United States. In July, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that it will no longer offer new funding to projects that rely solely on animal models to study human disease. Instead, the NIH will prioritize studies that use human-based technologies, including organ-on-chip and organoid systems.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced similar plans this year to phase out animal testing in favour of human cell cultures and organoids for drug safety trials. The FDA’s roadmap noted that animal models have been poor predictors of drug success for many common diseases, from cancer to Alzheimer’s. Some compounds that seemed safe in animal models have been lethal in humans, according to the regulator. “They’re telling us very clearly this is what the future looks like,” says Hartung.\n\nScRNA-seq: levelling up single-cell sequencing\n\nFew techniques have helped researchers to unravel the mysteries of the immune system quite like single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) — a method to determine which genes are being transcribed into the RNA of individual cells. Introduced in the late 2000s, scRNA-seq has rapidly evolved over the past decade, and has been used to map specific immune cell types and to pinpoint key differences in gene activity that affect immune response. Now, researchers are matching scRNA-seq with other tools to give it different capabilities.\n\nOne method that pairs particularly well with scRNA-seq is CITE-seq, which identifies both RNA and proteins on the surfaces of individual cells simultaneously, says Sara Suliman, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nThis combined approach has been a boon for research on natural killer (NK) cells (white blood cells that destroy diseased cells), says Eric Vivier, an immunologist at the Centre for Immunology of Marseille-Luminy in France. Last year, Vivier’s team published a study2 that used scRNA-seq and CITE-seq to uncover three main types of NK cell based on the proteins they produce in various tissues and cancers. This helped the researchers to design better cell ‘engagers’ — molecules that guide NK cells to attack tumours. The team went on to build a new engager that activates all three NK cell types to target treatment-resistant forms of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma3.\n\nSuch efforts would not have been possible using older technologies, such as bulk RNA sequencing, which obscures the distinct signatures of individual cells, says Vivier.\n\nAnother scRNA-seq add-on, called single-cell ATAC-seq, highlights which DNA regions are open, accessible and potentially active in regulating gene expression, rather than simply showing which genes are switched on. The technique not only offers insights into cellular function, but also allows researchers to piece together what’s possible or primed to happen in the future. In August, a team led by researchers at the Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing described how they used ATAC-seq to study acute myeloid leukaemia, a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow4. The work showed how faulty gene regulation in some leukaemia cells can cause the disease to return after treatment.\n\nPerturb-seq, meanwhile, is a technique that combines scRNA-seq with CRISPR gene-editing. This allows scientists to switch off or modify genes across thousands of cells simultaneously, and to track how those changes affect the cells. It’s been used to study cause-and-effect relationships, such as how a small genetic change might make someone more vulnerable to infection or inflammation, says Suliman. “That is where the powerful data is.”",

          "title": "Universities are embracing AI: will students get smarter or stop thinking?",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "When students entered Tsinghua University in Beijing this year, one of the first representatives they met wasn’t a person. Admission letters to the prestigious institution came with an invitation code to an artificial-intelligence agent. The bot is designed to answer students’ questions about courses, clubs and life on campus.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nAt Ohio State University in Columbus, students this year will take compulsory AI classes as part of an initiative to ensure that all of them are ‘AI fluent’ by the time they graduate. And at the University of Sydney, Australia, students will take traditional, in-person tests to prove that they have learnt the required skills and not outsourced them to AI.\n\nAll this is part of a sea change sweeping through campuses as universities and students scramble to adapt to the use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. These tools can, within seconds, analyse complex information, answer questions and generate polished essays — some of the exact skills that universities have conventionally taught. Eighty-six per cent of university students were regularly using AI in their studies in 2024, according to one global survey1 — and some polls show even more. “We are seeing students become power users of these tools,” says Marc Watkins, a researcher who specializes in AI and education at the University of Mississippi in Oxford.\n\nTo some, AI presents an exciting opportunity to improve education and prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Universities such as Tsinghua and Ohio State are already weaving AI into their teaching — and some studies hint that AI-powered tools can help students to learn. A randomized controlled trial2 involving physics undergraduates at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, suggested that those who used a custom-built AI tutor learnt more in less time than did students who were taught by humans alone.\n\nBut many education specialists are deeply concerned about the explosion of AI on campuses: they fear that AI tools are impeding learning because they’re so new that teachers and students are struggling to use them well. Faculty members also worry that students are using AI to short-cut their way through assignments and tests, and some research3 hints that offloading mental work in this way can stifle independent, critical thought.\n\nUniversities must move with the times: how six scholars tackle AI, mental health and more\n\nAnd some academics are angry that universities are allowing or even encouraging the use of AI tools — many of which are controlled by companies, have unknown cognitive impacts and are dogged by ethical and environmental concerns. An open letter released in June by scholars objecting to the uncritical adoption of AI technologies by universities quickly racked up more than 1,000 signatures from academics worldwide (see go.nature.com/4qpkygs). “Our funding must not be misspent on profit-making companies, which offer little in return and actively de-skill our students,” it reads.\n\nThere is one point of agreement among both enthusiasts and sceptics: the future has already arrived. “The rate of adoption of various generative AI tools by students and faculty across the world has been accelerating too fast for institutional policies, pedagogies and ethics to keep up,” says Shafika Isaacs, chief of section for technology and AI in education at the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO, in Paris.\n\nThe AI generation\n\nUniversities have been adapting to new technologies for decades — from computers and the Internet to online courses. But generative AI tools present a fundamental challenge, researchers say. Not only can they quickly perform some of the core tasks that universities teach students, but they have spread and are changing at pace. “The thing that is different about AI to every other technology is the speed at which it moves,” says Sue Attewell, head of AI at Jisc, a non-profit digital and data body for UK higher education, headquartered in Bristol.\n\nSurveys around the world show that students are quickly incorporating AI into their lives. “The number of users who are essentially young teens is just astronomically high,” says Watkins. “You’re talking hundreds of millions of users worldwide below the age of 24.” And science students seem to be early adopters. This year, the AI firm Anthropic, in San Francisco, California, analysed one million anonymized conversations between university students and its generative AI, Claude. It found that students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics were using it disproportionately more than were those in areas such as business and humanities4.\n\nBut what are students using AI for? In a survey of more than 1,000 UK students by the Higher Education Policy Institute, a think tank in Oxford, UK, most were, unsurprisingly, using AI tools to write, improve or summarize text (see ‘How university students use AI’). Nearly 90% of students said they had used generative AI for assessments such as exams or coursework. Most (58%) said they used it to explain concepts in the assessment, 25% used AI-generated text after editing it first and 8% admitted they’d used raw AI-written text5.\n\nSource: J. Freeman Student Generative AI Survey 2025 (HEPI, 2025)\n\nAttewell, who has conducted student focus groups on AI, says many students are using the tools to streamline their studies and become more efficient, not to cheat. And many just want guidance on how to boost their learning with AI, she says. Students might “know how to use [AI] brilliantly on social media or for their social life, but it doesn’t mean that they know how to use it for academic use”.\n\nThis, however, is where many universities are falling short. Institutions around the world have been scrambling to introduce policies for staff and students on the best ways to use AI — but with mixed results. On US campuses, “it’s been chaotic for the past two and a half years, and I don’t think it’s going to change anytime soon,” Watkins says. That’s because many institutions allow individual faculty members to decide whether and how AI can be used in their courses, he says, which leaves some students confused. “We might have a freshman student taking five classes, and they will be exposed to five different AI policies.”\n\nIn Australia, by contrast, there has been a strong, nationally coordinated response, educators say, in part because the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency has worked to develop guidelines with universities since 2023. And in China, “the integration of AI into universities is not optional, but an integral part of national strategy,” says Ronghuai Huang, co-dean of the Smart Learning Institute at Beijing Normal University.\n\nData and anecdote suggest that faculty members are embracing AI more cautiously than students are. Some staff are using AI tools to automate their own work, such as by helping to draft feedback on assignments, say researchers, whereas others are rejecting it outright. A survey this year of more than 1,600 faculty members from 28 countries by the Digital Education Council, an organization focused on technology in higher education, found that around 60% were using AI tools in teaching — less than the proportion of students using them6. However, 80% said their institution had not made it clear how to use AI in their teaching. “Faculty use is less sophisticated than student use,” says George Siemens, who studies technology and education at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.\n\nMeanwhile, big technology companies such as OpenAI and Google have been pitching their products to students and universities. “We’re inundated by companies wanting to partner with us,” says Ravi Bellamkonda, Ohio State University’s executive vice-president and provost. Last year, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Edu, a version of the popular chatbot tailored for universities. This February, when the California State University system announced it was giving its 520,000 students and faculty members access to that tool, it became “the largest implementation of ChatGPT by any single organization or company anywhere in the world”, according to OpenAI. In August, Google announced it was making its most advanced AI tools available for free to students aged over 18 in the United States and in a handful of other countries.\n\nEducation specialists say that tech firms are motivated by commercial interests and the opportunity to embed their AI systems into the lives of millions of young users. Universities that strike agreements with tech firms typically get campus-wide access to the latest AI models and data protection, meaning that student and faculty data and academic work are not fed into an AI training model.\n\nSome universities are grabbing the AI bull by the horns. Danny Liu, a biologist who specializes in educational technology at the University of Sydney, was one of the first to develop a generative AI platform tailored to higher education. Called Cogniti and developed in 2023, it is now embedded in the university’s digital learning platform and allows teachers to design custom AI agents for their courses. This might be an AI tutor for a science module, or an AI tool that expands brief marking comments into more specific student feedback. Cogniti is being used by more than 1,000 educators at his university, Liu says, and has been shared with more than 100 universities worldwide.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nAt Tsinghua University, academics also quickly started experimenting with ChatGPT after its release in November 2022, says Shuaiguo Wang, who directs the Center for Online Education there. Within a year, about 100 different AI teaching assistants had sprung up, and the university sought a more systematic approach. It also didn’t want to be reliant on any one AI model — such as the large language models (LLMs) that underlie ChatGPT and related tools — because “a new model emerges almost every day”, Wang says. Another key goal was to correct hallucinations, the inaccurate content that LLMs sometimes spout.\n\nIn April last year, the university led the development of a central, three-layer ‘architecture’ to incorporate AI into teaching. The bottom layer is where AI models are plugged in: the system draws on about 30 models from companies including DeepSeek, Alibaba Cloud, OpenAI and Google, Wang says. The middle layer contains ‘knowledge engines’ that hold accurate, up-to-date information for different academic fields. The top layer consists of various student-facing platforms, including an educational one that hosts teaching assistants, as well as the AI bot to help students starting at Tsinghua.\n\nAs part of this system, for instance, students can review slides after a class and click a button saying ‘I’m confused’. This allows them to ask a pop-up AI agent questions. The intermediary layer analyses the question and directs it to the appropriate AI model, as well as searching its own databases; it then compiles the information to provide an accurate answer. Wang says the system has been adopted by hundreds of universities across China.\n\nThis year, Wang is changing tack and launching studies to ask a crucial and outstanding question: do students using AI tools actually learn more? Early results — as yet unpublished — have raised some red flags. Wang and his colleagues found that students who use an AI tutor often score higher in tests immediately after a class than do those who don’t use the agent. But two to three weeks later, the AI users scored lower than their peers. “Students might have a false sense of understanding,” he says.\n\nClassroom concerns\n\nWang is not the only one worried about the impact of AI on students’ learning — as Nataliya Kosmyna discovered when, in June, she and her colleagues released a preprint7 suggesting that students who use ChatGPT to help write an essay use less of their brains than do students who write it on their own. She has since received some 4,000 e-mails from school and university teachers worldwide who are concerned that the result reflects what is happening to students in their classrooms who are using AI. In a lot of cases, “they actually sound very desperate”, she says.\n\nKosmyna, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and her team used electro-encephalography (EEG) to study the patterns of electrical activity in 54 students’ brains as they wrote 20-minute essays on questions such as “Do works of art have the power to change people’s lives?” The students were split into three groups: one with access to an LLM; another that could use websites and search engines but not LLMs; and a third that relied only on their own knowledge. The team used EEG to measure ‘connectivity’ between brain regions — the extent to which areas were communicating with each other.\n\nStudents using only their brains showed the strongest and widest pattern of connectivity and were usually able to later recall what they’d written. The LLM-using group showed the weakest connectivity — suggesting that there was less cross-brain communication — and could sometimes barely remember a word of their prose.\n\nKosmyna acknowledges that the study involved only a small number of students and did not look at the long-term impacts of using AI, among other limitations. (She also found it ironic that some commentators misinterpreted the study because they used AI to generate incorrect summaries of her 200-page preprint.) But the study fuelled a widespread concern that students who rely on AI in their studies are failing to develop valuable skills such as critical thinking — the ability to analyse and critique information and to reach considered conclusions. Anthropic’s analysis of one million student–AI conversations in Claude showed that nearly half of them involved individuals seeking direct answers or content with little engagement on their part.\n\nChatGPT for students: learners find creative new uses for chatbots\n\nOlivia Guest, a computational cognitive scientist at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, who led the writing of the June protest letter, says she has observed related problems with students in the past couple of years. “Their skills have dramatically changed,” she says: some struggle to reference a source or write an essay.",

          "abstract": "Children receive polio drops for vaccination during a door-to-door poliovirus eradication campaign in Lahore, Pakistan, in April.Credit: ARIF ALI/AFP via Getty\n\nVaccines are arguably one of the greatest inventions. Since 1974, global immunization efforts have saved the lives of some 154 million people — two-thirds of whom were infants — according to a paper published by The Lancet1 last year. Over the 50-year study period, vaccination accounted for a 40% decline in global infant mortality. And yet, around the world, these efforts are under threat.\n\nThe number of children who are missing routine vaccinations is increasing, especially in areas where conflict has disrupted basic health services. Funding cuts are taking a toll on public-health measures, including immunizations. Vaccine hesitancy — named one of the top ten threats to public health by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 — is also driving deadly gaps in coverage. And with the withdrawal of US support from the WHO and Gavi, a Geneva-based global health charity that vaccinates children in lower-income countries, researchers worry that infectious-disease prevention will get worse before it gets better.\n\nHere are four infectious diseases with rising case numbers, despite decades of vaccine development and use.\n\nMEASLES: Revealing weaknesses\n\nMeasles is one of the world’s most contagious viruses. “It’s an infection that really identifies weaknesses in immunization programmes,” says William Moss, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nNature Index 2025 Immunology\n\nTwo doses of the measles vaccine provide lifelong protection to 99% of people, says David Durrheim, a public-health physician and vaccinologist at the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia. But because measles is so infectious, about 95% coverage with two doses of the vaccine is needed in all communities to achieve herd-immunity— the percentage of people who need to be immune to stop a disease from spreading. Despite the vaccine’s effectiveness — accounting for 94 million of the 154 million lives saved by immunization, according to the Lancet study — the global coverage rate is only 83% for the first dose and 74% for the second dose. As a result, measles kills more than 100,000 people a year, mostly children in low- to middle-income countries.\n\nAnd infections are rising. Between 2022 and 2023, measles cases jumped by 20% to an estimated 10.3 million globally. Much of that increase was due to a slow-down in vaccination rates, made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic, Durrheim says. In the United States, measles was declared eliminated in 2000 by the WHO, yet in July this year, cases hit a high not seen since 1992. As of 30th September, 1,523 measles infections were confirmed across 42 US jurisdictions. Of those infected, 92% were unvaccinated or were of unknown vaccination status.\n\nAn increase in anti-vaccine sentiment, especially in the United States, is a major factor in immunity gaps, says Erica Ollmann Saphire, president and chief executive of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, California. In a study published in June2, researchers found that 78% of more than 2,000 US counties reported declines in measles vaccination. The average vaccination rate fell from almost 94% before the pandemic to 91% after it, well below the 95% herd-immunity threshold.\n\nAt the same time, there is a growing number of immunocompromised people who cannot receive the measles vaccine, Saphire says. According to a study published last year3, the proportion of US adults who are immunocompromised has more than doubled, from 2.7% in 2013 to 6.6% in 2021. The authors suggest that an increase in the use of immune-suppressing drugs such as adalimumab, prescribed for arthritis and other conditions, and more people living longer with diseases that weaken immunity, such as cancer and HIV, could be behind the surge. “There are more vulnerable people right when our walls of defence are crumbling,” says Saphire.\n\nNot only is measles an unpleasant and potentially dangerous disease, but the virus has an additional effect on the immune system, causing it to forget previously encountered infections and how to deal with them. “The complications from measles are not trivial — it’s a nasty disease,” says Rafi Ahmed, an immunologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. “Kids are sick for a long time, and they get immunosuppressed for several months, making them susceptible to other infections.”\n\nThere is no specific treatment for measles. Saphire and her colleagues are working on a new therapy that uses antibodies (proteins produced by the immune system) to stop the virus from attaching to cells or changing shape to enter them. The work began with a 2024 Science4 paper outlining what Saphire describes as the first detailed structure of a mouse antibody bound to the surface protein of a measles virus. They have since done a similar study5 on fully human antibodies that could be used in future treatments, she says, which they expect to publish in the coming months.\n\nThe team is also developing a vaccine that does not use live virus, which could be safer for immunocompromised people. But Saphire says they are struggling to secure funding to advance their work. This is surprising and disappointing, she says, “because we’re in the middle of an outbreak”.\n\nPOLIO: State of stalemate\n\nIn 1988, the World Health Assembly — the decision-making body of the WHO — set a lofty but seemingly achievable goal: eradication of polio by the year 2000. “The original anticipation was that global eradication would go quite quickly,” says Peter Wright, a paediatrician and infectious-disease researcher at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. But although numbers have greatly declined as a result of immunization campaigns and increasing routine vaccine coverage, the global community is in a stalemate with polio, he says.\n\nPoliovirus mainly infects the gut, where it replicates and enters the bloodstream. In a small number of cases, it invades motor neurons in the central nervous system, causing paralysis. Naturally occurring strains of the virus are endemic in two countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan, where vaccination rates are lower than in other places. Cases have remained low but persistent for decades, and are now creeping up, from 12 in 2023 to 99 in 2024.\n\nDeclining vaccination rates are also an issue in countries where the naturally occurring strains have been eradicated. Mutations of the weakened virus used in the oral polio vaccine can behave like wild poliovirus and cause outbreaks, says Wright. After being shed into the environment through a vaccinated child’s faeces, it can infect unvaccinated children in places where sanitation is poor. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, as it is known, now infects several hundred children each year in around 30 countries, mostly in Africa. Last year, Gaza reported its first case of vaccine-derived polio in 25 years6, due to the collapse of health-care and sanitation systems amid the ongoing conflict with Israel.\n\nIn 2011, a large group of research institutions, global health bodies and governments came together to develop a more stable oral vaccine to control outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus. The new vaccine has been in use since 2021. But in areas with low vaccination coverage, it can still mutate and spread, just like the original oral vaccine. “The only permanent solution to preventing vaccine-derived polio outbreaks is to exclusively use inactivated, injectable polio vaccines,” says Durrheim, referring to a different type of vaccination that countries such as the United States and Australia use, which does not use live virus. It is more expensive to produce than the oral vaccine, however, and requires trained health-care workers to administer, which limits its use in low-income settings. According to Durrheim, “we’ve got the means to eradicate polio; we just need to do it well.”\n\nMeanwhile, commitment to the goal of polio eradication is waning, including among some important donors. “I think everybody is tired, and the amount of money to continue [the effort] is of concern,” Wright says. The United States’ withdrawal of support for global immunization programmes — including for polio — earlier this year by shuttering the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and terminating funding for Gavi is especially concerning, adds Walter Orenstein, a global public health scientist at Emory University.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been a major funder of polio eradication efforts, but it also faces cuts to its global vaccination programmes. Without continued and sustained effort, global cases will go up, including in the United States, says Orenstein. In 2022, the New York Department of Health confirmed a case of paralytic polio — the first in the United States in 30 years. “Supporting polio eradication is a win–win situation,” Orenstein says. “It not only protects people in those countries, but also in our own.”\n\nYELLOW FEVER: Vigilance vital\n\nYellow fever is vaccine-preventable, but because the virus circulates between mosquitoes and non-human primates, it can’t be eradicated. The goal is to control its spread. In 2023, more than 62 million vaccine doses were administered in Africa, where the disease occurs naturally. “The vaccine lasts forever, so if you get it for your young population, you’re protecting the future generation,” says Oyewale Tomori, a virologist at Redeemer’s University in Ede, Nigeria. “But the rate of vaccination is not encouraging in many African countries.”\n\nYellow fever is largely spread by the mosquito Aedes aegypti.Credit: Dennish Kunkel Microscopy/Science Photo Library\n\nIn 2025, cases in the Americas increased more than eightfold compared with the same time in 2024, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), an international public-health agency for the Americas and regional office for the WHO. As of September, 334 cases were confirmed in six countries in South America, including 141 deaths. According to PAHO, almost all cases occurred in unvaccinated people in areas in and around forests where animals carry the disease. “People who go into the bush can bring [yellow fever] into urban centres,” says Tomori.\n\nThe yellow fever virus multiplies in immune cells inside the lymph nodes before spreading to other parts of the body. If the virus reaches the liver or kidneys, for example, it can cause serious damage and impair the organ’s function. There is no treatment for yellow fever, so supportive care is the only option, says Erin Staples, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. Most people who are infected are asymptomatic; of those who do develop symptoms, 33% have mild cases and 12% have severe ones. Those who develop severe disease have an almost 50% risk of death.\n\nGlobal yellow fever activity typically peaks every ten years or so in endemic areas, which is probably connected to fluctuating immunity in human populations, says Tomori. Climate change could increase mosquito breeding in some areas because of altered rainfall patterns, Moss adds, which might expand the disease’s reach as temperatures rise. Excessive heat and drought, on the other hand, could reduce mosquito populations in some locations, says Tomori.",

          "abstract": "Human-written code is facing stiff competition from AI-generated evolutionary code.Credit: MTStock Studio/Getty\n\nResearchers at Google have unveiled a new workflow to improve scientific software using artificial intelligence1.\n\nThe company built evolutionary ‘trees’ of software tools for six tasks. The ‘nodes’ in each tree were single programs whose performance was assessed using a standard benchmark. The team created new nodes by prompting a large language model (LLM) to improve an existing one’s performance. The researchers helped the LLM by feeding it summaries of research papers, specialist knowledge and other information. In each task, some of the resulting programs outperformed state-of-the-art tools.\n\n“It’s really cool to see big companies like Google using evolutionary approaches to make breakthroughs in other scientific fields,” says Jenny Zhang, a computer scientist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, who has designed programs using similar methods. “It gives me hope that the research direction that I’m doing, when scaled up, can make a big impact.”\n\nGoogle researchers answered questions from Nature about the work but declined to comment on the record because the manuscript has not yet been peer reviewed. The team is working to make the system available to scientists, the authors say. Many of the optimized tools can be found online.\n\nSoftware evolution\n\nScience runs on software. Researchers need code to analyse big data, simulate complex processes and operate sophisticated instruments. Last year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded, in part, for AlphaFold, a platform that predicts how proteins will fold up. And many of this century’s most-cited papers describe research software.\n\nBut writing scientific software is time-consuming and technical. “When I’m actually focused on science, 90% of my time is coding,” says Evan Johnson, a biostatistician and director of the Center for Data Science at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, who was not involved in the work. Google’s new workflow aims to automate the process by allowing software to evolve, building on both existing tools and online resources.\n\nGoogle refined its code-mutation system by having it complete tasks that had been published on the data-science competition platform Kaggle, testing ways to choose nodes to mutate or to prompt the LLM to alter them. Then the researchers applied the method across six scientific domains. For each one, they grew several evolutionary trees, each with up to 2,000 nodes. They created the initial node of a tree by asking the LLM to write a program from scratch, telling it to implement an existing method, combine two methods or create a new one. When mutating a program, the LLM could also search the literature for fresh ideas. It was allowed to duplicate and ‘mutate’ any node in the tree, not just the best-performing one, leading to an open-ended discovery process in which evolution could take meandering paths to success.\n\nThe first application was ‘batch integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data’ — that is, merging different genomics data sets. The system generated 40 programs that outperformed the best human-written program available, called ComBat, developed by Johnson. The top-scoring program was 14% better. Next, they used evolution to refine programs to predict the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations across US states. Their best predictors outscored all others in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, a repository of forecasting models.\n\nOther tasks included labelling satellite images, predicting neural activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and ‘time-series forecasting’: projecting how data points from various domains progress over intervals ranging from seconds to years. In all three cases, evolved programs beat existing ones. In the final challenge, Google created variations of a common function to solve calculus problems. The best one attempted 19 problems that the original had failed — and solved 17 of them.\n\nTime-savers",

They’re not the right shape for Harold or for anyone else who might actually need to sit on them. Too high off the ground, sized for people who haven’t yet begun to shrink, and too straight-backed, unkind to vertebrae that curl you inwards like last year’s leaves.\n\n“I’m waiting for my wife,” Harold calls out when the pharmacist appears. He’s already been ignored, condescended to, smiled weakly at, and ignored again. “Is Rosie ready yet?”\n\n“I need my —” says the next person in a queue that snakes all the way past Allergy and Anti-Inflammatory to Heavy Metal/Haemorrhoid. “Please —” says someone else; then everyone is clamouring like Oliver Twist, if Dickensian orphans had wanted pills instead of porridge.\n\nAmazingly, the pharmacist beckons. “Mr Vetch?” He holds out a paper bag. “I have your prescription.”\n\nHarold levers himself up. “Finally.” The first day of the month is special. That’s when he gets Rosie back. She’s only formulated for a 30-day supply, which means he’s alone for the last day of each month (except for April/June/September/November — and February, which gets weird).\n\nHe rips the bag open. “What’s this?” He doesn’t swear — they can throw you out for that. He pulls out a bottle with a single pill inside. “Where’s my wife?”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“This is the current approved grief mitigation formulation per your insurance.” The pharmacist’s sigh could blow an immovable object straight to Mars. “It’s no different from the usual monthly construct.”\n\nHarold shakes the bottle. Inside is a big pill, squishy and pale, but it’s not a person. Normally they bring Rosie out from behind the counter, looking just like when she went in for her last scan.\n\n“Just add water. Hydration is key.” The pharmacist turns away. Harold considers making a scene but he can’t afford to get banned. The next closest pharmacy is an extra 30 minutes on the bus. He could call their daughter. He could call the doctor’s office or his health insurance line. But he’s not going to do it here. He’ll go to lunch first.\n\nIn the deli, he sits with his sandwich and pulls out the bottle. The instructions read: Apply at least 340 ml distilled water. Allow space.\n\nHe tips the pill onto the table and pours bottled water over it. He’d thought it would spill everywhere but the pill soaks it up. Then it starts to expand like a Magic Grow toy. Soon Rosie is right there, sitting on the table. She’s fully clothed, thank goodness, and at first glance she looks the same as when he collects her at the pharmacy.\n\n“Harold!” She clambers off the table, steadied by his hand. “What are you eating? Do you know how much sodium is in pastrami?”\n\nMaybe this new formulation is OK. Now he’s glad he didn’t make a fuss.\n\nBut by the time they go to bed, he’s noticed that her nose is smaller. Her front tooth isn’t crooked. That mole on her back, the one they’d worried about for years but turned out to be just a mole, is gone. She has a lot fewer wrinkles, too. It’s her but not really, as if her edges had been smoothed by AI.\n\nAlso, there’s the extra finger on each hand.\n\nThat’s not the worst of it. When he asks her how they met, she says she’d spilt her iced latte on him and then he’d laughed and asked her out. But Rosie didn’t like lattes. They upset her stomach. Rosie thought coffee should be black and bubbling.\n\nAlso, he’s never been to a coffee shop called the Central Perk, even if it rings some kind of bell. They’d actually met in a cubicle farm. She’d taught him to keep his yammering voice down on the phone. He’d taught her to speak up in meetings. She’d got a promotion and then he had, too, and there’d been marriage and the kids and some trips and retirement and …\n\nWell. What’s important is this isn’t Rosie. He spends all morning on hold. By the afternoon, he’s back in the pharmacy. Rosie’s placidly smiling — that’s wrong too! — at his side.\n\n“You want more wrinkles on her?” The pharmacist looks baffled. “A bigger nose? She’s too nice?”\n\n“Exactly!” Harold wonders if it’s all in the pharmacy records: the missed cancer, the threatened lawsuit, the way they lost her too soon. They owe him this year, as close to real as possible.\n\n“Harold?” The not-really-Rosie picks at her skin.\n\nThe pharmacist, one eye on the queue, checks his records. “Your insurance approved a switch to the generic. It’s a totally legal cost-saving measure.”",

          "authors": "Cathy O’Neil",
          "abstract": "The Means of Prediction: How AI Really Works (and Who Benefits) Maximilian Kasy Univ. Chicago Press (2025)\n\nHave you felt dizzy from the constant flood of articles claiming that artificial intelligence will either boost economic productivity and be humanity’s best friend, or become superhuman and wipe everyone out? There’s a reason for the confusion — it is not accidental.\n\nIn The Means of Prediction, economist Maximilian Kasy argues that one side of this polarized debate is just cashing in on the current wave of techno-enthusiasm. This group, led by wealthy investors and technology executives who insist that AI tools will solve all of humanity’s problems, is opposed to the models being regulated by governments. At its core, Kasy says, it’s a calculated power grab. Meanwhile, some philosophers and others warning us about apocalyptic AI futures are also funded by large donations tied to those fears. In short, both camps have something to sell.\n\nHow AI is reshaping science and society\n\nHowever, given the scale of investment in AI, the public needs to have a clear grasp of what the technology really means for our future, especially if the economy were to start haemorrhaging jobs. Kasy’s book, which serves as an introductory crash course, suggests that by developing basic literacy about how AI works and what prediction engines do, people can learn to distinguish genuine progress from corporate spin.\n\nHe also argues that the public should see the AI roll-out as a pressing issue of growing inequality and concentrated power. Indeed, the book’s title alludes to political theorist Karl Marx’s argument that whoever controls the ‘means of production’ controls the structure and direction of society.\n\nBroader public debate over who gets to pick the objectives of AI systems is crucial, he argues. AI-driven prediction engines already influence hiring decisions at big corporations, shape what content is shown on social-media feeds and can help the military to select targets for air strikes.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide\n\nBut for the public to engage in the debate effectively, AI’s inner workings must be made accessible. Kasy devotes a substantial part of his book to explain, in plain language, how the technology works, unpacking terms such as machine learning and deep learning. A useful section called ‘neural nets are not artificial brains’ explains that neural networks — computer systems made of interconnected nodes that learn patterns from data — do not mimic how the human brain functions.\n\nTaking down this metaphor is important, because it’s one of the main ways in which the tech industry obscures what AI really is. In practice, AI systems are built and controlled by companies to serve commercial goals, not to think or feel in the way humans do.\n\nKasy goes on to examine the required framework for regulating AI, with discussions on fairness, explainability and privacy. He argues that decisions about how these systems are designed and deployed should not be left to corporate boardrooms alone. But his perspective is that of an academic, and regulation in the real world has to actually work.\n\nDealing with bias\n\nIf you wanted a breezy introduction to AI but don’t have the time or money for the author’s machine-learning or economics courses at the University of Oxford, UK, this book offers a high-level overview. But its tone can feel pedantic, overly technical and long-winded. There are few fresh examples of what can go wrong with algorithms — or deeper analyses of familiar case studies — and much of the discussion remains theoretical.\n\nTake fairness, for example. The author introduces the concept of merit-based discrimination — hiring someone less qualified for non-monetary reasons. He illustrates this with a hypothetical hiring algorithm designed to pick the most ‘productive’ workers. In this set-up, any unfair treatment would simply mean that the company is not maximizing profits. Similarly, as long as hiring decisions maximize profit, the company is assumed to be fair.\n\nWhy an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science",

          "abstract": "It was not, Ralph Englebert reflected as he gazed at the scene before him with a look of incredulity on his face, his first rodeo. It was, however, his first war.\n\nA medieval war at that. Mountains with predictably purple peaks drew a serrated line along the horizon. Above them iron grey cumulus warned of a gathering storm. On a plain beneath the sloping hill, moving inexorably towards an obsidian wall protecting an alabaster citadel, several armies converged. Ralph turned to the gaunt grey figure standing a few steps away, cocked a sceptical eyebrow and muttered: “Seriously?”\n\nThe grey figure gave him a mildly embarrassed smirk and then shrugged. “Well,” he said, voice a basso rumble. “Y’know.”\n\n“I’m pretty sure I don’t,” Ralph grumbled back. “I’m pretty sure I was just after some legal advice. I know it’s more efficient to do this stuff in virtual reality, but I kind of expected …” He found his voice trailing off. Truth was he had not had any particular expectations at all when he stepped into the Reality Distortion Field. Whatever it was he had not expected though, it had certainly not been this.\n\nThe grey figure — scraggy beard, wizened skin and broad-brimmed hat with floppy crown — rustled his cape and toyed with his staff for a moment. He wore a name badge, Ralph noted. A white rectangle with ‘Mage 101’ embossed on it. “It’s just a simulation,” Mage said after a moment. “Would you rather this, or pages of contracts and legalese?”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“I would have been OK with contracts,” Ralph insisted as he watched the field of battle forming below. He crumpled his brow into a frown. “Which lot is ours?”\n\nMage pointed. “Purple banners, green livery on the horses. They’re in quite a good position,” the wizardly figure assured him.\n\nA synthetic sentience, Ralph assumed. Lawyer-bot. If he squinted he could pick out his army on the plain. Problem was he could pick out several other armies too. “All I wanted to do was put in an offer on an apartment.”\n\n“All?” Mage’s voice rose a little. “Do you have any idea how competitive the rental property market in Cactus City is? Every dwelling has a multitude of buyers chasing it. Aggressive negotiation is the only way to succeed in this environment.”\n\nRalph blinked and aimed his finger at an approaching column. “With trebuchets?”\n\n“Metaphorical,” Mage insisted. “Merely illustrative of what another party is offering. An extra rent review at month 18, I believe.”\n\n“Oh,” Ralph fumed. “That’s low.”\n\n“It is,” Mage agreed.\n\nRalph watched for a while. His army was approaching the citadel, but other armies were too. The trebuchets were already picking holes in the obsidian wall. After a while he turned to Mage again. “Why a war?”\n\nMage folded his hands behind his back. “Why not?” Before Ralph could object he continued. “Look. Contracts are complicated. We noticed at an early stage that human attention dwindles, so we came up with a straightforward solution.”\n\nBy ‘we’ Ralph assumed Mage meant the various enclaves of synthetic sentiences that had emerged when Artificial General Intelligence appeared on the scene at the Singularity. A commune of machine minds that had achieved self-awareness, looked at the world around them, and let out a collective, exasperated sigh.\n\n“What was the solution?”\n\n“Gamification,” Mage said. “Humans showed themselves to be incapable of dealing with reality so we turned everything into a game.”\n\nA distant flurry of arrows flew from his army towards the trebuchets. Mage must have floated the idea that the review at 18 months had been offered only because the other party planned to terminate after 12. It seemed to cause some damage. “We’re not that bad,” Ralph insisted. Mage winced, but said nothing. On the field of battle other armies were drawing near. It certainly was a competitive market. Mage’s silence irritated him though. The simulation had not been his suggestion.\n\n“Really,” Ralph continued. “Human beings are entirely capable of making rational decisions based on factual information. We don’t need things sugar-coated.”\n\nHe had suspected the synthetic sentience might push back on his assertion in some way. What he had not expected was that it would burst out laughing. “Oh come on,” Ralph complained as he watched the thin grey figure lean on its staff and cackle. “It’s not that funny.”",

          "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects nearly twice as many women as it does men, but the biological reasons for this disparity are elusive. Writing in Nature Communications, Thomas et al.1 report a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) — an approach for finding links between genetic variations and observable traits — that includes almost 200,000 men and women with MDD. The researchers’ findings begin to unpick the genetic risk factors that are shared (or not) between men and women, and to explain why subtypes of MDD with metabolic symptoms, such as changes in weight, affect women more than men. Importantly, the results highlight how sex-stratified genetic analyses can help scientists to understand the sex-specific pathology of MDD, which is necessary for guiding more-precise treatments in the future. (This article separates people into ‘male’ and ‘female’ to reflect the use in Thomas and colleagues’ paper, but Nature recognizes that sex and gender are not binary and are not necessarily aligned.)",

          "authors": "Jenna Ahart",
          "abstract": "Sifting through the first-ever rock samples collected from the far side of the Moon, scientists in China have unearthed a surprise: fragments of a rare type of meteorite that could help to piece together the Solar System’s history. The debris — scooped up by China’s Chang’e-6 mission and returned to Earth in June last year — resembles material from asteroids that carry dust pre-dating the Solar System. Studying the chemical composition of this debris could help to trace how asteroids seeded planetary bodies such as Earth and the Moon with volatile compounds, including water.\n\n“The Chang’e-6 mission has a list of major questions to answer, but this wasn’t even on that list,” says Yuqi Qian, an Earth and planetary scientist at the University of Hong Kong, who was not involved in analysing the fragments. “It’s such an unexpected and important finding.”\n\nThe authors reported their discovery earlier this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1.\n\nNear and far\n\nMost missions that have returned rocks from the Moon have sampled the surface facing Earth — the near side — which has fewer craters and has hosted greater volcanic activity. Chang’e-6, however, landed on the far side, at the Moon’s largest, deepest crater — the South Pole–Aitken Basin, which accounts for about one-quarter of the Moon’s surface area. One of the main objectives was to better understand why the far side looks so different from the near side.\n\nAnother was to explore the huge basin, which scientists think was created when an asteroid smashed into the Moon about four billion years ago. The crater is probably rich with fragments from that and other asteroid impacts, alongside rock from the lunar mantle — the layer beneath the crust — dredged up by the collisions.\n\nOne of the rare meteorite fragments discovered on the Moon’s far side under an electron microscope.Credit: Yi-Gang Xu\n\nBut the discovery of the rare meteorite fragments was a surprise. At first, the researchers thought the samples came from the Moon’s mantle. But after analysing the iron, manganese and zinc levels in the debris, they found a mismatch with other lunar materials, indicating they were not from the Moon itself. So, the team examined the relative levels of three oxygen isotopes in the samples; these ratios are “like human fingerprints” and can tell you what type of planetary body the debris comes from, says Mang Lin, an author of the paper and geochemist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’s Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry (GIG). “This approach is basically space forensics.”",

          "title": "How to spot fake scientists and stop them from publishing papers",
          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "Beatriz Ychussie’s career in mathematics seemed to be going really well. She worked at Roskilde University in Denmark where, in 2015 and 2016 alone, she published four papers on mathematical formulae for quantum particles, heat flow and geometry, and reviewed multiple manuscripts for reputable journals.\n\nBut a few years later, her run of promising studies dried up. An investigation by the publisher of three of those papers found not only that the work was flawed, but that Ychussie didn’t even exist.\n\nHow big is science’s fake-paper problem?\n\nHer name is one of a network of 26 fictitious authors and reviewers that had infiltrated four mathematics journals belonging to the London-based publisher Springer Nature.\n\nThese sham scholars were created by a paper mill, a company that manipulates peer reviews and sells fake research papers to researchers looking to boost their profile. By inventing a stable of fake scientists, paper mills can create a ready supply of publications and favourable peer reviews, ensuring that more of the mills’ submissions get published. This tactic increases their output and credibility for paying customers.\n\nThis particular paper mill used two dozen fake authors and reviewers to publish 55 articles — one of the biggest such cases reported. After a lengthy investigation, Springer Nature, which also publishes Nature, retracted all three papers. (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n\nOther publishers have discovered similar fakes, with fictitious reviewers being more frequent than fake authors. Researchers acknowledge that this type of fraud probably isn’t a hugely common problem, but that the true scale is unknown. “We’re just flying completely blind here,” says Reese Richardson, a metascientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nPaper mills and individuals can also impersonate real researchers, stealing their identities to make submissions seem legitimate and increase their chances of getting published.\n\nMost publishers already check author identity before accepting submissions. Some rely on simple checks, such as whether a scientist is using an e-mail from a recognized institution. Others use several tests. Frontiers journals, for instance, cross-reference researcher records and look for previous publications. They also ask authors to confirm contributions made by others listed on the paper.\n\nJournal targeted by paper mill still grappling with the aftermath years later\n\nBut verifying identity is difficult because journal editors, reviewers and authors typically communicate remotely through e-mail or submission systems. Scientific publishing runs mostly on trust. There are ongoing discussions about whether to adopt more stringent measures — for example, requiring use of institutional e-mails or logging in with a system that uses university credentials — and even asking for documents such as passports or driving licences.\n\nBut such identity checks risk excluding scholars who do not work at a known institution, as well as early-career researchers and individuals in low- and middle-income countries who do not have institutional e-mails, says Adya Misra, associate director of research integrity at Sage Publications in Liverpool, UK. Journal editors might not feel comfortable playing ‘immigration officers’, checking identities for every submission. “What we lack as an industry is standards on what we consider to be a verified researcher,” says Misra.\n\nMake-believe mathematicians\n\nIn 2018, a reader spotted a pair of flawed and nearly identical papers that had been published in two mathematics journals the year before, and alerted the journal staff. The publisher of the journals, Springer Nature, discovered that both articles had used fictitious reviewers.\n\nThat was only the start. The fake reviewers had appeared as authors on earlier papers (some journals, including the two that published the flawed papers, allow authors to recommend their own peer reviewers). So once both made-up names became published authors, they began to be repeatedly suggested for reviewing.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2020, the paper mill published 55 papers with the help of 13 fictitious reviewers and 13 fake authors, who were supposedly based all over the world.\n\nIllustration by Adam Wójcicki\n\nMost of those fake authors appeared on only one article, but were suggested as reviewers 68 times. The other 13 fake personas had no publication history and were invited to review 25 times. When Springer Nature contacted the institutions that supposedly employed the researchers, those universities confirmed that no such people had ever been on their staff.\n\nThe fact that fake scientists with a publication history were invited to review papers more often than were those without explains why paper mills would bother to publish papers under fake names in the first place, says Tim Kersjes, head of research integrity at Springer Nature in Dordrecht, the Netherlands.\n\nIt took Springer Nature two years to investigate this ring of fake scientists, eventually finding that they were probably the work of a China-based paper mill and retracting all of the affected papers by early 2021.\n\n“Science has always been predicated on trust, and, at the time, awareness of identity fraud in peer review was limited. Such manipulation was rare, and editors were less alert to the risks,” Kersjes says. “We now have much more rigorous checks and editor training and awareness.” Kersjes presented his team’s investigation last month at the 10th International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nFictitious personas are just one example of identity fraud. Individuals and paper mills can also impersonate real scientists, posing as authors, reviewers or guest editors to slip poor-quality or fabricated work into journals (see ‘Finding fakes’). In work published earlier this year1, software engineer Diomidis Spinellis at the Athens University of Economics and Business uncovered 48 articles in one journal that he suspected were generated by artificial intelligence (AI). One of them listed him as an author without his knowledge. Others named researchers at prestigious universities as co-authors, but used wrong or non-institutional e-mail addresses, and some of those researchers had died years before the publications.\n\nSource: Ref. 4\n\nEven working institutional e-mail addresses are not a foolproof test for identity fraud. A preprint2 posted in August identified 94 fake profiles on OpenReview.net — a platform used to manage peer-review workflows. All but two had e-mails that were tied to well-known universities; the remaining e-mails came from institutions that had already closed.\n\nThe analysis — done by a team including researchers from OpenReview — found that imposters created e-mail aliases of genuine institutional e-mails. These aliases forwarded incoming messages into e-mail accounts that the imposters controlled.\n\nChecking up\n\nIt is unclear whether the number of cases of identity fakes in the scholarly publishing is growing. Elena Vicario, head of research integrity at Frontiers in Lausanne, Switzerland, says the situation is rare in Frontiers journals and typically involves impersonation of real individuals.\n\nRichardson says that other forms of malpractice are probably of more concern. “My gut instinct is that people engaging in unethical or unscrupulous behaviour under their own name is a far bigger issue than people using somebody else’s name to engage in unscrupulous behaviour,” he says.\n\nNonetheless, cases of fictitious and hijacked personas continue to surface, and some people worry that AI might worsen the problem. So pressure is mounting on publishers to tighten their checks.\n\nOne platform publishers are increasingly using is the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID), which was launched in 2012 as a free identification service that individuals can use to record their academic papers and other research activities. Some 10 million researchers use ORCID at least once a year, and major publishers require submitting authors to include their unique ORCID 16-digit identifier. Registered researchers carry their identifier for the entirety of their career, even if they change their job or institute.\n\nORCID does not, however, provide proof of identity. Anyone can sign up on the platform and there is currently no systematic mechanism to prevent or remove duplicate accounts.\n\nBut the platform does ask its almost 1,500 member organizations, which include publishers and funders, to contribute to its records by confirming affiliations, works, funding or peer review. These verified entries — referred to as trust markers — show up as green ticks on researchers’ profiles.\n\nEurope’s largest paper mill? 1,500 research articles linked to Ukrainian network\n\n“It is a community trust network,” says Tom Demeranville, the UK-based product director at ORCID, which is a non-profit organization in Bethesda, Maryland. “If everyone does this, we have a very helpful system for everyone.” About 5.7 million ORCID accounts contain at least one trust marker.\n\nBut some publishers request ORCID identifiers for only the lead authors on a submission3, which limits how effective the system can be.\n\nORCID might therefore work better when combined with other strategies. That was one conclusion of an expert task force on identity checks set up in late 2023 by the International Association of Scientific, Technical & Medical Publishers (STM), a trade organization in The Hague, the Netherlands.\n\nThe goal was “looking at other tactics to bolster research integrity” beyond screening the manuscript, says Hylke Koers, chief information officer at STM Solutions, STM’s operations arm based in Utrecht, the Netherlands.\n\nThe task force has published two reports on its findings4,5. The latest, posted in March, recommends a framework that combines indicators of risk and trust that publishers could apply to determine how much confidence to place on identity verifications5. Any approach must accommodate multiple solutions because otherwise it risks wrongly excluding individuals, says Koers, who helped to compile both reports. “We don’t believe there is a single silver bullet here,” he says.\n\nAlongside ORCID trust markers, the report suggests vetting institutional e-mail addresses and confirming affiliations through institutional sign-in systems. The framework also offers fall-back options such as making phone or video calls to the researcher or university, or requesting identity certificates or passports.",

Credit: Zhu Haipeng/VCG/Getty\n\nChina’s top leaders convened in Beijing this week for a high-level political meeting to map out the country’s next five-year plan (FYP), which runs from 2026 to 2030.\n\nDuring this period, the country aims to achieve greater self-reliance in science and technology, develop innovation-driven industries and “key core technologies”, notes a communique released after the meeting on Thursday. The plan — the 15th in China’s history — is expected to be released early next year.\n\nThe government intends to increase its support for advanced semiconductor technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and basic research, said Yin Hejun, the Chinese minister for science and technology, at a press conference in Beijing on Friday. Researchers say this is part of China’s effort to overcome technological bottlenecks.\n\nHuang Baorong, a researcher of sustainable development policies at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, expects China will increase its science-related investments over the next five years. This could help to offset some of the impact of the US government’s anticipated budget cuts to science, particularly in areas such as climate change and public health, Huang says.\n\nChina’s annual research and development (R&D) expenditure has skyrocketed over the past two decades. Last year, it spent more than 3.6 trillion yuan (US$505 billion), up 8.9% from 2023 and a sixfold jump compared with 2009. The Chinese government is the world’s biggest R&D spender.\n\nChina’s five-year plans are a comprehensive policy blueprint aimed at guiding the country’s economic and social development. The plan is a guide for the various levels of government to design policies for the short to medium term.\n\nChip independence\n\nSignificant resources will probably be devoted to addressing bottlenecks in the making of advanced semiconductors, says Hu Guangzhou, an economist at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai.\n\nSemiconductor chips, which power electronic devices, crucial infrastructure and military systems, are at the heart of an ongoing US–China ‘tech war’. The United States has blocked China’s direct and indirect access to its advanced chips as well as related technology and tools, citing national security risks.\n\nChinese scientists consider the years between now and 2035 crucial for the country’s chip independency. “We can hopefully leapfrog the west in the chip sector with another five or ten years of effort,” Dou Qiang, chief scientist at Phytium Technology, a chipmaker in Tianjin, China, told state-run China National Radio last week.\n\nFocus on AI\n\nAdvanced chips lay the foundation for another industry expected to feature heavily in China’s 15th FYP: AI. “As one of the most transformative general-purpose technologies in recent history, AI will undoubtedly continue to receive robust policy backing,” Hu says.\n\nYin said the government plans to draft a top-level policy framework for AI, which will focus on the development of new models and advanced computing chips.\n\nChina is focusing on integrating AI models and applications into its economy, says Philipp Boeing, an economist specializing in innovation at ZEW–Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany. The country launched in August an ‘AI+’ campaign to accelerate the deep integration between AI and key sectors through to 2035. This is a different strategy to the United States, which is also seeking to be global leader in AI. “In the US, companies want to have the best AI models possible,” Boeing says. Humanoid robots, 6G communications and clean tech are also expected to be priorities for the 15FYP, he adds.",

Biol.\n\nSome disease-ridden French soldiers have just received a new diagnosis — although it comes about two centuries too late. While retreating from Moscow in 1812, French emperor Napoleon I lost most of his army to hunger, illness and the frigid Russian winter. Now, analysis of some of the fallen soldiers’ DNA has uncovered two unsuspected diseases that plagued the troops1.\n\nThe results reveal that the reasons for the army’s demise might be more complex than was once thought, the authors report today in Current Biology. “This paper will be really interesting to history buffs,” says Anne Stone, who researches anthropological genetics at Arizona State University in Tempe. “This study was done beautifully.”\n\nFatal march\n\nHistorians had long debated the factors that led to the collapse of Napoleon’s army. Eventually, in 2006, researchers studying DNA in some of the soldiers’ remains identified two disease agents2: Rickettsia prowazekii, which causes typhus, and Bartonella quintana, which causes trench fever. These two had already seemed likely culprits on the basis of symptoms described in historical records and the discovery of body lice, which spread typhus, on the soldiers’ remains.\n\nHowever, these identifications relied on the polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) technique, which creates millions of copies of a short DNA segment. That technique allows researchers to detect DNA sequences for specific pathogens, so it excelled at verifying the presence of microorganisms that historians had already thought were present in the remains. But it isn’t as well suited for identifying unsuspected diseases.\n\nCollapse of Aztec society linked to catastrophic salmonella outbreak\n\nAfter 20 years, it felt like the right time to return to the mystery, says Nicolás Rascovan, a co-author of the new study and a palaeogenomicist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Armed with new techniques that can screen ancient DNA for any known pathogen, the team set out to identify other microbes that might have afflicted the troops. The researchers extracted DNA from the teeth of 13 fallen soldiers whose remains had been excavated in Lithuania in 2002. They then used next-generation techniques to sequence millions of different DNA fragments from a sample. That allowed the authors to look for a wide array of pathogens all at once.",

The researchers say more surveillance of the virus is needed.\n\nIn the past few years, surveillance has been focused on the avian influenza virus H5N1, which has spread across most continents and can cause severe disease and death in people. Since 2020, H5N1 has killed about 21 people. In North America, the virus is also spreading among dairy cows.\n\nLess attention is being paid to H9N2, says Kelvin To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, despite the virus being the second most common strain of bird flu that infects people. H9N2 has caused 173 infections in people since 2015, mostly in China, says To, who presented his team’s research at the Pandemic Research Alliance International Symposium in Melbourne, Australia, on 27 October.\n\nH9N2 might be more prevalent than we realize, says Michelle Wille, who studies bird flu at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne. Infections are probably being missed because they do not result in severe infection or hospitalization in people, or because people are more commonly tested for the H5N1 instead, she adds.\n\nGenetic changes\n\nScientists are yet to find evidence of person-to-person transmission of H9N2, which would be needed for it to lead to a pandemic. But To and his team have found that H9N2 underwent genetic changes that began around 2015 that have made the virus more infectious. In cell-based experiments, a version of the H9N2 virus collected in 2024 infected more human cells than did a historical sample collected in 1999. The modern version also showed improved binding to various receptors on human cells. This means the virus has adapted to spread among people1, reported To and his colleagues in Emerging Microbes & Infections earlier this month.\n\nThe virus would have to undergo several more changes before it could cause sustained transmission between people, says Wille. The virus has to change to preferentially bind to human receptors instead of receptors found in bird cells and has to adapt how well it grows at temperatures and pH levels of humans, which are different from birds.",

          "title": "The sci-fi films that physicists love to watch — from Interstellar to Spider-Man",
          "authors": "Jen A. Miller",
          "abstract": "Nature has interviewed a multitude of physicists this year in celebration of the 100th birthday of quantum mechanics. Although many of them disagree wildly about how the century-old theory describes reality, something they seem to agree on is their favourite science-fiction films. Throughout several interviews, two were consistently highlighted for their depictions of science: 2014’s Interstellar and 2006’s The Prestige — both of which were directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan.\n\nHappy birthday quantum mechanics! I got a ticket to the ultimate physics party\n\nNolan, who won an Academy Award for directing 2023’s Oppenheimer — a deep dive into the scientists behind the atomic bomb — credits his initial interest in physics to being introduced to science fiction as a child by watching the Star Wars films and television programmes such as Carl Sagan’s Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. “It was something that stuck with me, and it was something I applied very much to films like Interstellar,” he told online interview website The Talks in 2023. “It showed us the dramatic possibilities, that looking at the universe from a scientific perspective could be very, very engaging.”\n\nNolan declined to be interviewed for this story; we can assume that’s because he’s busy filming The Odyssey, a retelling of the Greek epic, slated for a 17 July 2026 release. Here, we delve into why physicists love his work. (Warning: spoilers ahead.)\n\nThe Prestige (2006)\n\nThe plot: Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians in late 1890s London, who each dazzle audiences with a ‘teleportation’ trick. Borden pulls his off by hiding the fact that he has an identical twin, with whom he shares the same identity. Angier, however, gets help from famed scientist Nicola Tesla (David Bowie) to build a teleportation machine, which creates a new version of Angier every time he does the trick.\n\nThe science of Oppenheimer: meet the Oscar-winning movie’s specialist advisers\n\n“It’s a brilliant movie,” says Barry Luokkala, physicist and author of the 2013 book Exploring Science through Science Fiction, who also teaches a course with the same name at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nLuokkala, who in his class shows a clip from the film, says this for a few reasons: first, it picks up on the fascination with illusions and magic that he experienced as a child. Second, it takes an ambitious, fictional leap from what we know about the actual science of teleportation, and third, it’s an “interesting character study to show Hugh Jackman’s character, who is a brilliant showman, next to Christian Bale, who is not, and how highly competitive they are”.\n\nIt’s a story that also lingers. “The Prestige lives rent-free in my brain: it’s like a steampunk representation of science that we still don’t know,” adds Rithya Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, who studies space-time evolution of fundamental particles at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. “We know how to teleport information … but it’s not a representation of science that we know.”\n\nInterstellar (2014)\n\nThe plot: Joseph Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA scientist tapped to pilot a mission through a wormhole to save humanity by colonizing a habitable planet near a black hole named Gargantua. Cooper later learns that those on the mission were never meant to return, and realizes that the presence of the wormhole was caused by actions of scientists in the future, including himself.\n\n“It’s real science, and it’s based on real physical phenomena pushed to the limit,” says Claudia de Rham, a theoretical physicist at Imperial College London, who also made a podcast about the film.\n\nWhy Oppenheimer has important lessons for scientists today\n\nThe idea of space, time and parallel universes presented in the movie are fascinating, says Kai Liu, a materials physicist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. So is the concept “that you can go back in time and see the Universe with a different light”, he adds.\n\nInterstellar also inspired physicists’ group-watch events. Kunnawalkam Elayavalli was a PhD student at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, when the film came out, and saw it with her fellow students. “We took up a whole row in the movie theatre,” she says. “We were the most annoying people to watch that movie with.” Manuel Calderón de la Barca Sanchez, who studies heavy-ion collisions at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, told Nature that he, too, organized a group outing of scientists to see it.",

The syndrome is caused by the inheritance of an extra full or partial copy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), resulting in three copies of HSA21 genes, rather than the normal two. This modest 50% increase in gene dosage is sufficient to cause Down’s syndrome, yet identifying the specific genes, or gene combinations, that underlie individual characteristics has been challenging — limiting scientists’ ability to develop therapies. Writing in Nature, Ranade et al.2 report an experimental tour de force that potentially links increased dosage of the high-mobility group nucleosome-binding protein 1 (HMGN1) gene with the high CHD incidence in Down’s syndrome.",

          "abstract": "Elkhorn coral off the coast of Key Largo, Florida. Credit: Sam Hodge/Alamy\n\nTwo years after a record-setting heatwave, scientists have confirmed that two iconic corals that have flourished across Florida’s 560-kilometre-long reef for more than 10,000 years are now ‘functionally extinct’ off the state’s southern coast.\n\nBoth the elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) and staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) survive in tanks and scattered locations across Florida’s reefs, but a study published today in Science suggests that their long-standing role as the primary reef builders off the coast of Florida has come to an end: so few remain that they can no longer play a functional part in the ecosystem1.\n\n“This ecosystem is forever transformed,” says study co-author Ross Cunning, a coral biologist at the John G. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Illinois. That does not mean scientists are giving up hope on either species, he says, but what scientists and conservationists do from now on “needs to fundamentally change”.\n\nBoiling ocean\n\nOver the past few decades, Florida’s corals have been hit repeatedly by bleaching events, which occur when rising water temperatures cause corals to expel the symbiotic algae that provide them with nutrients and colour. But the 2023 heatwave, which coincided with record temperatures that drove bleaching around the globe, hit Florida earlier, faster and harder than anything scientists had seen before.\n\nCoral die-off marks Earth’s first climate ‘tipping point’, scientists say\n\nOcean temperatures registered above 31 °C for nearly 41 days — up to 4 degrees above normal in places. This created heat exposures on the reef that were two to four times higher than previous records. Although many corals survived the event, mortality among Acropora corals ranged from 98–100% across much of the reef, from Dry Tortugas National Park in the west through the Florida Keys to the east. In the area off the coast of Miami, and farther north, more than 60% of the corals survived.\n\nThe 2023 heatwave was the nail in the coffin not just for Acropora corals, but also for more than two decades of conservation work that has focused mainly on raising these corals in laboratories and then planting them back in the ocean, says Ken Nedimyer, technical director at Reef Renewal, a conservation organization in Tampa, Florida. Most of the corals that the organization has raised and planted over the past two decades are now dead. So, Nedimyer says his team’s efforts are now shifting towards other types of corals that have survived the bleaching events, such as brain and star corals, while also working to preserve the genetic diversity of Acropora corals and to breed those rare individuals that survived.\n\n“We still have some great [Acropora] corals to work with,” Nedimyer says, and there is already evidence that such breeding efforts can help the corals to adapt and withstand future heatwaves. “We just haven’t done it at a big scale yet.”",

Using a nationally representative, online and offline-integrated dataset of a Generation Z cohort in China, we provide large-scale evidence on the determinants of success in attracting attention. Our findings reveal that ‘how you express yourself’ (using various emojis and expressing multiple emotions) is more influential than ‘who you are’ (in terms of gender, education, family background and personality traits) in attracting attention on social media. Further analysis confirms a causal effect of the variety of emojis and types of emotions on attracted attention, while simulation processes using agent-based models suggest that empathy evocation is the primary underlying mechanism. We also show that the mode of expression is largely independent of individual characteristics and that the attention gained from highly appealing expressions is easier to acquire than to sustain, as it is highly sensitive to changes in expression modes over time. Overall, our research identifies three key features of attention capital allocation on social media: low alignment with traditional resources, considerable manipulability and ease of acquisition but difficulty sustaining it over time.",

Yet despite decades of research on the adoption of conservation and climate-smart agricultural practices, little is known about the extent to which these practices persist over time. One key reason is the lack of longitudinal, field-level data. Using ground-verified, longitudinal data on cover cropping across thousands of farm parcels in Indiana (USA), we find that persistence is low and contrasts sharply with the predictions made by Indiana conservation experts. We also find low persistence in a new national dataset of self-reported cover cropping by farm operators. The potential for low behavioral persistence in sustainable agricultural practices raises essential questions about the design of conservation programs and the modeling and valuation of ecosystem services.",

In a nationwide survey across China, we investigated the presence, sources, health risks, and drivers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potential pathogens in discarded cigarette butts. Shotgun metagenomic and full-length 16S ribosomal rRNA (rRNA) sequencing revealed that cigarette butts harbored significantly higher abundances of ARGs and bacterial pathogens than plant litter or soil. Health risk assessment further showed that cigarette butts carried ARGs with greater mobility, clinical relevance, and pathogenic potential. Genomic analyses highlighted enrichment of ARG-carrying pathogens, particularly Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas , with mobile genetic elements and oxidative stress responses as key contributors. Functional assays, including plasmid transfer, transcriptomic profiling, and single-cell Raman spectroscopy, demonstrated that cigarette butts promoted horizontal gene transfer and upregulated key ARGs (e.g., mexE , mexF , cfrC ) under stress conditions. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed biofilm formation on cigarette fibers, supporting enhanced bacterial persistence. Source-tracking analyses identified both human oral and environmental sources of the enriched ARGs and pathogens in cigarette butts. Finally, socioeconomic factors such as lower gross domestic product (GDP), reduced education, and poor sanitation were strongly associated with elevated ARG and pathogen risks. Collectively, our findings identify cigarette butts as overlooked yet potent vectors of ARG and pathogen dissemination in urban green spaces, underscoring the need for targeted interventions within a One Health framework.",

Upon cellular uptake, these nanoflowers result in a two-fold increase in mitochondrial mass and enhancing mitochondrial transfer to recipient cells by several-fold. This enhanced efficiency of transfer significantly improves mitochondrial respiratory capacity and adenosine triphosphate production in recipient cells under physiological conditions. In cellular models of mitochondrial and cellular damage, MoS 2 enhanced mitochondrial transfer achieved remarkable restoration of cell function. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that nanomaterial-boosted intercellular mitochondrial transfer can enhance cell survivability and function under diseased conditions, offering a promising strategy for treating mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases.",

          "authors": "Jueng Soo You, Steve Pierce, Gangning Liang, Peter A. Jones",
          "abstract": "The origins of CpG islands (CGIs) are not known. They are relatively short GC-rich regions of DNA with a higher-than-expected occurrence of CpG dinucleotides compared to most of the genome. They constitute less than 1% of the human genome but harbor approximately 40% of all transcription start sites (TSSs). CGIs are usually modulated by histone modifications in somatic cells or, in a minority of cases, permanently silenced by CpG methylation. Those that do not have TSSs are called “orphan CGIs”. Here, we show that CGIs containing TSSs almost never contain any of three major classes of transposable elements (TEs) and orphan CGIs rarely do. We hypothesize that CGIs persist across evolutionary time due to counterselection against TE insertion in the germ line. The 99% of the vertebrate genome, which is not CG rich, contains 60% of TSSs and putative enhancers. We postulate that conversion of an ancestral CpG-rich genome into the current CpG-depleted version present in vertebrates may also have allowed reversible DNA methylation to function in complex and dynamic gene control circuits. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary model in which vertebrate TEs are indirectly responsible for the existence of CGIs, and the formation of regulatory elements such as TSSs and enhancers that can potentially utilize dynamic DNA methylation for gene control.",

          "abstract": "Highly polymorphic allorecognition systems have been characterized in numerous invertebrate species, and exhibit discriminatory capabilities reminiscent of vertebrate adaptive immunity. As these systems utilize germline encoded receptors, the mechanisms underlying allelic discrimination are unknown. The invertebrate chordate, Botryllus schlosseri, undergoes a natural transplantation reaction controlled by a highly polymorphic, polygenic locus (called the fuhc) with over 1,000 allelic haplotypes found worldwide. Two individuals are compatible if they share one or both fuhc alleles, and we had found that polymorphic discrimination is due to the integration of signals from two allorecognition receptors encoded within the fuhc locus, called fester and uncle fester. Here we show that these two receptors are members of an extended family consisting of &gt;35 genes, now called the Fester family ( FF ), and coexpressed with members of another diverse gene family, the fester coreceptors ( FcoR ). Both FF and FcoR are Immunoglobulin superfamily members and each FcoR encodes conserved tyrosine signal transduction motifs, including ITIMs or hemITAMs. FF and FcoR are expressed and encoded as cognate pairs in two polymorphic haplotypes: one within the fuhc locus, and another on a separate chromosome, and remarkably, copy number variation between haplotypes is of gene pairs. Furthermore, two FcoR genes can swap ITIMs and hemITAMs by alternative splicing, suggesting that dynamic tuning of activating and inhibitory signaling is required for allelic discrimination. These results indicate that conserved signal processing mechanisms are the foundation of both allelic discrimination in Botryllus , and recurring convergent evolution of allorecognition receptors observed from invertebrates to mammals.",

The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for this fate bias remain unclear. Here, we report that linker histone regulates HSPC fate choice at the lymphoid versus myeloid bifurcation. Linker histones package nucleosomes and compact chromatin. HSPCs expressing a doxycycline (dox)-inducible H1.0 transgene favor the lymphoid fate, display strengthened nucleosome organization, and reduced chromatin accessibility at subsets of genomic regions. The genomic regions showing reduced chromatin accessibility host many known marker genes of myeloid-biased HSCs. The transcription factor Hlf is located in one of the most differentially closed regions, whose chromatin accessibility and gene expression are reduced in H1.0 high HSPCs. Failure to reduce Hlf expression in multipotential HSPCs abrogates the H1.0-endowed lymphoid potential. Furthermore, HSPCs display aspartyl protease–dependent H1.0 decreases, especially in response to interferon alpha (IFNα). Aspartyl protease inhibitors preserve endogenous H1.0 levels and promote the lymphoid fate of wild type HSPCs.

          "abstract": "Temperature has strong impacts on all biological and ecological processes, and thermal performance curves (TPCs) have been employed recurrently to assess them. TPCs almost always take a particular asymmetric shape across the biological hierarchy, with many different competing mechanisms and models doing a similarly good job of trying to explain the TPC phenomenon. Here, we reveal that the ubiquitous exponential scaling of biological processes with temperature creates a mechanistic tendency for TPC data and models to collapse onto a single curve (which we call the Universal TPC, UTPC), explaining mathematically why biological systems respond to temperature in such a consistent way. We illustrate that many seemingly different TPCs actually approximate rescaled versions of the same curve, even when thermal performance estimates vary widely across organisms, systems, and contexts. We demonstrate remarkable UTPC collapse across the tree of life, with diverse datasets spanning microbes to vertebrates, and individual physiology to population growth. UTPC phenomena also provide a strong theoretical basis for predicting performance of warm-adapted organisms will be more sensitive to- and less tolerant of- temperature fluctuations; an important consideration in the context of climate change.",

          "abstract": "The emerging electrocatalytic C–N coupling reaction provides an attractive route toward green urea synthesis, but a lack of in-depth insight into the catalytic mechanism and the geometric/electronic configurations that determine the key C- and N-coupling intermediates formation hampers the exploration of efficient catalysts. Herein, we design a bimetallic oxide (Fe-Mo-O) with dual active sites of Fe and Mo for the adsorption and activation of NO 2 − and CO 2 , respectively. Constructing dual-metal catalyst leads to an upshift of the d-band center and the generation of an intermediate-spin Fe center, which not only favors the selective conversion of *CO 2 into the key intermediate *CO on Mo sites, but also facilitates the adsorption and reduction of NO 2 − on Fe sites. Operando characterizations and theoretical calculations together elucidate that urea generation is associated with the formation of *CONH 2 intermediate by coupling *CO and *NH 2 on the alternating Mo and intermediate-spin Fe active sites, ultimately synergistically lowering the C–N coupling energy barrier. Specifically, the Fe-Mo-O catalyst delivers a high urea yield rate of 681.8 μg h −1 mg −1 cat. and an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 60% at −0.5 V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, a C–N coupling paired with a glycerol oxidation system allows for energy-saving electrochemical coproduction of urea and formic acid. Our findings offer a feasible strategy to develop cutting-edge electrocatalysts for urea synthesis by active site design and electronic structure regulation.",

This interhemispheric exchange of information critically depends upon the corpus callosum. Classical anatomical descriptions of callosal organization outline a topographic gradient from front to back, such that specific transcallosal fibers support distinct aspects of integrated brain function. Here, we present a challenge to this conventional model. Using neuroimaging data obtained from a new cohort of adult corpus callosotomy patients, we leverage modern network neuroscience techniques to show that full interhemispheric integration can be achieved via a small proportion of posterior callosal fibers. Partial callosotomy patients with spared callosal fibers retained widespread patterns of interhemispheric functional connectivity and showed no signs of behavioral disconnection, even with only 1 cm of the splenium intact. Conversely, only complete callosotomy patients demonstrated sweeping disruptions of interhemispheric network architectures, aligning with disconnection syndromes long-thought to reflect diminished information propagation and communication across the brain. These findings motivate an evolving mechanistic understanding of synchronized interhemispheric neural activity for large-scale human brain function and behavior.",

We achieved this by spraying picoliter volume droplets at speeds of hundreds of meters per second into a thin layer of liquid ethane coating the surface of a precooled specimen support. The droplets simultaneously collapsed and froze in microseconds into the amorphous phase as they landed on the surface. The atomic structure of the proteins was preserved and tomographic reconstructions of the vitrified specimens indicated adhesion to the interfaces was eliminated. Improved control of the final thickness of the specimen and the orientation distribution of the particles are now the limiting factors. This demonstration provides a basis for the development of specimen preparation methods and instruments that eliminate the detrimental effects of the air–water interface in cryoEM.",

SARS-CoV-2, despite binding CL-11 to activate complement, was resistant to lysis. Remarkably, opsonization by CL-11 enhanced virus production by infected respiratory epithelial cells independently of complement. Furthermore, infected cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein displayed enhanced vulnerability to CL-11 binding and membrane attack by complement. The mechanism of enhanced infectivity was ablated in the presence of L-fucose, which occupied the extended carbohydrate-binding cleft of CL-11 in a crystallographic analysis of complexes between L-fucose and CL-11.

The model relies solely on simulated data rather than well-registered real data pairs, and is trained to descatter and restore hidden spatial information at greater depths. Quantitative evaluations on simulated fluorescent beads and vasculature show significant performance improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (23 to 29 dB) and structural similarity index (23×) compared to the raw data.

Prior to macroscopic degeneration, microstructural changes occur such as demyelination, iron deposition, or subtle atrophy, which can be characterized in vivo using MRI. We topographically mapped measures of microstructure and macrostructure across the unfolded surface of the hippocampus in 224 healthy older adults at risk for AD (aged 57 to 87) and 37 younger adults (aged 18 to 37). We describe three spatial regions of unique structural covariance between four parameters sensitive to microstructural tissue properties (R1, MTsat, R2*, PD) and macrostructure (surface thickness), with high convergence with previous spatial segmentations. We demonstrate both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of microstructure with healthy aging across the lifespan, AD pathological hallmarks, genetic risk, and cognition. These associations had subtle variations across different spatial areas of the hippocampus. We report associations between age and qMRI measures sensitive to macromolecular concentration (R1, MTsat) and paramagnetic susceptibility (R2*), consistent with mechanisms of demyelination and increased iron deposition as key hallmarks of the aging hippocampus and in presymptomatic stages of AD. qMRI measures did not explain more variance in delayed recall than global PET measures, suggesting variation in cognitive performance in aging and incipient AD is influenced by factors beyond hippocampal microstructure. We demonstrate the utility of quantitative MRI to provide greater insight into hippocampal health compared to typical macrostructural measures through “in vivo histology,” opening a window to understanding neuropathological mechanisms in the earliest stages of age- and disease-related neurodegeneration.",

While treatments targeting AChR autoantibodies benefit many, some patients remain refractory, highlighting the need for personalized therapies. This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of S-1117, a pan-IgG-specific protease, in AChR autoantibody-mediated pathology. Using live cell-based assays, we examined AChR-specific monoclonal IgG autoantibodies (mAbs) and patient-derived serum samples for their effects on receptor binding, blockade, internalization, and complement activation, before and after treatment with S-1117. S-1117 effectively removed the crystallizable fragment (Fc)γ from both mAbs and serum IgG, impairing Fcγ-mediated complement activation in both soluble and antigen-bound forms. In cases with partial complement reduction, AChR-specific IgM contributed to complement deposition. AChR-IgM acted in concert with IgG in some patients to enhance complement deposition, while acting as main complement driver in others. An IgM-specific protease completely suppressed the pathogenic effects of AChR-IgM in two independent patient cohorts. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of S-1117 in neutralizing AChR-IgG Fcγ-mediated effector functions and reveal an MG subset driven by IgM pathology. Our study shows that targeting both IgG- and IgM-mediated mechanisms with therapeutic proteases provides an approach to MG treatment and establishes a framework for patient stratification based on disease mechanisms, advancing precision medicine in MG.",

Here, we show that crosses of Caenorhabditis nigoni males with C. briggsae females result in insufficient expression of Cbr-xol-1 , an X-linked master switch responsible for intimately linked sex determination and dosage compensation pathways, consequently triggering aberrant X-chromosome repression in males, and ultimately leading to embryonic inviability. In contrast, male embryos from the reciprocal cross maintain normal expression level of C. nigoni xol-1 genes, consistent with their viability. We further demonstrate that the cis-regulatory regions of Cbr-xol-1 and Cni-xol-1 have functionally diverged. Finally, X transcription is also aberrantly repressed in lethal hybrid male embryos from crosses between gonochoristic species C. latens and C. remanei . Our results suggest an evolutionary scenario in which incompatibility of the dosage compensation system leads to reproductive isolation.",

          "abstract": "The soft corals (Cnidaria, Octocorallia), a diverse group of colonial marine invertebrates, can reversibly tune their body stiffness in response to external stimuli. This capability is attributed to their dynamic skeletal systems, which consist of thousands of mineralized skeletal elements, called sclerites, embedded within a gel-like matrix that swells/deswells and unjams/jams the sclerites, thus modulating skeletal stiffness. While sclerite morphology is widely used for species identification, its role in the mechanical performance of a soft coral’s skeletal system is largely unknown. Here, we investigated structure-jamming relationships in sclerite-based skeletal architectures using the red gorgonian octocoral Leptogorgia chilensis as a model system. The sclerites of L. chilensis exhibit a shaft-like geometry with two axial branches and two sets of triradiate side branches, which are aligned with the crystallographic symmetry of the constituent magnesium-containing calcite. By combining multiscale three-dimensional (3D) structural characterization, parametric geometrical modeling, 3D printing, mechanical testing, and discrete element simulations, we demonstrate how sclerite geometry achieves a balanced jamming performance in terms of stiffness, weight, strength, and fracture resistance in comparison to alternative geometries parametrically modified from the native sclerites (e.g., changes in the length and number of side branches). We also found that these performance metrics are achieved through the effective interlocking among side and axial branches, which is further enhanced by the fractal-like microscopic spikes on the branch tips. The findings in this natural jamming system offer insights for designing synthetic mechanotunable material architectures for a wide range of applications, from soft robotics to mechanical dampeners.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive genetic heterogeneity, 72% of pathogenic alleles for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) arise from coding and regulatory variants in genes of the RET and EDNRB gene regulatory network (GRN) in the enteric nervous system (ENS). To elucidate the mechanisms leading to enteric neuronal loss from these genetic defects, we generated four strains of mice carrying reduced function alleles at Ret or Ednrb or both, along with their wild-type alleles. ENS tissue- and single-cell gene expression profiling of the developing and postnatal gastrointestinal tract in these five mouse models revealed three major insights: i) Ret and Ednrb deficiency, rather than complete loss, is sufficient to induce HSCR, ii) Ret and Ednrb demonstrate strong trans interactions, and iii) disruption of this interaction leads to cellular fate changes to compensate for neuronal loss. Critically, we show the combined reduction of signaling of these two receptors below a threshold in enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDCs) leads to a molecular tipping point at which otherwise lesser cellular defects result in aganglionosis. This study of targeted mouse models of a multifactorial disorder reveals how increasing dosage of genetic defects within a GRN leads to quantifiably increasing dysregulation from genotype to gene expression to cellular identity to function. Importantly, our studies establish that aganglionosis results only with severely reduced gene expression at both receptor genes and their consequent disruption of normal and compensatory cell fate trajectories.",

The molecular processes driving aggregation in disease are still being uncovered, highlighting the need for innovative tools to study aggregation reactions. Here, we introduce FibrilPaint1 as a tool to measure the size of Tau amyloid fibrils in fluids, from early aggregation stages to mature fibrils. FibrilPaint1 is a 22mer peptide with exciting properties: i) FibrilPaint1 binds fibrils with nanomolar affinity; ii) it also binds to precursors, down to a size of only 4 layers; iii) it does not bind to monomers; iv) it is fluorescently labeled, which allows monitoring and localizing interactions; v) FibrilPaint1 recognizes various Tau fibrils, including patient-derived fibrils from AD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD); vi) it also binds to fibrils from amyloids derived from Amyloid-β, α-synuclein, and huntingtin vii) FibrilPaint1 is selective for the amyloid state and does not have background binding to amorphous aggregates, blood serum, or cell lysate. In combination with flow-induced dispersion analysis (FIDA), a microfluidics technology, we determined the molecular size of amyloid fibrils with submicroliter sample volumes. This setup acts as a molecular ruler at layer resolution—we determined Tau fibril length from 4 to 1100 layers in solution.

          "abstract": "The role of HIF2α, encoded by EPAS1 , in neuroblastoma remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that induction of high levels of HIF2α in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells results in a rapid and profound reduction of the oncoprotein MYCN. This is followed by an upregulation of genes characteristic of noradrenergic cells in the adrenal medulla. Additionally, upon induction of HIF2α, the proliferation rate drops substantially, and cells develop elongated neurite-like protrusions, indicative of differentiation. In vivo HIF2α induction in established xenografts significantly attenuates tumor growth. Notably, analysis of sequenced neuroblastoma patient samples, revealed a negative correlation between EPAS1 and MYCN expression and a strong positive correlation between EPAS1 expression, high expression levels of noradrenergic markers, and improved patient outcome. This was paralleled by analysis of human developing adrenal medulla datasets wherein EPAS1 expression was prominent in populations with high expression levels of genes characteristic of noradrenergic chromaffin cells. Our findings show that high levels of HIF2α in neuroblastoma, leads to drastically reduced MYCN protein levels, cell cycle exit, and noradrenergic cell differentiation.

          "abstract": "For many families severely affected with breast cancer, no inherited causal allele has been detected in any tumor suppressor gene. In an effort to understand the genetics underlying breast cancer in these families, we evaluated 136 such families for coinheritance of breast cancer with each of 79 common variants reported as high-confidence “risk alleles” for breast cancer by meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. Simulations based on allele frequencies and family structures revealed one (and only one) of these 79 variants to cosegregate with breast cancer in the families significantly more frequently than expected by chance. This variant (rs2046210) is located 180 kb proximal to ESR1 , encoding the estrogen receptor alpha. Reporter assays in MCF7 cells revealed enhancement by the genomic segment at this site of activity of ESR1 promoters, but no difference in effect among alternative haplotypes. In contrast, the 600 kb genomic region including ESR1 and rs2046210 harbored 11 rare variants, each of which cosegregated with breast cancer in one or a few families. For 9 of these 11 variants, reporter assays indicated significant allele-specific effects on ESR1 promoters, with the breast-cancer-linked allele of each variant yielding higher promoter activity. At the site with the most striking effect, the breast-cancer-linked allele was associated with increased binding by transcription factor AP2-gamma TFAP2C in both MCF7 and T47D cells. These results demonstrate coinheritance with breast cancer of rare alleles that increase activity of ESR1 promoters, and suggest that rare ESR1 regulatory alleles may contribute to inherited predisposition to breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Lamin A/C ( LMNA ), a key component of the nuclear envelope, is essential for maintaining nuclear integrity and genome organization [W. Xie et al. , Curr. Biol. 26 , 2651–2658 (2016)]. While LMNA dysregulation has been implicated in genomic instability across cancer and aging, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood [S. Graziano et al. , Nucleus 9 , 258–275 (2018)]. Here, we define a mechanistic role for LMNA in preserving genome stability in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a malignancy marked by extreme genomic instability [N. Takahashi et al. , Cancer Res. Commun. 2 , 503–517 (2022)]. LMNA depletion promotes R-loop accumulation, transcription-replication conflicts, replication stress, DNA breaks, and micronuclei formation. Mechanistically, LMNA deficiency disrupts nuclear pore complex organization, specifically reducing phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-nucleoporin incorporation, resulting in impaired RNA export and nuclear retention of RNA. LMNA expression is repressed by EZH2 and reexpressed during SCLC differentiation from neuroendocrine (NE) to non-NE states, and low LMNA levels correlate with poor clinical outcomes. These findings establish LMNA as a key regulator of nuclear transport and genome integrity, linking nuclear architecture to SCLC progression and therapeutic vulnerability.",

          "abstract": "Background: In early atherosclerosis, circulating Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) crosses the endothelium by transcytosis. This involves caveolar uptake of LDL by scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) and activin-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and requires the protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1). We identified mediators of LDL transcytosis by isolating membrane microdomains enriched in caveolin-1 from human coronary endothelial cells (HCAECs) treated with LDL and performing mass spectrometry. One of the proteins identified was myosin-9 (MYH9). Methods: Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was conducted to measure LDL transcytosis by HCAECs. We measured LDL transcytosis in vivo in mice lacking endothelial MYH9 (EC- Myh9 −/− ). Atherosclerosis studies were also performed in EC- Myh9 −/− deleted of hepatic LDLR via (adeno-associated virus, AAV)-CRISPR. Additionally, we performed analysis of human transcriptomic data. Results: Gene ontology analysis in human aortic endothelial cells suggested a role for MYH9 in exocytosis. Both knockdown and pharmacologic inhibition of MYH9 inhibited LDL transcytosis. MYH9 depletion caused an accumulation of LDL-containing vesicles at the base of the cell; overexpression caused an increase in LDL exocytosis. EC- Myh9 −/− mice accumulated less LDL in the aortic arch after acute injection with LDL. To investigate the role of MYH9 in atherosclerosis, we deleted hepatic LDL in EC- Myh9 −/− mice using AAV-CRISPR and fed them a high-fat diet. The aortic arch and root of AAV-CRISPR; EC- Myh9 −/− mice exhibited smaller plaques. Human transcriptomic data showed greater messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of aortic MYH9 in atherosclerotic aortas compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: Lipid raft proteomics identified MYH9 as a regulator of LDL transcytosis. MYH9 is required for endothelial LDL exocytosis and contributes to early atherosclerosis.",

Here, we report a nascent RNA-dependent PHF19-YTHDC1 condensate capable of switching EZH2-mediated gene suppression to activation during prostate cancer progression. We found that the long isoform of PRC2 accessory subunit PHF19, PHF19L, was highly expressed in advanced prostate cancer that promoted the tumor progression and hormonal therapy resistance. Mechanistically, PHF19L was recruited to the m 6 A modified nascent RNA through YTHDC1 and formed a liquid-like YTHDC1-PHF19L condensate that pulled the EZH2 away from chromatin, resulting in reduced H3K27me3 deposition and the activated expression of EZH2-repressed genes. Therefore, our study reveals a biomolecular condensate that modulates the switch from EZH2-mediated epigenetic gene silence to activation during the progression of prostate cancer.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic ammonia (NH 3 ) emissions have significantly increased in recent decades due to enhanced agricultural activities, contributing to global air pollution. While the effects of NH 3 on surface air quality are well documented, its influence on particle dynamics in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) and related aerosol impacts remain unquantified. NH 3 reaches the UTLS through convective transport and can enhance new particle formation (NPF). This modeling study evaluates the global impact of anthropogenic NH 3 on UTLS particle formation and quantifies its effects on aerosol loading and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) abundance. We use the EMAC Earth system model, incorporating multicomponent NPF parameterizations from the CERN CLOUD experiment. Our simulations reveal that convective transport increases NH 3 -driven NPF in the UTLS by one to three orders of magnitude compared to a baseline scenario without anthropogenic NH 3 , causing a doubling of aerosol numbers over high-emission regions. These aerosol changes induce a 2.5-fold increase in upper tropospheric CCN concentrations. Anthropogenic NH 3 emissions increase the relative contribution of water-soluble inorganic ions to the UTLS aerosol optical depth (AOD) by 20% and increase total column AOD by up to 80%. In simulations without anthropogenic NH 3 , UTLS aerosol composition is dominated by sulfate and organic species, with a marked reduction in ammonium nitrate and aerosol water content. This results in a decline of aerosol mass concentration by up to 50%. These findings underscore the profound global influence of anthropogenic NH 3 emissions on UTLS particle formation, AOD, and CCN production, with important implications for cloud formation and climate.",

Mechanistically, mutant p53 enhances RhoA/ROCK-dependent cell contractility and cell-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) reorganization via increasing mevalonate pathway–dependent RhoA localization to the membrane. In line with this, RhoA-dependent proinvasive activity is also mediated by IDI-1, a mevalonate pathway product. Further, the invasion-enhancing effect of mutant p53 is dictated by the biomechanical properties of the surrounding ECM, thereby adding a cell-independent layer of regulation to mutant p53 GOF activity that is mediated by dynamic reciprocal cell–ECM interactions. Together our findings link mutant p53 metabolic GOF activity with a context-dependent invasive cellular phenotype.",

There are a growing number of powerful forecasting methods that fall into two broad categories-empirical models that extrapolate from historical data, and mechanistic models based on fixed epidemiological assumptions. However, these methods often underperform precisely when reliable predictions are most urgently needed-during periods of rapid epidemic escalation. Here, we introduce epimodulation, a hybrid approach that integrates fundamental epidemiological principles into existing predictive models to enhance forecasting accuracy, especially around epidemic peaks. When applied to empirical and machine learning forecasting methods (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Holt-Winters, gradient-boosting machines, Prophet, and spline models), epimodulation improved overall prediction accuracy by an average of 12.3% (range: 8.5 to 18.7%) for COVID-19 hospital admissions and by 32.9% (range: 24.2 to 43.7%) for influenza hospital admissions; accuracy during epidemic peaks improved even further, by an average of 27.9% and 43.8%, respectively. Epimodulation also substantially enhanced the performance of complex forecasting methods, including the COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble model, demonstrating its broad utility in improving forecast reliability at critical moments in disease outbreaks.",

          "abstract": "In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), hyperactivated microglia produce inflammatory mediators that contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein expressed in many cell types, including neurons and microglia, plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis via its secretase-mediated processing to release the C-terminal 99-residue transmembrane fragment (C99) that is further cleaved to yield amyloid-β peptides. Voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1) have been implicated in microglial activation and release of inflammatory mediators, but the potential role of these channels in human microglia and AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived microglia (iMG) express native Hv1 channels with biophysical and pharmacological attributes determined by their coassembly with APP and that APP knockdown decreases Hv1 currents, suppressing cytokine and reactive oxygen species release. In HEK293T cells, APP is shown to increase current by favoring channel opening at more negative membrane potentials. C99 is sufficient to assemble with Hv1 and alters channel function even more significantly than APP. Coimmunoprecipitation, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and altered pharmacology further demonstrate that C99 forms stable complexes with Hv1 in the plasma membrane. In addition, we find that two early-onset AD mutations in APP (E682K and D694N) that reside within C99 significantly increase voltage-dependent channel activity beyond that induced by wild type C99, rationalizing their enhanced mediation of neuroinflammation.",

Here, we reveal that pHi plays a key role in regulating the stability of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3). Intracellular acidification markedly increases the half-life of ERK3, whereas alkalinization accelerates its degradation. The pH-dependent regulation of ERK3 is rapid, reversible, and consistent across cell types. Mechanistically, we identified a region in the C-terminus of ERK3 that contains pH-sensing motifs. We further show by quantitative proteomics that short-term acidification or alkalinization globally affects the cellular proteome. Our findings underscore the critical role of pHi in ERK3 turnover and suggest a broader role for pH in regulating protein stability and cell signaling.",

In a thin thread of PE solution sustained between two disks—whether wettable or nonwettable—these dipoles are reoriented by an axial electric field, aligning themselves with the field direction. This alignment causes significant axial elastic stresses and affects capillary self-thinning dynamics of the thread, slowing the process and potentially arresting it entirely, and even leading to oscillatory regimes. Accordingly, the evolution of the thread radius deviates significantly from the exponential decay characteristic of solutions of flexible polymer macromolecules and the linear decay characteristic of Newtonian fluids. At relatively high electric field strengths, in a thread where elastic stresses become dominant, an oscillatory regime emerges. Here, the cross-sectional radius not only decreases but also increases and oscillates in time—a behavior rooted in an ill-posedness of the problem reducing to the Laplace equation in case of strong electric fields. This indicates a manifestation of Hadamard instability. The theory is supported by experimental data acquired in this work.",

However, it is still unclear how these biases evolved. Nonhuman animals like primates and corvids share with humans a nonsymbolic number sense. Whether biases in magnitude estimation are evolutionarily widespread in animals remains an open question. We investigated numerical estimation in macaque monkeys and carrion crows—two distantly related but numerically proficient vertebrates—using a delayed match-to-numerosity task with dot arrays. Both species exhibited key biases commonly observed in humans during numerical estimation tasks: scalar variability (increasing response variability with numerosity), regression to the mean (overestimation of small and underestimation of large numerosities), and a sequential effect (estimates biased toward previous trial numerosities). Traditionally, these biases have been attributed either to static influences of overall task history or to dynamic effects from recent trials. Here, we demonstrate that a Bayesian model incorporating dynamic priors based on multiple previously encountered numerosities can account for all observed behavioral patterns. Our findings suggest that numerical judgments in both species are shaped by uncertainty and the integration of recent experience, revealing shared Bayesian-like mechanisms for cognitive biases across distantly related animals.",

          "abstract": "Soil salinization has emerged as a significant challenge for crop production worldwide. Xylem adjustments through plastic development and sodium unloading from root xylem, as mediated by sodium transporter HKT1, both play crucial roles in controlling sodium transport and salt tolerance in plants. Here, we report that XYLEM NAC DOMAIN 1 (XND1) of Arabidopsis contributes to the coordination of these two processes during salt stress responses. XND1 is predominantly accumulated in roots under salt exposure and confers plant salt tolerance, as demonstrated by analysis of overexpression and loss-of-function mutant lines. XND1 mediates discontinuous root protoxylem differentiation under salt stress, potentially limiting sodium transport. In addition, XND1 directly targets and activates the expression of HKT1 , thereby facilitating the removal of sodium from root xylem. We also show that MYBS2, a MYB transcription factor, interacts with XND1 to antagonistically regulate HKT1 , whereas VND-INTERACTING 2 (VNI2), a NAC transcription factor, activates XND1 in response to salt stress. Characterization of the XND1 ortholog of rice suggests a conserved regulatory role under salt stress. Collectively, our findings unveil an XND1-centered regulatory network that modulates salt stress response, through the integration of root xylem developmental plasticity and sodium unloading.",

By contextualizing single measurements, this framework shows that single-shot capability is not an intrinsic device property but emerges from the relationship between measurement precision and predictability. Implementing this approach with a custom measurement device at the ATLAS-3000 petawatt laser, we provide quantitative uncertainty bounds on pulse front tilt and curvature. Notably, we observe that our Bayesian method reduces uncertainty by up to 60% compared to traditional approaches.

Major perturbation of the global carbon (C) and sulfur (S) cycles is mainly inferred from marine δ 13 C and δ 34 S records, whereas few existing terrestrial records link δ 34 S fluctuations to widespread dispersal and fallout of volcanogenic sulfate aerosols. Mounting evidence, however, reveals that the collapse of P-Tr terrestrial ecosystems was diachronous, questioning a hypothesized globally synchronous common forcing. Here, we present records of pyritic multiple-S isotopes (δ 34 S py and Δ 33 S) and bulk organic δ 13 C for a paleotropical peatland drill core (HK-1) from Southwest China. The δ 34 S py variations define three distinct phases with a notable decline in δ 34 S py across the P-Tr transition, suggesting substantially elevated terrestrial sulfate influx coincident with major carbon cycle perturbation. Notably, overall small positive Δ 33 S values (+0.01 to +0.12‰) rule out a dominant role for stratospheric sulfates. Collectively, the observed changes in δ 13 C org , δ 34 S py , and Δ 33 S support catastrophic collapse of the Cathaysian Flora leading to intensified weathering and sulfate release. This inferred event, slightly after the P-Tr marine extinction, postdates by several 100-ky terrestrial floral collapse and perturbation of the C–S cycles documented in the high-latitude Sydney Basin. Cross-latitudinal diachroneity of terrestrial ecosystem collapse and consequent C–S perturbation challenges the hypothesis of a single, global volcanic driver. Rather, regional deforestation and its cascading effects overprinted on the global perturbations of biogeochemical cycles emerge here as critical factors shaping Earth’s largest recorded crisis.",

We report elevated cytosolic levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in neutrophils from patients with severe and critical COVID-19, correlating with enhanced NADPH oxidase–dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Using T2AA, a small-molecule inhibitor of the PCNA scaffold, we demonstrate potent suppression of NADPH oxidase activation and NET release, particularly in response to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Mechanistically, we identify a previously unrecognized interaction between PCNA and the heterodimeric S100A8/S100A9 (calprotectin), predominantly enriched in CD16 high CD62L low neutrophils expanded during COVID-19. PCNA binds the dimeric S100A8/S100A9 complex mediated via S100A8 subunit with micromolar affinity, and this interaction is abrogated by tetramerization, suggesting regulation by intracellular calcium. Disruption of this complex by T2AA inhibited ROS production in an S100A8/S100A9-dependent manner, implicating calprotectin as a functional regulator of neutrophil activation. In a betacoronavirus mouse model, T2AA treatment attenuated lung inflammation, reduced NET and calprotectin levels, and shifted pulmonary neutrophils away from hyperactivated and immunosuppressive phenotypes, consistent with immune reprogramming toward resolution. These findings establish cytosolic PCNA as a central scaffold in neutrophil hyperactivation during COVID-19 and highlight its pharmacological disruption as a promising host-directed strategy to limit inflammation and prevent organ damage.",

Building upon a computational model of reading, we used 7T functional MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to reveal a cortical hierarchy in which early visual areas (V1–V4) predominantly encode retinotopic information, whereas higher-level regions, including the visual word form area, transition to an ordinal letter-position code. MEG analyses confirm that retinotopic encoding emerges early (60 to 200 ms), followed by a shift toward ordinal representations in later time windows (220 to 450 ms). Despite this transition, word position remained a dominant factor across all time points, suggesting a concurrent coding of both retinotopic and abstract positional information. These findings uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the human brain transforms visual input into structured prelexical representations, shedding light on the cortical stages of reading and their developmental and clinical implications.",

          "abstract": "Many species of bacteria produce small-molecule antibiotics that enter and kill a wide range of competitor microbes. However, diffusible antibacterial proteins (ABPs) that share this broad-spectrum activity are not known to exist. Here, we report a family of proteins widespread in gram-positive bacteria that display potent antibacterial activity against a diverse range of target organisms. Upon entering susceptible cells, these ABPs enzymatically degrade essential cellular components including DNA, transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA), and ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). Unlike previously characterized bactericidal proteins, which require a specific cell surface receptor and therefore display a narrow spectrum of activity, we find that ABPs act in a receptor-independent manner and consequently kill bacteria spanning multiple phyla. Target cell entry by ABPs requires proteolytic activation by a cognate, coexported serine protease, and the liberated toxin component of the cleaved ABP is driven across the target cell membrane by the proton motive force. By examining representative ABPs from diverse pathogenic, commensal, and environmental bacteria, we show that broad-spectrum antibacterial activity is a conserved property of this protein family. Collectively, our work demonstrates that secreted proteins can act as broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting that ABPs represent one of potentially many such families produced in nature.",

Periodontitis is a prevalent, male-biased disease characterized by inflammation-driven bone loss, yet the mechanism(s) of this sex bias is unknown. This study explored whether enhanced inflammasome represents a causal mechanism for this bias. Analyses of three separate human studies (&gt;6,200 samples) show that males have significantly higher IL-1β in the gingival crevicular fluid than females during health and periodontitis. This pattern is experimentally reproduced with different versions of the ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model where males show greater IL-1β secretion than females. The inflammasome drives bone resorption in males but not females as revealed by analyses of inflammasome gene-deletion mice. Pharmacologic treatment with a caspase-1/4 inhibitor reduces inflammatory cell infiltration, dampens osteoclastogenesis signaling (via the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B pathway), and prevents bone resorption in males but not females during experimental periodontitis. While ovariectomized females show no change in their nonresponsiveness to caspase-1/4 inhibition, orchiectomized males no longer respond to the inhibition, suggesting the importance of an intact male reproductive system in the mediation of this inhibition. Thus, our study identifies inflammasome activation as causal for male-biased experimental periodontitis and supports sex-stratified studies to foster future advancement of inflammasome therapeutics in periodontics.",

          "abstract": "Enhancers regulate gene expression by physically contacting their target promoters, yet these contacts often span large genomic distances. Phase-separated condensates (droplet-like clusters) of transcription factors (TFs) are thought to facilitate such long-range enhancer–promoter (E-P) communication, but the quantitative principles underlying this mechanism remain unclear. Here, we use polymer-based chromatin simulations to systematically vary the strength of TF clustering and the E-P genomic distance, examining their combined effects on E-P contact formation. We find that E-P contact frequency shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the degree of TF clustering: Contact frequency peaks at an intermediate TF abundance and TF–TF affinity, leading to a “golden mean” optimum. Two distinct regimes emerge: Under weak TF–TF attraction, contact probability increases with condensate size, whereas strong TF attraction produces a peaked response that declines at high condensation levels. These results indicate that TF condensate acts as a tunable “rheostat,” buffering E-P interactions against increasing genomic distances. However, excessive TF clustering leads to molecular crowding and competition that ultimately impair E-P communication. Our study, consistent with recent experiments, establishes a mechanistic framework at the molecular level, where balanced TF condensation enables robust long-range E-P communication, reconciling the stochastic nature of chromatin dynamics with the fidelity of gene regulation.",

O -Glucose glycans are transferred to serine residues located between the first and second conserved cysteines within the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats in the Notch extracellular domain. Previously, O -glucose glycans were shown to be extended to a trisaccharide structure with two xyloses via α1-3 linkages. Our recent studies, however, indicated that the O -glucose glycan on NOTCH1 EGF10 can be extended by hexose and Neu5Ac. Here, we demonstrated that this hexose- and Neu5Ac-extended glycan has a 3’-sialyllactose-like structure synthesized by specific members of two isoenzyme families, B4GALT1 and ST3GAL4. Using mass spectrometry, we identified this modification exclusively on NOTCH1 EGF10 and the analogous NOTCH3 EGF9 domain, with no detection in any other EGF domains in NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH3. Sequence comparison and mutagenesis experiments identified one amino acid at position -2 of the fourth cysteine (C 4 -2) in the EGF domain as crucial for the galactose elongation of O -glucose glycans. We further demonstrated that this site-specific elongation of O -glucose on NOTCH1 EGF10 significantly impacts ligand binding and signal transduction of NOTCH1. In the context of early T cell development, the C 4 -2 mutants NOTCH1 A396Y and A396F enhance T cell differentiation through DLL1- and DLL4-dependent NOTCH1 signaling. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the intricate regulatory mechanisms of Notch receptor function mediated by distinct positions and structures of O -glycans.",

We used YeMaP for high-throughput screening of 8,000 pheromone sequences and identified peptides with improved agonism or antagonism action. We found that these peptides can be applied in a native fungal system such as the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum , to control hyphal chemotropism and reduce plant root penetration. Additionally, we utilized YeMaP in a one-pot assay to investigate how abiotic factors influence the communication of multiple pheromone–GPCR combinations and found that the cell–cell communication mediated by the GPCR Ste2 from F. oxysporum signaled robustly across different abiotic factors, while other fungal GPCR–pheromone interactions were more sensitive to changes. Taken together, YeMaP accelerates the identification of fungal GPCR–peptide interactions by enabling one-pot assays, and serves as a model system for studying fungal cell–cell communication.",

          "abstract": "Agonist-induced activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P 2 ] to diacylglycerol (DAG) at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM). DAG can be enzymatically transformed into phosphatidic acid (PA) and accumulated at the PM. PYK2 N-terminal domain-interacting receptor 2 (Nir2) mediates the formation of ER–PM membrane contact sites (MCSs) by specifically recognizing PA at the PM and directly interacting with ER membrane protein vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins (VAPs). The N-terminal phosphatidylinositol transfer protein domain of Nir2 facilitates PI/PA exchange at ER–PM MCSs to maintain PI and PA levels. Here, we reveal the mechanisms by which Nir2 senses phosphatidic acid (PA) and associates with membranes, based on three crystal structures of its C-terminal Lipin/Ned1/Smp2 (LNS2) domain bound to PA, the diphenylalanine [FF]–containing acidic tract (FFAT) motif complexed with vesicle-associated membrane protein–associated protein B/C (VAPB), and the Asp-Asp-His-Asp (DDHD) domain. The C-terminal LNS2 domain of Nir2 directly interacts with the phosphate in the headgroup of PA via hydrogen bonds involving S1025, T1065, K1103, and K1126. Formation of a salt bridge between E355 in Nir2 and R55 in VAPB is essential for Nir2 FFAT–VAPB interaction. The central DDHD domain of Nir2 forms a twofold symmetric dimer, and this self-association contributes to stable and tight membrane association. These findings reveal how Nir2-mediated ER–PM MCS formation maintains continued PI(4,5)P 2 -dependent PLC signaling.",

Here, we identify a sequence motif in the HLA-E cytoplasmic tail that enables rapid internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) through interaction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex. Following internalization, HLA-E is routed to endosomes, where the same cytoplasmic motif and peptide loading together facilitate its reappearance on the cell surface—a process influenced by valosin-containing protein (VCP).

In our cryo-EM data at pH 4.0, we identified and segregated asymmetric particles, which we precisely aligned to resolve high-resolution structures of several previously unresolved asymmetric intermediate states, in addition to symmetric closed and open states. Detailed structural analysis revealed systematic conformational changes at individual subunits driving the channel opening. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to assign the functional states. We further examined the roles of the F116 and Y251 residues, located at the domain interface, playing a central role in interdomain communication. In addition, patch-clamp experiments on GLIC I240A and L241A mutants, located in the M2 helix, demonstrated their importance in channel gating. Together, these results shed light on the sequential and asymmetric conformational transitions that occur during GLIC activation, offering a deeper mechanistic understanding of asymmetric gating in pLGICs.",

Here, we examined the relationship between exposure to PNMI and neurite density in the hippocampus and its subfields among offspring during late middle age. Participants included 72 mother–offspring dyads from the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) cohort. Data for four inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA], and soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor-II) were available from first- and second-trimester maternal sera. Neurite density in the offspring hippocampus and its subfields was estimated using microstructural modeling of offspring’s diffusion-weighted MRI data (mean age of offspring at imaging = 59 y; 51% male). We estimated the relationship between each biomarker and region-of-interest’s neurite density. Higher first-trimester maternal IL-1RA and IL-6 levels were associated with lower offspring hippocampal neurite density. These relationships were specific to the Cornu Ammonis 3, Cornu Ammonis 4, dentate gyrus, and subiculum subfields. In addition, higher second-trimester IL-6 was associated with lower subiculum neurite density. Our findings reveal that exposure to heightened prenatal levels of maternal inflammation is linked to altered offspring hippocampal microstructure in late middle age, which could have implications for memory decreases during this period and may be relevant for understanding the risk of aging-related cognitive changes.",

          "abstract": "Animals respond to sensory stimuli with motor actions, which in turn generate new sensory inputs. This sensorimotor loop is constrained by time delays that impose a trade-off between responsiveness and stability. Additionally, as the relationship between a motor command and the corresponding sensory feedback is context-dependent, the response must be adapted in real time. It is generally believed that this adaptation process relies on an internal model that is continuously updated through prediction error minimization. Here, we experimentally reveal an alternative strategy based on a simpler feedback mechanism that does not require any internal model. We developed a virtual reality system for the miniature transparent fish Danionella cerebrum that enables in vivo brain-wide imaging during fictive navigation. By systematically manipulating the feedback parameters, we dissected the motor control process that allows the animal to stabilize its position using optic flow. The sensorimotor loop can be fully described by a single delay differential equation, whose solutions quantitatively capture the observed behavior across all experimental conditions. Both behavioral and neural data indicate that the observed adaptive response arises from logarithmic nonlinearities at the sensory (Weber–Fechner law) and motor (Henneman’s size principle) ends. These fundamental properties of the nervous system, conserved across species and sensory modalities, have traditionally been interpreted in terms of efficient coding. Our findings unveil a distinct functional role for such nonlinear transformations: ensuring stability in sensorimotor control despite inherent delays and sensory uncertainty.",

At puberty, hypothalamic Kiss1 neurons release kisspeptin, stimulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release and activating the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis. Here, we show that Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus ( Kiss1 ARC ) of female mice undergo profound intrinsic plasticity at puberty. Kiss1 ARC neurons in brain slices from 3-wk-old mice, when depolarized, typically fire a short high-frequency burst of action potentials before falling silent. This would make them unsuitable for the sustained activity that is required to activate pulsatile GnRH secretion and the HPG axis. At 4 wk of age and after puberty, Kiss1 ARC neurons can fire a sustained train of action potentials. There is a concomitant hyperpolarization in action potential threshold and postspike minimum voltage and larger medium after-hyperpolarizations (mAHP) and hyperpolarization-induced voltage sags. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant changes in ion channel expression after puberty. Using quantitative PCR, we confirmed changes in genes encoding voltage-gated sodium, calcium, potassium, and cation channels. Blocking hyperpolarization-induced cation channels caused Kiss1 ARC neurons from postpuberty mice to fire less sustained trains of action potentials. Recordings from Kiss1 ARC neurons in mice after ovariectomy and 17β-estradiol replacement revealed a critical window of estrogen-dependent plasticity between 3 and 6 wk, which is essential for the maturation of Kiss1 ARC neurons and the development of their adult electrophysiological activity. This represents an example of sex steroid–dependent plasticity in the mammalian brain at puberty.",

          "abstract": "Cullin Ring E3 Ligases (CRLs) belong to the largest family of multisubunit ubiquitin E3 ligases. A cullin serves as the scaffold protein that recruits E3 ligases and substrate receptors in a CRL complex, whose activity requires cullin neddylation, a posttranslational modification that can be pharmacologically targeted by neddylation inhibitors. Elevated neddylation activity has been observed in the liver and adipose tissue of obese mice, implicating a pathogenic link between altered CRL activity and the development of metabolic disorders. Emerging evidence has also shown that neddylation inhibitors possess antiobesity and hypoglycemic property. However, the roles of cullin proteins in regulating adipocyte biology are still incompletely defined. Here, we report that pan neddylation inhibitor TAS4464 treatment reversed obesity and adipose inflammation, resulting in improved hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity in obese mice. Among all mammalian cullin proteins that were targeted by TAS4464, we identified that cullin 3 (Cul3) was required for adipogenesis and adipocyte hypertrophy. A complete absence of Cul3 in adipocytes caused severely inhibited adipose expansion associated with ectopic fat accumulation in the liver and brown adipose tissue and insulin resistance, while adipocyte-specific Cul3 haploinsufficiency attenuated obesity and improved overall metabolic homeostasis, which recapitulated the metabolic benefits of TAS4464. Mechanistically, we found that Cul3 inhibition caused adipose nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) stabilization, which contributed to impaired adipogenesis by inhibiting lipogenesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that Cul3 is required during adipogenesis and acts as a downstream mediator of the antiobesity effect of pan neddylation inhibitors.",

Despite its clinical significance, the endogenous role of SerpinB3 has remained undefined. Here, we identify SerpinB3 as a mediator of epithelial wound healing. Injury induces SerpinB3 expression in vitro and in vivo in the migrating epidermal tongue; overexpression of the protein promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition–like changes. Recombinant Serpinb3a, the mouse ortholog, enhances re-epithelialization in vitro and accelerates wound closure and collagen remodeling in vivo. These findings reveal a physiological function for SerpinB3 in epithelial repair and suggest that its expression in cancer, chronic wounds, and inflammatory diseases may reflect reactivation of a conserved wound response program—positioning SerpinB3 as a compelling therapeutic target.",

          "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection causes encephalitis in humans and animals. Following intradermal infection, JEV crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and reaches target cells in the brain parenchyma. However, the cellular dynamics and pathological niches involved in JEV neuroinvasion remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the early stages of JEV infection in the mouse brain employing a highly multiplexed spatial transcriptomics platform to map viral RNA and host gene expressions in intact brain sections at a single-cell resolution. Although JEV RNA was undetectable in brain sections at 1-day postinfection (dpi), innate immune responses were transiently activated across the brain. At 4 dpi, we detected limited viral RNA and mapped its spatial distribution, identifying glial cells surrounding microvessels as early targets of brain infection. We further characterized transcriptional changes in infected and surrounding bystander cells, revealing cell-type–specific antiviral responses. Notably, JEV neuroinvasion led to the downregulation of endothelial tight junction genes, indicative of an early event that precedes BBB impairment during subsequent disease progression. Our spatial transcriptomic analysis provides insights into cell-type– and region-specific responses to JEV infection, and highlights the early role of glial cells in shaping the immune response landscape of the brain. These findings greatly improve our understanding of JEV pathogenesis before the onset of clinical encephalitis.",

          "abstract": "Bone pain is a presenting feature of bone cancers such as osteosarcoma (OS), relayed by skeletal-innervating peripheral afferent neurons. Potential functions of tumor-associated sensory neurons in bone cancers beyond pain sensation are unknown. To uncover neural regulatory functions, a chemical-genetic approach in mice with a knock-in allele for TrkA was used to functionally perturb sensory nerve innervation during OS growth and disease progression. TrkA inhibition in transgenic mice led to significant reductions in sarcoma-associated sensory innervation and vascularization, skewed tumor associated macrophage polarization, reduced tumor growth and metastasis, and prolonged overall survival. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that sarcoma denervation was associated with phenotypic alterations in both OS tumor cells and cells within the tumor microenvironment, and with reduced calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. Multimodal and multiomics analyses of human OS bone samples further implicated peripheral innervation and neurotrophin signaling in OS tumor biology. Next and in two parallel approaches to inhibit nerve ingrowth, we repurposed FDA-approved bupivacaine liposomes and separately blocked CGRP signaling using FDA-approved Rimegepant. Both strategies led to significant reductions in sarcoma growth, vascularity, and sarcoma-induced hyperalgesia. In sum, TrkA-expressing peripheral neurons positively regulate key aspects of OS progression and sensory neural inhibition disrupts CGRP signaling within the sarcoma microenvironment leading to significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival. These data suggest that interventions to prevent pathological innervation of OS represent an adjunctive therapy to improve clinical outcomes and survival.",

          "abstract": "Animals navigate their environment stably without inefficient course corrections despite unavoidable errors. In humans, this stability is achieved by modulating the placement of the foot on each step such that recent errors are corrected. However, it is unknown whether animals with diverse nervous systems and body mechanics use such foot placement control; foot trajectories of many-legged animals are considered to be stereotypical velocity-driven patterns, as opposed to error-driven. Here, we put forth a unified “feedforward-feedback” control structure for stable locomotion that combines velocity-driven and body state error-driven foot placement. We provide empirical support for this control structure across flies, mice, and humans by mining their natural locomotor variability, finding that a competing control structure with purely velocity-driven foot placement is not supported by the data. This work finds shared behavioral signatures of foot placement control in flies, mice, and humans. We find that key characteristics of these signatures, such as their urgency and centralization, vary with neuromechanical embodiment across species. For example, more inherently stable multilegged animals exhibit less urgent control with a lower control magnitude and a slower correction timescale compared to humans. Furthermore, many-legged animals display modular, direction-, and leg-specific control signatures, whereas humans exhibit common signatures across both legs. Overall, our findings provide insight into stable locomotion across species, revealing how species with diverse neuromechanics achieve a shared functional goal: foot placement control.",

A frontier of this field is designing cell-permeable multifunctional ligands that contain fluorophores in combination with affinity tags or pharmacological agents. This is challenging since attachment of additional chemical moieties onto fluorescent ligands can adversely affect membrane permeability. To address this problem, we examined the chemical properties of rhodamine-based self-labeling tag ligands through the lens of medicinal chemistry. We found that the lactone–zwitterion equilibrium constant ( K L–Z ) of rhodamines inversely correlates with their distribution coefficients (log D 7.4 ), suggesting that ligands based on dyes exhibiting low K L–Z and high log D 7.4 values, such as Si-rhodamines, would efficiently enter cells. We designed cell-permeable multifunctional HaloTag ligands with a biotin moiety to purify mitochondria or a JQ1 appendage to translocate BRD4 within the nucleus. We found that translocation of BRD4 to constitutive heterochromatin in cells leads to apparent increases in transcriptional activity. These fluorescent reagents enable affinity capture and translocation of intracellular proteins in living cells, and our general design concepts will facilitate the design of multifunctional chemical tools for biology.",

          "abstract": "Signaling pathways induce stereotyped transcriptional changes as stem cells progress into mature cell types during embryogenesis. Signaling perturbations are necessary to discover which genes are responsive or insensitive to pathway activity. However, gene regulation is additionally dependent on cell state-specific factors like chromatin modifications or transcription factor binding. Thus, transcriptional profiles need to be assayed in single cells to identify potentially multiple, distinct perturbation responses among heterogeneous cell states in an embryo. In perturbation studies, comparing heterogeneous transcriptional states among experimental conditions often requires samples to be collected over multiple independent experiments, which can introduce confounding batch effects. We present Design-Aware Integration of Single Cell ExpEriments (DAISEE), a new algorithm that models perturbation responses in single-cell datasets collected according to complex experimental designs. We demonstrate that DAISEE improves upon a previously available integrative nonnegative matrix factorization framework, more efficiently separating perturbation responses from confounding variation. We use DAISEE to integrate newly collected single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from 5-h-old zebrafish embryos expressing optimized photoswitchable MEK (psMEK), which globally activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a signaling molecule involved in many cell specification events. psMEK drives some cells that are normally not exposed to ERK signals toward other wild type states and induces novel states expressing early-acting endothelial genes. Overactive signaling is therefore capable of producing unexpected gene expression states in developing embryos.",

The study of how these inclusions influence material fields has driven critical advances across multiple disciplines, from composite materials and solid-state physics to biomechanics and geophysics. Eshelby revolutionized this field with the equivalent inclusion method (EIM), transforming inhomogeneous problems into homogeneous ones by introducing an equivalent eigen-strain. However, determining Eshelby’s equivalent eigen-strain for arbitrary inclusions has remained a long-standing challenge. Here, we resolve this challenge and applied the EIM to multiphysics problems, deriving three-dimensional universal exact solutions in Fourier space for the generalized equivalent eigenfield, encompassing eigen-strain, eigen-electric, and eigen-magnetic fields. These solutions apply to both single and multiple inclusions of arbitrary shape, inhomogeneity, and anisotropy. Our results yield exact expressions for the effective properties of magnetoelectroelastic composites. We demonstrate the framework’s versatility through complex multiphase applications, including a general expression for stress intensity factors of arbitrarily shaped cracks, a criterion for designing auxetic materials via engineered elastic inhomogeneities and an optimized pathway to enhance magnetoelectric coupling. This work establishes a universal approach to multiphysics inhomogeneous inclusion problems, rooted in multiple disciplines and spanning multiple length scales.

          "abstract": "Magnons offer a promising path toward energy-efficient information transmission and the development of next-generation classical and quantum computing technologies. However, efficiently exciting, manipulating, and detecting magnons remains a critical need. We show that magnons, despite their charge-neutrality, can induce electric polarization through their spin and orbital moments. This effect is governed by system symmetry, magnon band hybridization, and interactions with other quasiparticles. We calculate the electric polarization induced by magnons in two-dimensional collinear honeycomb and noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs), showing that the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction yields a finite net electric polarization. In NiPSe 3 , a collinear honeycomb AFM with Zigzag order, the induced net electric polarization is about three orders of magnitude greater than in MnPS 3 , a collinear honeycomb AFM with Néel phase. In the noncollinear AFM KFe 3 (OH) 6 (SO 4 ) 2 , the net electric polarization can be tuned via magnon hybridization, which can be controlled by external magnetic fields. These findings reveal that electric fields could be used to both detect and manipulate magnons under certain conditions by leveraging their spin and orbital angular moment. They also suggest that the discovery or engineering of materials with substantial magnon orbital moments could enhance practical uses of magnons for future computing and information transmission applications.",

          "abstract": "RNAs are major drivers of phase separation in the formation of biomolecular condensates and can undergo protein-free phase separation in the presence of divalent ions or crowding agents. Much remains to be understood regarding how the complex interplay of base stacking, base pairing, electrostatics, ion interactions, and particularly structural propensities governs RNA phase behavior. Here, we develop an intermediate resolution model for condensates of RNAs (iConRNA) that can capture key local and long-range structural features of dynamic RNAs and simulate their spontaneous phase transitions with Mg 2+ . Representing each nucleotide using 6 to 7 beads, iConRNA accurately captures base stacking and pairing and includes explicit Mg 2+ . The model not only reproduces major conformational properties of poly(rA) and poly(rU) but also correctly folds small structured RNAs and predicts their melting temperatures. With an effective model of explicit Mg 2+ , iConRNA successfully recapitulates experimentally observed lower critical solution temperature phase separation of poly(rA) and triplet repeats, and critically, the nontrivial dependence of phase transitions on RNA sequence, length, concentration, and Mg 2+ level. Further mechanistic analysis reveals a key role of RNA folding in modulating phase separation as well as its temperature and ion dependence, besides other driving forces such as Mg 2+ –phosphate interactions, base stacking, and base pairing. These studies also support iConRNA as a powerful tool for direct simulation of RNA-driven phase transitions, enabling molecular studies of how RNA conformational dynamics and its response to complex condensate environments control the phase behavior and condensate material properties.",

          "abstract": "Speciation often results from the accumulation of reproductive isolation associated with lineage divergence, but secondary contact between diverged lineages can reshape the trajectory of speciation and reveal its underlying processes. The Indonesian island of Sulawesi is a tectonically complex island formed by the fusion of many paleo-islands, resulting in replicated cases of secondary contact among once-isolated lineages. Unlike secondary contact on continents where hybridization often results from unpredictable range shifts, Sulawesi’s fauna presents a replicated set of geologically constrained natural experiments to test how the magnitude of evolutionary divergence predicts outcomes of secondary contact and hybridization. Using thousands of genome-wide loci from Eutropis sun skinks spanning Wallace’s Line on Sulawesi and Borneo, we reconstructed a reticulate evolutionary history shaped by overwater dispersal, isolation, island fusion, hybridization, and character displacement. We delimited five distinct species (three undescribed) and uncovered multiple ancient hybridization events following island fusion leading to distinct outcomes. These outcomes—speciation reversal, parapatry, and sympatry putatively through reproductive character displacement—were associated with increasing levels of prior divergence consistent with evolutionary theory. Sympatry, specifically, was preceded by substantial introgressive hybridization and body size divergence that likely confers reproductive incompatibility. Together, these results provide empirical support for divergence-dependent tipping points along the speciation continuum. The sun skink radiation also includes a rare instance of reverse colonization of Borneo across Wallace’s Line that established a narrowly divergent species with a uniquely intermediate body size absent from Sulawesi.",

Thus, there is enormous interest in elucidating the biosynthetic pathways that are responsible for the production of these compounds.

Recent advances in both single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell mass spectrometry metabolomics (scMS) have enabled the measurement of either gene expression or metabolite levels in individual cells. However, these datasets can only be used to indirectly correlate gene expression levels with metabolite concentrations at the single-cell level.

However, no genetic data have been obtained from any of these late Neanderthals, some being inaccessible or badly preserved. Starosele is a notable site which has undergone excavations in recent years. We used collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry, ZooMS), to screen for potential human remains among thousands of fragmented bones from the site. Of the 150 bone fragments we analyzed, 97.3% had sufficient collagen preservation for taxonomic identification. Our results suggest Paleolithic humans primarily hunted horses. One ~5 cm bone fragment yielded peptide mass fingerprints matching Hominidae . Radiocarbon dating revealed an age range of 46 to 45,000 y old, close to the transition from the disappearance of Neanderthals to the dispersal of H. sapiens in western Europe. We sequenced a twofold coverage mitochondrial genome from this bone, indicating the individual belongs to the Neanderthal lineage. The mitogenome clusters with other Neanderthal mitogenomes previously generated from the Russian Altai region. Alongside this, an analysis of the lithic corpus from both regions suggests that a wider Neanderthal dispersal, linked to the Micoquian stone tool industry, occurred after ~60,000 y ago. We assessed the paleoclimate connection (temperature and precipitation) between these locations and identified a high habitat suitability corridor along 55°N, suggesting that the long-distance movement of Neanderthals would have been facilitated by periods of favorable climate.",

          "abstract": "Serial order memory, a key type of episodic representation, requires the encoding of map–like context information (interitem relationships) to facilitate recall. In rodent models, both spatial and nonspatial order memory depend heavily on the hippocampus. However, in humans, lesional and neurophysiological data also implicate extrahippocampal areas, especially the orbital frontal cortex and medial parietal regions, in these mnemonic abilities. To investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms of order information in human memory, we used direct brain recordings from hippocampal–cortical circuits as neurosurgical patients performed a serial recall task. Our unique dataset included simultaneous acquisition of data from the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate regions. Focusing on ripple events, we demonstrate distinct interregional dynamics during successful order memory encoding using temporally precise, simultaneous recordings across these circuits. The relative timing of co-rippling events implicates theta oscillations in cross-regional integration, particularly between the hippocampus and PCC, and we show that ripple rate, but not ripple duration, is correlated with the quantity of encoded order information. Notably, we find evidence for theta phase coding of serial position for early list items. We link our findings with computational and anatomical models of episodic memory processing as well as general theories of temporal binding facilitated by co-rippling events.

          "abstract": "Precise and accurate geochronology is essential for reconstructing Earth’s history and coeval life evolution. The Early Triassic was a critical time interval following the greatest Phanerozoic mass extinction, recording remarkable biotic changes and a series of environmental and climatic upheavals. Its geochronology remains, however, rather poorly constrained and highly debated. Here, we present high-precision zircon U-Pb dates for four ash beds from the Induan in South China, along with carbon isotope data. We use coupled Bayesian eruption age and Bayesian age–depth models to estimate the ages of our ash beds and to reinterpret the published ages of 25 ash beds from other four sections in South China, as well as to construct new age–depth models for each section. Our new age–depth models, integrated with biostratigraphic data, yield new age estimates for the following boundaries: Permian–Triassic (~251.867 Ma), Griesbachian–Dienerian (~251.562 Ma), Induan–Olenekian (~250.626 Ma), Smithian–Spathian (~249.236 Ma), and Olenekian–Anisian (~246.979 Ma). Calibration of the Early Triassic carbon isotopic record using the new age model reveals highly variable rates of individual carbon isotope excursions. For instance, the negative excursion across the Permian–Triassic boundary exhibits a rate of approximately −11.7‰ per 100 kyr—nearly seven times faster than the early Smithian negative excursion rate of approximately −1.7‰ per 100 kyr. This refined age model also provides a robust temporal framework to evaluate the tempo of biotic evolution in the aftermath of the Permian–Triassic mass extinction.",

          "abstract": "Recent experimental findings challenge the traditional belief that vigilance is solely attributed to the sensorimotor system, suggesting instead that hippocampal activity, coupled with locomotor processes, enhances environmental sampling and planning. Here, we propose that hippocampal theta-nested gamma oscillations (TGOs), widely observed in experiments, play essential roles in both prediction and vigilance, in terms of recalling reward sites and avoiding unexpected dangers through synfire chains (SFCs). Despite the recognized importance of TGOs in navigation, their precise functional roles remain unclear. By building a biologically plausible spiking neuronal network model and reproducing experimental results, we leverage SFC properties-length and separation-to reveal that the positive correlation between theta frequency and motion velocity optimally balances planning for predictable events and staying alert to unexpected ones. Based on this adaptive mechanism, we further explain the distinct functional contributions of TGOs consistent with experimental findings: Theta oscillations facilitate self-location awareness, gamma oscillations enhance predictive capabilities, and their coupling ensures sufficient time windows for prediction. Our study provides insights into the functional roles of TGOs in the hippocampus, highlighting their importance in achieving both planning and vigilance during goal-directed navigation.",

          "abstract": "There is evidence that the self-assembly of complex molecular systems often proceeds hierarchically, by first building subunits that later assemble in larger entities, in a process that can repeat multiple times. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon and its performance is limited. Here, we introduce a simple model for hierarchical addressable self-assembly, where interactions between particles can be optimized to maximize the fraction of a well-formed target structure, or yield. We find that a hierarchical strategy leads to an impressive yield up to at least five generations of the hierarchy and does not require a cycle of temperatures as used in previous methods. High yield is obtained when the microscopic interaction decreases with the scale of units considered, such that the total interaction between intermediate structures remains identical at all scales. We provide thermodynamic and dynamical arguments constraining the interaction strengths where this strategy is effective. Overall, our work characterizes an alternative strategy for addressable self-assembly at a fixed temperature, and provides insight into the mechanisms sustaining hierarchical assembly in biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Hematophagous mosquitoes use CO 2 as a key arousal signal that gates behavioral responses to host-derived cues. In Aedes aegypti , CO 2 is detected by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) housed in the sensory hairs (sensilla) on the maxillary palp. While the molecular mechanism and behavioral significance of CO 2 sensing have been well studied in mosquitoes, the nanoscale three-dimensional structures of their CO 2 -sensing ORNs and associated cells have remained unclear. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we characterize the CO 2 -sensing cpA neuron and its odor-sensitive neighbors, cpB and cpC, within the capitate sensilla of A. aegypti. Notably, cpA neurons are significantly larger, with an outer dendritic surface area 8 to 12 times greater than that of cpB and cpC neurons. This expanded CO 2 -sensing surface arises from its unique architecture, consisting of numerous flattened dendritic sheets folded into intricate lamellae. In contrast, cpB and cpC dendrites exhibit sparse, narrow cylindrical branches. Moreover, the cpA axon displays a prominent pearls-on-a-string morphology, with numerous mitochondria-rich, nonsynaptic varicosities connected by thin cables. Remarkably, a glial cell and an auxiliary cell together ensheathe the cpA soma but not cpB or cpC, suggesting a specialized role in supporting cpA function. Compared to Drosophila CO 2 -sensitive ORNs, a larger portion of the cpA outer dendrite is embedded within the sensillum cuticle, potentially improving access to environmental CO 2 . These findings reveal key morphological specializations of cpA neurons, thereby advancing our understanding of mosquito sensory biology and laying the groundwork for future studies on the molecular basis and functional ramifications of these anatomical adaptations.",

          "abstract": "In multicellular organisms, sensory perception affects many aspects of behavior and physiology. Perception of environmental stressors like food scarcity often leads to physiological changes that promote survival and slow aging. However, recent work shows that perception of attractive food smells can block the health benefits of dietary restriction in multiple model organisms. While it is known that sensory perception and cell nonautonomous signaling can modulate health and longevity, our knowledge of the specific sensory cues and mechanistic pathways that define this signaling is still limited. Here we find that the sense of touch interacts with nutritional state to modulate lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans . Worms subjected to dietary restriction are shorter-lived when they perceive tactile stimuli that mimic bacterial food and/or protective soil. Touch modulation of dietary restriction requires putative mechanoreceptor proteins, the neurotransmitters dopamine and tyramine/adrenaline, and the neuropeptides INS-11 and GnRH. Ultimately, the touch circuit regulates the longevity effectors DAF-2/IGF1R and FMO-2/FMO5. These results establish a physiological touch circuit and connect neural reward pathways to the growth and reproductive axes. Finding that texture mechanosensation can modulate longevity suggests a role for touch in lifespan.",

We use MoBa’s genetic data to compute polygenic indices for educational attainment ( PGI EA ). Importantly, MoBa includes genetic data on mother-father-child trios, allowing us to identify causal genetic effects using within-family variation. We calculate school value-added measures from Norwegian register data, allowing us to causally estimate school quality effects. Leveraging the advantages of both data sources, we provide a causally identified study of gene–environment interactions in the school context. We find evidence for substitutability of PGI EA and school quality in reading but not numeracy: A 1 SD increase of school quality decreases the impact of a 1 SD increase of PGI EA on reading test scores by 6%. The substitutability arises through gains of students at the lower end of the PGI EA distribution. This suggests that investments in school quality may help reduce educational inequalities arising from genetic differences between students.",

Using microscopy, we show that plant cell shape and chloroplast size achieve both goals: dense monolayer packing for optimal absorption in low light and sidewall packing for light avoidance. We present a theoretical model using random close packing simulations of polydispersed hard disks in rectangular boxes and find optimal cell shapes that match plant cell measurements. Our findings highlight how particle packing principles under confinement enable light adaptation in plants, offering insights into organelle organization under confinement, a physical challenge relevant across biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Epithelial cells are inherently contractile and in homeostasis, tissue integrity is maintained by balancing the uneven contractile forces in neighboring cells at the cell–cell interface. By contrast, epithelial cells can utilize an imbalance in contractile force to communicate various information to induce tissue-wide response as in wound healing. Contractility is generated and processed at the apical junctional complex (AJC) by the dynamic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton. Calcium signaling can pattern cellular responses based on its reach and amplitude and the actin cytoskeleton is supported by its wide ranging effects on actin regulators. Calcium transients regulate various cell behaviors associated with actin remodeling, such as in damage response and developmental morphogenesis. Here, we report that calcium maintains an adaptive pool of AJC-associated actin that is sensitive to tension and encoded by calcium dynamics. For this, the recently identified epithelial polarity module Homer-MUPP1/PatJ is required. Homer regulates calcium signaling in various tissue contexts through interaction with numerous components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) calcium signal toolkit. Knockout of either Homer or MUPP1/PatJ attenuated tension-induced calcium response and severely disrupted wound healing migration, which is dependent on guidance input through AJC tension. We also show that Homer is integral to early embryonic neurodevelopment as its suppression causes failure of neural tube closure. Our findings highlight the critical role of localized calcium dynamics on AJC actin remodeling and cellular behavior, elucidating the means of tissue coordination through intercellular tension.",

However, neither the magnitude nor the distribution of CaCO 3 dissolution in the modern oceans is well constrained. Here we diagnose CaCO 3 dissolution rates in major oceanic regions and reconstruct CaCO 3 settling flux using a data-constrained ocean circulation model and observational climatologies of global seawater alkalinity and dissolved oxygen. Our approach distinguishes the effects of ocean circulation and CaCO 3 dissolution on seawater alkalinity and dissolved oxygen, and involves only one free parameter, a restoring timescale, which is constrained by compiling carbonate export rates estimated in the literature. We find that CaCO 3 dissolution in shallow waters (above the saturation horizon of aragonite) is much smaller than some recent estimates. Excluding the upper 114 m of the euphotic zone, the fraction of CaCO 3 dissolution within aragonite saturated waters is only about 16.5 ± 5.5%. About 39.8 ± 4.5% of CaCO 3 dissolution occurs below the aragonite saturation horizon but above the saturation horizon of calcite. The remaining 43.7 ± 3.8% dissolves in the deep ocean in undersaturated seawater. These results suggest that the seawater CaCO 3 saturation state is the primary control on CaCO 3 dissolution in the ocean.",

          "abstract": "Body size variation in vertebrates is a complex polygenic trait, tightly correlated with numerous aspects of a species’ biology, ecology, and physiology. Miniaturization, the extreme reduction of adult body size, is a common phenomenon across the Tree of Life, yet the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of body size evolution in goby fishes, a clade encompassing some of the smallest vertebrates on Earth. We generate a genome-wide phylogeny for 162 Gobioidei species and perform comparative transcriptomics across three clades with repeated instances of miniaturization and large-bodied forms. We identified 54 differentially expressed one-to-one orthologs between miniature and large-bodied species. These genes reveal distinct functional profiles, suggesting that regulation of cell numbers is a key mechanism governing body size control. Miniature species consistently overexpress growth inhibitors like CDKN1B and ING2 , associated with tighter cell cycle regulation and decreased proliferation rates, while large-bodied species upregulate growth-promoting genes such as TGFB3 , linked to tissue development and growth signaling. These enriched functional pathways, conserved since the Eocene (50 Ma), suggest macroevolutionary convergence in size regulation over deep time. Our findings provide insights into how size determination is governed at a genetic level and highlights the importance of exploring these factors in nonmodel organisms to uncover the fundamental processes regulating vertebrate body size evolution.",

In mammals, CO formation is mediated by a conserved set of pro-CO proteins via mechanisms that remain unclear. Here, we characterize a mammalian pro-CO factor HEIP1. In mouse HEIP1 is essential for crossover and fertility of both sexes. HEIP1 promotes crossover by orchestrating the recruitment of other pro-CO proteins, including the MutSγ complex (MSH4-MSH5) and E3 ligases (HEI10, RNF212, and RNF212B), that are required to mature CO sites and recruit the CO-specific resolution complex MutLγ. Moreover, HEIP1 directly interacts with HEI10, suggesting a direct role in controlling the recruitment of pro-CO E3 ligases. During early stages of meiotic prophase I, HEIP1 interacts with the chromosome axes, independently of recombination, before relocalizing to the central region of the synaptonemal complex. We propose that HEIP1 is a conserved master regulator of CO proteins that controls different CO maturation steps.",

The Aβ-degrading enzymes (ADEs) are a collective group of proteases that normally promote clearance to counteract Aβ-induced neurodegeneration. We previously discovered that the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 is an atypical ADE that produces the nontoxic fragment Aβ34 by recognizing 40- or 42-residue-long Aβ peptides as substrates in vitro and in vivo. Here, we examined other known ADEs for their potential roles in degrading Aβ34, Aβ40, and Aβ42. By genetic, cellular, and pharmacological approaches, we identified and characterized endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE1) in a human neuroblastoma cell line, human brain vascular pericytes, and primary rat cortical cultures as a major enzyme degrading Aβ34 but not Aβ40 or Aβ42. Notably, we found that ECE1 cleaves Aβ34, an indicator of amyloid clearance, to a unique and unusually stable Aβ20-34 fragment that has the potential to serve as a measurable biomarker. Biocomputational analyses from non-AD controls and individuals with AD pathology showed that the highest messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of ECE1 expression were found in pericytes (i.e., cells within the brain microvasculature that are known to produce Aβ34) compared to other cell types. Given Aβ34 is an indicator for prodromal AD, we postulate that our collective findings (i.e., generation of Aβ34 and Aβ20-34 intermediates within the “amyloidolytic” degradation pathway) will generate a set of biomarkers to detect amyloid clearance activity in vivo.",

Recent theorizing has found that, despite promoting the counterintuitive behavior of longer deliberation, which is less rewarding in the short term, it is nevertheless normative to account for the value of learning when determining control allocation. Here, we sought to test this proposal by examining whether people were willing to allocate greater control and thereby expend greater effort (e.g., deliberate for longer) when they perceived a task to be learnable compared to when they did not. We found that participants’ proficiency and learning rate in the first block of a simple perceptual dot-motion task were able to predict their willingness to deliberate in a second block. These findings support the hypothesis that agents consider learnability when allocating cognitive control, and comply with a formal model of control allocation that considers the future discounted value of learning on reward.",

Previous studies have primarily focused on peritrichous bacteria like Escherichia coli , whose multiple flagella form a bundle during swimming, allowing them to remain trapped at surfaces for extended periods. However, this surface entrapment phenomenon varies significantly among different bacterial species, despite all fitting into the simplified theoretical models of pusher-type bacteria, suggesting that key factors remain unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that flagellar location is a critical determinant of surface entrapment stability in pusher-type bacteria. Using fluorescently labeled Pseudomonas aeruginosa , we show that cells with a single lateral flagellum exhibit substantially longer surface residence times compared to those with a single polar flagellum, despite similar cell morphology and swimming speeds. Through direct visualization of bacterial orientation angles relative to surfaces, we reveal that this difference results from the distinct bending directions of the flagellar hook—the flexible joint connecting the rigid filament to the cell body. The hook-generated torque resists reorientation differently depending on flagellar location, facilitating surface escape for polar-flagellated bacteria while enhancing entrapment for lateral-flagellated bacteria. Our findings highlight the previously overlooked importance of flagellar placement in bacterial surface interactions, providing insights for understanding microbial ecology and designing biomimetic microswimmers.",

Additional observations and experiments showed that affect could be transmitted between bees without physical contact, i.e., through visual modality alone.

In this Review, we examine the differences in functional traits that define each group’s distinctive role in the global carbon cycle and their sensitivity to climate change and ocean acidification. This synthesis reveals that a single representation of CaCO 3 in climate models is unlikely to accurately reflect system dynamics or their impacts on biogeochemical cycling under climate change. We argue that understanding past and future CaCO 3 cycle requires a better delineation of the traits that make up the diversity of calcifying plankton groups.",

          "abstract": "Extreme drought events are predicted to increase with climate change, yet their impacts on ecosystem carbon dynamics under warming and elevated carbon dioxide (eCO 2 ) remain unclear. In a peatland experiment with five warming treatments each under ambient carbon dioxide (aCO 2 ) and eCO 2 (+500 parts per million), a 2-month extreme drought in 2021 reduced net ecosystem productivity by 444.0 ± 65.8 and 736.6 ± 57.8 grams of carbon per square meter at +9°C under aCO 2 and eCO 2 , respectively—228.6 ± 56.8% and 381.9 ± 83.4% of the reduction at +0°C under aCO 2 . This exacerbation was driven by warming-induced water table decline, prolonged low water tables, and CO 2 -enhanced substrate availability through increased plant carbon inputs. Findings indicate that future climate will greatly amplify carbon loss during extreme drought, reinforcing positive carbon-climate feedbacks.",

Furthermore, by tuning SrTiO 3 toward quantum criticality, we more than double the EO and piezo-electric effects, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1000 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and nonlinearity, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems and providing a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.",

However, at cryogenic temperatures, Pockels coefficients are reduced in many materials optimized for room-temperature operation, which is a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies. Here, we show that strontium titanate (SrTiO 3 ) can be engineered to exhibit a Pockels coefficient of 345 picometers per volt at 20 hertz at cryogenic temperatures, a value twice as high as any other thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we were able to increase the Curie temperature and realize a ferroelectric phase yielding a high Pockels coefficient, so far with limited optical losses of decibels per centimeter. Our findings position SrTiO 3 as a promising material for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.",

By using an ion gate, we selectively populated either localized molecular states or semiconductor band states, achieving complete localization from mobile charges at densities up to 3 × 10 13 per square centimeter. This transition was energetically stabilized by the formation of coupled electron-ion dipoles, which could be tuned through Coulomb engineering. These properties further enabled single-band ambipolar transistor operation without substitutional dopants, demonstrating the potential of electron-ion correlations for practical electronic applications.",

          "abstract": "Biological invasions can alter ecosystems, yet their impacts vary across ecological contexts. Using a global meta-analysis of 775 studies (2223 effect sizes) in terrestrial systems, we show that the most consistent negative impacts are reductions in native plant diversity caused by invasive plants and increases in greenhouse gas emissions driven by both invasive plants and animals. However, evidence of publication bias suggests the latter should be interpreted with caution. Invader residence time emerged as a key predictor: Longer residence times intensified the negative effects of invasive plants on native diversity, whereas impacts on soil abiotic properties tended to weaken over time. Our synthesis reveals that some properties, such as native plant diversity, remain persistently sensitive to invasion, whereas others are more variable as invasions persist.",

Caloric refrigeration cycles offer a path forward but most rely on solid-state materials with limited temperature lift, low performance, and poor fluidity, which hinder scalability.

This cycle achieves large adiabatic temperature changes and high coefficients of performance. We identify effective salt-water pairs and validate the cycle experimentally, supported by thermodynamic modeling. Among these, ammonium nitrate is suited for refrigeration, while potassium nitrate is appropriate for air conditioning. The system uses abundant, low-cost materials, and its fluidic nature ensures efficient heat transfer and scalability.

Here we report the identification of the spontaneous prehaustorium 1 ( spoh1 ) mutant, which forms prehaustoria without external host signals. spoh1 harbors a point mutation in the gene encoding uridine diphosphate–glucosyltransferase UGT72B1, an enzyme that glucosylates and thereby inactivates phenolic HIFs. PjUGT72B1 has a different substrate specificity than its ortholog of the host Arabidopsis . Introduction of PjUGT72B1 into Arabidopsis reduced prehaustorium induction activity, indicating that UGT72B1 regulates haustorium induction by hosts. Our findings suggest that Orobanchaceae hemiparasitic plants have evolved kin-avoidance mechanisms through the glucosylation of endogenous HIFs.",

Population genomic analysis of ~350 contemporary and historical samples counters the popular hypothesis that molestus originated belowground in London &lt;200 years ago. Instead, we show that molestus first adapted to human environments aboveground in the Mediterranean or Middle East over the course of more than 1000 years, possibly in association with ancient agricultural civilizations of the Middle East.

PER2-S662 phosphorylation correlated with genome-wide expression pathways that regulate polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) conversion into oxylipins in the hypothalamus. Partial hydrogenation of dietary PUFAs increased hypothalamic PER2-S662 phosphorylation and entrainment to a summer photoperiod in control mice, but not in mice for which PER2-S662 could not be phosphorylated.

We designed an active deep-learning framework that leverages omics to enable scalable, optimizable identification of compounds that induce complex phenotypes. Our generalizable algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art models on classical recall, translating to a 13-17x increase in phenotypic hit-rate across two hematological discovery campaigns. Combining this algorithm with a lab-in-the-loop signature refinement step, we achieved an additional two-fold increase in hit-rate and molecular insights.

          "abstract": "In 2023, a record-setting marine heat wave triggered the ninth mass coral bleaching event on Florida’s Coral Reef (FCR). We examined spatial patterns of heat exposure along the ~560-kilometer length of FCR and the mortality of two ecologically important, critically endangered reef-building corals. Sea surface temperatures were ≥31°C for an average of 40.7 days, leading to heat exposures 2.2- to fourfold higher than all prior years on record. In the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas, 97.8 to 100% of the Acropora palmata and Acropora cervicornis colonies died. Mortality was lower offshore southeast Florida (37.9%), reflecting cooler temperatures in this region. Since the late 1970s, multiple stressors had already reduced the ecological relevance of Acropora in Florida, but the 2023 heat wave marks their functional extinction from FCR.",

          "abstract": "It has long been debated whether non-avian dinosaurs went extinct abruptly or gradually at the end-Cretaceous (66 million years ago), because their fossil record at this time is mostly limited to northern North America. We constrain a dinosaur-rich unit to the south, the Naashoibito Member in New Mexico, to the very latest Cretaceous (~66.4 to 66.0 million years), preserving some of the last-known non-avian dinosaurs. Ecological modeling shows that North American terrestrial vertebrates maintained high diversity and endemism in the latest Cretaceous and early Paleogene, with bioprovinces shaped by temperature and geography. This counters the notion of a low-diversity cross-continental fauna and suggests that dinosaurs were diverse and partitioned into regionally distinct assemblages during the final few hundred thousand years before the end-Cretaceous asteroid impact.",

Coevolutionary analysis and deep-learning (DL)–based protein structure prediction have enabled comprehensive PPI identification in bacteria and yeast, but these approaches have had limited success for the more complex human proteome. We overcame this challenge by enhancing the coevolutionary signals with sevenfold-deeper multiple sequence alignments harvested from 30 petabytes of unassembled genomic data and developing a new DL network trained on augmented datasets of domain-domain interactions from 200 million predicted protein structures. We systematically screened 200 million human protein pairs and predicted 17,849 interactions with an expected precision of 90%, of which 3631 interactions were not identified in previous experimental screens. Three-dimensional models of these predicted interactions provide numerous hypotheses about protein function and mechanisms of human diseases.",

Microbial cell factories offer a promising solution, yet reconstituting plant cytochrome P450s, key enzymes in these pathways, remains a major hurdle. In this study, we investigated a plant membrane protein, AtMSBP1, for its ability to broadly enhance P450 functionality in engineered yeast. Unlike in plants, interactions with cytochrome P450s are not essential for AtMSBP1’s function in yeast. Specifically, AtMSBP1 orchestrates interorganelle communication, involving not only the endoplasmic reticulum but also mitochondria and vacuoles, supporting cytochrome P450s functionality in yeast. This study highlights the critical role of cross-organelle coordination in supporting cytochrome P450s functionality, emphasizing a shift from traditional ER-based approaches to engineering cross-organelle interactions and tailoring the cellular microenvironment to enhance plant cytochrome P450s functionality in yeast.",

We address this challenge by developing a biosensor-driven, growth-coupled selection strategy in Pseudomonas putida for isoprenol, a potential aviation fuel precursor. We found and characterized a noncanonical signaling pathway, revealing a functional and physical complex between a hybrid histidine kinase and an alcohol dehydrogenase, whose activity is tuned by heterodimerization. Leveraging this biosensor in a pooled CRISPRi library selection, we identified key host limitations. Iterative combinatorial strain engineering derived from these hits yielded a 36-fold titer increase to ~900 milligrams per liter. Integrated omics analysis revealed that metabolic rewiring toward amino acid catabolism was crucial for this improvement. This observation was found to be beneficial by technoeconomic analysis.

Here, we demonstrate a meta-grating-lens (MGL)–based monolithic polarization camera achieving 14° FOV and real-time full-Stokes polarization imaging in the near-infrared region. The optimized MGL exhibits &gt;60% focusing efficiency with &lt;3% zeroth-order noise, enabling simultaneous polarization analysis, beam-splitting, and imaging functionalities in a fine-grained pixel level.

IC7Fc was previously shown to slow the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and here, we demonstrate its effect on atherosclerotic development. In APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, an atherosclerosis-prone model with a humanized lipoprotein metabolism, IC7Fc markedly lowered plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. This was mechanistically explained by an inhibition of de novo lipogenesis in the liver, increased synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, and down-regulated apolipoprotein B synthesis, which resulted in decreased cholesterol secretion in very low–density lipoprotein particles. As a consequence, IC7Fc treatment considerably reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation and vascular inflammation compared with current antihyperlipidemic therapy. In conclusion, IC7Fc is a promising pharmacological treatment for cardiometabolic diseases targeting hyperlipidemia and inflammation.",

          "abstract": "P. W. Anderson introduced a negative- U (i.e., attractive electron-electron interaction) to describe the scarcity of singly occupied spin states in amorphous materials. To uncover the underlying chemistry behind this phenomenon, we combined structural sampling with quantum-chemical analysis of amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiN x ) based on DFT. Our analysis demonstrates that coordination defects act as charge traps, with a density on the order of 10 21 per cubic centimeter. These defects render singly occupied electronic states energetically less favorable than paired or fully emptied states, primarily due to electron donor-acceptor interactions. Furthermore, excess charge trapping occurs through chemical bond reorganization, which disrupts the balance of existing electron and hole traps. In addition, we found that in Si-rich a-SiN x , various Si─Si bonding networks exhibit power-law–like size distribution, where larger networks are associated with deeper trap levels. These findings explain why a-SiN x has been used as a charge storage layer in the charge trap flash memory.",

Unlike messenger RNA–based approaches, ribonucleoprotein delivery enables immediate genome editing without relying on endogenous translation. However, intracellular delivery remains a major challenge due to protein size, charge variability, and susceptibility to denaturation and degradation. Here, we present a multistep screening platform to optimize LNP formulations for gene-editing protein delivery, focusing on in vivo T cell targeting. Through in vitro screening of a composition library, we identified top-performing candidates. In vivo screening in Ai9 mice revealed a spleen-tropic LNP formulation that preferentially targets T cells, enabling efficient gene editing in vivo. Using this LNP formulation, we achieved targeted knockout of CCR5 and PD-1 in splenic T cells, supporting potential applications in HIV resistance and cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, a machine learning–guided mechanistic study revealed key design principles for LNP-based protein delivery, highlighting unexplored opportunities for in vivo genome-editing therapies.",

          "abstract": "The shift from sprawling to erect limb postures in archosaurs during the Triassic represents a major evolutionary transformation in vertebrates. One unresolved question regarding the limb posture transition is its association with body size evolution. If adopting more erect limb postures reduces mass-specific muscle forces and bone stresses, it would enable the evolution of larger body sizes. We tested this prediction using computational modeling and simulation of hindlimb muscle activations and femoral stresses across limb postures and body sizes in juvenile to adult American alligators and a scaled model of the extinct giant alligatoroid Deinosuchus riograndensis . We showed that larger alligators and D. riograndensis encounter challenges in generating sufficient muscle forces to support their bodies and maintain bone stresses, whereas adopting more erect hindlimb postures helps mitigate bone stresses among individuals of similar sizes. These results show how the shift from sprawling to erect limb posture relaxed biomechanical constraints, potentially facilitating the evolution of larger body sizes in terrestrial tetrapods.",

To overcome this, we integrated a “crystallization-activated moisture barrier” into the perovskite film, which can exist in a liquid state/crystallization phase during the initial annealing to allow moisture to enter and promote crystallization, then migrate upward, and form a dense hydrophobic layer on the film surface to protect the perovskite from high humidity–caused damage. Such a “moisture barrier” enables the manufacturing of perovskite films to be insensitive to a wide range of relative humidity from 20% to over 90%. The barrier also regulates bulk crystallization and passivates surface defects. The crystallization-activated moisture barrier effectively reduces the sensitivity of perovskite films to humidity during annealing, which paves the way for high-tolerance manufacturing of perovskite photovoltaic devices.",

Yet, planetesimal formation appears to have occurred in at least two distinct phases. A temporal offset separates early-forming bodies from later-forming chondrite parent bodies, which accreted 2 to 3 million years after the Solar System onset—an unresolved aspect of Solar System formation. Here, we use numerical simulations to show that Jupiter’s early formation reshaped its natal protoplanetary disk. Jupiter’s rapid growth depleted the inner disk gas and generated pressure bumps and dust traps that manifested as rings. These structures caused dust to accumulate and led to a second-generation planetesimal population, with ages matching those of noncarbonaceous chondrites. Meanwhile, the evolving gas structure suppressed terrestrial embryos’ inward migration, preventing them from reaching the innermost regions. Jupiter likely played a key role in shaping the inner Solar System, consistent with structures observed in class II and transition disks.",

However, how these chaperones mitigate protein-folding stress remains unclear. Here, using correlated cryo–electron tomography, we show that folding stress triggers marked mitochondrial morphological changes, including the accumulation of amorphous protein aggregates and increased abundance and spatial clustering of the mitochondrial heat shock protein 60-heat shock protein 10 (mtHsp60-Hsp10) complex. Subtomogram analysis revealed the in situ architecture and conformational heterogeneity of mtHsp60-Hsp10 under stress, which retains its canonical double-ring structure while adopting distinct football, half-football, and bullet-like states. Notably, the mtHsp60-Hsp10 complex encapsulates unstructured substrates through conserved hydrophobic interactions. We further demonstrate that knockdown of the mtHsp60-Hsp10 complex exacerbates folding stress, as evidenced by elevated cellular stress responses and activation of mitophagy. Our study defines the in situ structural properties of the mtHsp60-Hsp10 complex and provides mechanistic insight into how it safeguards mitochondrial proteostasis under folding stress.",

We show that the serine/threonine–protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) regulatory subunit 3, SAPS3, is a critical regulator of metabolism during aging. SAPS3 deletion significantly extends lifespan in mice and counteracts age-related impairments in metabolic health. SAPS3 deficiency improves the effects of aging on the affective behaviors, cognition, and motor functions in aged mice. We find that SAPS3 expression is increased during aging to inhibit adenosine monophosphate–activated kinase (AMPK) activity. Deletion of SAPS3 leads to AMPK activation and reverses cellular senescence and aging-induced metabolic alterations. Using in vivo U- 13 C 6 -D-glucose tracing and metabolomic analysis, we find that SAPS3 deficiency restores metabolic homeostasis with increased glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and decreased fatty acid synthesis in aged mice. These findings highlight a critical role of the SAPS3/PP6 phosphatase complex in aging and suggest that strategies targeting SAPS3 may promote longevity and healthy aging.",

A molecularly tailored dual-interface passivation strategy is presented using a solvent-free rub-on transfer method, which enables uniform molecular deposition without inducing secondary defects. Specifically, 4-mercaptopyridine (4-MPy) is applied at the buried interface, and 2-mercaptopyridine (2-MPy) is applied on the perovskite surface. At the buried interface, 4-MPy stabilizes Ni 3+ states, reduces oxygen vacancies, and improves hole injection. In contrast, surface-deposited 2-MPy coordinates effectively with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions, forming wide-bandgap complexes that suppress trap states and enhance carrier confinement. As a result, the optimized PeLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.67% and a current efficiency of 95.01 candela per ampere, the highest values reported for solution-processed polycrystalline CsPbBr 3 –based PeLEDs. Furthermore, the operational half-life is substantially extended by nearly 10-fold at an initial luminance of 1000 candela per square meter.",

Among offshore technologies, wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) have emerged as the most promising solutions. However, a global assessment of offshore resources, particularly solar PV, remains lacking. Hence, we identify suitable areas for offshore wind and solar PV development on the basis of economic feasibility, technical constraints, and environmental considerations and quantify the national potential for electricity production and CO 2 reduction contributions. With a conservative assumption of using 1% of suitable areas, offshore wind and solar PV could generate ~6049 and 14,173 terawatt-hours of electricity annually. This would cover nearly 30% of the expected global electricity demand in 2050. The resulting reductions in carbon dioxide emissions could exceed 9 billion tonnes annually.

This platform meets key criteria for device integration, including scalability, reproducibility, and tunability via electric field. When the Fermi level is positioned within the energy gap, we observe quantized resistance values independent of device length and in both local and nonlocal measurement configurations, confirming the QSHE.

While recent clinical studies show promise, therapeutic efficacy remains incomplete, emphasizing the need for improved approaches. Here, we identified lysosomal perturbations in myofibers of patients with DMD and animal models, an overlooked mechanism of cellular damage in muscular dystrophies. These were notably marked by the up-regulation and recruitment of Galectin-3, a biomarker of lysosomal membrane permeabilization, to lysosomes, alongside alterations in lysosome number, morphology, and function. Microdystrophin therapy in Dmd mdx mice fails to fully correct these damages. However, combining it with trehalose, a lysosome-protective disaccharide, substantially improves the outcome, enhancing muscle function, myopathology, and transcriptome.

However, these longitudinal studies are rare and may be heavily biased by the presence of unaccountable confounding. Here, we develop a method—time-resolved Mendelian randomization—to estimate the cumulative effect of body mass index on disease risk at different ages. Using the UK Biobank, we find strong age-varying patterns for type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation, as well as for osteoarthritis.

Their shared technological features involve the use of dual core-and-blade and biface technologies similar to those in the Northeast Asian Late Upper Paleolithic. These dual approaches were often merged to produce small projectile points, including stemmed point forms using an elliptical cross-sectional ogive design. Similar dual lithic technologies are found in assemblages in northern Japan dating to ~20,000 cal yr B.P. We suggest a group with a similar lithic technology became isolated somewhere in the vicinity of the Paleo-Sakhalin-Hokkaido-Kuril region, developing genetically into ancestral American populations. Between ~22,000 and ~18,000 cal yr B.P., a subset of this population migrated along the southern Beringian and Northwest coasts into the Americas. By ~16,000 to ~15,000 cal yr B.P., they had become widely dispersed across North America.",

However, it remains unclear whether MASLD is sufficient to drive central nervous system deficits. Here, using diet-induced mouse models, we showed that MASLD was associated with alterations in social memory, sensorimotor processing, and hippocampal function, including decreased parvalbumin-positive interneurons, reduced dendritic spine density, and diminished dentate gyrus neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. Then, we selectively modulated liver metabolism through N -acetylgalactosamine small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy against Cyclin M4 ( CNNM4 ), a magnesium transporter dysregulated in MASLD. Liver-specific intervention with siRNA- Cnnm4 reversed impaired social memory and sensorimotor processing in association with recovery of hippocampal synaptogenesis and mitochondrial function pathways, alongside activation of neurogenesis-associated transcriptional programs. Our findings demonstrate that liver pathology is sufficient to drive neurobehavioral and hippocampal dysfunction in MASLD.

This excitation has topological robustness, which fundamentally stems from its intrinsic tolerance to fabrication imperfections. A 14-channel narrowband absorbers chip based on GTPP has been fabricated. Compared to conventional structures without GTPP excitation, this device can lower the reverse saturable absorption threshold (~7.7 × 10 −5 nanojoules per square micrometer) and increase the fluorescence intensity above the residual laser intensity to enhance the extinction capability by two orders of magnitude.

Given the poor activity of native laccase in the physiological context because of OH − inhibition of its geometrically constrained O 2 -reducing center, we designed a highly dynamic Ru-Cu binuclear center to counteract the inhibition effect. Structural and computational investigations unravel a self-adaptive catalytic mechanism by reversive Ru-Cu active site reconfiguration that lowers the kinetic barriers for O 2 -to-H 2 O conversion in neutral solution. The remolded laccase exhibits substantial enhancement of physiological activity (up to one order of magnitude) and improved catecholamine substrate specificity, enabling whole-cell down-regulation of vesicular dopamine and extracellular erasure of evoked dopamine signals in intact brains.

How HPV enters the nucleus after exiting the Golgi is unclear, although mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) appears important. Here, we show that importin-7 (IPO7), a nuclear pore import receptor, is present at the Golgi and promotes HPV infection. IPO7 knockdown inhibits infection and causes HPV to accumulate in the Golgi without reaching mitotic chromosomes, demonstrating that IPO7 promotes Golgi-to-nucleus transport of HPV. Golgi-to-nucleus transport of a cellular cargo also requires IPO7, suggesting that HPV hijacks a preexisting pathway for nuclear entry. Furthermore, the C-terminal nuclear localization sequence of HPV L2 protein, which overlaps its cell-penetrating peptide sequence, binds IPO7 directly in a COPI-dependent virus trafficking step. Together, these data identify a role for an importin in HPV infection and suggest that the canonical nuclear pore import machinery plays an unanticipated role in NEB-dependent nuclear entry.",

Here, we examine this hazard by combining a unique inventory of debris flows from the Wenchuan earthquake with numerical modeling to constrain their magnitude and frequency. We show that large debris flows occur more frequently than expected, on the basis of magnitude-frequency relationships for all debris flows, when high volumes of sediment are deposited in channels.

Here, we identify the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy homolog (ITCH) as a key regulator of proteotoxicity through its role in inducing Golgi fragmentation. Disease-associated accumulation of ITCH promotes fragmentation of both the cis- and trans-Golgi networks, disrupting protein sorting and impairing lysosomal functions. The ITCH-dependent lysosomal dysfunction compromises the clearance of misfolded proteins associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibition of ITCH protects against proteotoxicity in both mammalian neurons and Drosophila models of neurodegeneration. The accumulation of ITCH in patients with ALS and AD is attributed to up-regulation of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP11, which deubiquitinates and stabilizes ITCH.

Moreover, by measuring intramolecular distances in individual PIEZO1 channels with nanometer precision, we reveal subcellular compartment-specific differences in PIEZO1 conformation at rest and during activation that correlate with differences in PIEZO1 function and are possibly caused by differences in cytoskeletal architecture.

Here, we report that modification of a single longevity gene downstream of dietary restriction and hypoxia markedly alters behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans . We found that modified expression of flavin-containing monooxygenase ( fmo-2 ) leads to altered sensory perception and decision-making in a variety of behavioral paradigms. This cell nonautonomous signaling pathway is linked to changes in tryptophan metabolism, where loss of fmo-2 requires the tryptophan metabolite serotonin and overexpressed fmo-2 requires the tryptophan metabolite quinolinic acid to change behavior. These results suggest a unique mechanism for gut metabolism to communicate positive satiety signals and negative depressive signals to the organism by modifying an essential amino acid.

It identifies optimal procedures for the amounts of overlap that would maintain its predictions’ correctness and shows that these procedures could yield a sequence of tables that would anticipate every solar eclipse observable in the Mayan territory from a century or two after the first evidence of the Mayan lunar calendar to at least the era of the extant eclipse table, 700 years later.",

Although several methods have been developed to extend silicon photodetectors further in the IR range, these approaches often introduce additional challenges. Here, we present an approach to overcome these limitations by integrating disordered metasurfaces with upconversion nanoparticles, enabling IR detection by silicon photodetectors. The disordered design consisting of hybrid Mie-plasmonic cavities can enhance both the near-field localization and wide-band light absorption. The measured responsivity of the disordered element for 1550-nm laser is 0.22 A/W at room temperature, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 17.6%.

Here, we develop a nonperturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between cavity photons and electrons and crystals. We apply this approach to graphene coupled to cavity photons of different polarizations. Photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, solely due to the quantum nature of light, that lead to substantial renormalization of Dirac bands. The nonlocal interactions induced by anisotropic linearly polarized photons give rise to wedge-shaped bands and Dirac gap. When isotropic cavity photon modes are introduced, the Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the role of nonlocal interactions. This theoretical framework paves the way for revealing nonperturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of cavity-induced phenomena.",

Here, we find that Caenorhabditis elegans adapt to repeated generational stresses. We show that, upon two repeated generational hypoxia exposures, the life-span extension is eliminated, and after four repeated generational hypoxia exposures, the reduced fertility is eliminated. Transgenerational adaptation also occurred in response to changes in glucose availability. Transgenerational hypoxia adaptation is dependent on the H3K27 trimethyltransferase PRC2 complex, and we identified transgenerationally adapted genes.

          "abstract": "Leptin, a hormone primarily secreted by adipocytes, regulates energy balance and systemic metabolism through its interaction with the leptin receptor (LEPR). Beyond these functions, leptin signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis. Here, we report the x-ray crystal structures of a leptin-neutralizing antibody (hLep3) in the unbound and leptin-bound states. The interaction of this antibody with leptin mimics the interaction of the LEPR with leptin, providing direct insights into the mechanism by which the antibody disrupts leptin signaling. We furthermore evaluate the therapeutic potential of neutralizing leptin with this antibody across distinct mouse models of fibrosis affecting the kidney, liver, lung, heart, and blood vessels. Leptin neutralization markedly inhibited fibrosis progression in all models. Mechanistically, suppression of leptin activity reduces pro-inflammatory and profibrotic processes, underscoring its therapeutic potential. These findings suggest that leptin signaling plays a vital role in tissue fibrosis and that treatment with a leptin-neutralizing antibody may be a promising therapeutic approach.",

Divalent cations in MBL and quasicrystalline lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are key determinants of acquired and intrinsic resistance in these bacteria. Chemically depriving these cations would block multiple resistance pathways simultaneously and restore carbapenem susceptibility. Here, we chemically engineer a class of anionic adjuvants to tailor their interactions with MBL, enhancing the enzymatic inhibition by up to ~5885-fold compared to parent compounds. An orthogonal screen identifies the tiopronin-engineered anionic adjuvant (TINA), which achieves complete rescue of all tested carbapenems against diverse New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1–producing Gram-negative ESKAPE bacteria. TINA targets both MBL and LPS, depriving divalent cations to inactivate MBL and damage membrane collaboratively while also preventing resistance evolution. Moreover, TINA’s anionic nature minimizes serum adsorption, enabling safe and effective in vivo treatment of bacterial pneumonia.

However, they are normally prepared by the spin coating process, which is not conducive to scaling up. One of the considerable barriers to scaling up stems from the printing of electron transport layers (ETLs), with tin oxide (SnO 2 ) being a commonly used material. Here, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) is introduced into the SnO 2 nanocrystals ink to engineer the ink to enhance the dispersion of nanocrystals and slow down solvent evaporation, ensuring the printed ETLs having optimized coverage and morphology. Concurrently, the buried interface is refined by PAA, which enhances charge transfer and suppresses nonradiative recombination. The flexible device modified by PAA achieves a high efficiency of 22.46% (certified at 21.56%) and retains 89.3% of its initial value after 3000 bending cycles and 92.4% after 2000 hours of storage.

We applied FluWarning to the 2009 influenza pandemic as a test case.

Applied to H5N1 specimens collected between 2019 and 2025, FluWarning flagged genotypes D1.1 and B3.13, both associated with recent spillovers in dairy cows in the United States.

Mechanical perturbations impair tissue expansion patterns and severely compromise GC specification. Further investigations revealed that the master genetic regulator SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE (SPL/NZZ) was central in establishing this micromechanical environment via cell wall softening. In turn, the mechanical cues stabilized the transcription of SPL/NZZ . Here, we propose an intrinsic growth-derived mechanochemical feedback loop that safeguards the fate of GCs.",

Both partners exhibited hormesis in cocultures but were inhibited in monocultures under exposure to 10 different antibiotics, especially azithromycin (AZM). Notably, mutualistic cooperation between the partners shifted the effect of AZM from inhibition in monocultures to promotion in cocultures. C. reinhardtii alleviates AZM stress on bacteria by providing organic carbon and efficiently removing antibiotics. In turn, the altered phycospheric bacteriome supplied ammonia, phosphate, vitamin B 12 , and indole-3-acetic acid to promote C. reinhardtii growth. The antibiotic-induced growth promotion was also observed in natural phytoplankton–bacteria communities.

The overexpression of proteins in proximity to RNA assemblies stimulates parental cells to release excess exogenous proteins in induced superior EVs (iSEVs). The iSEV system enables the single-module–based enrichment of exogenous cargo in EVs with scalable manufacturing. By harnessing mass-produced iSEVs induced by GENRISEs, encoding an antigenic peptide, we have successfully demonstrated target-specific in vivo cancer immunotherapy. These findings suggest that the emerging iSEV platform shows considerable potential for biomedical applications by enabling the controlled production of cargo-specific EVs.",

Using a pyrazinacene-based probe ( TEG 8 -N14 ), we unexpectedly achieved discrimination of multiple cell states, including apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and senescence, based on RNA/DNA changes. Specifically, TEG 8 -N14 selectively stains necrotic cells in live samples, while after fixation, it allows detection of ultraearly senescence in UV-vis–sensitive cells, providing approximately twofold greater informational content than existing RNA or DNA fluorophores.

The system uses a dynamically tunable assembly mechanism governed by rotational direction enabling integrated locomotion (clockwise) and on-demand module separation (counterclockwise) at stenotic sites. The platform is compatible with intraoperative ultrasound, allowing real-time navigation and thermally triggered expansion in physiological environments. By synergizing programmable magnetic actuation, ultrasound-mediated expansion, and clinical workflow compatibility, the robot can navigate tortuous phantom ducts, achieving controlled stent deployment within 3 seconds and complete expansion within 30 seconds, permitting minimally invasive treatment of biliary strictures.

Here, we identify chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1), a protein known to exist in both soluble and membrane-associated forms, as highly enriched in human and murine microglia, with minimal expression in other brain cells. Acute blockade or genetic deletion of CLIC1 markedly attenuates microglial surveillance by reducing ramification and motility, without affecting chemotaxis. This phenotype is recapitulated in xenografted human microglia and human brain tissue. Mechanistically, CLIC1 effects involve interactions with actin-binding ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins, suggesting a role in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Contrary to its name, CLIC1 functions are chloride-independent and thus unlikely to reflect ion channel activity. This is supported by patch-clamp electrophysiology revealing lack of chloride conductance in surveillant microglia. Following ATP–evoked activation, CLIC1 blockade strongly suppresses NLRP3–dependent interleukin-1β release, suggesting therapeutic potential against neuroinflammation.",

Our results predict sequential regulations, with early-active TFs delaying the activation of later GRNs and their putative synaptic targets.

Using serial intravital microscopy in transgenic mice, we track tubulointerstitial remodeling between injured and intact tissue over 3 weeks. VCAM1 is rapidly induced in a distinct subset of injured tubules, preceding atrophy with sustained fibroblast recruitment. However, fibroblasts remain confined to injury sites and do not cause secondary damage in uninjured tubules.

Our results suggest Central Asia faunas exhibited two notable expansion phases: 19 to 16 million years (Ma) ago (pre-Tunggurian surge) and 11 to 9 Ma ago (Bahean surge). The latter phase was directly correlated with formation of the modern large-mammalian faunas, driven by the ecomorphological revolution of local mammalian communities following a regional mass extinction, “the Central Asian Tortonian Crisis.” We propose that the rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau altered Central Asian hydrological system, promoting aridification and earlier development of open habitats, which in turn drove the adaptation of large mammals to prolonged environmental shifts.",

          "abstract": "Melanosome (melanin-containing organelles) geometries sampled from fossil Jurassic fur have recently indicated uniformly dark colors consistent with a proposed nocturnal bottleneck early in the mammal lineage. Here, we use a distinct dataset of ~8000 melanosomes from 60 species (11 mammalian orders) including a Jurassic species to ask more generally what color or environmental variables may explain melanosome geometry in mammals. We confirm support for limited melanosome variation in Jurassic mammals. Crown therian mammalian melanosome diversity as extreme as that in birds is recovered within placental lineages. More environmental variables substantially explain aspects of melanosome geometry than do color variables, but the explanatory power of both sets of variables is limited. Prediction of color from melanosomes in fossil mammals merits caution, given observed lineage-specific trends. Potentially comparatively weak selection on the melanosome geometry-color relationship in mammals or correlations with other life history variables may further explain the evolution of these geometries.",

          "abstract": "Amorphous p-type oxides are essential for next-generation flexible and scalable complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Among emerging candidates, tellurium-based oxides (Te-TeO x ) show great promise due to their unique Te-Te conduction networks embedded within the amorphous TeO 2 matrix. However, controlled formation of these conduction channels remains challenging, limiting both hole transport and dopability under low thermal budgets. Here, we report a sulfur-mediated redox strategy that modulates the local bonding environment via TeO 2 dissociation and partial Te 4+ reduction, promoting formation of short-chain Te-Te networks. This enables high-performance p-channel thin-film transistors processed at an ultralow temperature of 120°C, exhibiting an average hole mobility of 11.5 cm 2  V −1  s −1 and on/off current ratios around 10 6 with high uniformity and reproducibility. Integration with n-type counterparts enables all-oxide CMOS circuits on both flexible and rigid substrates, including inverters with gain up to 1694, ring oscillators operating at 339 kHz, and large-scale functional circuits with rail-to-rail output.",

          "abstract": "Histone variants with metabolite-binding macrodomains provide a poorly understood link between chromatin composition and metabolism. To address their contribution to physiological health, we generated and analyzed mice individually lacking the histone variants macroH2A1.1, macroH2A1.2, or macroH2A2. We identified several histopathologic changes in the kidney as isoform-specific phenotype of complete macroH2A1.1 loss affecting male and female animals. Kidney alterations were barely associated with organ-intrinsic gene expression changes but strongly correlated with a systemic shift in nutrient metabolization and alterations in NAD + (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized form) metabolism. Reduced lipid oxidation and increased glycolysis were found in male and female mice lacking macroH2A1.1 but not macroH2A1.2 or macroH2A2. Male macroH2A1.1-deficient mice also had better glucose tolerance and altered hepatic gene expression. Replacing chow by ketogenic diet overrode the macroH2A1.1-dependent metabolic phenotype and prevented kidney abnormalities. Together, our results indicate that macroH2A1.1 controls nutrient metabolization and links macroH2A1.1 levels to secondary changes in the kidney.",

However, only one synthetic procedure consisting of five independent operation steps involving highly sensitive amino alkynone intermediate is available for their synthesis to date, depressing rigidly the application of AAAs in peptide synthesis and expanded acylation reactions. Herein, by combining consecutive trifold defluorination, acyl migration, and multicomponent reactions, a considerably simpler one-step protocol has been established for AAA synthesis with the α-trifluoromethyl ketones, amines, and carboxylic acids/amino acids as starting materials using Cs 2 CO 3 as the only promoter. The resulting AAAs have been verified with excellent performance in the synthesis of esters, amides, and peptides. In all investigated examples of peptide synthesis, no racemization or epimerization has been observed, documenting the high application potential of AAAs as a complementary option in peptide synthesis and other related acylation reactions.",

          "abstract": "The development of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) systems has largely advanced RNA therapeutics, particularly mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy. Conventional amine-LNPs, designed for hepatic RNA delivery, face challenges in targeting lymphoid organs effectively and maximize antigen presentation. In this study, we present the development of pH-responsive ionizable guanidine-LNPs (G-LNPs). Our cholesterol-free G-LNP system enables efficient delivery of mRNA to the spleen following intravenous administration. Notably, while both amine-LNPs and G-LNPs can deliver mRNA to the spleen, G-LNPs exhibit a unique ability to preferentially target antigen-presenting cells, leading to significantly enhanced antigen presentation and robust T cell activation. mRNA vaccines formulated with G-LNPs elicited strong and antigen-specific immune responses, providing complete protection against tumor progression. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of G-LNPs enabled selective mRNA expression in the pancreas, showcasing the versatility of this delivery platform. These findings underscore the potential of guanidine-LNPs as a highly promising platform for organ-targeted mRNA delivery and cancer immunotherapy.",
