          "title": "Measuring racial educational disparities over time amongst top achievers",
          "authors": "Uditi Karna, Min Sok Lee, John A. List, Andrew Simon, Haruka Uchida",
          "abstract": "Educational disparities remain a key contributor to increasing social and wealth inequalities. To address this, researchers and policymakers have focused on average differences between racial groups or differences among students who are falling behind1. This focus potentially leads to educational triage, diverting resources away from high-achieving students, including those from racial minorities2,3. Here we focus on the ‘racial excellence gap’—the difference in the likelihood that students from racial minorities (Black and Hispanic) reach the highest levels of academic achievement compared with their non-minority (white and Asian) peers. There is a shortage of evidence that systematically measures the magnitude of the excellence gap and how it evolves4,5. Using longitudinal, statewide, administrative data, we document eight facts regarding the excellence gap from third grade (typically ages 8–9) to high school (typically ages 14–18), link the stability of excellence gaps and student backgrounds, and assess the efficacy of public policies. We show that excellence gaps in maths and reading are evident by the third grade and grow slightly over time, especially for female students. About one third of the gap is explained by a student’s socioeconomic status, and about one tenth is explained by the school environment. Top-achieving racial minority students are also less likely to persist in excellence as they progress through school. Moreover, state accountability policies that direct additional resources to reduce non-race-based inequality6 had minimal effects on the racial excellence gaps. Documenting these patterns is an important step towards eliminating excellence gaps and removing the ‘racial glass ceiling’.",

          "abstract": "Greenlandic Inuit and other indigenous populations are underrepresented in genetic research1,2, leading to inequity in healthcare opportunities. To address this, we performed analyses of sequenced or imputed genomes of 5,996 Greenlanders with extensive phenotypes. We quantified their historical population bottleneck and how it has shaped their genetic architecture to have fewer, but more common, variable sites. Consequently, we find twice as many high-impact genome-wide associations to metabolic traits in Greenland compared with Europe. We infer that the high-impact variants arose after the population split from Native Americans and thus are Arctic-specific, and show that some of them are common due to not only genetic drift but also selection. We also find that European-derived polygenic scores for metabolic traits are only half as accurate in Greenlanders as in Europeans, and that adding Arctic-specific variants improves the overall accuracy to the same level as in Europeans. Similarly, lack of representation in public genetic databases makes genetic clinical screening harder in Greenlandic Inuit, but inclusion of Greenlandic data remedies this by reducing the number of non-causal candidate variants by sixfold. Finally, we identify pronounced genetic fine structure that explains differences in prevalence of monogenic diseases in Greenland and, together with recent changes in mobility, leads to a predicted future reduction in risk for certain recessive diseases. These results illustrate how including data from Greenlanders can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that migratory animals exploit the magnetic field of the Earth for navigation, both as a compass to determine direction and as a map to determine geographical position1. It has long been proposed that, to navigate using a magnetic map, animals must learn the magnetic coordinates of the destination2,3, yet the pivotal hypothesis that animals can learn magnetic signatures of geographical areas has, to our knowledge, yet to be tested. Here we report that an iconic navigating species, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), can learn such information. When fed repeatedly in magnetic fields replicating those that exist in particular oceanic locations, juvenile turtles learned to distinguish magnetic fields in which they encountered food from magnetic fields that exist elsewhere, an ability that might underlie foraging site fidelity. Conditioned responses in this new magnetic map assay were unaffected by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields, a treatment expected to disrupt radical-pair-based chemical magnetoreception4,5,6, suggesting that the magnetic map sense of the turtle does not rely on this mechanism. By contrast, orientation behaviour that required use of the magnetic compass was disrupted by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields. The findings provide evidence that two different mechanisms of magnetoreception underlie the magnetic map and magnetic compass in sea turtles.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal phenotypic traits such as morphology, connectivity and function are dictated, to a large extent, by a specific combination of differentially expressed genes. Clusters of neurons in transcriptomic space correspond to distinct cell types and in some cases—for example, Caenorhabditis elegans neurons 1 and retinal ganglion cells 2–4 —have been shown to share morphology and function. The zebrafish optic tectum is composed of a spatial array of neurons that transforms visual inputs into motor outputs. Although the visuotopic map is continuous, subregions of the tectum are functionally specialized 5,6 . Here, to uncover the cell-type architecture of the tectum, we transcriptionally profiled its neurons, revealing more than 60 cell types that are organized in distinct anatomical layers. We measured the visual responses of thousands of tectal neurons by two-photon calcium imaging and matched them with their transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, we characterized the morphologies of transcriptionally identified neurons using specific transgenic lines. Notably, we found that neurons that are transcriptionally similar can diverge in shape, connectivity and visual responses. Incorporating the spatial coordinates of neurons within the tectal volume revealed functionally and morphologically defined anatomical subclusters within individual transcriptomic clusters. Our findings demonstrate that extrinsic, position-dependent factors expand the phenotypic repertoire of genetically similar neurons.",

These planets form two populations separated by a natural division at about 1.8 R⊕ termed the radius valley. It is uncertain whether these populations arose from separate dry versus water-rich formation channels, evolved apart because of long-term atmospheric loss or a combination of both5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we report observations of ongoing hydrogen loss from two sibling planets, TOI-776 b (1.85 ± 0.13 R⊕) and TOI-776 c (2.02 ± 0.14 R⊕), the sizes of which near the radius valley and mature (1–4 Gyr) age make them valuable for investigating the origins of the divided population of which they are a part. During the transits of these planets, absorption appeared against the Lyman-α emission of the host star, compatible with hydrogen escape at rates equivalent to 0.03–0.6% and 0.1–0.9% of the total mass per billion years of each planet, respectively. Observations of the outer planet, TOI-776 c, are incompatible with an outflow of dissociated steam, suggesting both it and its inner sibling formed in a dry environment. These observations support the strong role of hydrogen loss in the evolution of close-orbiting sub-Neptunes5,6,7,8,15,16.",

          "abstract": "The breakdown of cellulose is one of the most important reactions in nature1,2 and is central to biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals3. However, the microfibrillar organization of cellulose and its complex interactions with other components of the plant cell wall poses a major challenge for enzymatic conversion4. Here, by mining the metagenomic ‘dark matter’ (unclassified DNA with unknown function) of a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, we discovered a metalloenzyme that oxidatively cleaves cellulose. This metalloenzyme acts on cellulose through an exo-type mechanism with C1 regioselectivity, resulting exclusively in cellobionic acid as a product. The crystal structure reveals a catalytic copper buried in a compact jelly-roll scaffold that features a flattened cellulose binding site. This metalloenzyme exhibits a homodimeric configuration that enables in situ hydrogen peroxide generation by one subunit while the other is productively interacting with cellulose. The secretome of an engineered strain of the fungus Trichoderma reesei expressing this metalloenzyme boosted the glucose release from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This discovery modifies the current understanding of bacterial redox enzymatic systems devoted to overcoming biomass recalcitrance5,6,7. Furthermore, it enables the conversion of agro-industrial residues into value-added bioproducts, thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable and bio-based economy.",

          "abstract": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in plant immunity by sensing pathogen effectors1. In Arabidopsis, certain sensor NLRs function as NADases to catalyse the production of second messengers2,3, which can be recognized by enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) with its partner senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101), to activate helper NLR N requirement gene 1 (NRG1)4. A cryoelectron microscopy structure shows that second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101 mainly contacts the leucine-rich repeat domain of NRG1A to mediate the formation of an induced EDS1–SAG101–NRG1A complex. Structural comparisons show that binding of a second messenger induces conformational changes in EDS1–SAG101, which are recognized by NRG1A, leading to its allosteric activation. We further show that an inhibitory NRG1 family member, NRG1C, efficiently outcompetes NRG1A for binding to second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101. These findings uncover mechanisms for NRG1A activation through its recognition of a modified host EDS1–SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of the activated EDS1–SAG101, thus shedding light on the activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system.",

          "abstract": "The crypt–villus structure of the small intestine serves as an essential protective barrier. The integrity of this barrier is monitored by the complex sensory system of the gut, in which serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells play an important part1,2. These rare sensory epithelial cells surveil the mucosal environment for luminal stimuli and transmit signals both within and outside the gut3,4,5,6. However, whether EC cells in crypts and villi detect different stimuli or produce distinct physiological responses is unknown. Here we address these questions by developing a reporter mouse model to quantitatively measure the release and propagation of serotonin from EC cells in live intestines. Crypt EC cells exhibit a tonic low-level mode that activates epithelial serotonin 5-HT4 receptors to modulate basal ion secretion and a stimulus-induced high-level mode that activates 5-HT3 receptors on sensory nerve fibres. Both these modes can be initiated by the irritant receptor TRPA1, which is confined to crypt EC cells. The activation of TRPA1 by luminal irritants is enhanced when the protective mucus layer is compromised. Villus EC cells also signal damage through a distinct mechanism, whereby oxidative stress activates TRPM2 channels, which leads to the release of both serotonin and ATP and consequent excitation of sensory nerve fibres. This topological segregation of EC cell functionality along the mucosal architecture constitutes a mechanism for the surveillance, maintenance and protection of gut integrity under diverse physiological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Crystal symmetry guides the development of condensed matter. The unique crystal symmetry connecting magnetic sublattices not only distinguishes altermagnetism1,2,3,4,5,6 from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism but also enables it to combine the advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism4,5. Altermagnetic order is essentially a magnetic crystal order7, determined by the magnetic-order (Néel) vector and crystal symmetry. Previous experimental studies have concentrated on manipulating the altermagnetic symmetry by tuning the Néel vector orientations8,9,10,11,12. However, manipulation of the crystal symmetry, which holds great promise for manipulating the altermagnetic order, remains challenging. Here we realize the manipulation of altermagnetic order in chromium antimonide (CrSb) films via crystal symmetry. The locking between the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector and the magnetic space symmetry helps to reconstruct the altermagnetic order, from a collinear Néel vector to a canted one. It generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnet. The relative direction between the current-induced spin polarization and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector determines the switching modes of altermagnetic order, that is, parallel for the field-assisted mode in CrSb\\((1\\bar{1}00)\\)/Pt and non-parallel for the field-free mode in W/CrSb\\((11\\bar{2}0)\\). The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector induces an asymmetric energy barrier in the field-assisted mode and generates an asymmetric driving force in the field-free mode. In particular, the latter is guaranteed by the emerging Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya torque in altermagnets. Reconstructing crystal symmetry adds a new twist to the manipulation of altermagnetic order. It not only underpins the magnetic-memory and nano-oscillator technology4,5 but also inspires crossover studies between altermagnetism and other research topics.",

          "abstract": "The biogenic structures produced by termites, ants and earthworms provide key functions across global ecosystems1,2. However, little is known about the drivers of the soil engineering effects caused by these small but important invertebrates3 at the global scale. Here we show, on the basis of a meta-analysis of 12,975 observations from 1,047 studies on six continents, that all three taxa increase soil macronutrient content, soil respiration and soil microbial and plant biomass compared with reference soils. The effect of termites on soil respiration and plant biomass, and the effect of earthworms on soil nitrogen and phosphorus content, increase with mean annual temperature and peak in the tropics. By contrast, the effects of ants on soil nitrogen, soil phosphorus, plant biomass and survival rate peak at mid-latitude ecosystems that have the lowest primary productivity. Notably, termites and ants increase plant growth by alleviating plant phosphorus limitation in the tropics and nitrogen limitation in temperate regions, respectively. Our study highlights the important roles of these invertebrate taxa in global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. Given the importance of these soil-engineering invertebrates, biogeochemical models should better integrate their effects, especially on carbon fluxes and nutrient cycles.",

          "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, which is strongly associated with obesity1, causing sensory loss and, in some patients, neuropathic pain2,3. Although the onset and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is linked with dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia4, the contribution of inflammation to peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis has not been investigated. Here we used a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD), which induces obesity and prediabetic metabolic changes, to study the onset of peripheral neuropathy. Mice fed the HFHFD developed persistent heat hypoalgesia after 3 months, but a reduction in epidermal skin nerve fibre density manifested only at 6 months. Using single-cell sequencing, we found that CCR2+ macrophages infiltrate the sciatic nerves of HFHFD-fed mice well before axonal degeneration is detectable. These infiltrating macrophages share gene expression similarities with nerve-crush-induced macrophages5 and express neurodegeneration-associated microglial marker genes6, although there is no axon loss or demyelination. Inhibiting the macrophage recruitment by genetically or pharmacologically blocking CCR2 signalling resulted in more severe heat hypoalgesia and accelerated skin denervation, as did deletion of Lgals3, a gene expressed in recruited macrophages. Recruitment of macrophages into the peripheral nerves of obese prediabetic mice is, therefore, neuroprotective, delaying terminal sensory axon degeneration by means of galectin 3. Potentiating and sustaining early neuroprotective immune responses in patients could slow or prevent peripheral neuropathy.",

We highlight these themes primarily as they relate to neurological diseases, the control of immunity, and the regulation of complex behaviours. We also consider the importance and challenges linked to the study of the neuroimmune connectome, which is defined as the totality of neuroimmune interactions in the body, because this provides a conceptual framework to identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Finally, we discuss how the latest techniques can advance our understanding of the neuroimmune connectome, and highlight the outstanding questions in the field.",

In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are theoretically contested1,2,3,4 and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude5,6. Here we present a method to directly access this quantity by precisely measuring the energy width of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the radioactive decay of beryllium-7. The final state in the decay process contains a recoiling lithium-7 nucleus, which is entangled with an electron neutrino at creation. The lithium-7 energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding beryllium-7 radioisotopes into a high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. Under this approach, we set a lower limit on the Heisenberg spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter of 6.2 pm, which implies that the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first, to our knowledge, direct lower limit on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket is extracted. These results may have implications in several areas including the theoretical understanding of neutrino properties, the nature of localization in weak nuclear decays and the interpretation of neutrino physics data.",

Li-deficient materials are thus excluded from battery design, and the battery fails when active Li ions are consumed3. Our study breaks this limit by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy. This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases. This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly. We leveraged machine learning to discover such functional salts and identified lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3) with optimal electrochemical activity, potential, product formation, electrolyte solubility and specific capacity. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated a 3.0 V, 1,192 Wh kg−1 Li-free cathode, chromium oxide, in the anode-less cell, as well as an organic sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode incorporated in a 388 Wh kg−1 pouch cell with a 440-cycle life. These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the lifetime of commercial LiFePO4 batteries was extended by at least an order of magnitude. With repeated external Li supplies, a commercial graphite|LiFePO4 cell displayed a capacity retention of 96.0% after 11,818 cycles.",

          "abstract": "Cumulative silicon photovoltaic (PV) waste highlights the importance of considering waste recycling before the commercialization of emerging PV technologies 1,2 . Perovskite PVs are a promising next-generation technology 3 , in which recycling their end-of-life waste can reduce the toxic waste and retain resources 4,5 . Here we report a low-cost, green-solvent-based holistic recycling strategy to restore all valuable components from perovskite PV waste. We develop an efficient aqueous-based perovskite recycling approach that can also rejuvenate degraded perovskites. We further extend the scope of recycling to charge-transport layers, substrates, cover glasses and metal electrodes. After repeated degradation–recycling processes, the recycled devices show similar efficiency and stability compared with the fresh devices. Our holistic recycling strategy reduces by 96.6% resource depletion and by 68.8% human toxicity (cancer effects) impacts associated with perovskite PVs compared with the landfill treatment. With recycling, the levelized cost of electricity also decreases for both utility-scale and residential systems. This study highlights unique opportunities of perovskite PVs for holistic recycling and paves the way for a sustainable perovskite solar economy.",

          "abstract": "Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors sense pathogen effectors and form resistosomes to confer immunity1. Some sensor NLR resistosomes produce small molecules to induce formation of a heterotrimer complex with two lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and SAG101, and a helper NLR called NRG1 (refs. 2,3). Activation of sensor NLR resistosomes also triggers NRG1 oligomerization and resistosome formation at the plasma membrane4,5. We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A heterotrimer formation is stabilized by the AtNRG1A loss-of-oligomerization mutant L134E5,6. We report structures of AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A L134E and AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1C heterotrimers with similar assembly mechanisms. AtNRG1A signalling is activated by the interaction with the AtEDS1–AtSAG101 heterodimer in complex with their small-molecule ligand. The truncated AtNRG1C maintains core interacting domains of AtNRG1A but develops further interactions with AtEDS1–AtSAG101 to outcompete AtNRG1A. Moreover, AtNRG1C lacks an N-terminal signalling domain and shows nucleocytoplasmic localization, facilitating its sequestration of AtEDS1–AtSAG101, which is also nucleocytoplasmic. Our study shows the activation and inhibition mechanisms of a plant helper NLR.",

          "abstract": "Zinc is emerging as a key material for next-generation biodegradable implants1,2,3,4,5. However, its inherent softness limits its use in load-bearing orthopaedic implants. Although reducing the grain size of zinc can make it stronger, it also destabilizes its mechanical properties and thus makes it less durable at body temperature6. Here we show that extruded Zn alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased while maintaining a basal texture. In this inverse Hall–Petch effect, the dominant deformation mode changes from inter-granular grain boundary sliding and dynamic recrystallization at the original grain size to intra-granular pyramidal slip and unusual twinning at the increased grain size. The role of the anomalous twins, termed ‘accommodation twins’ in this work, is to accommodate the altered grain shape in the plane lying perpendicular to the external loading direction, in contrast to the well-known ‘mechanical twins’ whose role is to deliver plasticity along the external loading direction7,8. The strength level achieved in these dilute zinc alloys is nearly double those of biodegradable implants made of magnesium alloys—making them the strongest and most stable biodegradable alloys available, to our knowledge, for fabricating bone fixation implants.",

          "abstract": "Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved behaviour that controls social hierarchies and protects valuable resources. In mice, aggressive behaviour can be broken down into an appetitive phase, which involves approach and investigation, and a consummatory phase, which involves biting, kicking and wrestling1. Here, by performing an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis on whole-brain FOS expression in mice, we identify a cluster of brain regions, including hypothalamic and amygdalar subregions and olfactory cortical regions, that are highly co-activated in male but not in female aggressors. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (COApl)—an extended olfactory structure—was found to be a hub region, on the basis of the number and strength of correlations with other regions in the cluster. Our data also show that oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing cells in the COApl (COAplEsr1) exhibit increased activity during attack behaviour and during bouts of investigation that precede an attack, in male mice only. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of COAplEsr1 cells in male aggressors reduces aggression and increases pro-social investigation without affecting social reward and reinforcement behaviour. We further show that COAplEsr1 projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala are necessary for these behaviours. Collectively, these data suggest that, in aggressive males, COAplEsr1 cells respond specifically to social stimuli, thereby enhancing their salience and promoting attack behaviour.",

Although they have feathered wings, the known Jurassic birds are more similar to non-avialan theropods in having the ancestral long reptilian tail9,10,11. This is in stark contrast to most Cretaceous and crownward taxa, which have a short tail that terminates in a compound bone called the pygostyle12,13,14. Here we report on the oldest short-tailed avialan, Baminornis zhenghensis gen. et sp. nov., from the recently discovered Late Jurassic Zhenghe Fauna15, which fills a noticeable spatio-temporal gap in the earliest branching avialan fossil record. B. zhenghensis exhibits a unique combination of derived ornithothoracine-like pectoral and pelvic girdles and plesiomorphic non-avialan maniraptoran hand, demonstrating mosaic evolution along stem avialan line. An avialan furcula collected from the same locality is referrable to ornithuromorphs on the basis of our morphometric and phylogenetic analyses. These newly discovered fossils demonstrate the early appearance of highly derived bird features, and together with an anchiornithine fossil from the same locality, they suggest an earlier origin of birds and a radiation of early birds in the Jurassic.",

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters contain vast amounts of hot ionized gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM is shorter than the age of the cluster. However, the absence of line emission associated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source1,2. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (‘sloshing’) motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for heat distribution from the outside of the core3,4. Here we present X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy, with velocities from 130 km s−1 to 310 km s−1 within about 30 kpc of the centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. Although the bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre, it could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be only ≲120 km s−1 in the core, even within about 10 kpc of the AGN. This suggests that the influence of the AGN on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster.",

Most cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are infiltrated by PNS neurons, contributing to the complex tumor microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumor mass. Thus, cancer or healthy organ-innervating neurons elude current tissue sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single cell resolution, we developed “Trace-n-seq”. This method employs retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing >5.000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons with about 4.000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas we reveal novel neuronal cell types and unique molecular networks distinct to pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC, or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuro-cancer-microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic cancer-nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a proinflammatory TME and increases immune-checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness. Nab-Paclitaxel causes intra-tumor neuropathy which attenuated PDAC growth and in combination with sympathetic denervation results in synergistic tumor regression. Our multi-dimensional data reveal new insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, supporting inclusion of denervation in future therapies.",

          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein 1,2 . Utrophin ( UTRN ), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD , is upregulated in some DMD patients 3–5 . To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMD PTC minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD , aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMD patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation 6–8 plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMD patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation via transcriptional adaptation. ",

          "abstract": "The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt (TeV) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena1,2,3. Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea4, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. We detect a muon with an estimated energy of \\(12{0}_{-60}^{+110}\\) petaelectronvolts (PeV). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now5,6,7 falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe.",

          "abstract": "Cancer mutations can create neomorphic protein–protein interactions to drive aberrant function 1,2 . As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma 3 , the most common embryonal brain tumour in children 4 . These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST 5 . However, their mechanism remains unresolved. Here we establish that KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2 as the direct target of the mutant substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we chart the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat β-propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 β-propellers is stabilized by the medulloblastoma mutations, which insert a bulky side chain into the HDAC1 active site pocket. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3–neosubstrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, we unveil a converging shape-complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4–HDAC1 interface and proliferation of KBTBD4-mutant medulloblastoma cells. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein–protein interactions.",

However, our grasp of the molecular functions of human genes remains incomplete and biased towards specific gene classes. The Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) Consortium aims to address this gap by creating a comprehensive catalogue of the molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with null alleles of all human genes using in vitro multicellular systems. In this Perspective, we present the strategic vision of the MorPhiC Consortium and discuss various strategies for generating null alleles, as well as the challenges involved. We describe the cellular models and scalable phenotypic readouts that will be used in the consortium’s initial phase, focusing on 1,000 protein-coding genes. The resulting molecular and cellular data will be compiled into a catalogue of null-allele phenotypes. The methodologies developed in this phase will establish best practices for extending these approaches to all human protein-coding genes. The resources generated—including engineered cell lines, plasmids, phenotypic data, genomic information and computational tools—will be made available to the broader research community to facilitate deeper insights into human gene functions.",

So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries2. Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries.",

Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells 4,5 . Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte–neuron metabolite shuttle 6 . Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential.",

Those methods that provide efficient access to structural alternatives for aromatic compounds (i.e., saturated arene bioisosteres), have become highly coveted.1,2,3,4 The incorporation of such bioisosteres typically leads to favorable drug-like properties and represents an emerging field of research. Here, we report a new synthetic method that furnishes one especially coveted motif, the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold,5,6 using mild reaction conditions and an operationally-simple protocol. The methodology proceeds via the uncommon coupling of two strained fragments: transiently-generated cyclic allenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, which possess considerable strain energies of ~30 kcal/mol7 and ~60 kcal/mol,6 respectively. The reaction is thought to proceed via a σ-bond insertion through a diradical pathway. However, rather than requiring an external stimulus to generate radical species, reactivity is thought to arise as a result of innate diradical character present in each reactant. This diradicaloid character,8 an underutilized parameter in reaction design, arises from the severe geometric distortions of each reactant. Our studies provide a means to access functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes of value for drug discovery, underscore how geometric distortion of reactants can be used to enable uncommon modes of reactivity, and should encourage the further exploration and strategic use of diradicaloids in chemical synthesis.",

Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus 1 , but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, ‘state cells’). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence.",

Owing to its distinct molecular structure and flexible hydrogen bonds that readily adapt to a wide range of pressures and temperatures, water forms numerous crystalline and amorphous phases4–6. Most relevant for the high pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors is ice VII4, and simulations have identified along its melting curve the existence of a so-called plastic phase7–12 where individual molecules occupy fixed positions as in a solid yet are able to rotate as in a liquid. Such plastic ice has not yet been directly observed in experiments. Here, we present quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements, conducted at temperatures between 450 and 600 K and pressures up to 6 GPa, that reveal the existence of a body centered cubic (bcc) structure, as found in ice VII, with water molecules exhibiting picosecond rotational dynamics typical for liquid water. Comparison with molecular dynamics simulations indicates that this plastic ice VII does not conform to a free rotor phase but rather exhibits rapid orientational jumps, as observed in jump-rotor plastic crystals13,14. We anticipate that our observation of plastic ice VII will impact our understanding of the geodynamics of icy planets and the differentiation processes of large icy moons.",

Meissner diamagnetic effect is observed at TM = 8 K via a mutual inductance setup, in agreement with the BKT-like transition. In-plane and out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exhibit anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) reveal that the bilayer nickelate films adopt a tetragonal phase under ~2% coherent epitaxial compressive strain in the NiO2 planes relative to the bulk.

However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications4. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/γ-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of γ-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of \\(\\mathrm{24,500}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\).

By co-opting KBTBD4, a substrate receptor of the CUL3–RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, UM171 promotes the degradation of the LSD1–CoREST corepressor complex, thereby limiting haematopoietic stem cell attrition 2,3 . However, the direct target and mechanism of action of UM171 remain unclear. Here we show that UM171 acts as a molecular glue to induce high-affinity interactions between KBTBD4 and HDAC1/2 to promote corepressor degradation. Through proteomics and chemical inhibitor studies, we identify the principal target of UM171 as HDAC1/2. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of dimeric KBTBD4 bound to UM171 and the LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST complex identifies an asymmetric assembly in which a single UM171 molecule enables a pair of KELCH-repeat propeller domains to recruit the HDAC1 catalytic domain. One KBTBD4 propeller partially masks the rim of the HDAC1 active site, which is exploited by UM171 to extend the E3–neosubstrate interface. The other propeller cooperatively strengthens HDAC1 binding through a distinct interface. The overall CoREST–HDAC1/2–KBTBD4 interaction is further buttressed by the endogenous cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate, which acts as a second molecular glue. The functional relevance of the quaternary complex interaction surfaces is demonstrated by base editor scanning of KBTBD4 and HDAC1 . By delineating the direct target of UM171 and its mechanism of action, we reveal how the cooperativity offered by a dimeric CRL3 E3 can be leveraged by a small molecule degrader.",

          "abstract": "People in Kulusuk, Greenland, after a fishing trip.Credit: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty\n\nAn analysis of the genomes of nearly 6,000 Greenlandic people suggests that their Inuit ancestors rarely moved around after settling the island around 1,000 years ago. This historical isolation means that people from some parts of Greenland are more likely to develop certain genetic diseases than are people in other parts of the world.\n\nThe findings, published on 12 February in Nature1, offer “new insights” on how genetics can be used to deliver better health care to Arctic populations, says Anders Koch, a senior physician at Queen Ingrid’s Hospital in Nuuk.\n\nAmbitious survey of human diversity yields millions of undiscovered genetic variants\n\nSmall, Indigenous populations — including Greenland’s — have long been a blind spot in genetics research, because most of the DNA in genetic databases comes from people of European ancestry. What little research has been done on the island suggests that living in the Arctic has profoundly altered the genetic make-up of Greenlanders, most of whom have mixed Inuit and European ancestry.\n\nIn the current study, researchers sequenced the DNA of 5,996 Greenlanders — around 14% of the adult population. By comparing these full or partially sequenced genomes, the team was able to confirm that Greenland was originally populated by a small group of travellers, fewer than 300 people, who arrived from Siberia, via North America, in the past 1,000 years.\n\nAfter the first big push, Greenland’s inhabitants “didn’t roam the coastline”, says Koch. Instead, they “sort of lived within a particular confined area and developed their own traits and variants”. Some of these gene variants seem to be adaptations to life in the Arctic. For example, many Greenlandic Inuit have the same variant of a gene involved in metabolizing fatty acids2 — this might be linked to the consumption of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as seal and whale meat.\n\nImpact of isolation",

          "abstract": "The US Environmental Protection Agency, with headquarters in Washington DC, regulates pollution to protect the environment and human health.Credit: Aaron Schwartz/ZUMA Press/Alamy\n\nBefore Donald Trump became US president for the second time last month, one of his Republican allies revealed a plan to put US government employees “in trauma” so that they would leave their jobs. The strategy, articulated by Russell Vought, now a key figure on Trump’s White House team, was one part of a larger plan to downsize and defund government agencies. Less than a month into the new administration, many scientists at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) say Vought’s plan seems to be working.\n\nDread and determination: how climate scientists are preparing for Trump 2.0\n\n“I’m scared to open my computer every morning,” says one EPA scientist who asked for anonymity because they fear reprisal. They are one of the more than 1,000 employees tasked with regulating air pollution, researching the health effects of toxic chemicals and more who were notified last week that they might be fired. These staff members are still in their initial, ‘probationary’ period — usually within one year of starting their jobs — and therefore can be fired at any time, said an agency e-mail they received. “It’s just cruel,” says the scientist.\n\nTermination notices for probationary employees started going out today at the EPA as the Trump administration accelerated efforts to fire this category of worker across the federal government. Thus far, the scientists who spoke to Nature have not been affected, but they fear they could be at any moment.\n\nWhite House officials declined to respond to Nature’s questions. In a statement, the EPA said that the agency is “diligently implementing President Trump's executive orders and associated guidance” and “remains committed to our mission of protecting human health and the environment”. The goal, it added, “is to create a more effective and efficient federal government”.\n\nAn agency under fire\n\nThe EPA has long been a target of Trump and his Republican allies. The politicians say that the agency hampers the US economy by issuing excessively strict pollution regulations. Republicans, including Vought, had called for the agency to be downsized and its authority reined in, as set out in ‘Project 2025’, a proposed blueprint for a second Trump administration.\n\nAnother action that EPA scientists say has been demoralizing is the announcement, on 11 February, by Trump-appointed agency administrator Lee Zeldin that 171 staff members were being placed on administrative leave. These employees work on programmes related to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental justice, which focuses on protecting poor communities that are vulnerable to pollution and climate change. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order asking all agencies to eliminate “radical and wasteful government DEI programs”, including environmental-justice positions.\n\nLee Zeldin was appointed by US President Donald Trump to lead the EPA during his second administration.Credit: Anna Moneymaker/Getty\n\nIn his announcement, Zeldin accused the administration of former US president Joe Biden, a Democrat, of pushing “ideological” goals with those programmes. “This ends now,” Zeldin said in a statement. “We will be good stewards of tax dollars and do everything in our power to deliver clean air, land, and water to every American, regardless of race, religion, background, and creed.”\n\nSo far, EPA scientists interviewed by Nature say that core research activities at the agency, such as papers being published and studies being run, have not been significantly affected, although two of its main science advisory panels, which provide technical guidance to the agency, have been disbanded so that new members can be appointed. And the agency has taken down the website of an environmental-justice tool known as EJScreen, which maps threats such as pollution alongside demographic trends to identify vulnerable communities. But many scientists fear it’s just a matter of time.\n\n“The only good news right now is that the administration’s attention seems to be elsewhere,” says Andy Miller, who retired from the EPA’s primary-research branch, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), in December. “It’s unlikely that will continue.”\n\nWorries over safety\n\nNature spoke to multiple staff members in the EPA’s environmental-justice programme who also asked for anonymity because they fear retribution. One of them, now among those on administrative leave, says the situation has injected uncertainty into every facet of their life, from career prospects to the mortgage payments on their home. They also worry about their personal safety. Last week, reports emerged of a ‘DEI Watch List’ created by a right-wing organization that exposed the names, photos and salaries of federal workers, many of them people of colour, whose jobs are linked to DEI efforts. Its aim, the group says, is to restore “common sense” to the US government.\n\n“I’ve got close friends” on that list, one EPA staff member says, and fears they’ll be added, too, if the organization turns its attention to the agency. “It’s not even about targeting institutions and funding and priorities: people are actually being targeted as individuals.”\n\nEPA contractors remove hazardous waste from a home destroyed in the Los Angeles wildfires that raged in January.Credit: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nOne environmental scientist at the agency says that this is their second time as a probationary employee under Trump. They re-entered probationary status recently because of a transfer to a new role in the agency. They note that many probationary employees can appeal a termination if it was because of discrimination or for political reasons, but that assumes that normal rules in the government remain intact.",

Other companies using a similar technology to build machines — called neutral-atom quantum computers — are also making gains on industry leaders such as IBM.\n\n‘A truly remarkable breakthrough’: Google’s new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone\n\nNeutral-atom technology “is catching up”, says Doug Finke, a computer scientist who works at business-analysis firm Global Quantum Intelligence and is based in Orange County, California. “As far as we know, this is the largest venture investment in a neutral-atom company.”\n\nNeutral atoms are stable and can remain in their quantum states without the need for bulky cooling systems. These are features that should make them excellent qubits, the building blocks of a quantum computer, equivalent to classical bits of information. But for years, progress in neutral-atom quantum computing was stymied by how precisely physicists could coax the particles to carry out calculations.\n\nQuantum race\n\nAdvances in ways to configure and control the atoms since 2019 mean that operations are now close in accuracy to those in other hardware types. “Over the past few years, we’ve seen major breakthroughs,” says Wenchao Xu, a physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. “There is definitely a lot of excitement.”\n\nAtom-based quantum computers are catching up with those made by firms such as IonQ or Google, which use trapped ions or tiny superconducting circuits to represent quantum states. QuEra in Boston, Massachusetts, is not alone in pursing neutral-atom technology: Atom Computing in Berkeley, California, Infleqtion in Boulder, Colorado, and Pasqal in Massy, France, have created machines with hundreds of qubits.\n\nThis billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed?\n\nTheir road maps to expand the number of interacting qubits are among the industry’s most aggressive. Making a computer that can start to perform useful calculations will probably take tens of thousands of qubits, working together to overcome errors that are inherent to quantum systems.\n\nQuEra was spun off from research at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both in Cambridge. In its system, physicists trap an array of rubidium atoms using laser light and store quantum information in the energy levels of the atom’s electrons.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Credit: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty\n\nA new and seemingly more impressive artificial intelligence (AI) tool is released almost weekly, and researchers are flocking to try them out. Whether they are looking to edit manuscripts, write code or generate hypotheses, researchers have more generative AI tools to choose from than ever before.\n\nEach large language model (LLM) is suited to different tasks. Some are available through free chatbots, whereas others use a paid-for application programming interface (API) that means they can be integrated with other software. A few can also be downloaded, allowing researchers to build their own custom models.\n\nAlthough LLMs produce human-like responses, they all remain too error-prone to be used on their own, says Carrie Wright, a data scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, headquartered in Seattle, Washington.\n\nSo which LLM is best for what task? Here, researchers share their current favourites with Nature to help guide those in need.\n\no3-mini (the reasoner)\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, California, introduced the world to LLMs in 2022 with its free-to-use ChatGPT bot. Scientists have mainly used the bot to look up information or as a writing assistant, for example to draft abstracts, but newer models are broadening the technology’s potential uses. Last September, in the firm’s most significant advance since then, OpenAI wowed scientists with its o1 ‘reasoning model’, which it followed with the more advanced o3 in December. Both reasoning models work more slowly than an LLM alone does, because they have been trained to answer queries in a step-by-step way. This ‘chain of thought’ process, aimed at simulating human reasoning, has helped them to smash tough benchmarks in science and mathematics. It has also made them good at technical tasks, such as solving coding issues and reformatting data.\n\nAfter the little-known Chinese start-up DeepSeek in Hangzhou launched a rival reasoner on 20 January, OpenAI responded with a range of new tools. These include a speedy o3-mini — a reasoner that is free for registered chatbot users — and ‘deep research’, which allows some paying subscribers to create reports that synthesize information, with citations, from hundreds of websites, akin to carrying out a literature review. The models excel when used in combination, says Andrew White, a chemist and AI expert at FutureHouse, a start-up in San Francisco.\n\nWhen it comes to tasks such as picking apart unfamiliar concepts in a new mathematical proof, o3-mini does a “really good job”, says Simon Frieder, a mathematician and AI researcher at the University of Oxford, UK. But even the best models “are still not even close to rivalling a mathematician”, he says.\n\nDeepSeek (the all-rounder)\n\nDeepSeek-R1, launched last month, has abilities on a par with o1’s, but is available through an API at a fraction of the cost. It also stands apart from OpenAI’s models because it is open weight, meaning that although its training data have not been released, anyone can download the underlying model and tailor it to their specific research project. R1 has “just unlocked a new paradigm” in which communities, particularly those with relatively few resources, can build specialized reasoning models, says White.\n\nRunning the full model requires access to powerful computing chips, which many academics lack. But researchers such as Benyou Wang, a computer scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, are creating versions that can run or train on a single machine. Like o1, DeepSeek-R1’s forte is maths problems and writing code. But it is also good at tasks such as generating hypotheses, says White. This is because DeepSeek has opted to publish the model’s ‘thought processes’ in full, which allows researchers to better refine their follow-up questions and ultimately improve its outputs, he says. Such transparency could also be hugely powerful for medical diagnostics. Wang is adapting R1 in experiments that use the model’s reasoning-like powers to build “a clear and logical pathway from patient assessment to diagnosis and treatment recommendation”, he says.\n\nDeepSeek-R1 has some cons. The model seems to have a particularly long ‘thought’ process, which slows it down and makes it less useful for looking up information or brainstorming. Concerns about the security of data input into its API and chatbot have led several governments to ban workers at national agencies from using the chatbot. DeepSeek also seems to have taken fewer measures to mitigate its models generating harmful outputs than have its commercial competitors. Adding filters to prevent such outputs — instructions to make weapons, for instance — takes time and effort. Although it is unlikely that this was done on purpose, “the lack of guard rails is worrisome”, says Simon.\n\nOpenAI has also suggested that DeepSeek may have “inappropriately distilled” its models, referring to a method for training a model on another algorithm’s outputs, which OpenAI’s conditions of use prohibit.\n\nDeepSeek could not be reached for comment on these criticisms before this article was published.\n\nSome researchers see such distillation as commonplace and are happy to use R1, but others are wary of using a tool that could be subject to future litigation. There’s a chance that scientists using R1 could be forced to retract papers, if using the model was considered a violation of the journal's ethical standards, says Ana Catarina De Alencar, a lawyer at EIT Manufacturing in Paris who specializes in AI law. A similar situation could apply to the use of models by OpenAI and other firms accused of intellectual-property violations, says De Alencar. News organizations claim that the firms used journalistic content to train their models without permission.\n\nLlama (the workhorse)\n\nLlama has long been a go-to LLM for the research community. A family of open-weight models first released by Meta AI in Menlo Park, California, in 2023, versions of Llama have been downloaded more than 600 million times through the open-science platform Hugging Face alone. The fact it can be downloaded and built on is “probably why Llama has been embraced by the research community”, says Elizabeth Humphries, a data scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.\n\nBeing able to run an LLM on personal or institutional servers is essential when working with proprietary or protected data, to avoid sensitive information being fed back to other users or to the developers, says Wright.\n\nResearchers have built on Llama’s models to make LLMs that predict materials’ crystal structure, as well as to simulate the outputs of a quantum computer. Tianlong Chen, a machine-learning scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says Llama was a good fit for simulating a quantum computer because it was relatively easy to adapt it to understand specialized quantum language.\n\nBut Llama requires users to request permission to access it, which is minor point of friction for some, says White. As a result, other open models such as OLMo, developed by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, or Qwen, built by the Chinese firm Alibaba Cloud, based in Hangzhou, are now often the first choice in research, he adds. DeepSeek’s efficient underlying V3 model is also a rival base for building scientific models.\n\nClaude (the coder)",

          "title": "China made waves with Deepseek, but its real ambition is AI-driven industrial innovation",
          "authors": "Jacob Dreyer",
          "abstract": "When US technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel’s book Zero to One was published in Chinese in 2015, it struck at an insecurity felt by many in China. Thiel suggested that although the country excelled at scaling and commercializing emerging technologies, it lagged behind the United States in true innovation — creating something entirely original from scratch. Take the iPhone: engineers in Cupertino, California, design them; workers in -Shenzhen, China, build them.\n\nFor more than a decade, Chinese policymakers have aimed to shed this image, embedding the pursuit of innovation into national industrial policies, such as Made in China 2025. And there are some early results to show. For instance, in 2023, the Shenzhen-based technology company Huawei launched the Mate 60 smartphone, which is powered by a domestically produced chip. This was celebrated as a symbolic breakthrough — demonstrating that China could manufacture advanced semiconductors despite stringent US sanctions on crucial tools and high-end design software. And last month’s release of Deepseek-R1, a Chinese large language model developed at a fraction of the cost of its Western counterparts, sent shockwaves through the US tech establishment.\n\nProminent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen described it as “AI’s Sputnik moment” — a reference to the mid-twentieth-century US–Soviet space race that began with the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik, by the Soviet Union. Accessing Deepseek through an application programming interface (API) — a protocol for connecting software applications — is roughly 13 times cheaper than similar models developed by OpenAI, based in San Francisco, California.\n\nThe sudden rise of Deepseek has put the spotlight on China’s wider artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, which operates differently from Silicon Valley. Although consumer-facing applications garner much attention, Chinese AI firms, unlike their US counterparts, are in fact more invested in solving industrial and manufacturing problems at scale. The divergence in priorities reflects the forces driving innovation in each economy: venture capital in the United States and large-scale manufacturing enterprises and organs of the state in China.\n\nTechnology split\n\nAt the root of the difference is China’s comparative advantage in the world economy — manufacturing — along with the government being the largest client for new technologies. The Chinese government aims to develop low-cost, scalable AI applications that can modernize the rapidly developing country.\n\nAt a press conference last September, for example, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian laid out the view of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that tech innovation is a core component of “national development”. To stay in the good books of Beijing, AI research laboratories have responded by building practical applications — to make trains run on time, monitor fish stocks and provide automated telehealth services.\n\nBeijing-based company Zhipu AI has partnered with several local governments and state-owned enterprises to deploy its agent model, which automates tasks such as form-filling and financial-report analysis. Last month, tech behemoth Alibaba, headquartered in Hangzhou, China, reached a deal with the Beijing-based startup 01.AI to set up an ‘industrial large model laboratory’ focused on deploying AI to optimize business and industrial processes.\n\nNvidia is a US company that manufactures chips needed to build AI systems.Credit: Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nAI also has an interesting role in China’s energy transition, from large-scale trials of integrated smart homes to the roll-out of a major investment (equivalent to US$800 billion) for a national smart grid.\n\nThus, Beijing’s goal is not necessarily to attain global leadership in AI chatbots, but to use the underlying technology to develop affordable, commercially viable business solutions. Its applications can then be exported, especially to lower-income countries. In other words, China’s target is not necessarily ‘frontier AI’, but ‘mass-market AI’. Its emerging AI playbook mirrors its approach to other technologies, such as electric vehicles and clean energy: not the first to innovate, but the first to make them affordable for widespread use.\n\nOut of necessity\n\nThe technological ‘stack’, an interconnected set of resources needed to develop advanced AI models, includes hardware, such as semiconductors; cutting-edge learning algorithms optimized for that hardware; and a backend comprising energy-intensive data centres and predictable capital flows.\n\nTo maintain its global lead in AI technology, the United States has periodically imposed export sanctions on key components. On 7 October 2022, the administration of former US president Joe Biden released a set of export controls on advanced computing and semiconductor-manufacturing items, aiming to block China from purchasing high-performance chips from companies such as Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California. Then--national-security-adviser Jake Sullivan called it the “small yard, high fence” strategy: the United States would erect a ‘fence’ around crucial AI technologies, encouraging even companies in allied countries, such as the Netherlands and South Korea, to restrict shipments to China.\n\nChina–US research collaborations are in decline — this is bad news for everyone\n\nMeanwhile, the CCP sees moving up the manufacturing supply chain, particularly into categories such as airplanes and semiconductors, as crucial for sustained economic growth. In that sense, the rivalry adds urgency and intensity to China’s efforts. If the United States owns the technology of the future and is willing to use export controls, then China runs the risk of economic stagnation — and the political turbulence that might accompany it. The battle for supremacy over AI is part of this larger geopolitical matrix.\n\nAnd China has been preparing for this scenario for a while. In 2019, the US added Huawei to its entity list, a trade-restriction list published by the Department of Commerce. This spurred China to rethink how to become less vulnerable to US export controls. The Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE) created a set of integrated research platforms (IRPs), a major institutional overhaul to help the country to catch up in key areas, including robotics, driverless cars and AI, that are vulnerable to US sanctions or export controls. There are now 30 IRPs.\n\nTake the IRP for new-generation integrated circuit technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, for instance — the sort of state-driven research enterprise that could drive breakthroughs. The 2022 export restrictions targeted chips with ‘nodes’ — the smallest component on a semiconductor — of 14 nanometres or less. Chips with smaller nodes can pack more transistors into the same area, potentially improving performance and efficiency. In 2021, the Fudan IRP was ahead of the curve, and already recruiting for roles to support research on even smaller nodes, of 3–4 nanometres. These high-performance chips now fuel the AI tech stack. To address manufacturing bottlenecks, the third round of China’s ‘Big Fund’ — a state-backed investment initiative to pool in resources from -public enterprises and local governments — was announced last year, with a planned US$47 billion investment in its semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nThis shows that China is serious about indigenizing AI capabilities by investing significant institutional, academic and scientific resources. By restricting access to chips, US policy has forced China to explore workarounds and unconventional methods. Many of these endeavours might fail. But it doesn’t take many successes to make a global impact.\n\nThe IRPs have emerged as ideal platforms to train a cadre of engineers, filling a talent gap that existed even a decade ago. The Deepseek success story is, in part, a reflection of this years-long investment.",

          "abstract": "Researchers have developed nanosensors that can detect signs of cancer in blood.Credit: Maskot/Getty\n\nResearchers have developed a simple blood test to detect pancreatic cancer before it spreads to other sites in the body. The test could be used for routine screening to improve the disease’s low survival rate1.\n\n“It’s a very pragmatic, really translatable solution” that builds on many advances in the field, says Simone Schürle-Finke, a biomedical engineer at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland. The results are described in Science Translational Medicine today.\n\nMost pancreatic cancers begin in the ducts that secrete enzymes used to digest food. But this form of cancer often doesn’t cause recognizable symptoms and isn’t detectable until it has metastasized and spread, making it difficult to treat. In 2022, some 467,000 people died of the disease globally. “There is a huge need for developing new ways of detecting pancreatic cancer early,” says study co-author Jared Fischer, a molecular biologist at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland.\n\nTelltale proteins\n\nFischer and his colleagues focused on detecting enzymes called proteases, which break down proteins and are active in tumours, even from the very early stages. They specifically looked at the activity of matrix metalloproteinases involved in chewing up collagen and the extracellular matrix, which helps tumours to invade the body.\n\nTo detect the presence of these proteases in the blood, the researchers developed nanosensors containing a magnetic nanoparticle attached to a small peptide that attracts matrix metalloproteinases and a fluorescent molecule. They then placed millions of nanosensors in a tiny sample of blood. If matrix metalloproteinases were present, and active, they would chop the peptide in the nanosensors, releasing the fluorescent molecule. The researchers then used a magnet to suck out all the unchopped nanosensors, and measure how many chopped fluorescent particles were left. The more active proteases were present in the blood, the brighter the sample was.\n\nThe researchers tested the nanosensor on frozen blood samples from 356 individuals, some with pancreatic cancer, some with non-cancerous forms of pancreatic disease and healthy controls. The nanosensor correctly identified healthy individuals 98% of the time, and identified people with pancreatic cancer with 73% accuracy. It always distinguished between individuals with cancer and those with other pancreatic diseases.\n\nGiven that proteases are important for many bodily functions, Schürle-Finke did not expect the nanosensor to identify such a clear tumour signal in the blood. “I was really surprised to see that,” she says. The 73% sensitivity needs to be pushed higher before the sensors can be used by physicians, but overall, it is “a very promising, very impressive result”.",

          "abstract": "An enzyme structure designed using a combination of machine-learning tools. Credit: Sam Pellock\n\nResearchers have used artificial intelligence (AI) to design brand-new enzymes that can go through multi-step reactions, a key feature of natural enzymes. The structures they made accelerated a four-step chemical reaction pivotal to many biological and industrial processes, including plastic recycling.\n\n“This is a milestone in enzyme engineering,” says Huimin Zhao, a synthetic biologist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “[It] shows that now it’s possible to design enzymes with native-like activity that could make them useful practically.”\n\nEarlier efforts to design enzymes from scratch using AI have had limited success, often producing ones that stall after the first step of a reaction. In the latest study, published in Science on 13 February1, researchers overcame this challenge by combining several machine-learning approaches. The new enzymes were 60,000 times better at speeding up the reaction than ones previously designed to work in a similar way.\n\nTailoring enzymes\n\nEarlier efforts have focused on tweaking the structures of existing enzymes to create new ones that work faster or have different functions. But this approach makes it difficult to create efficient enzymes capable of multi-step reactions.\n\n“It is like going to the thrift store and buying a suit, and that suit probably won’t fit you perfectly. That’s what happens when we try to design enzymes that way,” says study co-author Anna Lauko, a protein designer at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nAI has dreamt up a blizzard of new proteins. Do any of them actually work?\n\nLauko and her colleagues wanted to build enzymes that can undergo a four-step chemical reaction called serine hydrolysis, which involves breaking an ester bond between molecules. Serine hydrolases are the natural enzymes that carry out this reaction, and they are involved in many biological processes, including digestion, metabolizing fats and blood clotting.\n\nThe researchers started with an AI tool called RFdiffusion, a program they had previously developed to generate new enzyme structures from scratch2. They then created a deep neural network, called PLACER, to refine the structural design by modelling the locations of atoms in the enzyme and the molecules it binds to during every step of the reaction. This AI works like “a filter”, says Zou: it checks whether the enzyme’s active sites — the parts that interact with molecules — are compatible and properly arranged to carry out each step of the reaction. This is “very innovative”, says Zhao.",

Randazzo works on NASA’s Mars rover science team, helping to collect and analyse mineral samples gathered by Perseverance.Credit: Nicolas Randazzo\n\nNicolas Randazzo is proud of his unusual title: Mars 2020 Perseverance rover postdoctoral scientist. He’s based at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, where he works with meteorite geologist Chris Herd. But Randazzo also collaborates with NASA’s Mars rover science team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. Team members work together to collect and analyse remote visual and chemical data sent to Earth by the car-sized Perseverance rover, which landed in Jezero crater on 18 February 2021. He dreams of the day when samples of rocks and soil can be physically returned to Earth, allowing for more-detailed analysis to address questions including whether mineral samples hold evidence of life.\n\nTo prepare for the sample return, Randazzo also works on NASA’s analogue, or simulation, research. He is part of a team that orchestrates sample collection from Martian-like habitats on Earth, such as the Pilbara desert in Australia, to help refine understanding of how precious Mars samples should be handled in the future. Randazzo tells Nature about working with material from another planet and how he is planning for his career’s future, knowing that decades could pass before Martian samples get shipped back to Earth.\n\nHow does Perseverance help us to understand the Martian surface?\n\nPlanning for life on Mars\n\nEvery day, we’re moving along with the rover, exploring new environments and samples. I’m involved in studying Martian chemistry and sedimentology to better understand the ancient water flows and climate of the red planet, and gain clues about whether it held ancient life. The rover’s multiple instruments enable multidisciplinary exploration. The PIXL instrument uses X-ray fluorescence to determine the microscopic make-up of rocks. High-resolution cameras MastCam-Z and Supercam take zoomed in and out views of the Martian surface, atmosphere, rocks and soils. SHERLOC uses cameras, spectrometers and a laser to search for organic molecules and minerals altered by water. Wonderful high-resolution cameras allow us to look at geology in context and ask simple questions, such as, ‘Why is this mineral white or this mineral red?’ Wonderful people on the team stitch images together to make 3D models. You can put on a virtual-reality headset and simulate touching an outcrop of rock. There are a lot of great instruments, and a lot we can learn, but it’s always a team effort.\n\nWhat have you found recently?\n\nAn exciting find a few months ago was a surface covered in leopard-like spots. We discovered that their chemistry indicates the possibility of redox reactions — chemical reactions, involving the exchange of electrons, that are common and vital to life functions such as photosynthesis and respiration, but also to abiotic processes that are nothing to do with life, like corrosion or rusting. We also found a chemical signature suggestive of vivianite, a mineral often found in fossil shells, and other compounds that could suggest there is life — or was life. But we can’t say for sure. There are also potential non-life explanations. We don’t want to jump the gun, as happened in 1996 with the Allan Hills meteorite, which looked as if it contained worm-like fossils. Then-US president Bill Clinton announced in a speech that NASA had found possible evidence for Martian life. It turned out that the rock contained structures created by abiotic processes.\n\nA photo taken on 12 March 2024 by the Perseverance Mars rover of the Bunsen Peak rock, where the rover collected mineral-core and abrasion samples.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS\nWhy do we need to bring Martian samples back to Earth?\n\nAs wonderful as Perseverance’s instruments are, nothing beats actually having samples here, to run analyses in laboratories, with higher precision. For example, none of the instruments on Mars are doing stable isotope analyses, which could tell us more about how warm and wet Mars was in the past, using oxygen and carbon isotopes. To look at isotopes of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur and strontium, you must bring rocks here. The same goes for radiometric dating to estimate when a rock was deposited. We can’t do that work on Mars. Bringing samples home is infinitely more valuable than anything remote science can tell us.\n\nWhen will a mission bring samples back?\n\nThere is more than a bit of uncertainty about that. The original plan for Mars Sample Return was the early 2030s. Now it seems it’s been pushed to the 2040s and it’s going to be more expensive than originally predicted. Plus, there is competition with other missions. It’s always a balance between finances and time, and there’s been an open call to industry partners to see if they’re willing to invest in making it happen.\n\nHow do you plan for your future work, given that sample return could be 20 years away?\n\nIs there life on Mars? What a cave on Earth can teach us\n\nA lot of research questions come up minute-by-minute, as we see the remote samples. We’ll be driving the rover, find something interesting, scrape the rock’s surface to get a sample and then see what it looks like geologically and chemically by doing a PIXL scan. Then, if it’s deemed worthwhile, the rover collects a physical sample that is stored in a titanium tube. Some of the sample tubes are stored inside the rover and, just in case of catastrophic losses, back-up samples are also placed on the Martian ground in a cache at the Three Forks sample depot in Jezero Crater.\n\nMuch of the Perseverance work here on Earth focuses on: how do we handle samples if and when we get them back? What’s the order of analyses we’re going to do?\n\nA close-up of the core sample taken from the Bunsen Peak rock.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nIn some ways, there are advantages to the samples’ return being far into the future. Right now, we can detect sulfur compounds at the parts per billion or parts per trillion level — something that, decades ago, was almost unimaginable. So, 10–15 years from now, there will be more-precise techniques.\n\nA lot of careers will open up because of materials brought back. In 2022, scientists opened a tube from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission to the Moon. I had the opportunity to hold that tube in my hands during a recent tour of the Apollo lab at the JSC. The Apollo missions came back more than 50 years ago, but there are studies being done now on the material they brought that weren’t possible then. The same will happen with Mars samples — there will be analyses and work for decades to come.",

          "abstract": "Engineers prepare to add a KM3NeT module to the network of sea-floor detectors. Credit: Paschal Coyle/CNRS\n\nAstrophysicists have observed the most energetic neutrino ever. The particle — which probably came from a distant galaxy — was spotted by the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), a collection of light-detecting glass spheres on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea, on 13 February 2023. Researchers monitoring the telescope did not notice the detection until early 2024, when they completed the first analysis of their data. They unveiled it as a potentially record event last year at a conference in Milan, Italy, but did not disclose details such as the timing, direction or energy of the neutrino.\n\n“We had to convince ourselves that it wasn’t something strange or weird with the telescope,” says Paschal Coyle, a neutrino physicist at Aix-Marseille University in France and KM3NeT spokesperson. The result was published on 12 February in Nature1, and will be described in four preprints due to be posted on the arXiv preprint server.\n\nHigh-energy neutrinos\n\nNeutrinos are electrically neutral particles more than one million times lighter than an electron. They are typically produced in nuclear reactions such as those at the centre of the Sun, from which they emerge with energies on the order of millions of electronvolts (106 eV). But for more than 10 years, researchers have been recording neutrinos carrying unprecedented energies of up to several quadrillion electronvolts (1015 eV, or 1 petaelectronvolt), which are thought to originate in distant galaxies. (The most energetic particle ever detected, at 320,000 PeV, was not a neutrino but a cosmic ray dubbed the Oh-My-God particle.)\n\n‘Fantastic’ particle could be most energetic neutrino ever detected\n\nKM3NeT consists of strings of sensitive light detectors anchored to the sea floor at a depth of around 3,500 metres off the coast of the Italian island of Sicily, as well as in a second, smaller array near Toulon, France. These sensors pick up light emitted by high-energy, electrically charged particles such as muons. Muons are continuously raining down on Earth’s surface, because they are produced when cosmic rays hit air molecules. But occasionally, a cosmic neutrino that smashes into the planet’s surface also produces a muon.\n\nIn the February 2023 event detected by the Sicily observatory, the team estimated that the muon carried 120 PeV of energy, on the basis of the unusual amount of light it produced. The particle’s path was close to horizontal with respect to Earth’s surface and travelled eastwards, towards Greece.\n\nSource: Ref. 1Source: Aiello, S. et al. Nature 638, 376–382 (2025).",

          "title": "Researchers overlooked airborne diseases for centuries — then COVID-19 changed everything",
          "authors": "Linsey C. Marr",
          "abstract": "Air-Borne: The Hidden History of the Life We Breathe Carl Zimmer Dutton (2025)\n\nIn the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, one of the most pressing questions for researchers was how the SARS-CoV-2 virus was transmitted. Some physicians and public-health specialists argued that the virus spread solely in wet droplets from coughing. Others — backed by aerosol scientists — thought that it also spread through the air.\n\nIn Air-borne, acclaimed science writer Carl Zimmer examines why it took more than a year of vociferous debate to establish that the second theory was correct. His book is an enthralling historical exploration of the role of airborne microorganisms in disease, and examines why these pathogens have been overlooked for centuries.\n\nVaccine specialist Peter Hotez: scientists are ‘under attack for someone else’s political gain’\n\nThe beginning of ‘aerobiology’, as -Zimmer labels it, had its roots in ancient Greece. -Hippocrates, a physician and philosopher, was the first to propose that a miasma — “an invisible corruption of the air” — caused disease. The concept endured: from the fourteenth century onwards, miasmas were often wrongly blamed for plague outbreaks that devastated cites across the world. Now, we know that the disease was caused by a bacterium carried by fleas that live on rodents.\n\nA long history\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Italian physician -Girolamo Fracastoro wrote a book about tiny, invisible ‘seeds’ that could multiply in a host and spread through the air. Proponents of his theory, known as contagionists, would lock horns with miasmatists — who maintained that the air itself was the cause of disease — for the next 300 years. It wasn’t until the late 1800s — after physician Robert Koch proved that anthrax was caused by bacteria — that the idea that microbes cause infectious diseases became accepted and miasma theory was rejected.\n\nIn the 1930s, scientists began seriously considering the idea that microbes can spread disease through the air. Mildred Wells was an insightful, rigorous researcher who found that poliovirus was airborne. Her husband William — inspired by his wife’s work — pivoted from studying waterborne to airborne pathogens, and made the revolutionary discovery that bacteria released in sneezes could linger in the air of a classroom after the students had left.\n\nDr Semmelweis review: Mark Rylance play shows how hand washing saved hundreds of lives\n\nIn their landmark theory of airborne disease transmission, they proposed that diseases not only are spread through the droplets that are dispelled by coughs and sneezes and fall quickly to the ground, but also can be transmitted in microdroplets, now known as aerosol particles. These tiny particles, they argued, are released with every exhalation, settle very slowly and drift long distances.\n\nMildred went on to show that disinfecting air in schools with ultraviolet light reduced cold and flu incidence. William, meanwhile, found that hospitalized people with tuberculosis could infect guinea pigs through bacteria in aerosol particles — much to the annoyance of hospital staff, who for years had to run extra tuberculosis tests and autopsy dozens of guinea pigs. Unfortunately, the duo’s work was largely dismissed — perhaps owing to concern about reviving the discredited miasma theory and their “cantankerous and wearying” personalities.\n\nReading Air-borne, I felt frustrated by how long it took for researchers to accept that pathogens could spread through the air. Zimmer synthesizes research from various fields in a way that makes airborne transmission seem obvious, illustrating how scientific siloing inhibits progress. For example, plant pathologists knew from the early 1900s that the fungus that causes rust on wheat could spread to farms hundreds of kilometres away. Yet physicians — focused on the idea that -diseases spread through contact with infected people or contaminated objects — vehemently rejected the idea of airborne transmission indoors, even as late as the 1950s.",

My research on cave-bat conservation took me to remote locations, crawling through caves knee-deep in guano, catching bats. Back then, taking photos felt like a distraction from my research.\n\nBut two years ago, I left the academic world for a career as a science communicator at the GENUS hub at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in South Africa. Today, I work alongside researchers, helping them to bring their science to life through compelling stories. Visuals, particularly photographs, are a key part of this work.\n\nLooking back, I wish I’d captured more of my field experiences. Photos are priceless tools for public engagement, yet many researchers fail to see their value. Now, I understand that science doesn’t just live in publications — it lives in stories, visuals and the personal connections that we create with people.\n\nPics, or it didn’t happen\n\nDuring my postdoctoral position in ecology and viral zoonosis at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, my team and I worked mainly in a rural part of Limpopo, on the northeastern side of South Africa, in a small village called Ga-Mafefe. The landscape was lush and green, dotted with ancient fig trees and alive with the rhythm of daily life.\n\nPhotography: Science on camera\n\nWithin minutes of arriving at the cave site at the base of a steep hill, my team from the Centre for Viral Zoonoses would transform a patch of wilderness into a fully functioning research station, complete with a working centrifuge, powered by portable car batteries. We would dress head-to-toe in white, crinkly Tyvek suits (a type of lightweight, protective, plastic onesie that could shield both us and the bats from contaminants). With respirators humming, we looked like something straight out of the 1995 medical-disaster movie Outbreak.\n\nFor a week every month, this was my reality. I’d catch bats with specialized traps, and then spend hours hunched over folding camping tables carefully measuring the animals and collecting biological samples. Summer nights were sweltering, with sweat pooling in our suits; meanwhile, winters had us shivering, our noses running faster than we could wipe them, although wiping wasn’t exactly an option. It was exhausting, repetitive and, at times, comically miserable — but it was also exhilarating. We were a well-oiled machine, driven by a shared passion and the late-night humour that only a sleep-deprived team in the middle of nowhere could understand.\n\nThen in 2022, I did a three-month science-storytelling fellowship with the Nature, Environment and Wildlife Filmmakers — an organization that aims to build a network of visual storytellers, led by Indigenous African voices, celebrating and protecting Africa’s natural history — and it completely changed my perspective. I rediscovered my creative side and came to understand that scientific exchange can take many forms beyond just research papers. Armed with this newfound inspiration, I started taking photographs of everything during our fieldwork, capturing the beauty and intensity of our work.\n\nMariëtte van der Walt back in her bat-fieldwork days.Credit: Mariette van der Walt\n\nBack home in Johannesburg, my family and friends were captivated by the stories my photos told. Through my lens, they saw breathtaking landscapes, rough conditions and, of course, cute bats. I felt like my work could connect with people in a way data alone never could.\n\nWith this perspective, I realized that as much as I loved my research, my postdoctoral studies weren’t the right place to pursue my newfound passion for storytelling. I decided to leave academia and embrace a career in science communication.\n\nEcologists: don’t lose touch with the joy of fieldwork",

          "title": "Dozens of new obesity drugs are coming: these are the ones to watch",
          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "For Kristian Cook, every pizza box he opened was another door closed on the path to overcoming obesity. “I had massive cravings for pizza,” he says. “That was my biggest downfall.”\n\nAt 114 kilograms and juggling a daily regimen of medications for high cholesterol, hypertension and gout, the New Zealander resolved to take action. In late 2022, at the age of 46, Cook joined a clinical trial that set out to test a combination of the weight-loss drug semaglutide — better known by its brand names, Ozempic or Wegovy — and an experimental drug designed to preserve muscle while shedding fat.\n\nMuscle loss is a big concern for people on anti-obesity medications such as semaglutide. These ‘GLP-1 agonists’ mimic a natural gut hormone — glucagon-like peptide 1 — to suppress appetite and regulate metabolism. But reducing calories leads to an energy deficit, which the body often makes up for by burning muscle. The experimental drug that Cook received, called bimagrumab, seems to counteract this muscle loss.\n\nObesity drugs: huge study identifies new health risks\n\nIt’s one of more than 100 anti-obesity drug candidates that are in various stages of development. The next wave of medications, which are likely to hit pharmacy shelves in the next few years, resemble drugs that are already on the market. But close behind are numerous therapies being developed specifically for their muscle-sparing weight-loss potential. Dozens more are aimed at different biological pathways and could redefine obesity treatment in decades to come.\n\n“We’re working to create the next generation of healthy weight-loss solutions,” says Philip Larsen, who played a key part in the early development of GLP-1 drugs and is now chief executive of SixPeaks Bio, an obesity-focused start-up company in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe surge in anti-obesity drug development has been made possible by the blockbuster success of semaglutide and its rival drug tirzepatide — sold as Zepbound or Mounjaro. These drugs have unlocked the potential for a global market that is projected to surpass US$100 billion by the end of the decade.\n\nBut semaglutide and tirzepatide have limitations. They require weekly injections and frequently cause unpleasant side effects, with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea being particularly common. Long term, the loss of muscle mass and the likelihood of weight regain after stopping therapy are also issues. What’s more, the drugs don’t work sufficiently for an estimated 10–30% of people who take them.\n\nEmerging therapies aim to amplify weight loss, improve tolerability, ensure long-lasting effects and find options for a broader range of individuals (see ‘Next up in obesity drugs’). “We’re going to see that there are different medicines that work better for different groups of people,” says Louis Aronne, an obesity specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City who consults for drug makers.\n\nNext up in obesity drugs\n\nExpected dates of US approval for new types of weight-loss drugs heading to market.\n\nEstimated yearDrugCompanyDescription2026OrforglipronEli LillyAn oral, small-molecule drug that activates the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor.2026CagriSemaNovo NordiskAn injectable that activates the amylin and GLP-1 receptors.2027SurvodutideBoehringer IngelheimAn injectable that activates the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors.2027RetatrutideEli LillyAn injectable that activates GLP-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon receptors.2028 and beyondMariTideAmgenAn injectable that activates the GLP-1 receptor while blocking GIP signalling.2028 and beyondBimagrumabEli LillyAn injectable that blocks receptors involved in myostatin signalling.2028 and beyondMonlunabantNovo NordiskAn oral drug that inhibits the CB1 cannabinoid receptor.\nDiverse routes, same pursuit\n\nSemaglutide and tirzepatide are often lumped together under the umbrella of GLP-1 drugs, but they differ in one key regard: tirzepatide mimics not only GLP-1 but also a complementary hormone called gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). This hormone further revs up energy metabolism and affects how the body stores and burns nutrients. Tirzepatide’s dual action is thought to contribute to its superior weight-loss results.\n\nIn a large head-to-head trial, sponsored by tirzepatide’s maker Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, participants who took tirzepatide lost an average of 20% of their body weight, outpacing the 14% reduction achieved with semaglutide, which is produced by the pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk in Bagsværd, Denmark. “We believe there’s a homeostatic mechanism, like a thermostat, that we each have that is set to a certain body weight, and it’ll drive hunger until we achieve that,” says Dan Skovronsky, chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly. But, he says, drugs such as tirzepatide can override this natural mechanism.\n\nInspired by tirzepatide’s success, many companies are advancing other drugs that engage GLP-1 and GIP receptors. At least five tirzepatide-like therapies are progressing through clinical trials, with the first expected to hit the market by 2028. Patients and clinicians alike “need an array of options”, says Ron Renaud, chief executive of Kailera Therapeutics, a biotechnology start-up in Waltham, Massachusetts, which has a tirzepatide-like therapy in advanced-stage clinical testing.\n\nWhy do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments?\n\nIn addition to dual activators, such as tirzepatide, there are also drug candidates such as MariTide (produced by the biopharmaceutical company Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California) that instead block GIP signalling while still activating GLP-1. It might seem counterintuitive that both approaches could work. But Jonathan Campbell, a metabolism researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, explains metabolism in terms of a vehicle’s fuel consumption on the motorway: pushing the accelerator hard, as with GIP activation, burns energy inefficiently, depleting resources faster than they can be replenished. Conversely, driving without fully releasing the handbrake creates constant friction, much like blocking GIP, which introduces inefficiencies by forcing the system to work harder to maintain speed.\n\n“In terms of weight control, anything that makes you less efficient is going to be a positive,” says Campbell, who receives research funding from drug companies. But he cautions that the wider consequences of each strategy remain uncertain. Because GIP also plays a part in bone health, there are concerns that blocking GIP signalling could adversely affect bone health. There are also lingering questions about the long-term effects of drastic weight loss on the rest of the body, including on muscle, metabolic flexibility and organ health.\n\nAlthough drugs such as semaglutide and tirzepatide have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack and other cardiovascular problems, as well as alleviate sleep apnoea and improve liver function, they have also been tied to conditions such as arthritis and pancreatitis. The unknown risks, particularly in diverse populations and with prolonged use, lead some clinicians to favour established surgical solutions, such as bariatric surgery.\n\nBut uncertainty hasn’t dissuaded pharmaceutical companies from pursuing an expanding array of hormone targets. These include other gut-derived hormones such as peptide YY, which is known for its ability to make you feel full, and pancreas-released hormones such as glucagon and amylin, which could complement GLP-1–based therapies by boosting energy expenditure, stabilizing blood sugar levels and further suppressing appetite.\n\nWorking together\n\nMany strategies in development target multiple pathways simultaneously. The combination therapy CagriSema, for example, pairs a long-acting analogue of amylin with semaglutide. Participants in a 68-week, phase III trial lost an average of nearly 23% of their body weight with this approach, according to Novo Nordisk, the company behind the drug.\n\nIf ongoing trials are successful, CagriSema, along with agents that combine GLP-1 and glucagon activity, such as survodutide from the pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim in Ingelheim, Germany, could secure regulatory approval as early as 2026 or 2027. However, their impact might be eclipsed by yet another contender. In phase II testing, Eli Lilly’s retatrutide — dubbed ‘triple G’ for its ability to target GLP-1, GIP and glucagon receptors — delivered an average weight reduction of 24% after 48 weeks, setting a new benchmark for obesity treatments1 (see ‘Shedding weight’).\n\nSources: Weg.: J.

Activating multiple pathways could allow for lower doses that achieve the same weight loss with fewer side effects.\n\nCompanies are also exploring alternatives to once-a-week injections, which can be difficult to incorporate into people’s routines and come with manufacturing challenges. Once-monthly injectables are in the works, but GLP-1 pills — led by a drug called orforglipron produced by Eli Lilly — could arrive first, hitting the market as soon as next year. In a phase II, 36-week study, participants lost up to 15% of their body weight with the once-daily oral option2.\n\nLess familiar targets\n\nAlthough gut hormones continue to be the cornerstone of drug development for obesity, large-scale genetic sequencing has been one source of inspiration for emerging targets. In 2021, scientists at the biotech company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown, New York, led an analysis of DNA from nearly 650,000 individuals and uncovered a rare gene variant linked to low body weight3. The following year, researchers at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Massachusetts, led a study that pinpointed a mutation in a gene called INHBE. The mutation is associated with low waist-to-hip ratio, a measure that reflects a healthier fat distribution in the body4. Companies are now trying to develop drugs that replicate the metabolic benefits of these genetic variants.\n\nHow ‘miracle’ weight-loss drugs will change the world\n\nOld targets are also getting renewed attention. One example is the cannabinoid receptor CB1, originally pursued after researchers discovered its role in marijuana-induced appetite stimulation, commonly known as the munchies. In the late-2000s, a drug designed to counteract this effect was briefly sold in Europe as a weight-loss therapy. But inhibiting cannabinoid receptors in the brain was associated with an increased risk of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts in some people. The drug, known as rimonabant, was withdrawn from the market after less than three years, and rival companies abandoned similar candidates.\n\nBut George Kunos, a neuroendocrinologist at the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda, Maryland, never gave up on the cannabinoid-blocking strategy. Around 15 years ago, his team and others demonstrated in rodents that much of the anti-obesity effects of CB1 inhibitors came from metabolic pathways in the liver, muscle, pancreas and other organs outside the brain. If a drug such as rimonabant could be chemically modified to prevent it from crossing the blood–brain barrier, it might deliver metabolic benefits without the serious side effects.\n\nKunos’s laboratory created such a next-generation cannabinoid blocker, now known as monlunabant and being advanced by Novo Nordisk. Last year, phase II trial results indicated that monlunabant can still cause anxiety, irritability and sleep disturbances. Even so, Kunos predicts that drug makers will “arrive at a dose that causes significant weight reduction with acceptable levels of side effects”.\n\nBig flex",

Cross/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nScientists are bracing for major changes in the direction of US biomedical research as Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has promoted vaccine misinformation and public-health conspiracies, gains control over a vast swathe of science policy.\n\nThe Senate voted today to confirm Kennedy as President Donald Trump’s secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which has an annual budget of roughly US$1.7 trillion and includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. Kennedy has embraced some fields of biomedical research. But he has shown hostility to others, and has rejected established science on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the safety of vaccines in general and other topics. (Kennedy told the Senate that he supports vaccines and believes that they have saved lives.)\n\n“The future of America as a superpower in research appears grim,” says Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, who creates new models for studying HIV — which Kennedy has falsely suggested is not the cause of AIDS. “Even on issues he claims he supports, he does not follow scientific evidence. Picking a person like this to lead is like having the wolf guard the sheep.”\n\nFalse dichotomy\n\nDuring his own presidential campaign, Kennedy said that he would prioritize research on chronic diseases and would give infectious-disease research at the NIH “a break” for eight years. Speaking before a Senate committee in January, Kennedy asserted that chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, asthma and some cancers have historically received less attention than infectious diseases, but are mostly responsible for rising health-care costs. (Data from the NIH show that cancer alone receives more federal funding than that allotted to all infectious diseases combined.)\n\nUneven attention hampers the drive to control infectious diseases\n\nEven some researchers who could benefit from an emphasis on chronic disease are wary. Eric Lau, a cancer researcher at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, says that although it would certainly be nice to see more money poured into studying cancer, the federal government should focus on increasing funding for biomedical research in general.\n\nBoth he and Larry Schlesinger, a physician-scientist and chief executive of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio, say that the idea of cutting one field to benefit another creates a false dichotomy between chronic and infectious disease that isn’t rooted in scientific reality.\n\nAs an example of how tightly the two are linked, researchers cite increasing evidence that some chronic conditions stem from infectious diseases: infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), for instance, can cause cancer of the cervix and other tissues. “Prioritizing chronic conditions increasingly means prioritizing infectious diseases,” says Schlesinger, who was himself diagnosed with oral cancer after an infection with HPV decades before. “We are appreciating more and more that infections, and the inflammation they cause, play an important role in these chronic conditions.”\n\nScientists also say that the ongoing outbreak of bird flu, which has made at least 68 people in the United States ill since the start of 2024, makes this an especially bad time to cut research into infectious diseases.\n\nFocus on food\n\nAs part of his ‘Make America Healthy Again’ pledge, Kennedy has repeatedly called for further studies into diet and nutrition, as well as research on the links between environmental pollution and human health. During his January hearing, Kennedy said that scientists “know” that obesity is caused by “an environmental toxin”, and asked why researchers haven’t dedicated themselves to finding and eliminating it.\n\nFood systems: seven priorities to end hunger and protect the planet",

          "title": "Money and murder: the dark side of the Asilomar meeting on recombinant DNA",
          "authors": "Matthew Cobb",
          "abstract": "On 24 February 1975, some 150 people met at the Asilomar Conference Grounds near Monterey on the Californian coast. They were mostly scientists from the United States, together with representatives of various companies and government agencies, and 16 journalists. Their subject was the new technology of recombinant DNA — molecules created in a laboratory by stitching together genetic material from different organisms. Researchers were excited by the possibilities for discoveries, and the potential of the technique to produce drugs, for example using specially engineered bacteria to make insulin. But they were also terrified that they might inadvertently create diseases that could infect lab workers and the wider community.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, its participants had agreed to adopt biosafety protocols that are still in force in the United States, and which have hugely influenced similar regulations worldwide. The meeting has become known simply as Asilomar, a byword for how a scientific community came together to forge consensus on a thorny topic. It is often held up as an example of how science can self-regulate without the involvement of politicians (although some criticize it for just those same reasons). Periodic calls can be heard for ‘another Asilomar’ in other potentially hazardous fields such as synthetic biology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence.\n\nBut grasping the full significance of a historic event often involves understanding what was not discussed and highlighting the decisions that were not taken. Half a century on from Asilomar, that longer view provides a different perspective on two unspoken, yet essential, issues that loomed in the background of the meeting — the technology’s potential for creating riches and for destroying human life.\n\nAsilomar 1975: DNA modification secured\n\nDebates about the possible hazards of recombinant DNA first came to the fore in June 1971. Robert Pollack, a postdoctoral researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, New York, learnt from Janet Mertz, a PhD student on a course he was teaching, that her supervisor wanted her to transfer DNA from simian virus 40 (SV40) into the gut bacterium Escherichia coli. SV40 could cause uncontrolled growth in hamster cells, and it was feared it might cause cancer in humans.\n\nMertz’s supervisor was Paul Berg at Stanford University in California, a leading molecular biologist in his mid-40s. Pollack, more than ten years Berg’s junior, had never met him but was deeply alarmed at the idea, and so telephoned him the next day to ask why he was planning to do such a “crazy” experiment. The conversation did not last long; according to Pollack, Berg responded, “Who the bleep are you?”.\n\nBerg later recalled that he thought the concerns were “bunk” and “outrageous”. But this exchange and subsequent conversations with friends, colleagues and students kindled doubts in his mind. The experiment he had given to Mertz was not central to his research project, and faced with opposition and the slight possibility that the experiment might go awry, he abandoned this part of it.\n\nBerg’s creation of the first recombinant DNA the following year — inserting a DNA segment from E. coli into SV40 — did not cause outrage. Indeed, it helped him to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980. But the subsequent discovery1 of the powerful method of plasmid-based gene cloning by a team including Stanley Cohen at Stanford University and Herb Boyer at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), did lead to great alarm. By allowing researchers to move any piece of DNA into a bacterium where its function could be studied, this technique “made it possible for anybody to do anything”, as Berg put it later. When Boyer presented the technique at a conference in June 1973, participants raised their concerns with the meeting’s organizers, who published a letter2 in Science warning that the creation of “new kinds of hybrid plasmids or viruses, with biological activity of unpredictable nature … may prove hazardous to laboratory workers and to the public”.\n\nThe US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) tasked Berg with convening a working group to address these concerns. In July 1974, Berg, Boyer, Cohen and eight others — including James Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA — wrote an open letter3 calling on scientists to defer all such experiments “until the potential hazards of such recombinant DNA molecules have been better evaluated or until adequate methods are developed for preventing their spread”. They also announced a meeting to be held in early 1975 to discuss the matter. For perhaps the first time in history, scientists had publicly decided to stop doing an experiment until it was safe. This soon became known as a moratorium — a word adopted from opposition to atomic-weapons testing.\n\nThis was the backdrop to the Asilomar meeting, organized by Berg under the auspices of the NAS. Its main aim was to agree biosafety protocols that could be adopted by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a condition of funding, without fractious lawmakers getting involved. Researchers from Europe were culturally less hostile to the prospect of legislation. In many countries outside the United States, laws using protocols very similar to those adopted at Asilomar eventually governed recombinant DNA research.\n\nThe lure of lucre\n\nIn early 1975, Berg learnt to his horror that administrators at Stanford and UCSF had applied for a patent on the Cohen–Boyer cloning technique4. If all went well, both universities — as well as Cohen and Boyer — stood to become very rich. Berg was keen to see the moratorium lifted to enable research to continue. He disagreed with the Cohen–Boyer patent, but immediately understood that, were the patent application to become widely known, the Asilomar meeting would be fatally compromised. It would look as if the researchers wanted to lift the moratorium so that they could make money. Caught in a bind, Berg had no alternative but to press on in the hope that no one would leak the story.\n\nThis was more problematic than it might seem. There were curious reporters at Asilomar, including Michael Rogers, a writer for Rolling Stone, a US counter-cultural music magazine. In an article5 about the meeting, Rogers described the possibility of producing insulin in a recombinant microorganism, adding drily, “The prospect is sufficiently realistic that the conference includes representatives from the research arms of drug manufacturers Merck, Roche, G. D. Searle — and even General Electric.” However, despite the twitching of Rogers’ journalistic antennae, there was no revelation of the patent at Asilomar or in the immediate aftermath.\n\nChildren at a military barracks in Kineshma, Russia, simulate a biochemical attack in 1999.Credit: Oleg Nikishin/Hulton Archive/Getty\n\nThe Asilomar recommendations were accepted by the NIH in 1976. These involved increasingly strict biosafety measures with increasing levels of perceived hazard. They were later summarized by Gwladys Caspar, a biosafety officer at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as: level 1 — don’t eat it; level 2 — don’t touch it; level 3 — don’t breathe it; level 4 — don’t do it.\n\nAt the end of 1977, researchers working with a tiny start-up company co-founded by Boyer, named Genentech, produced a human growth hormone in a microbe6 and then repeated the trick with insulin7. Debate began to focus not on the morality of patenting processes that had been developed with public money, but instead on who was going to get rich. The US Patent Office eventually accepted the Stanford–UCSF application in early December 1980, following a landmark US Supreme Court ruling, Diamond v. Chakrabarty. Less than two weeks after the patent was finally granted, the Bayh–Dole Act was signed into law, which encouraged recipients of federal funding to take out patents on discoveries and to license them.\n\nThis all led to an explosion of venture-capital-funded biotechnology. The excitement soon infected Nature, which created the “Nature guide to bio-riches”, an index of US biotechnology stocks that was published in the journal each month. Taking Boyer and Cohen’s patent alone, during its lifetime (17 years in the United States, 20 in Europe) more than 2,000 products were developed using the technique, generating billions in sales. The total revenue was around $255 million; each university received $90 million, with Boyer and Cohen sharing the rest8.\n\nThe intrusion of vast potential wealth also had a profound effect on relations between scientists. Competition became even greater, with inevitable conflicts of interest (although as late as 1997, a Nature editorial9 dismissed such concerns). Scientists stopped speaking openly about their research, as Berg complained a few years later: “No longer do you have this free flow of ideas. You go to scientific meetings and people whisper to each other about their companies’ products. It’s like a secret society.” Had the underlying conflict of interest of some of those debating at Asilomar been revealed in 1975, the meeting’s decisions would surely have been the focus of greater political opposition.\n\nHidden menace\n\nAt the opening session of Asilomar, biologist David Baltimore at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, speaking for the organizing committee, ruled that there would be no discussion of the danger of recombinant DNA being used to create bioweapons, for example by introducing toxin genes into highly infectious bacteria. As he explained, although the issue of bioweapons was a very serious one “which many of us care about and have cared about for a long time”, the meeting was “not designed to deal with that question”, which was “peripheral” and might “confuse” the discussion.\n\nMany people felt that the menace of biological warfare had been hugely reduced by the 1972 United Nations Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). This entered into force a month after Asilomar, following ratification by the Soviet Union, the United States and 20 other countries. The BWC was partly prompted by then US president Richard Nixon’s unexpected and unilateral cancellation in 1969 of the US biological warfare programme, which used natural microbial pathogens and had been developed during the Second World War. All US bioweapon stockpiles were declared destroyed.\n\nHowever, the microbiologist and anti-bioweapons campaigner Richard Novick, together with colleagues working on plasmids, wanted the final Asilomar declaration to include a clear statement on the threat of recombinant DNA bioweapons10. The hectic last session of the conference saw Berg and Baltimore invoking the right of academic enquiry as they rejected any declaration that some dangerous experiments should never be carried out. Berg’s compromise formulation, adopted by the meeting — “there is a class of experiments that should not be done at all irrespective of the type of containment available today” — left it open whether such experiments would be permissible in the future.\n\nThe February 1975 meeting at the Asilomar resort in California lifted a moratorium on a controversial strand of DNA research.Credit: John D. Ivanko/Alamy\n\nUnknown to almost everyone at Asilomar, exactly this kind of work was being proposed in the Soviet Union. In April 1974, the federation had launched a top-secret biological-warfare programme, overseen by an agency called Biopreparat, that would use recombinant DNA alongside existing bioweapons such as anthrax and plague11. The Soviet delegation to Asilomar included three men who were deeply involved with Biopreparat: at the time of its launch, Alexander Baev and Andrej Mirzabekov were members of the military–scientific body that oversaw the recombinant DNA bioweapons project, and Vladimir Engelhardt, who at 80 years old was the senior Soviet delegate, was director of the Moscow-based Institute of Molecular Biology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, one of the main contractors for this research.\n\nThese cultured and knowledgeable men had excellent scientific reputations and were close friends of many Western molecular biologists. Their involvement in the bioweapons project was a consequence of the terrible situation in Soviet genetics. From the 1930s to the mid-1950s, the Soviet regime had been virulently hostile to genetics, driven by the ideas and ambition of the agronomist Trofim Lysenko, a favourite of the country’s then-leader Josef Stalin. Even though Lysenko’s influence eventually waned in the 1960s, Soviet genetics was in a parlous state. This led Soviet molecular biologists to agree to create bioweapons in return for a huge increase in funding.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to have been the slightest suspicion among the Western scientists that anything might be amiss. Looking back, the age and behaviour of the Soviet delegation at Asilomar seemed almost designed to deflect attention. According to the Rolling Stone article, one US microbiologist chuckled: “These Russians, they just send over the old guys from the [Soviet Academy of Sciences] who don’t know anything. You ask them something and they hedge around — and it’s not that they’re hiding things … they just don’t know in the first place”. Delegates were further amused when one of the Soviets used a camera fitted with a flashbulb to take photographs of slides that were being presented (all that would have appeared on the film would be a white screen). Convinced that the Soviets were harmless, the chortling Americans paid them no further attention, although one of the conference organizers, Maxine Singer, later officially noted their support and cooperation.\n\nApart from Rogers, the journalists were equally incurious. He found the Soviet presence “somewhat puzzling”, and asked one of the delegates whether the Soviet Union viewed molecular biology as militarily significant (there was no direct answer). Rogers also noted that the delegation was accompanied by “a charming, dapper, San Francisco vice-consul, performing chaperon service”. You do not need to be a spy novelist to realize this man’s real role — the Soviet Union’s consulate in San Francisco was the notorious centre of a huge spy operation (and was closed down by the US government in 2017). It seems unlikely that Western security agencies blithely allowed their scientists to discuss the future of genetic engineering, with its evident potential for bioweapons development, and in the presence of Soviet scientists, without any supervision or surveillance. What form that might have taken is unknown.\n\nBiological arms race\n\nWhether or not the Soviet delegation learnt anything at Asilomar that was of direct relevance to the Biopreparat programme, the conference and its decisions did provide civilian cover for the huge expansion of biotechnology in the Soviet Union. On 20 February 1977, the Los Angeles Times suggested Soviet interest in this area could be used to develop bioweapons, but Baev insisted that any use of recombinant DNA in biological warfare would breach both the BWC and “the moral code of science”. The US Defense Intelligence Agency was similarly sanguine (or unimaginative), reporting in 1976 that the sudden increase in Soviet genetic-engineering capacity was simply a response to “embarrassment” at the US lead in the field.",

          "title": "Here’s how to bag a hefty research prize to turbocharge innovation",
          "authors": "Rachel Brazil",
          "abstract": "Could you double the lifespan of a mouse, decipher passages in scrolls destroyed nearly 2,000 years ago or, in less than 30 minutes, detect bacteria that cause urinary-tract infections? If so, you would have been eligible to win one of a barrage of ‘challenge prizes’ — the above examples alone provide rewards of more than £12 million (US$15 million). Such prizes have seen a resurgence in the past decade, in the hope that a hefty reward can turbocharge innovation and solve some of society’s stickiest problems.\n\nThe concept of a challenge prize is not new. One of the most famous examples is the 1714 Longitude prize, offered by the UK Parliament to find a method for determining longitude at sea. More than 50 years later, clockmaker John Harrison won it with a marine chronometer that was able to accurately keep time on a rough sea journey.\n\nThe winning solution “changed the world”, says Tris Dyson, managing director of Challenge Works, the London-based non-profit organization that runs challenge prizes across the globe. In 2014, 300 years after the original, Challenge Works launched its own Longitude prize to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Dyson says that running a successful innovation prize takes a lot more than simply dangling a pot of money, and Challenge Works now provides support ranging from funding grants to community-building events.\n\nThe current interest in such prizes came out of concerns that the pace of innovation was slowing, and with public finances becoming more constrained, prizes could offer a cheaper way to stimulate new ideas.\n\nPrizes can de-risk innovation spending, and this is one attraction of the American-Made programme, launched in 2018 by the US Department of Energy to advance technologies to support clean energy. The programme has administered more than 100 prizes, including the annual flagship Solar prize, and has allocated $400 million in prize money. “We reward people for the work that they already do,” says programme manager Debbie Brodt-Giles. “To the government, it’s very low-risk.” The programme also diversifies who is funded by providing a low barrier to entry. “It could be an innovator working out of their garage, or a large-scale company.”\n\nFor researchers, it’s a chance to apply their knowledge to real-world challenges and move in a direction that conventional research funding often doesn’t allow. Even for unsuccessful applicants, participation can lead to a start-up venture, an advance in a research goal or a renewed enthusiasm for innovation.\n\nDyson describes the modern Longitude prize as Challenge Works’ most audacious and high-risk venture. “We didn’t know if we were going to get a winner,” he says.\n\nEncouraging innovators in stages\n\nA partnership with the UK government, the prize featured a public vote on the BBC to select the topic. AMR won, and the £8-million contest was designed around creating an affordable, accurate, rapid and easy-to-use diagnostic test for bacterial urinary-tract infections (UTIs).\n\nMicrobiologist Emma Hayhurst took up the challenge. Then at the University of Cardiff, UK, she is now chief executive of Llusern Scientific in Cardiff, a company she co-founded to commercialize the technology she and her collaborators developed. “I can absolutely 100% say that without the Longitude prize, that wouldn’t have got off the ground,” she says. In 2016, she had just returned to science after maternity leave and was looking to kick-start her research by focusing on AMR. She used skills she had already developed in replicating DNA and RNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a single-test-tube molecular technique that can amplify nucleic acids without having to cycle temperatures. Eventually, she created Lodestar DX, a device that uses LAMP to identify six common UTI-causing pathogens in 35 minutes (J. Diggle et al. JCR-Antimicrob. 6, dlae148; 2024).\n\nThe SunFlex team won $650,000 from the American-Made programme for its solar modules.Credit: Sunflex Solar\n\nAn important aspect of the competition, Hayhurst says, was the clear requirement that the winning solution should be user-friendly and inexpensive, two of eight mandatory criteria. “It made us focus very early on,” she says, and provided concrete goals.\n\nBut having a clear brief and offering a seven-figure reward is often not enough to stimulate innovation, says Anton Howes, head of innovation research at The Entrepreneurs Network, a London-based think tank. People think of the Longitude prize “as a big sum of money that was put up for solving this big problem, and then people came forth with their solutions”, he says. “That’s not really how it works.” The 1714 prize, he points out, awarded small sums along the way to develop promising ideas. Harrison, for example, received £250 in 1737 to improve his sea clock.\n\nThe AMR Longitude prize also provided partial funding. “They gave us £16,000, enough to employ a research assistant for 6 months,” says Hayhurst. Unlike a conventional grant, the funding was not dependent on having a proven track record in the field. “Anyone from anywhere can apply, as long as the idea is good,” she says. Her team also sourced small amounts of money from the University of Cardiff and the Welsh government, crucial to help produce a prototype.\n\nThe American-Made prizes also provide some funding to help lower the barriers to entry, and the programme employs ‘power connectors’ — people who help with outreach and the recruitment of innovators beyond the organization’s typical networks.\n\nHolly Jamieson, executive director of Challenge Works, says that many of its prizes now include more competition stages: the organization funds an initial cohort that is whittled down, with increased funding at each stage. Challenge Works used this model for its second Longitude prize, launched in 2022, which offered £4.4 million to create technology to help people with dementia live independently. In 2023, 24 semi-finalists each got £80,000 to produce a prototype, with five finalists then getting £300,000 each to develop innovations such as smart glasses to aid memory and a remote safety-monitoring system. The winner, to be announced next year, will get £1 million. Similarly, the American-Made Solar prize awards 20 first-stage competitors $50,000, ”enough to keep them energized and working towards that next goal”, says Brodt-Giles, with $100,000 for ten finalists and then two final $500,000 prizes. The competition also awards vouchers that grant access to US national lab facilities to help accelerate innovations.\n\nThe 2022 winner, Origami Solar, based in Bend, Oregon, produces steel frames that house solar panels and that use less materials than existing set-ups, drastically lowering the carbon footprint of installation. The company received $150,000 in vouchers which it used at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to investigate whether the frames could be used in any climate. “Solar can provide energy in even extreme climates, but you have to have panels able to handle snow loads,” says founder Eric Hafter. “With Sandia, we’ve been doing extensive snow-load testing.”\n\nHafter says the competition has been central to their success. “That level of validation was like going from a stationary concrete diving board to a springboard, something that really gave us so much more momentum.”\n\nRunner-up rewards\n\nEnvironmental systems modeller John Gallagher, at Trinity College Dublin, vied for one of the first European Commission Horizon prizes. The 2018 award was €3 million (US$3.1 million) for ways to reduce the concentration of particulates in urban areas. He had been working for several years with a colleague to provide a pre-filtration process for mechanical ventilation systems in urban buildings, to remove particulates from the air.\n\nGallagher received funding to move his ideas forwards, and says that compared with other European funding, the prize “didn’t have the same level of reporting required around it, which was fantastic”. His team’s prototype reduced the energy consumption of ventilation systems by one-third and was one of only two to progress to the final stage, but the prize ultimately went to a large multinational company. “We went to the ceremony and sat beside the winner and clapped for the winner, and they received €3 million as a company, and we received zero,” he remembers. “I think that was the hardest part”, because both teams’ work contained innovations. Hayhurst also missed out on the Longitude prize but feels her team came close. “I’d love it if there were second and third prizes, not just all to one winner, because I feel that we could have done an awful lot with even some of that money.”\n\nInnovator and entrepreneur Emma Hayhurst.Credit: Llusern Scientific\n\nUnlike Hayhurst’s, Gallagher’s innovation ultimately stalled for lack of more-substantial funding. Undeterred, he is now competing in Science Foundation Ireland’s Sustainable Communities Challenge. His team’s entry is a phone app that helps rural communities to manage water scarcity, contamination and infrastructure issues, using real-time monitoring and artificial intelligence for better decision-making. It is one of 12 projects to make the penultimate round, each of which was awarded €250,000.\n\nEven if he doesn’t win this time, Gallagher says that taking part in these competitions has made him keener to explore the commercial opportunities that arise from his research. “It can accelerate real-world impact” more so than continuing at the pace of basic research, he adds.\n\nIn the end, the 2024 AMR Longitude prize was awarded to diagnostic company Sysmex Astrego, based in Uppsala, Sweden. Its PA-100 AST point-of-care test captures bacterial cells directly from urine samples using a microfluidic chip, and monitors their growth rates when exposed to nine antibiotics (Ö. Baltekin et al. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 114, 9170–9175; 2017), to indicate which drug should work best against a UTI.\n\nOriginally called Astrego, the firm was acquired by a Japanese company called Sysmex in 2022, which helped it to grow. But being part of the competition provided the company with both external validation and inspiration for its technology. “It gives some legitimacy to what we’re doing, that this is something that is needed,” says chief executive Mikael Olsson. “It has motivated a lot of people within the team.”\n\nContests that spur collaboration\n\nDo challenge prizes elevate competition above cooperation? They are competitive, especially in the later stages, agrees Dyson, but earlier on, “can actually be quite collaborative”. Jamieson adds that there are cases of teams combining during Challenge Works competitions.\n\nThe Vesuvius Challenge successfully blended competition and cooperation in its contest to use machine learning and computer vision to read the Herculaneum scrolls that were buried and carbonized by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in ad 79. “For me, this is the gold standard” of how a challenge prize should be run, says Howes.",

          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Psychologist Laura Steenbergen speaking at a TEDx event.Credit: TEDx\n\nLaura Steenbergen met her scientific mentor as an undergraduate. In 2009, she began a bachelor’s degree in psychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands and did her undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Lorenza Colzato, a cognitive psychologist with a prolific academic output. Steenbergen soon realized she enjoyed research, and with Colzato’s help, she transitioned into a master’s degree, then a PhD. They made a good team, Steenbergen thought.\n\nSteenbergen says she found it hard at first as a student with hardly any research experience to know whether Colzato’s research practices were unusual. Steenbergen had always appreciated that her mentor worked efficiently. Sometimes, for example, according to Steenbergen, Colzato would say that she had obtained ethics approval from the university for studies involving research participants after just one or two weeks. And once Steenbergen started talking to participants herself to collect data, she noticed that Colzato would report the findings in their papers for substantially fewer people than had actually participated in a research project, without specifying why some people’s results were omitted from the data analysis.\n\nAccording to Steenbergen, Colzato dismissed her concerns and would instead question whether science was an appropriate choice for the PhD student — a painful thing for Steenbergen to hear because she knew she wanted a scientific career.\n\nWhistleblowing in science: this physician faced ostracization after standing up to pharma\n\nEventually, after speaking to another PhD student and a postdoctoral researcher in Colzato’s laboratory, Steenbergen realized that her concerns weren’t all in her head. It wasn’t clear what the junior researchers could do about it, however. The Cognitive Psychology Unit within the Institute of Psychology where they worked was headed by Colzato’s husband, Bernhard Hommel. Because of this, they felt that they had limited recourse to other colleagues, Steenbergen says.\n\nSteenbergen continued to work with Colzato, starting a one-year postdoc position in 2016. She explains that, because she completed her PhD in only two years, she had no time to consider jobs elsewhere.\n\nAfter that, she worked briefly at other universities, including the University of Amsterdam and Ohio State University in Columbus, exposing her to other workplaces and making her realize that Colzato’s research practices were unusual.\n\nData doubt\n\nIn 2018, she returned to Leiden University as an assistant professor. It was at that point that new students working with Colzato asked Steenbergen why data were being deleted, she says.\n\nThis prompted her and a former colleague to report their concerns about research integrity to Sander Nieuwenhuis, the head of the Cognitive Psychology Unit (by this stage, Hommel had moved on from that position). In 2019, Philip Spinhoven, scientific director of the Institute of Psychology, submitted an internal complaint regarding Colzato and a suspected violation of academic integrity, based on what he had been told.\n\nThe university’s Academic Integrity Committee conducted an investigation, considering four allegations in total. In its 27-page ruling in 2019 (in which names are redacted), it stated: “The Defendant has repeatedly selectively omitted research results and has not reported this or given reasons for it. She has thus violated academic integrity.”\n\nThe committee also acknowledged that the group’s young, less experienced researchers were not responsible for the violations.\n\nCollection: Career resources for PhD students\n\nColzato was suspended by the university in 2019 and then resigned. In 2020, a journal article co-authored by her and Steenbergen was retracted1, followed by a second in 20212. Data manipulation was given as the reason in each case. The retractions were a relief to Steenbergen, although she still struggled with anxiety over her decision to report the problems, saying: “It feels like I filed a process against my scientific mother.”\n\nIn Colzato’s response to a 2019 Retraction Watch article about the outcome of the misconduct hearing, she described herself as a scapegoat, and maintained that she had experienced “wonderful” working relationships with Steenbergen and the colleagues who had raised the concerns.\n\nShe admitted obtaining blood from human participants when approval had not been granted by Leiden University’s Medical Ethics Review Committee, but in the Retraction Watch article points out that Steenbergen carried out the procedures.\n\nSteenbergen says that power dynamics were in play around the blood collection, and that “being a PhD student, it feels like you have to do that”.\n\nTaking action\n\nSteenbergen says the case has exacted a personal toll. During the investigation, when all the publications she had co-authored with Colzato came under scrutiny, “I felt frozen in science, because who’s going to take you seriously if everything about your work is suspicious? So I needed things to be open.”\n\nOn returning to work after a period of absence in 2023 and seeing that her PhD dissertation had recently been downloaded by others, she wanted to take action but wasn’t sure how to proceed. There are examples of authors choosing to retract their own papers and of dissertations being retracted against the authors’ wishes. But Steenbergen says she had no model for acknowledging the issues in her own dissertation.\n\nOn talking to other faculty members, she proposed to print “retracted” over the two chapters of her nine-chapter dissertation that had been affected by Colzato’s misconduct, and to write a cover note for the document. “I didn’t want to erase it or change it,” Steenbergen explains. She remembers thinking, “It’s more constructive if I use it.”\n\nSteenbergen says the university was supportive. In October 2024, two months after she made her proposal, the dissertation was corrected with retractions for two chapters and an expression of concern for another chapter on which a journal publication was based.\n\n“This is unprecedented in my experience,” says Dorothy Bishop, a retired developmental neuropsychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who writes about scientific integrity. “It looks like Steenbergen did the right thing, which can’t have been easy for her.”\n\nBishop says that this case illustrates the potentially catastrophic effect of a principal investigator’s research misconduct on an early-career researcher in their lab, adding: “Many leave the field,” which is especially likely when universities do not back whistleblowers.",

The meeting, scheduled for 3 March, comes after more than 1,300 scientists signed an open letter expressing “deep concerns” about the conduct of billionaire Musk, who is a fellow.\n\nMusk is working closely with US President Donald Trump on sweeping government reforms that threaten flagship US research programmes and are causing havoc for scientists in the United States and globally. He is also accused of spreading misinformation on the social-media site X, which he owns.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nTwo Royal Society fellows have resigned over the institution’s perceived lack of action over Musk’s behaviour in recent months.\n\n“It is tarnishing their reputation and to some degree devalues the honour of awarding fellowships. Does one want to be associated to a society that does not stand up for its values?” says Stephen Curry, a retired structural biologist at Imperial College London, who wrote the letter and published it on his blog on 11 February.\n\nA spokesperson for the Royal Society says that issues raised about individual fellows are dealt with in confidence and in accordance with its code-of-conduct processes. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPrestigious appointment\n\nMusk became a fellow of the society — the world’s oldest science academy — in 2018 for his companies’ development of technologies such as space rockets, electric cars and brain implants. The society has about 1,800 living fellows and foreign members, and being elected is considered one of the most prestigious appointments in UK science. Scientists are nominated for making a “substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge”, and selected through a rigorous competitive process.\n\nTrump appointed Musk, the world’s richest man, to lead an advisory group called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that is tasked with finding cuts to government spending and reducing regulation. So far, the administration has attempted to freeze federal research grants and slash funding by the US National Institutes of Health.\n\nCurry’s letter describes “an assault on scientific research”. “It has sought to impose huge cuts in funding and a regime of censorship (particularly with regard to [equity, diversity and inclusion] and climate issues) that is a direct threat to freedom of expression and academic freedom.” These actions contravene the society’s code of conduct for fellows, he says.\n\n‘High anxiety moment’: Biden’s NIH chief talks Trump 2.0 and the future of US science\n\nResearchers worldwide have signed the letter, which calls for the society to stand up for the scientific community and “the values it claims to believe in”.\n\nNature understands that the society has scheduled a meeting of fellows next month to “discuss public pronouncements and behaviours of other fellows”.\n\nIt has been more than 150 years since a fellow has been expelled from the society, according to the spokesperson.",

          "authors": "Michael Eisenstein",
          "abstract": "When Patrick Yizhi Cai reflects on the state of synthetic genomics, he recalls the Big DNA Contest. Launched in 2004, the competition challenged synthetic biologists to design a novel, functional 40,000-base-pair DNA sequence that the contest sponsor, US DNA-synthesis firm Blue Heron Biotech (now Eurofins Genomics Blue Heron) would manufacture for free.\n\nIt was no small prize: at the time, producing this modest slab of DNA — less than 1% the length of the Escherichia coli genome — would have cost roughly US$250,000. The company’s aim was to energize the then-nascent field of synthetic biology. “In the end, zero applications were received,” says Cai, a synthetic biologist at the University of Manchester, UK. “That just tells you that even if you could make synthetic DNA for free, nobody really had enough imagination 20 years ago.”\n\nEngineered yeast breaks new record: a genome with over 50% synthetic DNA\n\nToday, steady progress in genomics and computational biology — not to mention DNA synthesis and assembly — have yielded multiple examples of what an ambitious, imaginative genome-writing effort can achieve. The synthetic bacterial strain JCVI-syn3A, developed at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in La Jolla, California, is a streamlined version of Mycoplasma mycoides that survives and replicates despite having had several hundred non-essential genes stripped away1. Various groups are engineering E. coli strains in which the genetic code has been altered to enable production of proteins containing amino acids beyond the 20 typically observed in nature. And last year, the multinational Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0) completed construction of heavily engineered versions of every chromosome in the eukaryotic budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae — comprising some 12 million base pairs in all.\n\nThese efforts have been invaluable learning experiences, says Akos Nyerges, a synthetic-genomics researcher involved with the E. coli rewriting effort in George Church’s lab at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. “You can mimic and test evolutionary steps which otherwise would have taken billions of years to evolve — or wouldn’t have evolved ever,” he says. But they have also laid bare how much we still don’t understand about the fundamental language of the genome. Every genome-rewriting program so far has grappled with substantial and unexpected challenges, and the era of made-to-order genomes remains out of reach. When it comes to heavily modified genomes, says Nyerges, “we underestimated how complex biology is”.\n\nBack to basics\n\nMost synthetic-genome projects are ‘top-down’ efforts that take a naturally occurring organism and pare away or redesign its DNA. That provides a valuable initial framework relative to ‘bottom-up’ approaches, in which the goal is to build a working genome from scratch. After all, explains Farren Isaacs, a genome engineer at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, when it comes to tinkering with genomes, the margin for error is surprisingly slim. “If you create an error in an essential gene, you’re going to wipe the organism out.”\n\nA key goal of the JCVI and Sc2.0 projects was to determine which genes are truly essential — a characteristic that is surprisingly hard to predict. John Glass, leader of the JCVI’s synthetic-biology programme, says that when he and his team published2 their 2016 report on their first minimal cell, nearly one-third of the cell’s remaining genes (149 of 473) had no known function. “I’d say it’s 78 now,” he adds.\n\nTo determine which genes were necessary, both projects used random mutagenesis — basically, introducing untargeted perturbations throughout the genome and asking which ones the cells could tolerate and which ones severely undermined cellular viability.\n\nHow to build a genome\n\nBut essentiality is a slippery concept, particularly given that most genomes contain redundancies and ‘fail-safe’ mechanisms to minimize the impact of individual mutations. Glass and his colleagues encountered dozens of instances in which mutagenesis revealed pairs of seemingly dissimilar genes that unexpectedly performed overlapping functions. As a result, there is no single minimal genome, he explains. “You take away one [gene], and with each choice, you’re going down a different road to a slightly different minimal cell.” Furthermore, many bacterial genes have multiple jobs, making it difficult to recognize which is the essential function. Glass cites the example of enolase, an enzyme with a well-known role in carbohydrate metabolism that also, it turns out, helps to degrade unwanted RNA.\n\nIncreasingly sophisticated computational ‘whole-cell models’ could help to remove some of the guesswork from future genome-trimming efforts. In 2020, mathematician Lucia Marucci and synthetic biologist Claire Grierson, both at the University of Bristol, UK, led an effort to simulate genome-reduction strategies in a whole-cell model of Mycoplasma genitalium — a close relative of the microorganism edited by the JCVI3. Their analysis, which used elaborate models of cellular processes and their interactions, suggested two redesigns with distinct sets of genes deleted, each yielding genomes that were roughly 40% smaller than the natural M. genitalium genome.\n\nMore recently, Marucci and Grierson have begun working with sophisticated whole-cell models of E. coli. As described in a 2024 preprint4, their current efforts combine mechanistic models with machine learning to predict the consequences of genome manipulation across a broad range of biological functions. These are described by thousands of interlinked equations, yielding blueprints for bacteria that have 40% fewer genes than wild-type E. coli. “We now have a bunch of minimized reduced genomes that we want to test in the laboratory,” Marucci says.\n\nFind and replace\n\nRather than making abridged editions of the genome, other groups have set out to subtly reword the genetic text — encountering an entirely different set of challenges.\n\nSynthetic yeast genome reveals its versatility\n\nProtein-coding sequences are built of nucleotide triplets known as codons. With 61 possible codons for the 20 naturally occurring amino acids as well as 3 ‘stop’ codons that terminate protein synthesis, there is considerable redundancy in the resulting code. Various teams have shown that, by comprehensively converting each instance of a given codon to one of its ‘synonyms’, one can repurpose that codon. This month, for example, Isaacs and his colleagues described an E. coli strain called Ochre in which two stop codons were reassigned to direct the incorporation of the non-natural amino acids para-acetyl-l-phenylalanine and Nε-Boc-l-lysine5. These amino acids have chemical properties and functions that don’t exist in nature, but recoding can also serve as a ‘firewall’ that prevents the interaction and exchange of genetic material with other organisms in natural environments.\n\nSuch work might sound straightforward — simply substituting one codon for another — but genome recoding requires much planning and effort. After researchers have found all instances of the codon they wish to eliminate, they must then work out how to replace it without disrupting the affected genes or regulatory machinery. Bacterial genes often contain regulatory sequences in the protein-coding sequence, Nyerges points out, and a gene on one DNA strand can overlap with a gene on the opposite strand. Seemingly minor changes can thus have major, unexpected consequences.\n\nNyerges, Church and their colleagues are grappling with this challenge at an unprecedented scale as they finalize a heavily recoded variant of E. coli that uses only 57 of the 61 naturally occurring amino-acid codons6. This effort has entailed more than 73,000 changes to the strain’s 4-megabase genome, which inevitably creates unintended effects. “Some things will happen readily with no impact on growth or fitness, while others have a striking impact,” says Nyerges. Some changes disabled existing regulatory elements or unwittingly created new one; others established new protein-coding sequences. “And we’re only learning about this as we go.”\n\nComputer-generated models of the synthetic minimal cell created by researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, California.Credit: Laboratory of Zaida Luthey-Schulten\n\nSorting out these issues is a substantial undertaking in its own right. For example, throughout the recoding process for their Ochre strain, Isaacs and his team used extensive ‘multi-omic’ analyses to characterize the bacterium. “We collected metabolic profiling data under different [culture] conditions,” he says. “We also collected proteomics data comparing the recoded cell to a few different progenitors, including wild-type cells.” In this way, they systematically tweaked the genome until the cells were able to grow under standard culture conditions at roughly the same rate as unmodified bacteria — a non-trivial result, given that genome recoding often impairs growth. Nyerges and his colleagues likewise turned to multi-omics to troubleshoot their 57-codon genome. They also used an experimental strategy that spurs rapid evolution of bacteria in culture, to promote the selection of genome mutations that improve fitness.\n\nAlgorithmic tools are also helping researchers to model and predict the outcomes of some genome-rewriting experiments in advance. For instance, synthetic biologist Howard Salis’s team at Pennsylvania State University in University Park uses quantitative data from high-throughput screens of both genetically modified cells and strands of synthetic DNA to develop algorithms that can define, characterize and even design sequences that govern processes such as transcription and translation. “A typical paper for us nowadays is anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 different defined, designed experiments,” says Salis. The results are used to extract testable physical principles that allow the algorithms to predict, for example, how changes to a gene’s promoter sequence alter downstream expression.\n\n“You can ground-truth everything,” says Salis. “And we can combine our existing models to design the next experiments to understand the remaining misunderstood stuff.” Indeed, the Church lab has used several of Salis’s tools to design its 57-codon microbe. Nyerges says such algorithms have been a substantial asset — albeit not enough to prevent considerable troubleshooting. “Even very tiny changes can cumulatively lead to significant fitness problems once you add up thousands of genes in a genome,” he says.\n\nBrewing progress in eukaryotes",

From Australia and Japan to Brazil and the United Kingdom, there are concerns that high living costs, low stipends and limited job options after graduation are deterring people from pursuing doctoral degrees.\n\nThese declining numbers should “act as a wake-up call” for those countries, says Cláudia Sarrico, a project lead at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris. “This is a signal you need to reform working conditions and think about diversifying career options — otherwise, you risk a talent drain that will ultimately slow down scientific progress.”\n\nThe most recent figures on this trend, released by Universities Australia and the Australian Council of Graduate Research (ACGR) in January, revealed an 8% reduction in the number of domestic PhD enrolments in Australia from 2018 to 2023, although the population of the country grew by more than 7% over the same period.\n\nPhD poverty\n\nIn many countries, one of the biggest factors deterring students from pursuing doctoral degrees is the high cost of living relative to how much they get paid.\n\nIn Australia, the average PhD stipend is roughly Aus$32,000 (US$20,000). “It is well under the minimum wage,” says Louise Sharpe, president of the ACGR, based in Melbourne, Australia. And although it is just above the poverty line for people who are single, the average doctoral student in the country is in their late thirties — often having come with experience working in different sectors — and have families and other responsibilities, Sharpe adds.\n\nFinancial insecurity is also one of the chief concerns for doctoral students in Japan, where the number of PhD students has been dropping since the early 2000s. In 2023, the number of domestic PhD enrolments was 15,014, compared with a high of 18,232 in 2003. In response to this issue, Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), announced plans last year to provide extra funding for doctoral students.\n\nPeople have also been losing an interest in postgraduate education on the other side of the ocean. Last year, the Brazilian Federal Agency for the Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES) released a report revealing that, in 2022, the country saw its lowest number of domestic PhD entrants in almost a decade. One factor was the COVID-19 pandemic, but that was not the only reason for the drop, says CAPES president Denise Pires de Carvalho, headquartered in Brasilia. The economic crisis in Brazil, along with the government’s unwillingness to increase funding for science and technology were also major contributors, Pires de Carvalho says.\n\nThings are beginning to shift. In 2023, the Brazilian government increased the value of grants for master’s and doctoral students by 40% — the first increase in a decade. This change brought with it a slight increase in enrolments in that same year.\n\nIn Canada, where PhD numbers haven’t yet dropped, a need for more funding to provide a living wage for doctoral students has been a big discussion over the past few years, says Adam Sarty, president-elect of the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies, who is based in Halifax. Last year, the Canadian government responded to this need by increasing graduate-student scholarships for the first time in more than two decades. This has been a welcome change, but Sarty notes that these grants only go to the top students — and extra changes are needed to provide more financial security to those who don’t win these scholarships.\n\nBut many Canadian universities are under financial strain because of a dip in enrolments in professional graduate programmes, such as MBAs, owing to a cap on international students that was put into place in 2024. Countries such as the United Kingdom have seen similar rules put in place in recent years — raising concerns about universities’ abilities to support early-career researchers.\n\nJob precarity",

Standard treatments had been unable to hold the cancer back. It had spread to her bones, and the prognosis was poor.\n\nThe race to supercharge cancer-fighting T cells\n\nNineteen years later, she is cancer-free and the mother of two children. The remarkable success story, published on 17 February in Nature Medicine1, is the longest reported cancer remission following treatment with engineered immune cells called CAR T cells.\n\nIn the years since the girl’s treatment in 2006, CAR T cells have produced stunning results in some blood cancers such as leukaemia. Seven CAR-T-cell therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration since 2017, and some early recipients of CAR-T therapy have been cancer-free for more than a decade.\n\nBut researchers have struggled to repeat that success against solid tumours such as those caused by neuroblastoma, a nerve-cell cancer that is typically diagnosed in young children. That makes the latest results particularly good news, says Sneha Ramakrishna, a paediatric oncologist and cancer researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“This provides me with a lot of hope,” she says. “We’re going to unlock CAR T cells for people with solid tumours.”\n\nCell target\n\nCAR T cells are immune cells that have been engineered to make a protein called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). This protein is designed to latch onto a target found on a cancer cell, triggering the immune cell to attack and destroy it.\n\nWhy are so many young people getting cancer? What the data say\n\nWhen the Texas neuroblastoma study began in 2004, CAR-T-cell therapy was still a bit of a wild idea, says Helen Heslop, an immunotherapy researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and a member of the team that ran the trial. “This is some kind of weird synthetic biology,” she remembers thinking. “Will it actually work?”\n\nThe CAR-T-cell therapies Heslop and her colleagues tested then are now considered first-generation editions of the molecules. Later versions, including those that are now approved medicines, contain extra modifications to bolster their power. Heslop calls her first CAR-T-cell study “a vintage trial”.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "NASA’s diverse astronaut corps was an example of the agency’s support for diversity and inclusion.Credit: James Blair/NASA/JSC\n\nIn the corridors of NASA buildings across the United States, Pride flags and pictures celebrating women in science are being taken down. Scientists are adding space-mission stickers to their laptops to cover ones that displayed rainbows and other symbols of LGBT+ support. Employees are stripping pronouns from their e-mail signatures and holding darkly humorous conversations in which they try to avoid saying any pronouns at all.\n\nThese and other changes are rippling through NASA, which is purging programmes involving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) throughout the agency. The directive to do so came from US President Donald Trump, who on 20 January issued an order to eliminate DEI initiatives across the federal government.\n\n“I get a sinking feeling in my stomach when I have to check my [work] e-mail,” says an early-career NASA scientist, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns about their career prospects. “Every time I reload it, it’s like, ‘oh god, will there be some new heinous missive in there?’”\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nNature spoke to scientists inside and outside NASA about the impacts of its DEI changes — and heard anger, fear and confusion. Although the orders affect all federal agencies, they are keenly felt at NASA, which has a long history of working towards inclusivity. In 2020, Trump appointee Jim Bridenstine, then head of NASA, added inclusion to the agency’s list of core values, joining safety, integrity, teamwork and excellence. That fifth value has now been removed from many NASA websites.\n\n“How do you go from something being so important that it’s a pillar [of the agency], to being so reviled that it’s off of everything?” asks Julie Rathbun, a planetary scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.\n\n“It feels like a betrayal by NASA,” says Kas Knicely, a planetary geophysicist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. “It’s inefficient, it’s wasteful, and it’s also just messed up.”\n\nIn a statement, NASA said the agency “is committed to engaging the best talent to drive innovation and achieve our mission for the benefit of all. As new guidance comes in, we’re working to adhere to new requirements in a timely manner.”\n\nA changed agency\n\nNASA’s push towards inclusivity is one of the most visible in the US government. In the 1950s and 1960s, all of the agency’s astronauts were white men. By 1978, it had bowed to internal and external pressure and had chosen several women and people of colour to fly to space. Today, NASA’s astronauts, as well as its world-renowned scientific and engineering teams, are measurably diverse.\n\nBut signs of NASA’s efforts to make space for everyone are disappearing. These removals have been triggered both by official edicts — such as the requirement to remove pronouns from employees’ e-mail signatures — and by unofficial notices, such as verbal suggestions to remove flags or other displays from workspaces.\n\n‘Mind-boggling’: US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers\n\nTrump’s changes have also halted projects by employee affinity organizations ― groups ranging from military veterans, to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, to Black employees. Before 20 January, NASA celebrated these groups’ efforts with many glowing, now-deleted web articles.\n\n“The work these groups did was wholesome and good for the agency — things like, discussing how do we publish data in a way that works with screen readers, so people with visual disabilities can get at our content,” says a senior NASA scientist, who requested anonymity to avoid possible reprisals. “Or bringing Star Trek legends in to inspire the workforce.” Pausing the work of these groups “promotes fear”, the scientist says, because employees worry that they might be targeted for participating.\n\nOther cancellations include a programme that paired undergraduates from underrepresented groups with active planetary missions, giving the students a chance to observe scientists at work.\n\nMany NASA employees are angry about the changes to DEI, but are buckling down to work nevertheless. “We believe in the mission, and we know that our work is important,” says the senior scientist. “We know that it matters for the nation.”\n\nGrassroots protest\n\nAs federal workers, NASA employees can’t push back against the changes, no matter how much they personally support DEI efforts, says Knicely, who co-chairs a community working group on best practices for DEI at NASA. But space scientists outside NASA are voicing their frustration with the agency’s rejection of years of progress towards a more diverse community. Several of them wrote an open letter to NASA leadership on 6 February protesting the changes, which has garnered more than 1,000 signatures.",

          "abstract": "The lived experience of urban life is shaped by personal mobility through dynamic relationships and resources, marked not only by access and opportunity, but also inequality and segregation. The recent availability of fine-grained mobility data and context attributes ranging from venue type to demographic mixture offer researchers a deeper understanding of experienced inequalities at scale, and pose many new questions. Here we review emerging uses of urban mobility behaviour data, and propose an analytic framework to represent mobility patterns as a temporal bipartite network between people and places. As this network reconfigures over time, analysts can track experienced inequality along three critical dimensions: social mixing with others from specific demographic backgrounds, access to different types of facilities, and spontaneous adaptation to unexpected events, such as epidemics, conflicts or disasters. This framework traces the dynamic, lived experiences of urban inequality and complements prior work on static inequalities experience at home and work.",

Our findings indicate that affluent children in public schools are relatively isolated from their less affluent peers, while low- and middle-income students experience relatively even peer income distributions. Students from families in the top percentile of the income distribution attend schools where 20 percent of their peers, on average, come from the top five income percentiles. A large majority of the differences in peer exposure that we observe arise from the sorting of students across schools; sorting across classrooms within schools plays a substantially smaller role.",

          "authors": "Miruna Cotet, Wenjia Joyce Zhao, Ian Krajbich",
          "abstract": "A standard assumption in game theory is that decision-makers have preplanned strategies telling them what actions to take for every contingency. In contrast, nonstrategic decisions often involve an on-the-spot comparison process, with longer response times (RT) for choices between more similarly appealing options. If strategic decisions also exhibit these patterns, then RT might betray private information and alter game theory predictions. Here, we examined bargaining behavior to determine whether RT reveals private information in strategic settings. Using preexisting and experimental data from eBay, we show that both buyers and sellers take hours longer to accept bad offers and to reject good offers. We find nearly identical patterns in the two datasets, indicating a causal effect of offer size on RT. However, this relationship is half as strong for rejections as for acceptances, reducing the amount of useful private information revealed by the sellers. Counter to our predictions, buyers are discouraged by slow rejections—they are less likely to counteroffer to slow sellers. We also show that a drift-diffusion model (DDM), traditionally limited to decisions on the order of seconds, can account for decisions on the order of hours, sometimes days. The DDM reveals that more experienced sellers are less cautious and more inclined to accept offers. In summary, strategic decisions are inconsistent with preplanned strategies. This underscores the need for game theory to incorporate RT as a strategic variable and broadens the applicability of the DDM to slow decisions.",

          "authors": "Eliane Deschrijver, Richard Ramsey",
          "abstract": "Based on the seminal minimal group experiment, the widely influential social identity theory has, in the last 45 y, led to the belief that discrimination follows from intergroup relations and social identity. A large body of research evidenced that people discriminate against members of their out versus ingroup, even if groups and identities were assigned on the basis of a quantity estimate, aesthetic judgment, or a chance outcome. But to what extent may unequal resource division be accounted for by ad hoc difference versus sameness, outside of any group division? We show via Bayesian regression analyses in seven preregistered experiments (&gt;1,400 subjects) that unequal resource division strategies persist against a single person that demonstrates a different versus the same quantity estimate, painting preference, or even coin flip (Experiments 1, 2, and 3ab), with 43.1% more money awarded for sameness relative to difference conditions (Experiments 4, 5, and 6). These findings open up the possibility that one key driver of discrimination may exist in a mechanism of interindividual comparison that treats ad hoc difference more negatively than ad hoc sameness. If unequal resource division readily emerges against a single person even after a mere chance difference, discrimination may be more widespread and occur for partly different reasons than is currently assumed. Theoretical implications for understanding cognitive and brain systems of discrimination are discussed.",

Mammalian COP1 binds to DET1 and is a substrate adaptor for the CUL4A-DDB1-RBX1 RING E3 ligase. Transcription factor substrates, including c-Jun, ETV4, and ETV5, are targeted for proteasomal degradation to effect rapid transcriptional changes in response to cues such as growth factor deprivation. Here, we link a homozygous DET1 R26W mutation to lethal developmental abnormalities in humans. Experimental cryo-electron microscopy of the DET1 complex with DDB1 and DDA1, as well as co-immunoprecipitation experiments, revealed that DET1 R26W impairs binding to DDB1, thereby compromising E3 ligase function. Accordingly, human-induced pluripotent stem cells homozygous for DET1 R26W expressed ETV4 and ETV5 highly, and exhibited defective mitochondrial homeostasis and aberrant caspase-dependent cell death when differentiated into neurons. Neuronal cell death was increased further in the presence of Det1 -deficient microglia as compared to WT microglia, indicating that the deleterious effects of the DET1 p.R26W mutation may stem from the dysregulation of multiple cell types. Mice lacking Det1 died during embryogenesis, while Det1 deletion just in neural stem cells elicited hydrocephalus, cerebellar dysplasia, and neonatal lethality.

          "abstract": "The discovery of ferroelectric phases in HfO 2 offers insights into ferroelectricity. Its unique fluorite structure and complex polarization switching pathways exhibit distinct characteristics, challenging conventional analysis methods. Combining group theory and first-principles calculations, we identify numerous unconventional electric polarization switching pathways in HfO 2 with energy barriers of 0.32 to 0.57 eV as a function of the different shift in the suboxygen lattices. In total, we identify 47 switching pathways for the orthorhombic phase, corresponding to the left cosets of the F m 3 ¯ m group with P c a 2 1 group. Contrary to the conception that the tetracoordinated oxygen (O IV ) layers are inactive, our result demonstrates that both the tricoordinated oxygen (O III ) and O IV can be displaced, leading to polarization switching along any axial direction. The multiple switching pathways in HfO 2 result in both 180° polarization reversal and the formation of 90° domains observed experimentally. Calculations show that specific switching pathways depend on the orientation of the applied electric field relative to the HfO 2 growth surface. This allows HfO 2 to automatically adjust the in-plane polarization direction under an out-of-plane electric field, thereby maximizing the out-of-plane component and contributing to the wake-up process. These findings redefine the roles of O III and O IV layers, clarify unconventional switching pathways, and enhance our understanding of electric field response mechanisms, wake-up, and fatigue in ferroelectrics.",

          "abstract": "Photosynthesis, the fundamental process using light energy to convert carbon dioxide to organic matter, is vital for life on Earth. It relies on capturing light through light-harvesting complexes (LHC) in photosystem I (PSI) and PSII and on the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Composition and organization of PSI and PSII core complexes are well conserved across evolution. PSII is particularly sensitive to photodamage but benefits from a large diversity of photoprotective mechanisms, finely tuned to handle the dynamic and ever-changing light conditions. Light Harvesting Complex protein family members (LHC and LHC-like families) have acquired a dual function during evolution. Members of the LHC antenna complexes of PS capture light energy, whereas others dissipate excess energy that cannot be harnessed for photosynthesis. This process mainly occurs through nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). In this work, we focus on the Light Harvesting complex-Like 4 (LHL4) protein, a LHC-like protein induced by ultraviolet-B (UV-B) and blue light through UV Resistance locus 8 (UVR8) and phototropin photoreceptor-activated signaling pathways in the model green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . We demonstrate that alongside established NPQ effectors, LHL4 plays a key role in photoprotection, preventing singlet oxygen accumulation in PSII and promoting cell survival upon light stress. LHL4 protective function is distinct from that of NPQ-related proteins, as LHL4 specifically and uniquely binds to the transient monomeric form of the core PSII complex, safeguarding its integrity. LHL4 characterization expands our understanding of the interplay between light harvesting and photoprotection mechanisms upon light stress in photosynthetic microalgae.",

          "abstract": "Systemic infections caused by Cryptococcus claim over 161,000 lives annually, with global mortality rate close to 70% despite antifungal therapies. Currently, no vaccine is available. To develop an effective multivalent vaccine against this free-living opportunistic eukaryotic pathogen, it is critical to identify protective antigens. We previously discovered ZNF2 oe strains elicit protective host immune responses and increase the abundance of antigens present in the capsule, which is required for its immunoprotection. Capsule is a defining feature of Cryptococcus species and composed of polysaccharides and mannoproteins. Here, we found increased levels of exposed mannoproteins in ZNF2 oe cells. As mannoproteins are the primary components recognized by anticryptococcal cell-mediated immune responses and few have been characterized, we systemically screened all 49 predicted GPI-mannoproteins in Cryptococcus neoformans for enhanced host recognition. We identified those highly present in ZNF2 oe cells and found Cig1 to be a protective antigen against cryptococcosis either as a recombinant protein vaccine or an mRNA vaccine. Cig1 is induced by iron limitation and is highly expressed by this fungus in infected mice and in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Remarkably, iron restriction by the host induces cryptococcal cells to express iron-uptake proteins including Cig1, which act as cryptococcal antigens and in turn enhance host detection. Our results highlight an arms race between the pathogen and the host centered on iron competition, and the trade-off between cryptococcal iron acquisition and antigen exposure. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging this host–pathogen interaction for vaccine development.",

Its implication in neurological disorders and inflammation has spurred the development of numerous compounds that enhance channel activation. However, the therapeutic potential of these compounds has been limited by the characteristically fast desensitization of the α7 receptor. Using recent high-resolution structures from cryo-EM, and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations augmented by Markov state modeling, here we explore the mechanism of α7 receptor desensitization and its implication on allosteric modulation. The results provide a precise characterization of the desensitization gate and illuminate the mechanism of ion-pore opening/closing with an agonist bound. In addition, the simulations reveal the existence of a short-lived, open-channel intermediate between the activated and desensitized states that rationalizes the paradoxical pharmacology of the L247T mutant and may be relevant to type-II allosteric modulation.

          "abstract": "The introns of the gene encoding the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) GAS5 host up to 10 C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). However, whether there is a regulatory and functional relationship between these snoRNAs and GAS5 is unknown. Here, we show that the expression of SNORD80, but not the other snoRNAs, parallels GAS5 expression and is regulated alongside GAS5 in response to cellular stress. The 2′-O-methylation at the A496 site, located within a segment of GAS5 complementing the conserved RNA-binding region on SNORD80, promotes GAS5 stability and consequent upregulation. This methylation requires SNORD80, as it is diminished by knockdown of SNORD80 and increased by SNORD80 overexpression, similar to the effects of manipulating the expression of fibrillarin, the methyltransferase of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle (snoRNP). The upregulation of SNORD80 in response to cellular stress is due to an enhancement in its stability, which is associated with an increase in its interaction with fibrillarin. Collectively, these results identify a role for SNORD80 in guiding 2′-O-methylation to stabilize GAS5. This uncovers a feedforward regulatory loop at the GAS5 gene locus in response to cellular stress and sheds light on posttranscriptional mechanisms governing lncRNA expression.",

          "abstract": "The unsupervised and principled diagnosis of multiscale data is a fundamental obstacle in modern scientific problems from, for instance, weather and climate prediction, neurology, epidemiology, and turbulence. Multiscale data are characterized by a combination of processes acting along multiple dimensions simultaneously, spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, nonstationarity, and/or invariances such as translation and rotation. Existing methods are not well-suited to multiscale data, usually requiring supervised strategies such as human intervention, extensive tuning, or selection of ideal time periods. We present the multiresolution coherent spatio-temporal scale separation (mrCOSTS), a hierarchical and automated algorithm for the diagnosis of coherent patterns or modes in multiscale data. mrCOSTS is a variant of dynamic mode decomposition which decomposes data into bands of spatial patterns with shared time dynamics, thereby providing a robust method for analyzing multiscale data. It requires no training but instead takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of multiscale systems. We demonstrate mrCOSTS using complex multiscale datasets that are canonically difficult to analyze: 1) climate patterns of sea surface temperature, 2) electrophysiological observations of neural signals of the motor cortex, and 3) horizontal wind in the mountain boundary layer. With mrCOSTS, we trivially retrieve complex dynamics that were previously difficult to resolve while additionally extracting hitherto unknown patterns of activity embedded in the dynamics, allowing for advancing the understanding of these fields of study. This method is an important advancement for addressing the multiscale data which characterize many of the grand challenges in science and engineering.",

          "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation is causing the collapse of seed dispersal interactions and ecosystem functioning. When management and conservation strategies aim to sustain ecosystem functioning of fragmented forests, species’ traits and functional performance are critical in guiding decisions. However, to date, we lack a quantitative understanding of the role of frugivores’ body size and dispersal ability in ecosystem sustainability among fragmented forests. Focusing on avian frugivory and seed dispersal in a multi-island setting, we address the data gap by recording more than 20,000 frugivory events in an artificial insular fragmented landscape constructed in 1959 and nearby unfragmented forests on the mainland. We show that large-bodied and dispersal-limited frugivorous birds are largely confined to large islands and the unfragmented mainland, whereas on small islands, small-bodied and highly mobile birds predominantly engage in frugivory interactions. The plant–frugivore meta-network exhibits a distinct compartmentalization, driven by island area and bird mobility. Birds with smaller size and greater mobility have higher topological importance, and the presence of small-bodied birds significantly enhances meta-network robustness. These results suggest that among insular fragmented forests where frugivory interactions are degraded, small-bodied and highly mobile birds disproportionately contribute to meta-community cohesion and ecosystem functioning because of the lack of large-bodied and dispersal-limited birds. We thus advocate for the restoration of landscapes to facilitate seed dispersal and functional connectivity, ensuring the presence of large patches along with small patches as stepping-stones. Meanwhile, we recommend prioritizing conservation on small-bodied and highly mobile birds in fragmented landscapes, a subset of underappreciated species that yet play crucial roles in ecosystem functioning.",

We show anti-poly-glycine-arginine (a-polyGR) positive aggregates frequently accumulate in sporadic AD autopsy brains (45/80 cases). We hypothesize that these aggregates are caused by one or more polyGR-encoding repeat expansion mutations. We developed a CRISPR/deactivated-Cas9 enrichment strategy to identify candidate GR-encoding repeat expansion mutations directly from genomic DNA isolated from a-polyGR(+) AD cases. Using this approach, we isolated an interrupted (GGGAGA) n intronic expansion within a SINE-VNTR-Alu element in CASP8 ( CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP ). Immunostaining using a-polyGR and locus-specific C-terminal antibodies demonstrate that the CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP expresses hybrid poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n proteins that accumulate in CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP (+) AD brains. In cells, expression of CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP minigenes leads to increased p-Tau (Ser202/Thr205) levels. Consistent with other types of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) proteins, poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n protein levels are increased by stress. Additionally, levels of these stress-induced proteins are reduced by metformin. Association studies show specific aggregate promoting interrupted CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP sequence variants found in ~3.6% of controls and 7.5% AD cases increase AD risk [ CASP8 -GGGAGA-AD-R1; OR 2.2, 95% CI (1.5185 to 3.1896), P = 3.1 × 10 −5 ]. Cells transfected with a high-risk CASP8 -GGGAGA-AD-R1 variant show increased toxicity and increased levels of poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n aggregates. Taken together, these data identify polyGR(+) aggregates as a frequent and unexpected type of brain pathology in AD and CASP8 -GGGAGA-AD-R1 alleles as a relatively common AD risk factor. Taken together, these data support a model in which CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP alleles combined with stress increase AD risk.",

          "abstract": "Immune responses in the intestine are intricately balanced to prevent pathogen entry without inducing immunopathology. The nervous system is well established to interface with the immune system to fine-tune immunity in various organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract. Specialized sensory neurons can detect bacteria, bacterial products, and the resulting inflammation, to coordinate the immune response in the gastrointestinal tract. These sensory neurons release peptide neurotransmitters such as Substance P (SP), to induce both neuronal signaling and localized responses in nonneuronal cells. With this in mind, we assessed the immunoregulatory roles of SP receptor signaling during enteric bacterial infection with the noninvasive pathogen Citrobacter rodentium . Pharmacological antagonism of the SP receptor significantly reduced bacterial burden and prevented colonic crypt hyperplasia. Mice with SP receptor signaling blockade had significantly reduced inflammation and recruitment of T cells in the colon. Reduced colonic T cell recruitment is due to reduced expression of adhesion molecules on colonic endothelial cells in SP receptor antagonist-treated mice. Using SP receptor T cell conditional knockout mice, we further confirmed SP receptor signaling enhanced select aspects of T cell responses. Our data demonstrate that SP receptor signaling can significantly reduce inflammation and prevent host-maladaptive responses without impinging upon host protection.",

Ablation of CDKL3 does not affect normal kidney, but abrogates Akt-mTOR hyperactivity and thoroughly prevents the formation and growth of the HIF-agitated ccRCC in vivo. Remarkable clinical correlations also supported the oncogenic role of CDKL3. Mechanism-wise, cytosolic CDKL3 unexpectedly behaves as the adaptor to physically potentiate mTORC2-dependent Akt activation without functioning through kinase activity. And mTORC2 can phosphorylate and stabilize CDKL3 to form a positive feedback loop to sustain the cancer-favored Akt-mTOR overactivation. Together, we revealed the pathological importance and molecular mechanism of CDKL3-mediated Akt-mTOR axis in ccRCC initiation and progression.",

Yet, real-time prediction of these dynamic structures remains a significant challenge. Two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing protein dynamics. However, translating its complex, low-dimensional signals into detailed three-dimensional structures is a daunting task. In this study, we introduce a machine learning-based approach that accurately predicts dynamic three-dimensional protein structures from 2DIR descriptors. Our method establishes a robust “spectrum-structure” relationship, enabling the recovery of three-dimensional structures across a wide variety of proteins. It demonstrates broad applicability in predicting dynamic structures along different protein folding trajectories, spanning timescales from microseconds to milliseconds. This approach also shows promise in identifying the structures of previously uncharacterized proteins based solely on their spectral descriptors.

          "abstract": "Bacteria frequently inhabit surface-attached communities where rich “social” interactions can significantly alter their population-level behavior, including their response to antibiotics. Understanding these collective effects in spatially heterogeneous communities is an ongoing challenge. Here, we investigated the spatial organization that emerges from antibiotic exposure in initially randomly distributed communities containing antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Enterococcus faecalis , an opportunistic pathogen. We identified that a range of complex spatial structures emerged in the population homeland—the inoculated region that microbes inhabit prior to range expansion—which depended on initial colony composition and antibiotic concentration. We found that these arrangements were explained by cooperative interactions between resistant and sensitive subpopulations with a variable spatial scale, the result of dynamic zones of protection afforded to sensitive cells by growing populations of enzyme-producing resistant neighbors. Using a combination of experiments and mathematical models, we explored the complex spatiotemporal interaction dynamics that create these patterns, and predicted spatial arrangements of sensitive and resistant subpopulations under new conditions. We illustrated how spatial population dynamics in the homeland affect subsequent range expansion, both because they modulate the composition of the initial expanding front, and through long-range cooperation between the homeland and the expanding region. Finally, we showed that these spatial constraints resulted in populations whose size and composition differed markedly from matched populations in well-stirred (planktonic) cultures. These findings underscore the importance of spatial structure and cooperation, long-studied features in theoretical ecology, for determining the fate of bacterial communities under antibiotic exposure.",

However, less is known about the structure of interaction configurations within species, even though individuals are the actual interacting units in nature. We compiled 46 empirical, individual-based, interaction networks on plant-animal seed dispersal mutualisms, comprising 1,037 plant individuals across 29 species from various regions. We compared the structure of individual-based networks to that of species-based networks and, by extending the niche concept to interaction assemblages, we explored individual plant specialization. Using a Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty derived from sampling, we examined how plant individuals “explore” the interaction niche of their populations. Both individual-based and species-based networks exhibited high variability in network properties, lacking remarkable structural and topological differences between them. Within populations, frugivores’ interaction allocation among plant individuals was highly heterogeneous, with one to three frugivore species dominating interactions. Regardless of species or bioregion, plant individuals displayed a variety of interaction profiles across populations, with a consistently-small percentage of individuals playing a central role and exhibiting high diversity in their interaction assemblage. Plant populations showed variable mid to low levels of niche specialization; and individuals’ interaction niche “breadth” accounted for 70% of the population interaction diversity, on average. Our results highlight how downscaling from species to individual-based networks helps understanding the structuring of interactions within ecological communities and provide an empirical basis for the extension of niche theory to complex mutualistic networks.",

Fluorescent indicators for Ca 2+ ions revolutionized our ability to make rapid, accurate, and highly parallel measurement of Ca 2+ concentrations in living cells. The use of ratio-based imaging with one particular indicator, fura-2, allowed practitioners to correct for a number of experimental confounds, including dye bleaching, variations in sample thickness, and fluctuations in illumination intensity. Ratio-based imaging with fura-2 was the most accurate and reliable method for measuring Ca 2+ concentrations. Two drawbacks to fura-2 exist. First, it requires ultraviolet (UV) excitation, which is more toxic to living cells than visible light. Second, our ability to use fura-2 for accurate, stable, ratio-based determinations of Ca 2+ concentration in living cells is fast becoming a method of the past. This is due, in part, because modern microscopes are phasing out the use of mercury arc lamps that provide the UV excitation needed for fura-2 imaging. To address this problem, we describe the design, synthesis, and cellular application of benzo[ b ]phosphole-based fluorescent Ca 2+ indicators for ratio-based imaging of Ca 2+ in living cells that can be used with modern light emitting diode (LED)-equipped fluorescence microscopes. We report isoCaRed-1Me, a Ca 2+ indicator that enables ratio-based imaging in immortalized cell lines, primary mammalian hippocampal neurons, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes.

Counter to dogma that “cancer outgrows its blood supply,” we suggest that development of necrosis is not merely a consequence of aggressive neoplastic growth but could be a contributing force causing tumor microenvironment (TME) restructuring and biologic progression. Mechanisms related to necrotic contributions are poorly understood due to a lack of methods to study necrosis as a primary variable. To reveal spatiotemporal changes related to necrosis directly, we developed a mouse model and methodology designed to induce clinically relevant thrombotic vaso-occlusion within GBMs in an immunocompetent RCAS/tv-a mouse model to study TME restructuring by intravital microscopy and demonstrate its impact on glioma progression. Diffuse high-grade gliomas are generated by introducing RCAS-PDGFB-RFP and RCAS-Cre in a Nestin/tv-a; TP53 fl/fl PTEN fl/fl background mouse. We then photoactivate Rose Bengal in specific, targeted blood vessels within the glioma to induce thrombosis, hypoxia, and necrosis. Following induced necrosis, GBMs undergo rapid TME restructuring and radial expansion, with immunosuppressive bone marrow–derived, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and glioma stem cells (GSCs) increasing dramatically in the perinecrotic niche. Collectively, this model introduces necrosis as the primary variable and captures glioma TME and growth dynamics in a manner that will facilitate therapeutic development to antagonize these mechanisms of progression.",

Moreover, the geometric deformation, induced by the topological defect, curves the geometry such that these Faraday lines are channeled preferentially by the arrays’ curved geometry. Our results demonstrate how the intentional combination of topology and geometry can be designed to control magnetic charges and the flow of local magnetization and thus manipulate associated collective excitations.",

          "abstract": "Experimental studies have shown that symbiotic relationships between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and host plants can regulate soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. Although the impacts of mycorrhiza are highly context-dependent, it remains unclear how these effects vary across broad spatial scales. Based on data from 2296 field sites across grassland ecosystems of China, here we show that mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis enhances SOC storage in the topsoil and subsoil through increasing plant diversity and elevating biomass allocation to belowground. SOC storage is significantly higher in both the topsoil and subsoil in systems dominated by obligate mycorrhizal (OM) and facultative mycorrhizal (FM) plants than those dominated by nonmycorrhizal (NM) plants. Also, the relative abundance of OM plants increases at the expense of FM plants as temperature and precipitation increase. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi may influence grassland plant diversity and SOC storage in the context of global change.",

Careful regulation of these molecules is critical to control apoptosis, pyroptosis, and inflammation. Here, we found a pivotal role of Raver1 as an essential regulator of Ripk1 pre-mRNA splicing, expression, and functionality and the subsequent caspase-8-dependent inflammatory cell death. We show that Raver1 influences mRNA diversity primarily by repressing alternative exon inclusion. Macrophages from Raver1 -deficient mice exhibit altered splicing of Ripk1 . As a result, Raver1 -deficient primary macrophages display diminished cell death and decreased interleukin-18 and interleukin-1ß production, when infected with Yersinia bacteria, or by restraining TGF-ß-activated kinase 1 or IKKβ in the presence of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor family members, or interferon-γ. These responses are accompanied by reduced activation of caspase-8, Gasdermin D and E, and caspase-1 in the absence of Raver1 . Consequently, Raver1 -deficient mice showed heightened susceptibility to Yersinia infection. Raver1 and RIPK1 also controlled the expression and function of the C-type lectin receptor Mincle. Our study underscores the critical regulatory role of Raver1 in modulating innate immune responses and highlights its significance in directing in vivo and in vitro inflammatory processes.",

          "abstract": "Fungal infections represent a significant global health concern, with a growing prevalence of antifungal drug resistance. Targeting glucosylceramides (GlcCer), which are functionally important glycosphingolipids (GSL) present in fungal membranes, represents a promising strategy for the development of antifungal drugs. GlcCer are associated with the antifungal activity of certain plant and insect defensins. The 44-residue ETD151 peptide, optimized from butterfly defensins, is active against several fungal pathogens. ETD151 has been shown to induce a multifaceted mechanism of action (MOA) in Botrytis cinerea , a multiresistant phytopathogenic fungus. However, the target has yet to be identified. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of GlcCer in membranes determines the susceptibility of Pichia pastoris and Candida albicans toward ETD151. To ascertain whether this is due to direct molecular recognition, we demonstrate that ETD151 selectively recognizes liposomes containing GlcCer from B. cinerea , which reveals a methylated-sphingoid base structure. The dissociation constant was estimated by microscale thermophoresis to be in the µM range. Finally, fluorescence microscopy revealed that ETD151 localizes preferentially at the surface of B. cinerea . Furthermore, the majority of prokaryotic cells do not contain GSL, which explains their resistance to ETD151. We investigated the susceptibility of Novosphingobium capsulatum , one of the rare GSL-containing bacteria, to ETD151. ETD151 demonstrated transient morphological changes and inhibitory growth activity (IC 50 ~75 µM) with an affinity for the cell surface, emphasizing the critical importance of GSL as target. Understanding the MOA of ETD151 could pave the way for new perspectives in human health and crop protection.",

We used PiggyBac (PB) transposon technology to insert a liver-specific hNTCP expression cassette into rhesus macaque zygotes and transferred the resulting embryos into surrogate females, resulting in two healthy transgenic offspring.

Using X-ray crystallography and negative-stain electron microscopy, we determined structures of cH5/1, cH8/1, and cH11/1 HAs in their apo (unliganded) and antibody Fab-bound states. Stem-reactive antibodies 3E1 and 31.b.09 recognize their cognate epitopes in cH5/1, cH8/1, and cH11/1 HAs. However, with cH5/1, the head domains are rotated by 35 to 45° around the threefold axis of the HA trimer compared to native HA with a more splayed-open conformation at the stem base. cH11/1 with 3E1 is structurally more native-like but resembles cH5/1 with 31.b.09, whereas cH8/1 with 31.b.09 exhibited a range of closed-to-open stem configurations with some separation of head and stem domains. Furthermore, all of these group 1 cHAs effectively bound a broad head trimer interface antibody and other broad stem antibodies. Thus, the cHAs exhibit structural plasticity without compromising the stem and head trimer interface epitopes for elicitation of influenza A group 1 cross-reactive antibodies.",

We previously reported that the functional and molecular profiles of layer 2/3 (L2/3) cell types in the primary visual cortex (V1) are vision-dependent [S. Cheng et al. , Cell 185 , 311–327.e24 (2022)]. Here, we characterize the spatial organization of L2/3 cell types with and without visual experience. Spatial transcriptomic profiling based on 500 genes recapitulates the zonation of L2/3 cell types along the pial–ventricular axis in V1. By applying multitasking theory, we suggest that the spatial zonation of L2/3 cell types is linked to the continuous nature of their gene expression profiles, which can be represented as a 2D manifold bounded by three archetypal cell types. By comparing normally reared and dark reared L2/3 cells, we show that visual deprivation-induced transcriptomic changes comprise two independent gene programs. The first, induced specifically in the visual cortex, includes immediate-early genes and genes associated with metabolic processes. It manifests as a change in cell state that is orthogonal to cell-type-specific gene expression programs. By contrast, the second program impacts L2/3 cell-type identity, regulating a subset of cell-type-specific genes and shifting the distribution of cells within the L2/3 cell-type manifold. Through an integrated analysis of spatial transcriptomics with single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we describe how vision patterns cortical L2/3 cell types during the critical period.",

We employed a imaging method called spatiotemporal optical coherence tomography, which ensures high contrast and phase stability within the strongly scattering photoreceptor– Retinal Pigment Epithelium complex. Using this approach, we recorded nanometer-scale changes in human cones and rods in response to photopic flicker stimulation and observed length changes in rodent rods under scotopic conditions following a single pulse of light, in the absence or presence of sildenafil, which inhibits the catalytic activity of PDE6. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that during phototransduction conformational changes in PDE6 structure, which occur on an angstrom scale, are amplified to the nanometer scale due to the unique structure of the photoreceptor outer segments and sequential stimulation. This finding opens up possibilities for the informed use of photopic flicker optoretinography measurements as a diagnostic tool, as the observed nanometer-scale changes in rod and cone dimensions as a function of light stimulus can now be directly linked to molecular events involved in the phototransduction pathway.",

OPN3 was first identified in the brain (and named encephalopsin) and subsequently found to be expressed in other tissues. In adipocytes, OPN3 is necessary for light responses that modulate lipolysis and glucose uptake, while OPN3 in human skin melanocytes regulates pigmentation in a light-independent manner. Despite its initial discovery in the brain, OPN3 functional mechanisms in the brain remain elusive. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of OPN3 function in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. We show that Opn3 is coexpressed with the melanocortin 4 receptor ( Mc4r ) in a population of PVN neurons, where it negatively regulates MC4R-mediated cAMP signaling in a specific and Gα i/o -dependent manner. Under baseline conditions, OPN3 via Gα i/o potentiates the activity of the inward rectifying Kir7.1 channel, previously shown to be closed in response to agonist-mediated activation of MC4R in a Gα s -independent manner. In mice, we found that Opn3 in Mc4r -expressing neurons regulates food consumption. Our results reveal the first mechanistic insight into OPN3 function in the hypothalamus, uncovering a unique mechanism by which OPN3 functions to potentiate Kir7.1 activity and negatively regulate MC4R-mediated cAMP signaling, thereby promoting food intake.",

The scaling behavior of superfluid weight with the band gap is studied in detail, and the effect on the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition temperature is explored.

How do such antagonistic interactions impact the growth and survival of competing strains, while being spatially advected by turbulent flows? By using numerical simulations of a continuum model, we study the dynamics of two antagonistic strains that are dispersed by incompressible turbulent flows in two spatial dimensions. A key parameter is the ratio of the fluid transport time to that of biological reproduction, which determines the winning organism that ultimately takes over the whole population from an initial heterogeneous state, a process known as fixation. By quantifying the probability and mean time for fixation along with the spatial structure of concentration fluctuations, we demonstrate how turbulence raises the threshold for biological nucleation and antagonism suppresses flow-induced mixing by depleting the population at interfaces. Our work highlights the unusual biological consequences of the interplay of turbulent fluid flows with antagonistic population dynamics, with potential implications for marine microbial ecology and origins of biological chirality.",

Herein, we report a strategy, coined self-assembled proteomimetic (SAP), to mimic such three-helix bundle architecture with a hybridization-enforced two-helix coiled coil that is obtained by templated native chemical ligation (T-NCL) of PNA–peptide conjugates. This SAP strategy stands out by its synthetic accessibility, reducing the length on the longest synthetic peptide to less than 30 amino acids which is readily attainable by standard SPPS methodologies. We show that the T-NCL dramatically accelerates the ligation, enabling this chemistry to proceed in a combinatorial fashion at low micromolar concentrations. We demonstrate that small combinatorial libraries of SAPs can be prepared in one operation and used directly in affinity selections against a target of interest with an LC–MS analysis of the fittest binders. Moreover, we show that the underlying design paradigm is functional for SAPs based on structurally distinct three-helix peptides aimed at different therapeutic targets, namely HER2 and spike’s RBD, reaching picomolar affinities. We further illustrate that the affinity of the SAP can be allosterically regulated using a toehold displacement of the hybridizing PNAs to disrupt the coiled coil stabilization. Finally, we show that an RBD-targeting SAP effectively inhibits viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with an IC 50 of 2.8 nM.",

Recent attempts to reconcile this uncertainty by “Darwinizing” nonreplicating biogeochemical processes subject to persistence-based selection conform with the historicity of the geochemical record but lack mechanistic clarity. Here, we present a theoretical framework showing how: 1) A biogeochemical “cycle-biota-variant” (CBV) can be defined non-arbitrarily as one biologically facilitated pathway for net recycling of an essential element, plus the genotypes driving the relevant interconversion reactions. 2) Distinct CBVs can be individuated if they have climatic or geochemical side effects that feed-back on relative persistence. 3) The separation of spatial/temporal scales between the dynamics of such effects and those of conventional Darwinian evolution can introduce a degree of randomness into the relationship between CBVs and their Earth system impact properties, loosely analogous to that between the biochemical causes and evolutionary effects of genetic mutation. 4) Threshold behavior in climate feedback can accentuate biotic impacts and lead to CBV-level “competitive exclusion”. 5) CBV-level persistence selection is observationally distinguishable from genotype-level selection by strong covariance between “internal” CBV properties (genotypes and reactions) and “external” climatic effects, which we argue is analogous to the covariance between fitness and traits under conventional Darwinian selection. These factors cannot circumvent the basic fact that local natural selection will often favor phenotypes that ultimately destabilize large-scale geochemical/climatic properties. However, we claim that our results nevertheless demonstrate the theoretical coherence of persistence-selection between non-replicating life–environment interaction patterns and therefore have broad biogeochemical applicability.",

One class of bacteriocins produced by S. mutans , the lantibiotic mutacins, are particularly effective at killing due to their broad spectrum of activity. Despite years of study, the regulatory mechanisms governing production of lantibiotic mutacins I, II, and III in S. mutans have never been elucidated. We identified a distinct class of quorum-sensing system, MutRS, that regulates mutacins and is widespread among the streptococci. We demonstrate that MutRS systems are activated by a short peptide pheromone (Mutacin Stimulating Peptide) and show that MutRS controls production of three separate lantibiotic mutacins in three different strains of S. mutans .

Bone formation is mediated by osteoblasts originating from the differentiation of bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (BM-MSPCs). However, how bone cells communicate with BM-MSPCs to coordinate bone formation remains largely elusive. Here, we unveil a key role of osteocyte connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels in regulating the lineage commitment of BM-MSPCs. Two transgenic mouse models expressing dominant negative Cx43 mutants in osteocytes were used: R76W (inhibiting gap junctions) and Δ130 to 136 (inhibiting both hemichannels and gap junctions). BM-MSPCs from Δ130 to 136 mice showed enhanced adipogenic differentiation and reduced osteogenic potential, leading to increased BM adipocytes. Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed shifts in BM-MSPC subsets, less osteogenic-biased MSPCs, and more adipogenic-biased MSPCs in Δ130 to 136 mice. Conversely, R76W, with more functional hemichannels, exhibited effects similar to WT mice or even greater opposite effects than Δ130 to 136 mice. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), released from active Cx43 hemichannels, inhibited adipogenesis and promoted osteogenesis via the PGE 2 receptor EP4 and ERK1/2 signaling. Inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels or EP4 led to increased adipogenic-biased MSPCs. Moreover, administration of a Cx43(M1) antibody, which inhibits hemichannels, substantially increased BM adipocytes, accompanied by increased adipogenic-biased MSPCs, and decreased osteogenic-biased MSPCs. Our study highlights the pivotal role of osteocyte Cx43 hemichannels in BM-MSPC fate decision through PGE 2 release, providing insights into the precise and highly regulated communication between matrix-bound bone cells and BM-MSPCs, which dictates bone formation and remodeling.",

SLC2A9 is the primary transporter that returns urate from the basolateral side of kidney tubule cells back to plasma. A shorter splice variant of SLC2A9 is directed to the apical surface where several transporters recapture urate from the tubule back into cells. Too high a concentration in plasma causes hyperuricemia, is linked to gout, and favors kidney stone formation. To understand the molecular basis of uric acid transport and the role of disease-causing mutations in SLC2A9, we determined structures of human SLC2A9 in its apo form, and its urate-bound form by cryo-EM, at resolution of 3.3 Å and 4.1 Å respectively. Both structures are captured in an inward open conformation. Using the inward-facing structure as a template we modeled the outward-facing conformation to understand the alternating access mechanism. Alternative salt bridge pairs on the cytoplasmic side suggest a mechanism that can balance the energetics of the inward open and outward open states. The location of disease-causing mutants suggests their role in impacting function. Our structures elucidate the molecular basis for urate selectivity and transport and provide a platform for future structure-based drug discovery aimed at reducing plasma urate levels in diseases of hyperuricemia and gout.",

          "abstract": "The immune system exploits a wide range of strategies to combine sensitivity with selectivity for optimal response. We propose a generic physical mechanism that allows tuning the location and steepness of the response threshold of cellular processes activated by multivalent binding. The mechanism is based on the possibility to modulate the attraction between membrane receptors. We use theory and simulations to show how tuning interreceptor attraction can enhance or suppress the binding of multivalent ligand-coated particles to surfaces. The changes in the interreceptor attraction less than the thermal energy k B T can selectively switch the receptor-clustering and activation on or off in an almost step-wise fashion, which we explain by near-critical receptor density fluctuations. We also show that the same mechanism can efficiently regulate the onset of endocytosis for, e.g. , drug delivery vehicles.",

          "abstract": "Modern machine learning has achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacrifices interpretability, a critical consideration in high-stakes domains such as medicine. In such settings, practitioners often use highly interpretable decision tree models, but these suffer from inductive bias against additive structure. To overcome this bias, we propose Fast Interpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (FIGS), which generalizes the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm to simultaneously grow a flexible number of trees in summation. By combining logical rules with addition, FIGS adapts to additive structure while remaining highly interpretable. Experiments on real-world datasets show FIGS achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. To demonstrate the usefulness of FIGS in high-stakes domains, we adapt FIGS to learn clinical decision instruments (CDIs), which are tools for guiding decision-making. Specifically, we introduce a variant of FIGS known as Group Probability-Weighted Tree Sums (G-FIGS) that accounts for heterogeneity in medical data. G-FIGS derives CDIs that reflect domain knowledge and enjoy improved specificity (by up to 20% over CART) without sacrificing sensitivity or interpretability. Theoretically, we prove that FIGS learns components of additive models, a property we refer to as disentanglement. Further, we show (under oracle conditions) that tree-sum models leverage disentanglement to generalize more efficiently than single tree models when fitted to additive regression functions. Finally, to avoid overfitting with an unconstrained number of splits, we develop Bagging-FIGS, an ensemble version of FIGS that borrows the variance reduction techniques of random forests. Bagging-FIGS performs competitively with random forests and XGBoost on real-world datasets.",

          "abstract": "Host antibody responses are key components in the protection of animals against pathogens, yet the defining properties of viral antigens and induction of B cell responses that result in varied protection are still poorly understood. Parvoviruses are simple molecular structures that display 60 repeated motifs on their capsid surface, and rapidly induce strong antibody responses that protect animals from infection. We recently showed that following canine parvovirus infection of its natural host, the polyclonal response in the sera contained only two or three dominant antibodies that bound two epitopes on the capsid. Here, we characterize key antibodies present in that immune response, identifying their sequences, defining their binding properties on the capsid by cryoelectron microscopic (cryoEM) analysis, and testing their effects on viral infectivity. Two antibodies sharing the same heavy chain bound to the side of the capsid threefold spike (B-site), while another distinct antibody bound close to the threefold axis (A-site). The epitopes of these antibodies overlapped the binding site of the host receptor, the transferrin receptor type-1, but to varying degrees. The antibodies varied widely in their neutralization efficiencies as either immunoglobulins (IgGs) or monomeric antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), which was consistent with their ability to compete for the receptor. The monoclonal antibodies characterized here matched the structures from the cryoEM analysis of polyclonal sera, including those present in a different dog than the monoclonal source. This shows that after infection, a focused response to the viral antigen is produced that protects against infection.",

          "abstract": "Enhancing thermoelectric conversion efficiency (TCE) is pivotal for advancing global energy conservation and emission reduction initiatives. Traditional approaches primarily focus on microscopic strategies such as bandgap engineering, chemical potential adjustments, and entropy engineering. However, these methods face substantial limitations in practical applications due to challenging material property requirements. Additionally, the efficiencies achieved remain modest, constrained by the interdependent nature of electrical and thermal conductivities, which typically vary concurrently. Inspired by the thermoregulation mechanisms in biological organisms, we propose here a macroscopic strategy based on an expanded-plane (EP) meta-structure. Such a meta-structure, of the thermal gradient regulator type, exploits the temperature gradient concentrating effect to significantly boost TCE. We prove, both numerically and experimentally, how the proposed device can achieve temperature gradient concentration under diverse conditions. Remarkably, under undistorted temperature background conditions, we measured an striking efficiency enhancement of 59.0 % . This work highlights the EP thermal gradient regulator’s ability to boost thermoelectric efficiency, valuable across domains: aiding efficient chip cooling in microelectronics and powering wearable medical devices.",

          "abstract": "Poststroke inflammation critically influences functional outcomes following ischemic stroke. Arginase-1 (Arg1) is considered a marker for anti-inflammatory macrophages, associated with the resolution of inflammation and promotion of tissue repair in various pathological conditions. However, its specific role in poststroke recovery remains to be elucidated. This study investigates the functional impact of Arg1 expressed in macrophages on poststroke recovery and inflammatory milieu. We observed a time-dependent increase in Arg1 expression, peaking at 7 d after photothrombotic stroke in mice. Cellular mapping analysis revealed that Arg1 was predominantly expressed in LysM-positive infiltrating macrophages. Using a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model, we examined the role of Arg1 expressed in infiltrating macrophages. Contrary to its presumed beneficial effects, Arg1 cKO in LysM-positive macrophages significantly improved skilled forelimb motor function recovery after stroke. Mechanistically, Arg1 cKO attenuated fibrotic scar formation, enhanced peri-infarct remyelination, and increased synaptic density while reducing microglial synaptic elimination in the peri-infarct cortex. Gene expression analysis of fluorescence-activated single cell sorting (FACS)-sorted CD45 low microglia revealed decreased transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and proinflammatory cytokine activity in peri-infarct microglia from Arg1 cKO animals. In vitro coculture experiments demonstrated that Arg1 activity in macrophages modulates microglial synaptic phagocytosis, providing evidence for macrophage–microglia interaction. These findings present unique insights into the function of Arg1 in central nervous system injury and highlight an interaction between infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia in shaping the poststroke inflammatory milieu. Our study identifies Arg1 in macrophages as a potential therapeutic target for modulating poststroke inflammation and improving functional recovery.",

However, there is another, often overlooked side to science communication—how scientists respond when questions arise about the integrity of their research. Often, the tendency has been to stay silent and wait for any controversy to pass or be resolved in professional forums. But in an age of growing, intense attacks on science, silence can be detrimental to both public trust and the careers of scientists who are under scrutiny.

We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored. On a decadal scale, we find substantial depletion in aquifers below 50-meter depth, with only limited storm-related recovery.

We discovered that a small variation in maternal foraging success amplified into larger changes in offspring body mass and enormous variation in first-year survival and recruitment. Worsening oceanographic conditions could shift predator population trajectories from current growth to sharp declines.

We find that the median US stream network is five times longer during annual high-flow conditions than during annual low-flow conditions.

Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are principal regulators of satiety because they decrease food intake through excitatory melanocortin neuropeptides. We discovered that POMC neurons not only promote satiety in fed conditions but concomitantly switch on sugar appetite, which drives overconsumption. POMC neuron projections to the paraventricular thalamus selectively inhibited postsynaptic neurons through mu-opioid receptor signaling. This opioid circuit was strongly activated during sugar consumption, which was most notable in satiety states.

This reaction is enabled by a catalyst containing a high density of atomic Pt 1 and Ir 1 species supported on a reactive alpha-molybdenum carbide substrate, achieving a hydrogen production rate of 331.3 millimoles of hydrogen per gram catalyst per hour and an acetic acid selectivity of 84.5% at 270°C, and is therefore more energy-efficient compared with standard reforming. Techno-economic analysis of partial ethanol reforming demonstrates the potential profitability for operation at an industrial scale, presenting the opportunity to produce hydrogen and acetic acid with a substantially reduced carbon dioxide footprint.",

          "abstract": "Innovations in the pallium likely facilitated the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities in birds. We therefore scrutinized its cellular composition and evolution using cell type atlases from chicken, mouse, and nonavian reptiles. We found that the avian pallium shares most inhibitory neuron types with other amniotes. Whereas excitatory neuron types in amniote hippocampal regions show evolutionary conservation, those in other pallial regions have diverged. Neurons in the avian mesopallium display gene expression profiles akin to the mammalian claustrum and deep cortical layers, while certain nidopallial cell types resemble neurons in the piriform cortex. Lastly, we observed substantial gene expression convergence between the dorsally located hyperpallium and ventrally located nidopallium during late development, suggesting that topological location does not always dictate gene expression programs determining functional properties in the adult avian pallium.",

Currently, the stability of the most active iridium (Ir) catalysts is impaired by dissolution, redeposition, detachment, and agglomeration of Ir species. Here we present a ripening-induced embedding strategy that securely embeds the Ir catalyst in a cerium oxide support. Cryogenic electron tomography and all-atom kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that synchronizing the growth rate of the support with the nucleation rate of Ir, regulated by sonication, is pivotal for successful synthesis. A PEMWE using this catalyst achieves a cell voltage of 1.72 volts at a current density of 3 amperes per square centimeter with an Ir loading of just 0.3 milligrams per square centimeter and a voltage degradation rate of 1.33 microvolts per hour, as demonstrated by a 6000-hour accelerated aging test.",

We employed in vivo CRISPR-Cas9–based perturbation sequencing to assess the role of ~40 transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modulators in T cell fate decisions. Unexpectedly, we found that knockout of the TF Klf2 resulted in aberrant differentiation to exhausted-like CD8 T cells during acute infection. KLF2 was required to suppress the exhaustion-promoting TF TOX and to enable the TF TBET to drive effector differentiation. KLF2 was also necessary to maintain a polyfunctional tumor-specific progenitor state. Thus, KLF2 provides effector CD8 T cell lineage fidelity and suppresses the exhaustion program.",

Bi 2 O 3 combusts C 2 H 2 with a first-order rate constant that is 3000 times greater than the rate constant for C 2 H 4 combustion. In successive redox cycles, the lattice O of Bi 2 O 3 can be fully replenished without discernible changes in local Bi coordination or C 2 H 2 combustion selectivity. Heterolytic activation of C–H bonds across Bi–O sites and the higher acidity of C 2 H 2 results in lower barriers for C 2 H 2 activation than C 2 H 4 , enabling selective catalytic hydrocarbon combustion leveraging differences in molecular deprotonation energies.",

By comparing the enzymatic and solution reaction, we identified molecular features that provide catalysis and quantified their energetic contributions to catalysis. Serine proteases precisely position their reactants in destabilized conformers, creating a downhill energetic gradient that selectively favors the motions required for reaction while limiting off-pathway conformational states. The same catalytic features have repeatedly evolved in proteases and additional enzymes across multiple distinct structural folds. Our ensemble-function analyses revealed previously unknown catalytic features, provided quantitative models based on simple physical and chemical principles, and identified motifs recurrent in nature that may inspire enzyme design.",

Deployed on 500 hours from the SEEDLingS dataset, HARMONI generates detailed quantitative measurements of 3D human behavior previously unattainable through manual efforts or 2D methods. HARMONI identifies longitudinal trends in child-caregiver interaction, including child movement, body pose, dyadic touch, visibility, and conversational turns. The integrated visual and audio analysis further reveals multimodal trends, including associations between child conversational turns and movement. Open-sourced for large-scale analysis, HARMONI facilitates advancements in human development research. HARMONI achieves 63 to 80% consistency on key attributes with human annotators on SEEDLingS and 84 to 93% consistency on videos taken from a laboratory setting while achieving &gt;100 times savings in time.",

To investigate this, we used an advanced causal inference method to 16 diverse climatic regions in the Philippines. This method is capable of detecting nonlinear and joint effects of temperature and rainfall to dengue incidence. We found that temperature consistently increased dengue incidence throughout all the regions, while rainfall effects differed depending on the variation in dry season length, a factor previously overlooked. Specifically, our results showed that regions with low variation in dry season length experience a negative impact of rainfall on dengue incidence likely due to strong flushing effect on mosquito habitats, while regions with high variation in dry season length experience a positive impact, likely due to increased mosquito breeding sites. Our findings emphasize the need for tailored prevention strategies based on local climate conditions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.",

Here, we demonstrate that a coherent Ising machine (CIM) based on degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) pulses can find solutions to large-scale maximum independent set problems, which is an essential optimization problem that is closely related to real-world optimization tasks. We implemented a stable external field for each Ising spin as an interaction between a DOPO pulse and a group of ferromagnetically coupled auxiliary pulses. Consequently, the CIM delivered independent sets for dense graphs with up to 40,000 nodes. We compared the performance of the CIM with that of optimized simulated annealing algorithm implemented on a digital computer and found that the CIM outperformed the central processing unit (CPU) in terms of the time needed to obtain good approximate solutions when the graph size exceeded several thousand nodes.",

We demonstrated efficient LEDs with controllably tailored emission from n = 3, 4, 5, and ≥7 ALN perovskite NPs with specific and discrete major peaks at 607, 638, 669, and 728 nanometers. These LEDs demonstrated peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.8% and high wavelength reproducibility with less than 1 to 2 nm difference between batches. High color stability without observable EL spectral change and operating stability with the best T 50 of 267 minutes at 1.0 milliampere per square centimeter was also achieved. This work demonstrates a concept of tailoring specific ALN emission with fixed wavelengths, shedding light on efficient, emission-discrete, and color-stable LEDs for next-generation display.",

Recently, this concept has been realized in classical photonic and acoustic systems. However, these implementations are constrained by adiabatic conditions, necessitating long operation distances and hindering practical applications. Here, we conceive and demonstrate shortcut to adiabatic (STA) braiding of light in three-dimensional silicon photonic chips. Our device comprises trilayer silicon waveguides embedded in the SU-8 polymer, using an STA strategy to expedite the braiding operations, resulting in compact devices that function as photonic quantum X, Y, and Z gates. We further experimentally observed non-Abelian braiding behaviors based on this STA-braiding scheme. Our work represents a compact braiding apparatus with a size reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to previous works. This work presents a feasible approach to accelerating adiabatic braiding evolutions, paving the way for compact, CMOS-compatible non-Abelian photonic devices.",

Retromer (VPS26/VPS35/VPS29) binds multiple sorting nexin (SNX) proteins on endosomal membranes, but assembly mechanisms of metazoan SNX/Retromer complexes remain elusive. We combine biochemical and biophysical approaches with AlphaFold modeling to identify a previously unidentified direct interaction between SNX27 and VARP. A full biochemical reconstitution system using purified proteins systematically tests how and when coats are recruited to membranes to generate tubules. We demonstrate and measure how specific combinations of Retromer with SNX27, ESCPE-1 (SNX2/SNX6), or both complexes, remodel membranes containing physiological cargo and phospholipids. SNX27, alone and with Retromer, remodels membranes with PI(3)P and PDZbm cargo. ESCPE-1 deforms membranes with bis-phosphoinositides and CI-MPR cargo but surprisingly does not recruit Retromer. VARP co-immunoprecipitates all coat components in cells and is required to reconstitute a proposed endosomal “supercomplex” (SNX27, ESCPE-1, and Retromer) in vitro. These data suggest VARP regulates metazoan endosomal coat assembly to promote cargo sorting out of endosomes.",

Microtubule reorganization supports plant survival in saline-rich soils, but the underlying molecular mechanism in tree species remains unclear. In this study, we identified a salinity stress response mechanism in hybrid poplar seedlings. This mechanism involves regulation of microtubule dynamics by the microtubule-associated protein PLASMA MEMBRANE–ASSOCIATED CATION BINDING PROTEIN 1a (PagPCaP1a). Salinity stress induced PagPCaP1a expression and phase separation of PagPCaP1a protein to form PagPCaP1a condensates in a calcium-dependent manner. The formation of PagPCaP1a condensates was partially driven by the VEEEKK motif within the carboxyl terminus of the protein, which rapidly depolymerizes microtubules under salinity stress. Our study reveals that the liquid-liquid phase separation of PagPCaP1a represents an additional regulatory layer for microtubule depolymerization, and we propose an effective strategy to manipulate the phase separation of PagPCaP1a to improve plant stress tolerance.",

Here, we investigate changes in permafrost under net-zero and negative emissions, based on idealized emission-driven simulations using a state-of-the-art Earth system model. While acting as a net ecosystem carbon sink during most of the positive emission phase, permafrost becomes a net ecosystem carbon source just before reaching net-zero and negative emissions. Permafrost slowly recovers, especially in regions with high organic carbon content, and net ecosystem carbon loss persists until the end of simulations, resulting in a cumulative net ecosystem carbon loss of approximately 14 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in both scenarios. In addition, methane emissions increase under net-zero and negative emissions, due to the irreversibility of the inundated areas. We conclude that the permafrost ecosystem carbon loss may continue under net-zero and negative emissions, which could hinder climate change mitigation efforts.",

Inspired by this, we report a reprogrammable chemical fluid skin, which achieves deformation through fluids like the skin of a pufferfish and achieves color change function like the skin of a chameleon. Based on the skin, we design a soft mask that allows switching between at least eight human faces at a time. The soft mask is lightweight, thin, and fits the wearer’s head. Its actuation is silent and safe, and can realize facial switching, including facial color and shape. By wearing the soft mask, robots can show facial changes and expression modulation, and humans can change their faces as needed.

To date, model limitations have prevented quantifying climate-lightning-wildfire interactions comprehensively. We exploit advances in Earth System modeling to examine these three-way interactions and their sensitivities to idealized CO 2 forcing in 140-year simulations. Lightning sensitivity to global temperature change (+1.6 ± 0.1% per kelvin) is mitigated by compensating atmospheric effects. Global burned area sensitivity to temperature (+13.8 ± 0.3% per kelvin) is largely driven by intensified fire weather and increased biomass but marginally by lightning changes. We find a universal law characterizing regional-scale modeled fire activity and its CO 2 sensitivity, consistent with basic principles of statistical mechanics. Last, a negative climate feedback through intensified aerosol direct effect from fire emissions reaches an equivalent decrease of 0.91 ± 0.01% in CO 2 radiative forcing. However, this feedback contributes to polar amplification. Our analysis shows that climate-lightning-wildfire interactions involve multiple compensating and amplifying feedbacks, which are sensitive to anthropogenic CO 2 forcing.",

Our approach facilitates rapid approximate solutions with a scalable circuit topology and expedites the high-precision refinement process by substantially reducing the digital-to-analog conversion overhead. We experimentally validated this methodology using a heterogeneous computing system. We performed simulations of multiple scientific problems on these circuits, including solving the diffusion equation and modeling equilibration in silicon P-N junctions. Notably, our memristive solver, combined with digital refinement, achieved software-equivalent precision (with an error of 10 −12 ). Compared to conventional digital processing units, this approach offered a 128-fold improvement in solution speed and a 160-fold reduction in energy consumption.

Here, we critically reevaluate core assumptions of the hard-steps model through the lens of historical geobiology. Specifically, we propose an alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary singularities required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth’s surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps required for human existence, then the timing of human origins was controlled by the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history.",

We demonstrate that our single-molecule assay is able to decode the underlying binding kinetics of aptamers despite their similar binding affinity. Guided by computational simulations and validated with quartz crystal microbalance experiments, we show that the quantitative insights generated by this single-molecule technique enabled the rational understanding of biosensor performance (i.e., the sensitivity and limit of detection). This capability was demonstrated with thrombin as the analyte and the structurally similar aptamers HD1, RE31, and NU172 as the biorecognition elements.

Using a custom antibody, we detected Bgm1 in human and mouse nucleus pulposus, with prominent intracellular expression in notochordal cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that Bgm1 interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6), a key player in ribosome biogenesis. Bgm1 dysregulates eIF6 localization in notochordal cells, affecting nucleocytoplasmic transport. Induced IDD in mice showed elevated nuclear eIF6 expression and reduced Bgm1 in degenerating nucleus pulposus.

Diabetes-associated immune cell dysfunction plays a minor role in the emergence of resistance, while hyperglycemia plays a dominant role facilitating the expansion and takeover of resistant mutants in diabetic infections. Furthermore, vancomycin intermediate resistant isolates display a pronounced fitness defect in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice.

Upon ultrasound stimulation, the Fe-MoS 2 nanocatalyst generates reactive oxygen species and depletes glutathione via synergistic piezocatalytic and enzyocatalytic effects, disrupting copper ion homeostasis and inducing cuproptosis, concurrently triggering ferroptosis and ferritinophagy, which collectively enhances tumor suppression. This study represents the first paradigm to introduce a copper-free piezocatalyst for initiating cuproptosis, substantially advancing the applications of cuproptosis in tumor therapy.",

          "abstract": "The Phanerozoic climate has been interrupted by two long “icehouse” intervals, including the current icehouse of the last ~34 million years. While these cool intervals correspond to lower atmospheric CO 2 , it is unclear why CO 2 levels fell, with hypotheses suggesting changes in CO 2 degassing rates or modification of silicate weathering through changing continental lithology or paleogeography. Here, we construct an Earth System Model that integrates these proposed cooling mechanisms in detail. The model can reproduce the broad geologic record of ice cap expansion, allowing us to infer the primary drivers of long-term climate change. Our results indicate that recent icehouse climates required a combination of different cooling mechanisms acting simultaneously and were not driven by a single known process, potentially explaining why icehouses have been rarer than greenhouses over Earth history.",

We characterized the transcriptional response to chronic GC exposure during neural differentiation and studied the underlying gene regulatory networks by integrating single-cell transcriptomics with chromatin accessibility data. We found lasting cell type–specific changes that included autism risk genes and several transcription factors associated with neurodevelopment. Chronic GC exposure influenced lineage specification primarily by priming the inhibitory neuron lineage through transcription factors like PBX3 .

The EB disruption is accompanied by the alternations in permeability and even the breakdown of tight junctions (TJs), leading to the leakage of albumin; thus, albumin can serve as a biomarker for EB disruption. Herein, we develop an albumin-specific, covalently tagged near-infrared II (NIR-II) dye, with its high selectivity for endogenous albumin, for targeted imaging EB disruption. Our albumin-tagging dye serves as a chromophore to construct NIR-II fluorescent proteins in situ, with substantially improved brightness. Thus, through in situ dye tagging of endogenous albumin as the efficient “targeting agent,” we can precisely image disruptions in various endothelial barriers. Unlike the traditional exogenous targeting agents (e.g., dye-labeled antibodies) with enzymatic degradation or immune system capture issues, in situ albumin tagging demonstrates superhigh performance for targeted imaging.",

We used computational methods to identify 149 sites across the HIV-1 clade B genome under HLA-II–associated selection. Functional assays, including activation-induced intracellular cytokine staining and enzyme-linked immunospot for interferon-γ, revealed diverse mechanisms of HIV-1 adaptation to HLA-II–associated immune pressure, ranging from loss to sustained antigen recognition. T cell receptor and RNA sequencing demonstrated variable clonotype overlap of T cell clones to recognize adapted versus non-adapted peptides, with cells targeting adapted peptides exhibiting a dysfunctional transcriptomic state. Moreover, incorporating HLA-II–associated adaptation strengthened the correlation between Gag-specific viral adaptation and poor disease outcomes.

The MoS 2 channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting. Further, we observe a peculiar nonlinearity at intermediate power regime.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are protective in animal models and humans against several infections, including sepsis and COVID-19; however, the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Here, we mechanistically link two previously described effects of the SSRI fluoxetine in mediating protection against sepsis. We show that fluoxetine-mediated protection is independent of peripheral serotonin and instead increases levels of circulating interleukin-10 (IL-10). IL-10 is necessary for protection from sepsis-induced hypertriglyceridemia, preventing cardiac effects including impairment of glucose oxidation, ectopic lipid accumulation, ventricular stretch and possibly cardiac failure. Our work reveals a beneficial “off-target” effect of fluoxetine, and reveals a protective immunometabolic defense mechanism with therapeutic potential.",

To this end, we leverage cell-cell “NETwork” of neutrophils to deliver SERCA activator-loaded SR-localized nanoparticles (L-P-NPs) to the damaged myocardial cells, following a hierarchical targeting process: (i) chemotactic neutrophils deliver L-P-NPs to ischemia-reperfused heart, achieving tissue level targeting; (ii) neutrophils produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to transport L-P-NPs to injured myocardial cell, achieving cellular level targeting; (iii) L-P-NPs escort therapeutic payloads to the SR, achieving subcellular targeting.

The neuron array can function as double-opponent receptive fields for spatial-chromatic opponent preprocessing to color signals, emulating the neural pathway from the retina to the cortex. With the color spiking preprocessing function of the neuron array, the recognition accuracy is improved almost twofold compared to direct perception of underexposure objects, and the noise robustness is also strengthened.

Here, we explore somatic nonstop mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 Associated Protein 1 ( BAP1 ) and Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) enriched in renal cell carcinoma. For BAP1 , nonstop mutations generate an extremely long extension. Instead of proteasomal degradation, the extension decreases translation and depletes BAP1 messenger RNA from heavy polysomes. For VHL , the short extension leads to proteasomal degradation. Unexpectedly, the mutation alters the selection of the translational start site shifting VHL isoforms. We identify germline VHL nonstop mutations in patients leading to the early onset of severe disease manifestations. In summary, nonstop extension mutations inhibit the expression of renal tumor suppressor genes with pleiotropic effects on translation and protein stability.",

Mechanical force and auxiliary binding partners converge to stabilize the cadherin-catenin complex’s inherently weak binding to actin filaments (F-actin) through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that afadin’s coiled-coil (CC) domain and vinculin synergistically enhance the cadherin-catenin complex’s F-actin engagement. The cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of an E-cadherin–β-catenin–αE-catenin–vinculin–afadin-CC supra-complex bound to F-actin reveals that afadin-CC bridges adjacent αE-catenin actin-binding domains along the filament, stabilizing flexible αE-catenin segments implicated in mechanical regulation. These cooperative binding contacts promote the formation of supra-complex clusters along F-actin. Additionally, cryo-EM variability analysis links supra-complex binding along individual F-actin strands to nanoscale filament curvature, a deformation mode associated with cytoskeletal forces. Collectively, this work elucidates a mechanistic framework by which vinculin and afadin tune cadherin-catenin complex–cytoskeleton coupling to support AJ function across varying mechanical regimes.",

Curiously, their clocks are not permanently lost; exposure to monochromatic blue light restores both circadian gene expression and behavioral rhythms. Conversely, blocking blue light in sighted relatives induces an arrhythmic “cave phenotype.” Our RNA interference experiments suggest that clock genes regulate the rhythmicity of the huddle response, establishing a link between circadian gene networks and this behavioral rhythm. We demonstrate that circadian regulation is readily toggled and may play a latent role, even in constant darkness.

We show that in Arabidopsis mur1 mutant, CWI defects from compromising dimerization of RG-II pectin, a key component of cell wall, attenuate the expression of auxin response factors ARF7-ARF19 . As a result, polar auxin transport components are misexpressed, disrupting auxin response asymmetry, leading to defective apical hook development. Accordingly, mur1 hook defects are suppressed by enhancing ARF7 expression. In addition, expression of brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes is down-regulated in mur1 mutant, and supplementing brassinosteroid or enhancing brassinosteroid signaling suppresses mur1 hook defects. Intriguingly, brassinosteroid enhances RG-II dimerization, showing hormonal feedback to the cell wall. Our results thus reveal a previously unrecognized link between cell wall defects from reduced RG-II dimerization and growth regulation mediated via modulation of auxin-brassinosteroid pathways in early seedling development.",

Our simulations reproduced the energy gain and showed that ions were accelerated mainly by the motional electric field during reflection. The results identify shock drift acceleration as the dominant ion energization mechanism, which is consistent with satellite observation in the Earth’s bow shock. Our observations pave the way for laboratory investigations of the cosmic accelerators, also be beneficial to laser fusion and laser-driven ion accelerator.",

For pediatric IBD (PIBD) patients, wireless, biodegradable miniaturized bioelectronic devices are crucial to prevent neural damage and support neural development during and after therapy. Here we demonstrate a battery-free, miniaturized neurostimulator based on biodegradable materials and capacitive-coupling wireless power transfer. The biodegradable capacitive-coupling (BCC) neurostimulator consists of molybdenum (Mo) electronic components and self-healing biodegradable polyurethane elastomer (SBPUE) encapsulations. The self-healing property of SBPUE enables a stable neural interface. Capacitive coupling wirelessly transfers high-frequency electric fields through a single capacitor between wearable transmitters and implanted BCC neurostimulators. Programmed electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve alleviates PIBD symptoms by restoring CD4 + T cell balance, enhancing anti-inflammatory effects and suppressing pro-inflammatory effects in the intestines.",

However, they are most often reported as case studies, lack integration and standardization, and are therefore hard to objectively compare. In this study, we established a streamlined and diverse toolbox for methods that predict amino acid probabilities inside the Rosetta software framework that allows for the side-by-side comparison of these models. Subsequently, existing protein fitness landscapes were used to benchmark novel ML methods in realistic protein design settings. We focused on the traditional problems of protein design: sampling and scoring. A major finding of our study is that ML approaches are better at purging the sampling space from deleterious mutations. Nevertheless, scoring resulting mutations without model fine-tuning showed no clear improvement over scoring with Rosetta. We conclude that ML now complements, rather than replaces, biophysical methods in protein design.",

Melanoma antigen-A4 (MAGE-A4), a cancer-testis antigen, is expressed in solid tumors and correlates with poor survival, but its role in tumorigenesis and antitumor immunity remains unclear. We found that expression of MAGE-A4 was highly associated with the loss of PTEN , a tumor suppressor, in human non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Here, we show that constitutive expression of human MAGE-A4 with Pten loss in mouse airway epithelia results in metastatic adenocarcinoma. Tumors showed distinct enrichment in IgA + CD138 + CXCR4 + plasma cells (PCs) and increased expression of CXCL12 in endothelial cells. Consistently, human NSCLC expressing MAGE-A4 showed increased CD138 + IgA + PCs surrounding tumors. Abrogation of PCs decreased tumor burden, increased activated T cell infiltration, and reduced CD163 + CD206 + macrophages in the MAGE-A4–induced lung tumors. These findings suggest MAGE-A4 promotes NSCLC tumorigenesis, in part, through the recruitment and retention of IgA + PCs in the lungs.",

The capacity to induce regeneration exogenously is limited and usually confined to meristematic-like tissues. We show that bacterial cellulose (BC), but not other structurally similar matrixes, induces postwounding regeneration in nonmeristematic plant tissues via a distinctive route to callus-mediated regenerative programs. The BC-specific program involves cytokinin operating concurrently with strongly activated plant biotic response genes to induce plant regeneration. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, normally associated with defense responses, is sustained upon BC application, involving a network of tightly interconnected transcription factors, where WRKY8, known for regulating stress responses, shows a clustering and hierarchical prevalence. WRKY8 regulates BC-mediated plant regeneration and ROS homeostasis, including superoxide anion accumulation, to potentially promote cell proliferation after wounding. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the cytokinin- and ROS-associated defense responses can be targeted by BC application to promote plant wound regeneration through alternative regenerative programs.",

Despite excessive accumulation of α-syn being key to the pathogenesis of PD, the mechanisms governing its clearance remain elusive. In this study, we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system plays a crucial role in capturing and facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated α-syn. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin was found to promote K27-linked polyubiquitination of α-syn, directing it to the endosome for subsequent degradation. We showed that the deletion of the Listerin gene exacerbates the neurodegenerative progression in a mouse model of PD, whereas the overexpression of Listerin effectively mitigates disease progression in PD mice. Consequently, our study reveals a mechanism for α-syn degradation and identifies Listerin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.",

Starting with the semiautomated identification of potential specificity-modulating SNVs, our workflow comprises mass spectrometry–based cleavage specificity profiling and substrate identification, localization, and inhibitor studies, followed by functional analyses investigating cancer cell properties. To demonstrate the feasibility of TACAP, we analyzed the meprin β R238Q variant.

Recently demonstrated using phonon polaritons in twisted van der Waals (vdW) layers of α-MoO 3 , it offers unprecedented possibilities for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, practical applications have been hindered by the complex sample fabrication of twisted stacks. In this work, we introduce a previously unexplored canalization phenomenon in a single-thin vdW layer (α-MoO 3 ) interfaced with a substrate exhibiting a given negative permittivity. This enables a proof-of-concept application of polariton canalization: super-resolution nanoimaging (~λ 0 /220). Canalization-based imaging transcends conventional projection constraints, allowing the super-resolution images to be obtained at any desired location in the image plane. This versatility stems from the synergetic manipulation of three key parameters: incident frequency, rotation angle of the thin vdW layer, and thickness. Our results provide insights into the properties of canalization and constitute a seminal step toward multifaceted photonic applications, including imaging, data transmission, and ultracompact photonic integration.",

Phylogenetics identified the fungus as a previously undescribed species, Serendipita cyanobacteriicola , closely related to endophytes, and the cyanobacterium belongs to the family Coleofasciculaceae, representing a genus and species not yet classified, Symbiothallus taiwanensis . These thalli exhibit nitrogen-fixing activity similar to mosses but lower than cyanolichens.

This tension is illustrated at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where two motor inputs that differ in structural and functional properties coinnervate most muscles to coordinate locomotion. To stabilize NMJ activity, motor neurons augment neurotransmitter release following diminished postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). How these distinct inputs contribute to PHP plasticity remains enigmatic. We have used a botulinum neurotoxin to selectively silence each input and resolve their roles in PHP, demonstrating that PHP is input specific: Chronic (genetic) PHP selectively targets the tonic MN-Ib, where active zone remodeling enhances Ca 2+ influx to promote increased glutamate release. In contrast, acute (pharmacological) PHP selectively increases vesicle pools to potentiate phasic MN-Is. Thus, distinct homeostatic modulations in active zone nanoarchitecture, vesicle pools, and Ca 2+ influx collaborate to enable input-specific PHP expression.",

We introduce a novel deformable body fracture mechanics approach and high-resolution strain field imaging to reveal that nonuniform stress distributions cause EA clutches to fail through delamination and crack propagation. Using this insight, we developed EA clutches sustaining 22 newtons over 1 square centimeter at 100 volts, achieving the highest stress per voltage among similar clutches. This was achieved by incorporating a soft interlayer and peeling stopper for uniform stress distribution and mitigating the failure modes. These EA clutches were integrated into a lightweight ring-based wearable system for finger rehabilitation and haptics.

That IgA may amplify postimmune IgG production is suggested by the impaired IgG response to pneumococcal vaccines in some IgA-deficient patients. Here, we found that antipneumococcal but not total IgG production was impaired in mice with IgA deficiency. The positive effect of gut IgA on antipneumococcal IgG responses started very early in life and could implicate gut bacteria, as these responses were attenuated in germ-free mice recolonized with gut microbes from IgA-deficient donors. IgA could exert this effect by constraining the systemic translocation of gut antigens, which was associated with chronic immune activation, including T cell overexpression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibitory receptor may attenuate antipneumococcal IgG production by causing B cell hyporesponsiveness, which improved upon anti–PD-1 treatment.

In this study, we used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with a nickelocene molecule to sense the spin of a hydrogen-loaded nanoscale Co island grown on Cu(111). Magnetic exchange maps obtained from the molecular tip revealed the presence of a hydrogen superstructure and a 90° rotation of the magnetization compared to the pristine island. Ab initio calculations corroborate these observations, indicating that hydrogen hybridization with Co atoms on the island surface drives the spin reorientation of the island. This reorientation is further reinforced by hydrogen penetration into the island that locates at the Co/Cu interface.

Rituximab in vasculitis exacerbates neutralization deficits over standard immunosuppressive therapy, although impairment resolves over time since dosing. We observed discordance between detectable IgG binding and neutralizing activity specifically in the context of rituximab use, with high proportions of individuals showing reasonable IgG titer but no neutralization. ADCC response was more frequently detectable compared to neutralization in the context of rituximab, indicating that a notable proportion of binding antibodies are non-neutralizing.
