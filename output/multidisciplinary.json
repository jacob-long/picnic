          "title": "Measuring racial educational disparities over time amongst top achievers",
          "authors": "Uditi Karna, Min Sok Lee, John A. List, Andrew Simon, Haruka Uchida",
          "abstract": "Educational disparities remain a key contributor to increasing social and wealth inequalities. To address this, researchers and policymakers have focused on average differences between racial groups or differences among students who are falling behind1. This focus potentially leads to educational triage, diverting resources away from high-achieving students, including those from racial minorities2,3. Here we focus on the ‘racial excellence gap’—the difference in the likelihood that students from racial minorities (Black and Hispanic) reach the highest levels of academic achievement compared with their non-minority (white and Asian) peers. There is a shortage of evidence that systematically measures the magnitude of the excellence gap and how it evolves4,5. Using longitudinal, statewide, administrative data, we document eight facts regarding the excellence gap from third grade (typically ages 8–9) to high school (typically ages 14–18), link the stability of excellence gaps and student backgrounds, and assess the efficacy of public policies. We show that excellence gaps in maths and reading are evident by the third grade and grow slightly over time, especially for female students. About one third of the gap is explained by a student’s socioeconomic status, and about one tenth is explained by the school environment. Top-achieving racial minority students are also less likely to persist in excellence as they progress through school. Moreover, state accountability policies that direct additional resources to reduce non-race-based inequality6 had minimal effects on the racial excellence gaps. Documenting these patterns is an important step towards eliminating excellence gaps and removing the ‘racial glass ceiling’.",

          "abstract": "Greenlandic Inuit and other indigenous populations are underrepresented in genetic research1,2, leading to inequity in healthcare opportunities. To address this, we performed analyses of sequenced or imputed genomes of 5,996 Greenlanders with extensive phenotypes. We quantified their historical population bottleneck and how it has shaped their genetic architecture to have fewer, but more common, variable sites. Consequently, we find twice as many high-impact genome-wide associations to metabolic traits in Greenland compared with Europe. We infer that the high-impact variants arose after the population split from Native Americans and thus are Arctic-specific, and show that some of them are common due to not only genetic drift but also selection. We also find that European-derived polygenic scores for metabolic traits are only half as accurate in Greenlanders as in Europeans, and that adding Arctic-specific variants improves the overall accuracy to the same level as in Europeans. Similarly, lack of representation in public genetic databases makes genetic clinical screening harder in Greenlandic Inuit, but inclusion of Greenlandic data remedies this by reducing the number of non-causal candidate variants by sixfold. Finally, we identify pronounced genetic fine structure that explains differences in prevalence of monogenic diseases in Greenland and, together with recent changes in mobility, leads to a predicted future reduction in risk for certain recessive diseases. These results illustrate how including data from Greenlanders can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that migratory animals exploit the magnetic field of the Earth for navigation, both as a compass to determine direction and as a map to determine geographical position1. It has long been proposed that, to navigate using a magnetic map, animals must learn the magnetic coordinates of the destination2,3, yet the pivotal hypothesis that animals can learn magnetic signatures of geographical areas has, to our knowledge, yet to be tested. Here we report that an iconic navigating species, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), can learn such information. When fed repeatedly in magnetic fields replicating those that exist in particular oceanic locations, juvenile turtles learned to distinguish magnetic fields in which they encountered food from magnetic fields that exist elsewhere, an ability that might underlie foraging site fidelity. Conditioned responses in this new magnetic map assay were unaffected by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields, a treatment expected to disrupt radical-pair-based chemical magnetoreception4,5,6, suggesting that the magnetic map sense of the turtle does not rely on this mechanism. By contrast, orientation behaviour that required use of the magnetic compass was disrupted by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields. The findings provide evidence that two different mechanisms of magnetoreception underlie the magnetic map and magnetic compass in sea turtles.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal phenotypic traits such as morphology, connectivity and function are dictated, to a large extent, by a specific combination of differentially expressed genes. Clusters of neurons in transcriptomic space correspond to distinct cell types and in some cases—for example, Caenorhabditis elegans neurons 1 and retinal ganglion cells 2–4 —have been shown to share morphology and function. The zebrafish optic tectum is composed of a spatial array of neurons that transforms visual inputs into motor outputs. Although the visuotopic map is continuous, subregions of the tectum are functionally specialized 5,6 . Here, to uncover the cell-type architecture of the tectum, we transcriptionally profiled its neurons, revealing more than 60 cell types that are organized in distinct anatomical layers. We measured the visual responses of thousands of tectal neurons by two-photon calcium imaging and matched them with their transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, we characterized the morphologies of transcriptionally identified neurons using specific transgenic lines. Notably, we found that neurons that are transcriptionally similar can diverge in shape, connectivity and visual responses. Incorporating the spatial coordinates of neurons within the tectal volume revealed functionally and morphologically defined anatomical subclusters within individual transcriptomic clusters. Our findings demonstrate that extrinsic, position-dependent factors expand the phenotypic repertoire of genetically similar neurons.",

These planets form two populations separated by a natural division at about 1.8 R⊕ termed the radius valley. It is uncertain whether these populations arose from separate dry versus water-rich formation channels, evolved apart because of long-term atmospheric loss or a combination of both5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we report observations of ongoing hydrogen loss from two sibling planets, TOI-776 b (1.85 ± 0.13 R⊕) and TOI-776 c (2.02 ± 0.14 R⊕), the sizes of which near the radius valley and mature (1–4 Gyr) age make them valuable for investigating the origins of the divided population of which they are a part. During the transits of these planets, absorption appeared against the Lyman-α emission of the host star, compatible with hydrogen escape at rates equivalent to 0.03–0.6% and 0.1–0.9% of the total mass per billion years of each planet, respectively. Observations of the outer planet, TOI-776 c, are incompatible with an outflow of dissociated steam, suggesting both it and its inner sibling formed in a dry environment. These observations support the strong role of hydrogen loss in the evolution of close-orbiting sub-Neptunes5,6,7,8,15,16.",

However, the microfibrillar organization of cellulose and its complex interactions with other components of the plant cell wall poses a major challenge for enzymatic conversion4. Here, by mining the metagenomic ‘dark matter’ (unclassified DNA with unknown function) of a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, we discovered a metalloenzyme that oxidatively cleaves cellulose. This metalloenzyme acts on cellulose through an exo-type mechanism with C1 regioselectivity, resulting exclusively in cellobionic acid as a product. The crystal structure reveals a catalytic copper buried in a compact jelly-roll scaffold that features a flattened cellulose binding site. This metalloenzyme exhibits a homodimeric configuration that enables in situ hydrogen peroxide generation by one subunit while the other is productively interacting with cellulose. The secretome of an engineered strain of the fungus Trichoderma reesei expressing this metalloenzyme boosted the glucose release from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This discovery modifies the current understanding of bacterial redox enzymatic systems devoted to overcoming biomass recalcitrance5,6,7. Furthermore, it enables the conversion of agro-industrial residues into value-added bioproducts, thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable and bio-based economy.",

          "abstract": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in plant immunity by sensing pathogen effectors1. In Arabidopsis, certain sensor NLRs function as NADases to catalyse the production of second messengers2,3, which can be recognized by enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) with its partner senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101), to activate helper NLR N requirement gene 1 (NRG1)4. A cryoelectron microscopy structure shows that second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101 mainly contacts the leucine-rich repeat domain of NRG1A to mediate the formation of an induced EDS1–SAG101–NRG1A complex. Structural comparisons show that binding of a second messenger induces conformational changes in EDS1–SAG101, which are recognized by NRG1A, leading to its allosteric activation. We further show that an inhibitory NRG1 family member, NRG1C, efficiently outcompetes NRG1A for binding to second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101. These findings uncover mechanisms for NRG1A activation through its recognition of a modified host EDS1–SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of the activated EDS1–SAG101, thus shedding light on the activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system.",

          "abstract": "The crypt–villus structure of the small intestine serves as an essential protective barrier. The integrity of this barrier is monitored by the complex sensory system of the gut, in which serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells play an important part1,2. These rare sensory epithelial cells surveil the mucosal environment for luminal stimuli and transmit signals both within and outside the gut3,4,5,6. However, whether EC cells in crypts and villi detect different stimuli or produce distinct physiological responses is unknown. Here we address these questions by developing a reporter mouse model to quantitatively measure the release and propagation of serotonin from EC cells in live intestines. Crypt EC cells exhibit a tonic low-level mode that activates epithelial serotonin 5-HT4 receptors to modulate basal ion secretion and a stimulus-induced high-level mode that activates 5-HT3 receptors on sensory nerve fibres. Both these modes can be initiated by the irritant receptor TRPA1, which is confined to crypt EC cells. The activation of TRPA1 by luminal irritants is enhanced when the protective mucus layer is compromised. Villus EC cells also signal damage through a distinct mechanism, whereby oxidative stress activates TRPM2 channels, which leads to the release of both serotonin and ATP and consequent excitation of sensory nerve fibres. This topological segregation of EC cell functionality along the mucosal architecture constitutes a mechanism for the surveillance, maintenance and protection of gut integrity under diverse physiological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Crystal symmetry guides the development of condensed matter. The unique crystal symmetry connecting magnetic sublattices not only distinguishes altermagnetism1,2,3,4,5,6 from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism but also enables it to combine the advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism4,5. Altermagnetic order is essentially a magnetic crystal order7, determined by the magnetic-order (Néel) vector and crystal symmetry. Previous experimental studies have concentrated on manipulating the altermagnetic symmetry by tuning the Néel vector orientations8,9,10,11,12. However, manipulation of the crystal symmetry, which holds great promise for manipulating the altermagnetic order, remains challenging. Here we realize the manipulation of altermagnetic order in chromium antimonide (CrSb) films via crystal symmetry. The locking between the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector and the magnetic space symmetry helps to reconstruct the altermagnetic order, from a collinear Néel vector to a canted one. It generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnet. The relative direction between the current-induced spin polarization and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector determines the switching modes of altermagnetic order, that is, parallel for the field-assisted mode in CrSb\\((1\\bar{1}00)\\)/Pt and non-parallel for the field-free mode in W/CrSb\\((11\\bar{2}0)\\). The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector induces an asymmetric energy barrier in the field-assisted mode and generates an asymmetric driving force in the field-free mode. In particular, the latter is guaranteed by the emerging Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya torque in altermagnets. Reconstructing crystal symmetry adds a new twist to the manipulation of altermagnetic order. It not only underpins the magnetic-memory and nano-oscillator technology4,5 but also inspires crossover studies between altermagnetism and other research topics.",

          "abstract": "The biogenic structures produced by termites, ants and earthworms provide key functions across global ecosystems1,2. However, little is known about the drivers of the soil engineering effects caused by these small but important invertebrates3 at the global scale. Here we show, on the basis of a meta-analysis of 12,975 observations from 1,047 studies on six continents, that all three taxa increase soil macronutrient content, soil respiration and soil microbial and plant biomass compared with reference soils. The effect of termites on soil respiration and plant biomass, and the effect of earthworms on soil nitrogen and phosphorus content, increase with mean annual temperature and peak in the tropics. By contrast, the effects of ants on soil nitrogen, soil phosphorus, plant biomass and survival rate peak at mid-latitude ecosystems that have the lowest primary productivity. Notably, termites and ants increase plant growth by alleviating plant phosphorus limitation in the tropics and nitrogen limitation in temperate regions, respectively. Our study highlights the important roles of these invertebrate taxa in global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. Given the importance of these soil-engineering invertebrates, biogeochemical models should better integrate their effects, especially on carbon fluxes and nutrient cycles.",

          "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, which is strongly associated with obesity1, causing sensory loss and, in some patients, neuropathic pain2,3. Although the onset and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is linked with dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia4, the contribution of inflammation to peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis has not been investigated. Here we used a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD), which induces obesity and prediabetic metabolic changes, to study the onset of peripheral neuropathy. Mice fed the HFHFD developed persistent heat hypoalgesia after 3 months, but a reduction in epidermal skin nerve fibre density manifested only at 6 months. Using single-cell sequencing, we found that CCR2+ macrophages infiltrate the sciatic nerves of HFHFD-fed mice well before axonal degeneration is detectable. These infiltrating macrophages share gene expression similarities with nerve-crush-induced macrophages5 and express neurodegeneration-associated microglial marker genes6, although there is no axon loss or demyelination. Inhibiting the macrophage recruitment by genetically or pharmacologically blocking CCR2 signalling resulted in more severe heat hypoalgesia and accelerated skin denervation, as did deletion of Lgals3, a gene expressed in recruited macrophages. Recruitment of macrophages into the peripheral nerves of obese prediabetic mice is, therefore, neuroprotective, delaying terminal sensory axon degeneration by means of galectin 3. Potentiating and sustaining early neuroprotective immune responses in patients could slow or prevent peripheral neuropathy.",

We highlight these themes primarily as they relate to neurological diseases, the control of immunity, and the regulation of complex behaviours. We also consider the importance and challenges linked to the study of the neuroimmune connectome, which is defined as the totality of neuroimmune interactions in the body, because this provides a conceptual framework to identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Finally, we discuss how the latest techniques can advance our understanding of the neuroimmune connectome, and highlight the outstanding questions in the field.",

Although they have feathered wings, the known Jurassic birds are more similar to non-avialan theropods in having the ancestral long reptilian tail9,10,11. This is in stark contrast to most Cretaceous and crownward taxa, which have a short tail that terminates in a compound bone called the pygostyle12,13,14. Here we report on the oldest short-tailed avialan, Baminornis zhenghensis gen. et sp. nov., from the recently discovered Late Jurassic Zhenghe Fauna15, which fills a noticeable spatio-temporal gap in the earliest branching avialan fossil record. B. zhenghensis exhibits a unique combination of derived ornithothoracine-like pectoral and pelvic girdles and plesiomorphic non-avialan maniraptoran hand, demonstrating mosaic evolution along stem avialan line. An avialan furcula collected from the same locality is referrable to ornithuromorphs on the basis of our morphometric and phylogenetic analyses. These newly discovered fossils demonstrate the early appearance of highly derived bird features, and together with an anchiornithine fossil from the same locality, they suggest an earlier origin of birds and a radiation of early birds in the Jurassic.",

Here we report a low-cost, green-solvent-based holistic recycling strategy to restore all valuable components from perovskite PV waste. We develop an efficient aqueous-based perovskite recycling approach that can also rejuvenate degraded perovskites. We further extend the scope of recycling to charge-transport layers, substrates, cover glasses and metal electrodes. After repeated degradation–recycling processes, the recycled devices show similar efficiency and stability compared with the fresh devices. Our holistic recycling strategy reduces by 96.6% resource depletion and by 68.8% human toxicity (cancer effects) impacts associated with perovskite PVs compared with the landfill treatment. With recycling, the levelized cost of electricity also decreases for both utility-scale and residential systems.

In mice, aggressive behaviour can be broken down into an appetitive phase, which involves approach and investigation, and a consummatory phase, which involves biting, kicking and wrestling1. Here, by performing an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis on whole-brain FOS expression in mice, we identify a cluster of brain regions, including hypothalamic and amygdalar subregions and olfactory cortical regions, that are highly co-activated in male but not in female aggressors. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (COApl)—an extended olfactory structure—was found to be a hub region, on the basis of the number and strength of correlations with other regions in the cluster. Our data also show that oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing cells in the COApl (COAplEsr1) exhibit increased activity during attack behaviour and during bouts of investigation that precede an attack, in male mice only. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of COAplEsr1 cells in male aggressors reduces aggression and increases pro-social investigation without affecting social reward and reinforcement behaviour. We further show that COAplEsr1 projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala are necessary for these behaviours. Collectively, these data suggest that, in aggressive males, COAplEsr1 cells respond specifically to social stimuli, thereby enhancing their salience and promoting attack behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters contain vast amounts of hot ionized gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM is shorter than the age of the cluster. However, the absence of line emission associated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source1,2. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (‘sloshing’) motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for heat distribution from the outside of the core3,4. Here we present X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy, with velocities from 130 km s−1 to 310 km s−1 within about 30 kpc of the centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. Although the bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre, it could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be only ≲120 km s−1 in the core, even within about 10 kpc of the AGN. This suggests that the influence of the AGN on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster.",

          "abstract": "Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors sense pathogen effectors and form resistosomes to confer immunity1. Some sensor NLR resistosomes produce small molecules to induce formation of a heterotrimer complex with two lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and SAG101, and a helper NLR called NRG1 (refs. 2,3). Activation of sensor NLR resistosomes also triggers NRG1 oligomerization and resistosome formation at the plasma membrane4,5. We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A heterotrimer formation is stabilized by the AtNRG1A loss-of-oligomerization mutant L134E5,6. We report structures of AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A L134E and AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1C heterotrimers with similar assembly mechanisms. AtNRG1A signalling is activated by the interaction with the AtEDS1–AtSAG101 heterodimer in complex with their small-molecule ligand. The truncated AtNRG1C maintains core interacting domains of AtNRG1A but develops further interactions with AtEDS1–AtSAG101 to outcompete AtNRG1A. Moreover, AtNRG1C lacks an N-terminal signalling domain and shows nucleocytoplasmic localization, facilitating its sequestration of AtEDS1–AtSAG101, which is also nucleocytoplasmic. Our study shows the activation and inhibition mechanisms of a plant helper NLR.",

          "abstract": "Zinc is emerging as a key material for next-generation biodegradable implants1,2,3,4,5. However, its inherent softness limits its use in load-bearing orthopaedic implants. Although reducing the grain size of zinc can make it stronger, it also destabilizes its mechanical properties and thus makes it less durable at body temperature6. Here we show that extruded Zn alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased while maintaining a basal texture. In this inverse Hall–Petch effect, the dominant deformation mode changes from inter-granular grain boundary sliding and dynamic recrystallization at the original grain size to intra-granular pyramidal slip and unusual twinning at the increased grain size. The role of the anomalous twins, termed ‘accommodation twins’ in this work, is to accommodate the altered grain shape in the plane lying perpendicular to the external loading direction, in contrast to the well-known ‘mechanical twins’ whose role is to deliver plasticity along the external loading direction7,8. The strength level achieved in these dilute zinc alloys is nearly double those of biodegradable implants made of magnesium alloys—making them the strongest and most stable biodegradable alloys available, to our knowledge, for fabricating bone fixation implants.",

In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are theoretically contested1,2,3,4 and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude5,6. Here we present a method to directly access this quantity by precisely measuring the energy width of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the radioactive decay of beryllium-7. The final state in the decay process contains a recoiling lithium-7 nucleus, which is entangled with an electron neutrino at creation. The lithium-7 energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding beryllium-7 radioisotopes into a high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. Under this approach, we set a lower limit on the Heisenberg spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter of 6.2 pm, which implies that the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first, to our knowledge, direct lower limit on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket is extracted. These results may have implications in several areas including the theoretical understanding of neutrino properties, the nature of localization in weak nuclear decays and the interpretation of neutrino physics data.",

          "abstract": "Lithium (Li) ions are central to the energy storing functionality of rechargeable batteries1. Present technology relies on sophisticated Li-inclusive electrode materials to provide Li ions and exactingly protect them to ensure a decent lifetime2. Li-deficient materials are thus excluded from battery design, and the battery fails when active Li ions are consumed3. Our study breaks this limit by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy. This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases. This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly. We leveraged machine learning to discover such functional salts and identified lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3) with optimal electrochemical activity, potential, product formation, electrolyte solubility and specific capacity. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated a 3.0 V, 1,192 Wh kg−1 Li-free cathode, chromium oxide, in the anode-less cell, as well as an organic sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode incorporated in a 388 Wh kg−1 pouch cell with a 440-cycle life. These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the lifetime of commercial LiFePO4 batteries was extended by at least an order of magnitude. With repeated external Li supplies, a commercial graphite|LiFePO4 cell displayed a capacity retention of 96.0% after 11,818 cycles.",

          "abstract": "The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt (TeV) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena1,2,3. Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea4, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. We detect a muon with an estimated energy of \\(12{0}_{-60}^{+110}\\) petaelectronvolts (PeV). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now5,6,7 falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe.",

          "abstract": "Cancer mutations can create neomorphic protein–protein interactions to drive aberrant function 1,2 . As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma 3 , the most common embryonal brain tumour in children 4 . These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST 5 . However, their mechanism remains unresolved. Here we establish that KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2 as the direct target of the mutant substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we chart the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat β-propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 β-propellers is stabilized by the medulloblastoma mutations, which insert a bulky side chain into the HDAC1 active site pocket. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3–neosubstrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, we unveil a converging shape-complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4–HDAC1 interface and proliferation of KBTBD4-mutant medulloblastoma cells. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein–protein interactions.",

          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein 1,2 . Utrophin ( UTRN ), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD , is upregulated in some DMD patients 3–5 . To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMD PTC minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD , aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMD patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation 6–8 plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMD patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation via transcriptional adaptation. ",

So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries2. Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in functional genomics and human cellular models have substantially enhanced our understanding of the structure and regulation of the human genome. However, our grasp of the molecular functions of human genes remains incomplete and biased towards specific gene classes. The Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) Consortium aims to address this gap by creating a comprehensive catalogue of the molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with null alleles of all human genes using in vitro multicellular systems. In this Perspective, we present the strategic vision of the MorPhiC Consortium and discuss various strategies for generating null alleles, as well as the challenges involved. We describe the cellular models and scalable phenotypic readouts that will be used in the consortium’s initial phase, focusing on 1,000 protein-coding genes. The resulting molecular and cellular data will be compiled into a catalogue of null-allele phenotypes. The methodologies developed in this phase will establish best practices for extending these approaches to all human protein-coding genes. The resources generated—including engineered cell lines, plasmids, phenotypic data, genomic information and computational tools—will be made available to the broader research community to facilitate deeper insights into human gene functions.",

Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells 4,5 . Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte–neuron metabolite shuttle 6 . Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential.",

Those methods that provide efficient access to structural alternatives for aromatic compounds (i.e., saturated arene bioisosteres), have become highly coveted.1,2,3,4 The incorporation of such bioisosteres typically leads to favorable drug-like properties and represents an emerging field of research. Here, we report a new synthetic method that furnishes one especially coveted motif, the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold,5,6 using mild reaction conditions and an operationally-simple protocol. The methodology proceeds via the uncommon coupling of two strained fragments: transiently-generated cyclic allenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, which possess considerable strain energies of ~30 kcal/mol7 and ~60 kcal/mol,6 respectively. The reaction is thought to proceed via a σ-bond insertion through a diradical pathway. However, rather than requiring an external stimulus to generate radical species, reactivity is thought to arise as a result of innate diradical character present in each reactant. This diradicaloid character,8 an underutilized parameter in reaction design, arises from the severe geometric distortions of each reactant. Our studies provide a means to access functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes of value for drug discovery, underscore how geometric distortion of reactants can be used to enable uncommon modes of reactivity, and should encourage the further exploration and strategic use of diradicaloids in chemical synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Granzymes are a family of serine proteases mainly expressed by CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and innate-like lymphocytes1. Although their primary function is thought to be the induction of cell death in virally infected and tumor cells, accumulating evidence indicates certain granzymes can elicit inflammation by acting on extracellular substrates1. Recently, we found that the majority of tissue CD8+ T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium and in inflamed organs across other diseases express granzyme K (GZMK)2, a tryptase-like protease with poorly defined function. Here, we show that GZMK can activate the complement cascade by cleaving C2 and C4. The nascent C4b and C2b fragments form a C3 convertase that cleaves C3, enabling assembly of a C5 convertase that cleaves C5. The resulting convertases generate all the effector molecules of the complement cascade: the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, the opsonins C4b and C3b, and the membrane attack complex. In RA synovium, GZMK is enriched in regions with abundant complement activation, and fibroblasts are the major producers of complement proteins that serve as substrates for GZMK-mediated complement activation. Further, Gzmk-deficient mice have less severe arthritis and dermatitis with concomitant decreases in complement activation. Our findings describe the discovery of a previously unidentified mechanism of complement activation that is entirely driven by lymphocyte-derived GZMK. Given the widespread abundance of GZMK-expressing T cells in tissues in chronic inflammatory diseases, GZMK-mediated complement activation is likely to be an important contributor to tissue inflammation in multiple disease contexts.",

Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus 1 , but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, ‘state cells’). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence.",

Owing to its distinct molecular structure and flexible hydrogen bonds that readily adapt to a wide range of pressures and temperatures, water forms numerous crystalline and amorphous phases4–6. Most relevant for the high pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors is ice VII4, and simulations have identified along its melting curve the existence of a so-called plastic phase7–12 where individual molecules occupy fixed positions as in a solid yet are able to rotate as in a liquid. Such plastic ice has not yet been directly observed in experiments. Here, we present quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements, conducted at temperatures between 450 and 600 K and pressures up to 6 GPa, that reveal the existence of a body centered cubic (bcc) structure, as found in ice VII, with water molecules exhibiting picosecond rotational dynamics typical for liquid water. Comparison with molecular dynamics simulations indicates that this plastic ice VII does not conform to a free rotor phase but rather exhibits rapid orientational jumps, as observed in jump-rotor plastic crystals13,14. We anticipate that our observation of plastic ice VII will impact our understanding of the geodynamics of icy planets and the differentiation processes of large icy moons.",

By co-opting KBTBD4, a substrate receptor of the CUL3–RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, UM171 promotes the degradation of the LSD1–CoREST corepressor complex, thereby limiting haematopoietic stem cell attrition 2,3 . However, the direct target and mechanism of action of UM171 remain unclear. Here we show that UM171 acts as a molecular glue to induce high-affinity interactions between KBTBD4 and HDAC1/2 to promote corepressor degradation. Through proteomics and chemical inhibitor studies, we identify the principal target of UM171 as HDAC1/2. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of dimeric KBTBD4 bound to UM171 and the LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST complex identifies an asymmetric assembly in which a single UM171 molecule enables a pair of KELCH-repeat propeller domains to recruit the HDAC1 catalytic domain. One KBTBD4 propeller partially masks the rim of the HDAC1 active site, which is exploited by UM171 to extend the E3–neosubstrate interface. The other propeller cooperatively strengthens HDAC1 binding through a distinct interface. The overall CoREST–HDAC1/2–KBTBD4 interaction is further buttressed by the endogenous cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate, which acts as a second molecular glue. The functional relevance of the quaternary complex interaction surfaces is demonstrated by base editor scanning of KBTBD4 and HDAC1 . By delineating the direct target of UM171 and its mechanism of action, we reveal how the cooperativity offered by a dimeric CRL3 E3 can be leveraged by a small molecule degrader.",

          "abstract": "The use of reactive supports to disperse metal species is crucial for constructing highly efficient interfacial catalysts, by tuning the competitive reactant adsorption–activation pattern in supported metal catalysts into a non-competitive mechanism1,2,3. However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications4. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/γ-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of γ-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of \\(\\mathrm{24,500}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\).

          "abstract": "Elizabeth Holmes (second from left) was convicted of conspiracy and defrauding investors in her company, Theranos, after overhyping the science behind her work.Credit: Nic Coury/AP/Alamy\n\nSharing scientific discoveries requires as much care as uncovering them, a fact I didn’t fully appreciate until I moved from academia to public relations. Missteps in communication — whether intentional or not — can undermine trust and even harm the reputation of entire fields.\n\nI started working in science communication as a postdoctoral fellow at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), and I spent time in the policy and communications office at the NIH’s National Institute of Nursing Research. When the COVID-19 pandemic shut down non-urgent research on the NIH campus, I decided to start exploring careers in communication. I took a position supporting medical and scientific communications for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, which funds US biomedical research. In 2021, I transitioned into public relations through an account role at an agency called LifeSci Communications, in New York City; a year later, I shifted to specialize in scientific storytelling at Syneos Health Communications, also in New York.\n\nIn public relations, we shape how people perceive a company or a product, working across many communication platforms: websites, press releases, social media and more. In my role, I focus on creating a compelling narrative to help biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies communicate their scientific approach to investors, the media and consumers. For me, distilling complex topics into messages that resonate is a welcome challenge.\n\nWhether helping a client to explain why the science behind their treatment is unique, or combating vaccine misinformation, I’ve found that the temptation to misrepresent, inflate or otherwise hype data is ever present, as are the dangers that come with doing so.\n\nConsider Theranos, the biotech start-up in Palo Alto, California. The company’s bold claims about revolutionizing blood testing captured public and investor interest, but its refusal to acknowledge technical limitations or share transparent data led to one of the most notorious scandals in science and technology. Ultimately, the company was shut down in 2018, and founder Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud in 2022.\n\n‘Blood, sweat and tears’: Building a network for Black scientists\n\nThe fallout left scientists questioning whether the benefits of other scientific innovations had been over-inflated, and many called for more rigorous peer-reviewed evidence before funding new ventures. This ripple effect shows the stakes of miscommunication – it can undermine public trust in legitimate breakthroughs, spinning fact into fiction.\n\nThe temptation to ‘sell out’ is present across the science-communications industry, in which the pressure to stand out might overshadow the responsibility to communicate with integrity. Overselling findings, cherry-picking data or making claims that the evidence does not yet support can seem like a quick route to funding or to recognition. But these shortcuts come at a cost: eroded trust, scepticism about future work and, in some cases, damage to a field’s reputation.\n\nKisha Greer works in public relations, helping companies to honestly and ethically communicate their scientific approach.Credit: Julia Johnson Photography\n\nThe lessons from Theranos are clear: hype and secrecy are a dangerous combination. But how can scientists avoid these pitfalls and communicate their work responsibly? Here are some strategies for selling science without crossing the line into spin.\n\nSet realistic expectations\n\nScience is inherently exciting; it offers new possibilities and solutions to pressing challenges. But that excitement should never come at the expense of honesty. Research is rarely foolproof, and overselling it by exaggerating its impact or downplaying its limitations can backfire, leading to disappointment and scepticism when the full picture emerges.\n\nOne way to set realistic expectations is to ask yourself, “If this statement was taken out of context in a headline, would it still accurately represent the research?” This exercise helps to identify overly broad or optimistic phrases, which should be replaced with precise, contextual language such as ‘early-stage research’ or ‘preclinical findings’.\n\nAnother approach is to emphasize the scientific journey rather than just the destination. Instead of saying, “On the basis of the early clinical data, this treatment could cure cancer,” highlight the next step forwards: “Early clinical data suggest this treatment has the potential to improve outcomes for people with cancer. To explore this further, we’ve initiated a phase II study to better understand its effects and expect to see initial results by the end of the next year.” This statement highlights progress while acknowledging that the research is ongoing.\n\nClear communication ensures that audiences understand the iterative nature of science. Research evolves. Setting realistic expectations from the start fosters trust and enthusiasm that will last beyond the initial headlines.\n\nKnow your audience’s needs\n\nA message that resonates with one group might fall flat with another. Tailoring communication to your audience is critical.\n\nFor instance, if you’re writing a grant application for research on stem-cell responses to traumatic brain injury (TBI), focus on feasibility, potential impact and measurable goals to show how the work could fill a gap in TBI treatments. When presenting your findings at a scientific conference, highlight the methodologies and technical details that underpin your results. Discuss, for example, which imaging techniques were used to track the integration of stem cells and the strategies for quantifying stem-cell responses.\n\nIf, instead, you are communicating to the general public, focus on why your research matters to society and what people can expect as a result. Avoid boring them with too many technical details. This might require simplifying your message, so that more people can understand it: “My research explores how the brain can heal itself by using its own cells to repair damage.”\n\nBy aligning your message with your audience’s needs, you can prevent misunderstandings and ensure that the most relevant information comes through. Clear, targeted messaging builds credibility, creating a foundation for long-term engagement.\n\nUse data transparently to build trust\n\nTransparency is more than an ethical responsibility; it’s the foundation of trust. People respect honesty, especially when it includes uncertainties and setbacks.\n\nData are at the core of science and should be used thoughtfully and generously to support your points. Highlighting only favourable results can give a skewed picture of the research, leading audiences to overestimate its impact. Instead, aim for a balanced view, showing both supportive and contrasting data and acknowledging any limitations.\n\nWhen preparing to present data, I often start by asking, “What’s the most important takeaway, and what context does the audience need to fully understand it?” For example, if a study on Parkinson’s disease showed positive results in a small subgroup of participants with mild neurocognitive decline but mixed outcomes in the overall study group, craft your messaging to reflect that variability.\n\nEmphasize how the findings added to the scientific understanding of the disease. Rather than focusing solely on the positive results found in the subgroup, this approach provides the context needed to position the study as an important step forwards without overstating its immediate implications for people with Parkinson’s.\n\nSuch transparency builds trust with your audience and amplifies the impact of your science.",

Some 47,500 people have been killed as a result of Israel’s retaliation. These figures are according to data reported to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nResearchers and specialists in humanitarian assistance estimate that 90% of Gaza’s 2.2-million population is homeless. Systems ensuring food, supplies, water, sanitation, education, health care, energy and the broader economy have been destroyed or are critically endangered, requiring rebuilding.\n\nAnother urgent need, the researchers say, is removal of debris from bomb damage. According to a preliminary assessment by the UN Environment Programme published in June, for every square metre of the Gaza Strip, there is an estimated 100 kilogrammes of debris, such as concrete, iron and steel, as well as residue from exploded and unexploded bombs, asbestos and human remains.\n\n“More than 97% of Gaza’s water comes from a groundwater aquifer,” says Ahmed Hilles, head of the National Institute for Environment and Development in Gaza. “The porosity [of the aquifer’s layers] is very high, so the potential of [groundwater] contamination is also very high,” he adds.\n\nUniversities, too, will need to be rebuilt. Fifteen of Gaza’s 21 universities, university-colleges and community colleges have been either severely damaged or destroyed, according to September data from the UN science and cultural agency UNESCO.\n\nIn a written response sent to Nature, an Israel Defense Forces representative explained that, as part of its efforts to dismantle Hamas’s military capabilities, “there has been an operational need, among other things, to strike or raid buildings” where Hamas “placed some of its terror infrastructure”. The representative added: “Hamas systematically uses public buildings that are supposed to be used for civilian purposes only, including educational institutions and universities.”\n\nSewage in the streets\n\nEven before the war, just 10% of Gazans had access to safe water. That is now 4%. Thirty per cent have access to a sewage network, compared with 70% pre-war, according to a November report of Gaza's reconstruction needs1 authored by Hilles who also lectured at Al-Azhar University in Gaza. “There is sewage water collected in the streets. Repairing the sewage system is urgent, so people will not get water-borne diseases,” Elessi adds.\n\nAround half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are not functioning, and the rest are only partially operational, according to the World Health Organization. Gazans are experiencing high rates of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, skin rash, scabies and viral hepatitis, according to a study co-authored by Abuzerr, published last November2.\n\n“We have 350,000 patients with chronic diseases who have not been followed for the last 16 months. We have 11,000 cancer patients,” says Elessi. “They are all in pain and deteriorating because there is no therapy nor referral abroad. These patients should be dealt with urgently.”\n\n‘Expedite reconstruction’\n\nElMashharawi studied the impact of displacement on almost 200 staff members at her university. “Establishing temporary shelters and expediting the reconstruction of houses is a top priority,” she says.\n\nAya ElMashharawi: ‘I remain committed to my academic journey.’Credit: Aya ElMashharawi- UCAS\n\n“Four floors above us were bombed, killing 30 people,” says ElMashharawi, who is now in the Nuseirat refugee camp. “It was an incredibly terrifying experience that I can’t even describe, but by the grace of God, we survived,” she recalls.",

          "title": "Your brain is full of microplastics: are they harming you?",
          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "A sliver of human brain in a small vial starts to melt as lye is added to it. Over the next few days, the caustic chemical will break down the neurons and blood vessels within, leaving behind a grisly slurry containing thousands of tiny plastic particles.\n\nToxicologist Matthew Campen has been using this method to isolate and track the microplastics — and their smaller counterparts, nanoplastics — found in human kidneys, livers and especially brains. Campen, who is at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, estimates that he can isolate about 10 grams of plastics from a donated human brain; that’s about the weight of an unused crayon.\n\nMicroplastics have been found just about everywhere that scientists have looked: on remote islands, in fresh snow in Antarctica, at the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific, in food, in water and in the air that we breathe. And scientists such as Campen are finding them spread throughout the human body.\n\nLandmark study links microplastics to serious health problems\n\nDetection is only the first step, however. Determining precisely what these plastics are doing inside people and whether they’re harmful has been much harder. That’s because there’s no one ‘microplastic’. They come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes and chemical compositions, each of which could affect cells and tissues differently.\n\nThis is where Campen’s beige sludge comes into play. Despite microplastics’ ubiquity, it’s difficult to determine which microplastics people are exposed to, how they’re exposed and which particles make their way into the nooks and crannies of the body. The samples that Campen collects from cadavers can, in turn, be used to test how living tissues respond to the kinds of plastic that people carry around with them.\n\n“Morbidly speaking, the best source I can think of to get good, relevant microplastics is to take an entire human brain and digest it,” says Campen.\n\nThe world is hungry for data — German consumers rated microplastics in food as their top environmental-health concern in 2023, for example. And negotiations on a global treaty that could cap plastics production are under way. Findings have trickled out slowly, hampered by insufficient analytical methods, contamination risks and a lack of collaboration between scientists in different fields. “There’s no cookbook at this point. There’s no manual of standard operating procedures,” says Kathleen Egan, a cancer researcher at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. “We’re having to make them up as we go, and it’s a process.”\n\nBut there are signs that scientists are ironing out these kinks, and that the field is maturing. Campen is one of a cadre of researchers developing unconventional methods and forming teams of interdisciplinary scientists. They are caught in a race against time. Plastics production, which began less than a century ago, reaches an all-time high each year, and the material takes hundreds, if not thousands, of years to degrade, which will create trillions of microplastics in the process.\n\n“There are microplastics everywhere,” says Bart Koelmans, an environmental chemist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. “We cannot run away from them.”\n\nPiling up\n\nThe term microplastics was coined 20 years ago, but only in the past 10 years have researchers progressed from studying the particles in the environment and animals to gauging their effects on human health, says Martin Wagner, a biologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “It’s a young field,” he says.\n\nCampen’s team has already found grim results: as the number of plastics created has increased sharply, so too has the concentration of microplastics found in the brain, liver and kidneys, according to his group’s results published in Nature Medicine this month1. On average, microplastic levels were about 50% higher in brain samples from 2024 than in 2016 samples. And brain samples contained up to 30 times more microplastics than samples from a person’s liver and kidneys.\n\nAir pollution and brain damage: what the science says\n\nAnother study published in January2 might offer clues as to how the particles congregate. Researchers fed mice water laced with microplastics and tracked the movements of the particles through the bodies of the mice. The researchers found that the plastics were gobbled up by immune cells, and ended up piling up in and blocking small blood vessels in the brain.\n\nWhat plastics do to human organs is subject to intense study. When scientists add microplastics to human tissue samples in the laboratory, it can result in cell death, immune reactions and tissue damage. And hundreds of studies have exposed animals — mainly aquatic organisms — to microplastics and found that the particles can clog their guts or hinder their ability to reproduce. On the basis of these findings, researchers suspect that these particles could be linked to cancer3, heart4 and kidney disease5, Alzheimer’s disease6 or fertility issues7 in people.\n\nBut there is no evidence yet that microplastics directly cause poor health in humans — only data that show a link. A landmark study4, published in March 2024, reported that nearly 60% of about 250 people who were undergoing heart surgery had micro- or nanoplastics in a main artery. Those who did were 4.5 times more likely to experience a heart attack, a stroke or death in the three years after the surgery than were those whose arteries were plastic-free.\n\nBut, as the authors of the study acknowledge, the presence of plastic might correlate with other factors that would influence health, such as diet or socio-economic status.\n\nShifting sands\n\nThe field has grown in the past decade: for example, in 2014, there were 20 papers published that include the keyword ‘microplastics’ listed in Elsevier’s Scopus database. Nearly 6,000 were published in 2024. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued its first grant with the word ‘microplastics’ only seven years ago — in 2018. Since then, the agency has funded more than 45 projects.\n\nBut as money comes in and interest grows, researchers are still developing methods. This burst of innovation is exciting, says Phoebe Stapleton, a toxicologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, who studies the effects of plastics during pregnancy. But it also means that each team of scientists is developing and using different analytical approaches to detect and characterize microplastics. And there haven’t been many studies analysing each method’s reliability or validity.\n\nSamples of the types of microplastic that have been found in the Atlantic Ocean.Credit: Sophie Dingwall/eXXpedition\n\nThis lack of standardization makes it difficult to do a head-to-head comparison of studies by different groups, says Eliseo Castillo, a mucosal immunologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque who studies the particles’ effects on the digestive and immune systems.\n\nFor example, many studies use pristine microplastics — such as small spheres — that are not representative of the diversity of particles found in the environment. Some researchers argue that they are the most readily available and standardized set of microplastics available to use, whereas others say that they’re a waste of money because they are so different from what people are exposed to. “We defend our areas like crazy”, Campen says, and that can ultimately hinder the search for conclusive data. There are numerous variables in the plastics themselves, including size, shape and composition. And many are coated with one of more than 10,000 chemical additives to make them more flexible, flame retardant or degradable. Furthermore, plastics might affect each organ or cell type differently. A sharp microplastic fragment might be more damaging in the fragile lung environment than in the throat, for example.\n\nThe dose matters, too, as well as the route of ingestion, says Alison Elder, an inhalation toxicologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. “The inhalation route is a major concern because if inhaled plastics can get into the deep lung and cause an inflammatory reaction, they don’t need to go anywhere to cause health outcomes,” she says.\n\nWhile the field develops tools and works out the strengths and weaknesses of each one, it will be important for researchers to use multiple methods to confirm the characteristics of the particles that they’re finding, Stapleton says.\n\nMicro to nano\n\nOf particular concern are the smallest of plastics that get inhaled and ingested, says Stephanie Wright, an environmental toxicologist at Imperial College London. Particles of less than 1 micrometre across (see ‘Microplastics to scale’) have earned the name nanoplastics (some argue for a smaller cut-off of around 0.1 micrometres). Depending on the ingestion route, some data suggest that many particles larger than this pass through the digestive system and are excreted. Nanoplastics, however, might be taken into cells, in which the body doesn’t have established mechanisms to digest or expel them.\n\nSource (tools and costs): S. Primpke et al. Appl. Spectrosc. 74, 1012–1047 (2020).\n\nStapleton and her colleagues, for example, have found that during pregnancy the placenta does not serve as a barrier to nanoparticles in rats, and that nanoplastics cross from mother to fetus — and are quickly dispersed in fetal tissue8. It will be important to understand what the particles are doing there, Stapleton says, especially because they take up a disproportionate amount of space in a fetus compared with in a fully-grown adult.",

          "abstract": "From CRISPR gene editing to protein-structure predictions driven by artificial intelligence, great innovations stem from interdisciplinary research. Solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss, health inequities and other global crises will also rely on insights that bridge many fields.\n\nYet interdisciplinary research is still sidelined in many countries. Even though these papers attract more citations1 and have more impact on research2, interdisciplinary research proposals tend to be less likely to receive funding than are those with a narrower scope3.\n\nSome countries have adjusted their research funding strategies accordingly. For example, between 2016 and 2018, UK research councils awarded 30% more grants to interdisciplinary investigators than they had a decade earlier, with 44% of funded projects in 2018 spanning at least two research subjects4. A similar move has been made in the United States: between 2015 and 2020, university departments that submitted some interdisciplinary grant proposals received almost five times more funding — in terms of total and individual awards — from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) than did those that submitted in only one discipline5.\n\n‘Male-dominated campuses belong to the past’: the University of Tokyo tackles the gender gap\n\nAlas, this isn’t the case in Japan. The nation’s funding agencies still mostly support research in tight disciplinary boundaries, such as engineering or chemistry. Specialists who evaluate these grant proposals tend to favour work in fields that they are familiar with over interdisciplinary studies they do not understand well.\n\nThis narrow approach is leading to substantial underfunding of interdisciplinary research in Japan. It also means that the nation is missing out on breakthroughs. Japan’s natural resources are limited, and its economy has long relied on science and technology. The decline in its research and innovation is unmistakable, as indicated by the country’s share of the world’s top 10% of most-cited research articles, which has dropped from 6% to 2% over the past two decades or so.\n\nAs scientists and engineers based in Japanese research institutions, we urge the government and funding agencies to do more to support interdisciplinary research — or risk eroding the country’s global standing in science and its economy. Here we highlight five directions to foster such a shift.\n\nFund people, not projects\n\nWe argue that Japanese funding agencies should pivot from funding projects to supporting talented researchers. Such a model has proven to be effective in leading institutions worldwide. For example, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s (HHMI) Investigator Program provides outstanding scientists with flexible, long-term funding to pursue high-impact biomedical research — some US$11 million over a seven-year term, which can be renewed. This approach has led to groundbreaking discoveries, including the mechanistic understanding of circadian rhythms, the computational prediction of protein folding and the discovery of RNA interference.\n\nJapanese research is no longer world class — here’s why\n\nSimilarly, in Germany, the Max Planck Society prioritizes curiosity-driven research that has long-term objectives over immediate applications. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and providing institute directors with generous internal funding, free from the continual need to secure external grants, this strategy has enabled breakthroughs including the development of CRISPR–Cas9 as a gene-editing tool and structural insights into ribosomes.\n\nJapan does have some programmes to support talented researchers, but these are too timid. The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), for example, dedicate some funds to basic science and some to curiosity-driven research. But the JST adopts a top-down approach, which often favours research on trending topics and can miss more-original ideas or projects . And the annual budget for the JSPS’s main grant programme, the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), has remained stagnant for the past decade. Adjusted for inflation and the weakening yen, the average funding per project has halved since 2013.\n\nHowever, one Japanese institution has adopted researcher-focused funding with great success: the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST). Unlike national universities, which are funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, OIST is a private university that is funded by Japan’s Cabinet Office. Launched in 2011, it has a horizontal organizational structure and a strong commitment to diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration (see ‘Steps to success’). OIST is now ranked as Japan’s leading research institute by the Nature Index, and around 20% of its publications involve contributions across more than one discipline. More Japanese institutions should follow its lead.\n\nSteps to success\n\nAt the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), faculty members receive core funding for five years — with flexibility in what to do with it. Unlike many other universities, in which laboratories must cover the costs of core facilities and technical staff, access to these resources at OIST is provided free of charge. This fosters collaboration and enables high-risk, high-reward projects. A review of each faculty member every five years ensures accountability, with continued support granted only to those who demonstrate significant achievements.\n\nOIST also operates without conventional departments, helping scientists from different fields to collaborate. The buildings host open spaces, lounges, shared kitchens and open desk areas that encourage casual interactions. PhD students must also rotate through multiple labs during their first year to widen their horizons. These rotations facilitate the exchange of ideas and technologies, embedding interdisciplinary collaboration into the fabric of the institution.\n\nAlthough further progress is needed, including in terms of gender and disability, OIST fosters a greater diversity in its community than do other Japanese institutions. This is partly because it attracts scholars from around the world. In 2024, more than 60% of faculty members and 80% of students at OIST were not Japanese citizens, bringing a dynamic mix of perspectives and expertise.\n\nEmbrace high-stakes projects\n\nInterdisciplinary research is often perceived as riskier than more conventional, single-discipline work. This might be because it can be hard to learn concepts and methods, and even communicate efficiently, across disciplines. And priorities between fields can conflict.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, Japanese funding agencies should consider adopting a ‘high risk, high impact’ funding model, similar to that of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which anticipates a success rate of just 50%. They should recognize that even ‘unsuccessful’ high-risk projects can generate valuable knowledge, contributing to broader scientific and technological advancements. The DARPA funding model has inspired others, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), launched in the NIH to drive biomedical breakthroughs6.\n\nHow to improve assessments of publication integrity\n\nAnother example is the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in California, which supports interdisciplinary teams comprising biologists, engineers and data scientists to work on ambitious goals, such as the eradication of infectious diseases. It provides substantial funding over several years to enable teams to pivot research directions in response to emerging challenges. Success is assessed through regular milestone-based evaluations. Projects that show limited potential are promptly terminated, ensuring that resources can be reallocated to more-promising endeavours.\n\nIn Japan, we are not advocating for existing funds to be redistributed. Rather, Japanese policymakers should allocate money to high-risk, high-reward projects from a separate pot, managed through dedicated DARPA-like programmes.\n\nExpand grant panels\n\nInitiatives such as the JST’s Diversity and Inclusiveness programme aim to lessen the homogeneity of the research workforce — for example, through awards and networking opportunities for women in science and by providing support or extensions for life events as well as for childcare and caregiving commitments — which tend to fall mostly on women (see page 295). This is laudable, but these efforts should be more widespread: they should be extended across genders and also include funding agency officers, programme managers and reviewers.\n\nThe crewed research submersible Shinkai 6500 has conducted more than 1,700 dives.Credit: Associated Press/Alamy\n\nJapan’s funding agencies should also ensure that their own decision makers are less homogeneous in terms of their discipline, background, gender, age, nationality and culture. This would help to favour interdisciplinary research, which by nature weaves different approaches together and can benefit from being planned, conducted and assessed by a diverse community.\n\nThe role of immigration in boosting diversity should also be recognized.",

          "authors": "Jesús Avila, Federico Mayor Jr, Paola Bovolenta",
          "abstract": "Credit: Luis Davilla/Cover/Getty\n\nBiochemist Federico Mayor Zaragoza played a pivotal part in preventing inherited metabolic diseases in Spain, setting up the country’s first trials of the heel-prick test for newborn infants. In 1975, he co-founded the Centre for Molecular Biology (CBM) in Madrid, one of southern Europe’s pioneering research institutions. During his mandate as director-general of the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO from 1987 to 1999, and afterwards, Mayor contributed to crucial initiatives that shaped international educational and scientific policies. He has died aged 90.\n\nMayor was born in Barcelona in 1934 and his early years were marked by the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). His father — a self-made man with no academic training — rose to manage one of the first pharmaceutical companies to produce antibiotics in Spain. In 1950, Mayor moved to Madrid to study pharmacy. After earning a PhD in biochemistry in 1958, he became, in 1963, the youngest professor of biochemistry at the University of Granada, in southern Spain.\n\nIn 1966–67, on sabbatical in Oxford, UK, he met biochemist Louis Woolf, who had developed simple tests for the detection of some metabolic diseases, such as phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria causes severe learning difficulties in people who are unable to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. However, Woolf had found that the disorder could be treated successfully with a special diet if detected early enough.\n\nmRNA drug offers hope for treating a devastating childhood disease\n\nOn his return to Granada, Mayor decided to work on molecular diseases that affected newborn babies, including phenylketonuria and other rare metabolic conditions. Along with his collaborators, he launched Spain’s first neonatal blood-screening tests in 1968. These screens have since helped to prevent thousands of cases of genetic and metabolic disease in the country.\n\nBalancing research with leadership roles, Mayor was the rector of the University of Granada between 1968 and 1972. In 1973, he was recruited to lead the Department of Molecular Biology at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM), where he mentored a large number of young investigators. With help and inspiration of Spanish Nobel prizewinner Severo Ochoa, Mayor was a key co-founder and the first director of the CBM, a multidisciplinary institute that brought together his metabolism group at the UAM and prominent researchers in virology, molecular biology and developmental genetics. He also fostered a leading centre for the diagnosis of molecular diseases (CEDEM) at the UAM, focusing on the investigation and prevention of rare genetic diseases. The CEDEM is directed by his long-time collaborator Magdalena Ugarte.\n\nAfter Spain’s transition to democracy, Mayor was elected a member of the Spanish Parliament in 1977. He chaired the parliamentary committee for education and science and acted as an adviser to the country’s prime minister at the time, Adolfo Suárez. He later served as minister of education and science (1981–82), promoting measures to foster research at Spanish universities and earning accolades.\n\nAt UNESCO, Mayor focused on raising educational, scientific and cultural standards, emphasizing improvements in low- and middle-income nations in Africa and Latin America. For instance, he lent support to the World Declaration on Education for All in 1990, the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights in 1997 and the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1999.",

Wanyama, a 29-year-old in Nairobi who was born HIV-positive, is one of millions of people worldwide whose life-saving treatment is funded by a US foreign-aid programme.\n\nThe HIV clinic that Wanyama visits has managed to continue delivering medications — although many clinics aren’t, say researchers. But drug supplies are being rationed.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\n“We patients who are HIV-positive, we are really panicked,” says Wanyama, whose two children do not carry the virus. He’s lost his job mentoring other HIV-positive people at a US-funded facility, and is worried about continued access to medication. “The way things are going, I feel like I have worked so much for nothing.”\n\nAs the Trump administration announces drastic policy changes, nowhere is the shock more palpable than in the field of global health. Scientists, medics and health officials say that the outsize US influence on battling disease globally will be difficult to quickly replace.\n\nUS actions such as the foreign-aid freeze and its exit from the World Health Organization will affect billions of dollars in annual funding for battling HIV, malaria and other areas in global health. That will cost lives and threaten global security, say researchers. “It will make the world a less safe place,” says Peter Horby, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of Oxford, UK.\n\n‘High anxiety moment’: Biden’s NIH chief talks Trump 2.0 and the future of US science\n\nFunding freeze\n\nAfter the Trump administration announced a three-month freeze on foreign aid last month, effects have rippled throughout the global-health community. Programmes supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) — in which many employees have been furloughed, according to news reports — fund research, prevention and care for diseases such as HIV and malaria, and work on other global-health priorities.\n\n“People haven’t had a chance to get alternative funding because of the abrupt nature of this,” says Salim Abdool Karim, director of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, in Durban. The centre was due this week to enrol the first participant in a USAID-funded trial of HIV vaccines, which is now on hold. It is using its reserve funds to continue a trial testing whether a vaginal insertion can prevent HIV transmission.\n\nHIV clinics in Kenya and elsewhere have been affected by the freezes on US aid money.Credit: Pedro Ugarte/AFP via Getty\n\n“It is chaos,” says an HIV researcher in Africa, who runs a clinic that treats thousands of people supported by a US programme called the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) — they asked not to be named because of fears of reprisal. More than 20 million people, mostly in Africa, including more than one million children and pregnant people, receive antiretroviral drugs through the US$6.5-billion programme.\n\nThe clinic has had to suspend staff, which were funded by PEPFAR, and its patients are still receiving drugs only because of volunteer efforts. Last night, the clinic received a waiver from the US government that seems to allow it to resume HIV treatment, but uncertainty abounds.\n\nHIV treatments threatened\n\nIn South Africa, where the government provides the bulk of HIV care using some PEPFAR funding, the impact of the aid freeze will be minimal, says Abdool Karim. But in many other African countries, “if PEPFAR services stop, the effect will be catastrophic. The governments can’t just step in to meet the shortfall.”\n\nStopping antiretroviral treatment causes virus levels to rebound, making it possible for a person to transmit HIV — including through pregnancy to unborn children — and facilitating the evolution of drug resistance. “I’m hoping that someone somewhere sees sense and does not continue this abrupt ending of AIDS-treatment programmes,” says Abdool Karim.",

          "abstract": "Tatsuya Amano works with members of the translatE project, which strives to make environmental science more accessible to non-fluent English speakers.Credit: Naoki Katayama\nChangemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates people who fight racism in science and who champion inclusion. It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nJapanese biologist Tatsuya Amano has always struggled with English. But he accepted that, as a scientist, he would need to make an extra effort to communicate his research in science’s lingua franca. After moving to the University of Cambridge, UK, as a postdoc studying biodiversity changes at the global scale, Amano realized that most of his colleagues whose first language was not English were facing the same challenges, spending considerably more time reading papers, polishing their manuscripts and preparing oral presentations than those who were fluent.\n\nHe also noticed that the quality of a paper was often conflated with the quality of English writing, leading to many rejections simply because certain language standards weren’t met. Amano identified this as a serious inequality issue, so he decided to speak up — and back up his message with data. In the past decade, he has published several papers investigating language barriers in science.\n\nChampioning queer scientists of colour: ‘I don’t think we’ve scratched the surface on systemic exclusion’\nIn one such survey-based study, non-fluent English speakers reported that their papers were rejected 2.5 times as often as those of fluent speakers, owing to language-related issues1. Amano thinks that objectively measuring the effects of language barriers will bring more awareness to this often-hidden bias and pave the way for solutions. “It’s really hard for native English speakers to see, and let alone experience, how not being fluent in English is commonly viewed as the same as being inferior as a scientist,” he says.\n\nAmano, now a biodiversity researcher at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, tells Nature that science has a lot to lose by ignoring the inequalities caused by language barriers.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor and why?\n\nIf I have to choose one, I’d say it’s Bill Sutherland, a conservation biologist at the University of Cambridge, because he has always shown me, and continues to show, how to make a real difference in the community. As a postdoc in his group, I watched him develop and lead the Conservation Evidence project, turning his idea of “having all the existing evidence on what works in conservation2 at your fingertips” into a reality. I was lucky to watch him build this huge project, actively involving and influencing many people around the world.\n\nHe is extremely solution-oriented. For example, when he realized that we needed to provide more training on the importance of evidence-based conservation practices for future generations, he quickly assembled a team of 117 educators from 23 countries to develop open-access teaching materials in several languages. If I hadn’t worked with Bill and seen the power of these actions, I probably would have asked myself, “As a conservation scientist, should I really be working on language barriers in science?” But thanks to Bill’s influence, I had confidence in his approach and did not hesitate to tackle this issue.\n\nWhen did you decide to address language-related inequalities in science?\n\nMy first language is Japanese, and I struggle to communicate in English. Even now, I find it tough to write in English and prepare lecture materials. It was even a challenge to get ready for this interview. Initially, I saw this as my own problem.\n\nBut then, after I moved to Cambridge, I realized that this issue applies to almost every non-fluent English speaker.\n\nOne day, I looked up the number of people in the world whose first language is not English. It was 95% of the world’s population. That’s a massive number. And I thought, surely we can’t dismiss an issue that is affecting the inclusion of that much of the world. But this is not being seriously considered in academia. And that was the moment when I thought I should make a real change in science to better include non-native English speakers.\n\nHow have you dealt with issues of discrimination personally and professionally?\n\nLast April, one of my co-authored papers was rejected because the level of English did not meet the journal’s standard. Unfortunately, this is still very common.\n\nFor a long time, many of us non-native English speakers assumed that such rejections were our own fault. And the entire scientific community has relied on individuals to overcome these barriers on their own. But I see this as a serious inequality issue, and it is costing the community because we are losing huge numbers of uniquely talented researchers. For example, many participants in our survey1 expressed frustration, anxiety and stress because they had to do science in English. They also reported that younger generations have not been able to pursue their academic careers owing to language barriers.\n\nHow Los Angeles neighbours partnered to show under-represented students the ‘unspoken rules’ to success\nThat’s why we have been advocating solutions to eliminate this kind of inequality — and that led us toreview the policies of more than 700 biological science journals3. We proposed a set of linguistically inclusive policies for them to take up. For example, we recommended allowing manuscripts and abstracts to be published in relevant languages and having a public statement that manuscripts will be fairly assessed regardless of the perceived standard of English. I'm trying to make these barriers visible to everyone and propose productive solutions.",

Credit: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto/Getty\n\nA prominent US scientific society altered its website to remove references to diversity and equity ― terms targeted by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Articles about scientists who are members of under-represented groups also temporarily vanished from the site, although they have since reappeared.\n\nThe editing sparked an outcry among some of the more than 37,000 members of the organization, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) in Washington DC. Some ASM members note that other scientific societies have posted statements in support of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), rather than deleting terms targeted by White House orders.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\n“I feel sad, mad, disappointed,” says Carla Bonilla, a biologist at the University of San Diego, California, who was born in El Salvador. An article about her on the ASM website was briefly replaced with a notice saying ‘Under review’ before being restored. Bonilla has been a member of the ASM since 2015, and says that it had always been consistent in its support for scientists from diverse backgrounds. But now, she says, it feels “like they are trying to hide me”.\n\nIn an e-mail, ASM president Theresa Koehler told Nature that the organization had followed legal advice to review all of its webpages, in the hope of protecting its federally funded programmes. But Koehler acknowledged that the organization should have alerted members to the review. “We realize that our poor communication has hurt and confused people,” wrote Koehler. “We will learn from this, and we will do better.”\n\nTargeted terminology\n\nThe ASM took action after Trump ordered federal agencies to end “radical and wasteful” DEI programmes and to take down websites and other public platforms that “promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology”. In response, numerous US agencies took steps to scrub terms mentioned in Trump’s orders from their websites and from research papers under review. Trump’s directives extended beyond the federal government: he also told federal officials to identify “large non-profit corporations or associations” that have DEI programmes as targets for investigation.\n\nIn the first few days of February, scientists began noticing changes to the ASM’s website. For example, the page for the ASM’s ‘Inclusive Diversity with Equity, Access and Accountability Committee’ morphed into a page for a ‘Progress, Impact, Access and Accountability Committee’.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\nThe phrase “other marginalized groups in science and health care” was replaced with “other groups in science and health care” in an article on the ASM website titled ‘Women in the History of Antimicrobial Development’, which was written by Jennifer Goff, a microbiologist at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. The original language was restored within hours of its removal, but “it’s particularly concerning that alterations were made to articles without contacting the authors to ask for permission”, says microbiologist and ASM member Sean Gibbons at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington.",

          "abstract": "An ongoing trial of Zepbound (tirzepatide) is testing effects on heart disease in people with obesity and diabetes.Credit: Shelby Knowles/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nAs appetite for blockbuster weight-loss drugs grows worldwide, scientists are developing the next crop of medications that, they hope, will improve the performance of these drugs and offer benefits beyond weight loss.\n\n“It’s going to be another year where, every week, there’s going to be something really cool,” says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nNew obesity definition sidelines BMI to focus on health\n\nDrug makers are building on the success of medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which contain the active ingredient semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. These drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1, helping to regulate blood-sugar levels and appetite.\n\nBut most of these medications are costly, require weekly injections and need to be taken long-term to prevent weight regain. These are some of the issues that companies hope alternative drugs will address.\n\nNature looks at the weight-loss medicines being tested in 2025 and what they have to offer.\n\nTirzepatide: cuts heart weight and surrounding fat\n\nTirzepatide — sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound and given by injection — mimics GLP-1 and another hormone called gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which is involved in fat metabolism. In trial results published in November, it helped participants to lose up to 20% of their body weight over 72 weeks and reduced the risk of diabetes, compared with a placebo. People taking semaglutide for 68 weeks lose up to 15% of their body weight. Participants who took tirzepatide also had a beneficial reduction in heart weight and in fat surrounding the heart, improved mobility and lower blood pressure and inflammation compared with people on a placebo.\n\nOne trial expected to conclude in 2025 is examining tirzepatide’s effects on heart disease in people with obesity and diabetes.\n\nRetatrutide: trial participants report major weight loss\n\nRetatrutide, which has not yet received regulatory approval for weight loss, activates receptors for GLP-1, GIP and glucagon, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Developed by Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, it has shown even more promising results than tirzepatide and semaglutide, with trial participants losing an average of 24% of their body weight over 11 months. The drug also helped to reduce blood-sugar levels in people with diabetes, and it’s now being tested in phase III trials that are expected to conclude by 2026.\n\nAnti-obesity drug has life-changing benefits for arthritis\n\nResearchers are excited about combination therapies such as retatrutide, says Beverly Tchang, an endocrinologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, who notes that obesity’s complexity makes targeting multiple pathways the most promising approach.\n\nOrforglipron: oral drug shows promise\n\nOrforglipron, an oral small-molecule drug candidate also developed by Eli Lilly, showed similar results to GLP-1 injections in rodents, and led to a weight loss of about 10% over 26 weeks in people with obesity, improving blood pressure and levels of circulating fatty molecules. Like Ozempic, orforglipron is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, but whereas Ozempic requires injection, orforglipron comes as a daily pill.\n\nLilly expects to complete phase III trials in 2025, and orforglipron could receive US regulatory approval in 2026, according to Lilly’s chief executive Dave Ricks.\n\n“The wild card is the oral small molecules,” says Randy Seeley, an obesity specialist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. Many companies are working on this approach, because pills might be more appealing and cost-effective than injections, but progress has been slower than expected owing to dosing challenges, he says. “If one of them finally breaks through, it has the ability to alter the landscape pretty considerably.”\n\nMariTide: weight-loss maintenance\n\nBiopharmaceutical company Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California, is planning a phase III trial of its drug candidate MariTide, which activates GLP-1 receptors while reducing GIP’s activity. The medication can be taken monthly by injection and resulted in an average weight loss of up to 20% over 52 weeks, according to data released by the company.\n\nUnlike other treatments, MariTide has shown the ability to maintain weight loss for several months after the last dose. When people stop taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, they tend to regain weight quickly, but that doesn’t seem to happen with MariTide, which might encourage more people to have the treatment, says Seeley, who consults for and receives funding from Amgen and other companies developing obesity drugs.\n\nCagriSema: combination drug outperforms semaglutide",

The tool follows a similar one from Google released in December and acts as a personal assistant, doing the equivalent of hours of work in tens of minutes.\n\nMany scientists who have tried it are impressed with its ability to write literature reviews or full review papers and even identify gaps in knowledge. Others are less enthusiastic. “If a human did this I would be like: this needs a lot of work,” says Kyle Kabasares, a data scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute in Moffett Field, California, in an online video review.\n\nScientists flock to DeepSeek: how they’re using the blockbuster AI model\n\nThe firms are presenting the tools as a step towards AI ‘agents’ that can handle complex tasks. Observers say that OpenAI’s deep research tool, released on 2 February, is notable because it combines the improved reasoning skills of the o3 large language model (LLM) with the ability to search the Internet. Google says its Deep Research tool is, for now, based on Gemini 1.5 Pro, rather than on its leading reasoning model 2.0 Flash Thinking.\n\nReview writing\n\nMany users are impressed with both tools. Andrew White, a chemist and AI expert FutureHouse, a start-up in the San Francisco, California, says that Google’s product is “really leveraging Google’s advantages in search and compute” to get users up to speed on a topic quickly, while o3’s reasoning skills add sophistication to OpenAI’s reports.\n\nDerya Unutmaz, an immunologist at the Jackson Laboratory in Farmington, Connecticut, who has free access to ChatGPT Pro granted by OpenAI for medical research, says the OpenAI deep research reports are “extremely impressive”, “trustworthy” and as good or better than published review papers. “I think writing reviews is becoming obsolete.”\n\nWhite anticipates that AI systems like these could be used to update human-authored reviews. “Authoritative reviews cannot feasibly be updated [by humans] every 6 months.”.\n\nBut many caution that all LLM-based tools are sometimes inaccurate or misleading. OpenAI’s website admits that its tool “is still early and has limitations”: it can get citations wrong, hallucinate facts, fail to distinguish authoritative information from rumors and fail to convey its uncertainty accurately. The company expects the issues to improve with more usage and time. Google’s Deep Research has a disclaimer that simply reads “Gemini can make mistakes, so double-check it”.\n\nHow China created AI model DeepSeek and shocked the world",

          "authors": "Linda Nordling",
          "abstract": "The Norwegian government wants to ensure that English does not replace Norwegian as the main language used in higher education.Credit: Getty\n\nResearchers in Norway have mounted a major legal challenge to the introduction of mandatory Norwegian language classes for foreign PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, arguing that the requirement violates labour laws and threatens to harm the country’s ability to compete internationally in research. Some critics view the law as part of a broader trend of protectionist policies emerging across an increasingly conservative Europe.\n\nAll doctoral and postdoctoral researchers hired from August this year who do not speak Norwegian, Danish or Swedish must complete 15 study points of Norwegian language training — about 3 months of study — during the period covered by their contracts.\n\nLast June, Oddmund Hoel, then Norway’s research and higher-education minister, said that the law aims to “preserve Norwegian as a professional language and prevent English from becoming the main language in Norwegian higher education”. The law came into force on 1 August 2024 with a 12-month implementation delay to give universities time to adjust to the regulations.\n\nBut critics say the mandatory language courses won’t achieve the intended goal. Instead, they argue, the law could harm Norway’s ability to attract and retain international talent by cutting into research time and making it more expensive for universities to hire from abroad.\n\n“Our principal investigators, postdocs and PhDs come from all over the world,” says Edvard Moser, a Nobel laureate who heads up the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “These demands will make it difficult for us to recruit them.”\n\nLegal challenge mounted\n\nThe impact of the law could be considerable. In 2022, around 44% of PhD candidates and 74% of postdoctoral fellows at Norwegian higher-education institutions came from abroad.\n\nBut the law is unlikely to strengthen Norwegian as a scientific language, says Pierre Lison, an artificial-intelligence researcher at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo. The three-month courses will help researchers with basic conversational skills, he says, but won’t provide the level of proficiency needed “to partake in academic discussions or write academic texts in Norwegian”.\n\nLast December, Lison and the Association of Doctoral Organizations in Norway, which represents local interest groups for early-career researchers, filed a complaint with the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority, which monitors compliance with European Economic Area (EEA) rules in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, none of which are members of the European Union. The complaint argues that the language policy breaches EEA law, which guarantees free movement of workers within the EU and its partner countries.\n\nAlthough EEA law allows countries to have language requirements for jobs, such criteria must serve a legitimate public interest, be appropriate for achieving that goal and not go beyond what is necessary. The petitioners argue that Norway’s language law fails on the last two counts.\n\nNobel laureate Edvard Moser is one of dozens of researchers who are protesting against the language-proficiency requirements.Credit: Philip Toscano/PA Images/Alamy\n\nThe law fails to fulfil its purpose because the level of proficiency attained through the three-month courses will be insufficient to conduct academic work in Norwegian, it says. It is also disproportionate, the petition adds, because most PhD students and postdocs in Norway don’t need to speak Norwegian to do their jobs, and because it creates additional costs for universities, which will not be given extra funding to compensate.\n\n“Institutions are expected to pay for it but don’t have the resources, so they pass it on to research groups,” says Moser, one of 26 named researchers formally backing the complaint. He adds that using research grants for language courses could violate grant terms.\n\nProtectionism in disguise?\n\nThe surveillance authority could respond in several ways, Lison says. If it finds an infringement, it typically starts by discussing possible changes with authorities in Norway. If that fails, it could issue a formal opinion requiring Norway to comply with EEA law. The final step would be court action, although Lison hopes “it will not go this far” and the ministry will drop the requirement.\n\nThe complainants’ preferred solution is to make offering language courses mandatory for universities but to allow PhD students and postdocs to choose whether to enrol. But Lison thinks there is an ulterior motive to the law that goes beyond wanting to protect the Norwegian language.\n\n“This is essentially a protectionist employment policy in disguise,” he says. The law will lead to universities favouring domestic candidates when filling positions, because they will cost less and be able to assume a higher teaching load than will foreign candidates who need to take the language classes, he says.\n\nLison draws a parallel between Norway’s law and a plan submitted by the Dutch government to its parliament last May that aims to curb the number of undergraduate courses offered in English in the Netherlands. Ostensibly a move to bolster language skills, the proposal is “essentially a way to reduce the number of international students” and address the housing shortage in university cities such as Amsterdam, he says.\n\nIn a statement, the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research told Nature that it does not think the regulations are in breach of EEA law, and that its aim is to “preserve Norwegian as a fully functional national language”. Part of this means ensuring that teaching is done primarily in Norwegian, it said, however, “In recent decades, a large share of the newly recruited academic staff has been non-Norwegian speakers”.",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, is the second-wealthiest medical-research foundation in the world.Credit: imageBROKER/Alamy\n\nThe Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) — one of the world’s largest private funders of basic biomedical research — has abruptly cancelled a US$60-million initiative to boost diversity in university science programmes and scrubbed all mention of the effort from its website.\n\n‘Mind-boggling’: US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers\n\nIn doing so, the funder has terminated grants to 104 US universities approximately midway through the programme’s six-year funding cycle, without any explanation. The move has unsettled many scientists, who are reeling after US President Donald Trump issued a stream of executive orders in the past few weeks targeting “illegal” diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and funding across the country, saying that the policies diminish “the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society”. In response, US science agencies have ordered staff members to strip DEI mentions from government websites and are scrutinizing federal research grants for violations, with an eye towards revising or cancelling them.\n\nThat such a massive private funder, which doesn’t receive federal funding, is cutting support at such a sensitive time “is so disappointing”, says Danielle Beckman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Davis. “Now is the time that we need private funders to fill the gap that the new administration has left” by threatening public science funding.\n\nA spokesperson for the HHMI, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, confirmed that the institution terminated the initiative, called Inclusive Excellence 3 (IE3), on 5 February, adding that the HHMI “remains committed to supporting outstanding scientists and talented students training to become scientists” through its other programmes. The spokesperson did not address Nature’s queries about why IE3 was cancelled, why HHMI deleted all its webpages referencing the programme or scientists’ distress over its termination.\n\nA ‘safe haven’?\n\nWith a $24-billion endowment, the HHMI is the second-wealthiest medical-research foundation in the world. Its prominent Investigator Program offers each recipient $11 million over a renewable seven-year term to conduct groundbreaking research.\n\nRNA biologist loses disability case against Howard Hughes Medical Institute\n\nIts IE3 initiative grouped its awardee universities into seven ‘learning communities’ to encourage collaboration on projects. Each community, consisting of about 15 US institutions, received nearly $9 million and was tasked with deciding how and where to allocate that money. For example, one of the communities was working to build more robust peer-mentoring programmes to improve student outcomes.\n\nAlthough the HHMI did not say why it ended IE3, Trump’s 21 January order on DEI might have played a part. The order calls for US agencies to encourage the private sector to end “illegal DEI discrimination”. He directed each agency to produce, within four months, a list of up to nine companies, non-profit organizations, “foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more” or other private institutions for potential civil-compliance investigations.\n\nTo understand the importance of IE3, Nature reached out to nine researchers listed as a principal investigator on one of the programme’s grants. Some did not respond, and the others either declined to comment or requested anonymity because they feared drawing attention to their university in the current political climate.\n\nIn the United States, “we know we have a problem retaining STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] students, especially with how COVID interrupted schooling”, and this money helped to bring institutions together to address the problem, says one researcher. “All the momentum we had built — gone.”\n\nThe decision has left scientists in a bind, because it seems that federal funding for research related in any way to DEI will dry up after Trump’s crackdown. “There were rumours this would happen to federally funded grants, but many people thought that private foundations might be a safe haven from all that,” the same researcher says.\n\nThe fact that the HHMI not only ended IE3, but also wiped all traces of it off its website was particularly disheartening, Beckman says. “It’s like it never existed.” And sometime in the past six months, the HHMI deleted a landing page on which it stated its commitment to DEI and posted demographic data about its grantees and staff members.",

          "abstract": "One of the buildings on the US National Institutes of Health’s campus in Bethesda, Maryland, is a hospital dedicated to medical research.Credit: Bob Korn/Alamy\n\nA US judge has blocked a policy that would have, beginning today, slashed billions of dollars of funding annually for US research institutions, including universities and hospitals. The action is in response to lawsuits filed by 22 US states and a coalition of universities earlier today contending that the policy was illegal and would cause “cutting-edge work to cure and treat human disease” to “grind to a halt”.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nThe policy, announced on 7 February by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), would have cut ‘research overhead’ to 15% for new and existing grants. Last year, the NIH, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, awarded US$26 billion directly to scientists for laboratory expenses, including staff salaries, equipment and reagents; $9 billion went to these overhead, or indirect, costs to help institutions run their facilities and cover administrative fees. The historical average indirect-costs rate has been about 40%, reaching up to 75% at some institutions.\n\nThe steep cut attempted by the NIH comes as the administration of US President Donald Trump, in partnership with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, is targeting federal spending and attempting to dismantle agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, which funds global disease research, prevention and care. In the past few weeks, Trump’s team tried to freeze federal grants, sowing chaos and confusion throughout the US scientific community, but federal judges have so far blocked this effort. Musk said on Friday that wealthy universities getting high rates for indirect costs is “a ripoff” on the social-media platform X, which he owns.\n\nThe 15% cap is necessary to “ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead”, according to a memorandum from the office of acting NIH director Matthew Memoli announcing the change.\n\nThe attorneys general of the states that sued are Democrats, although Trump, a Republican, won five of those states in last year’s presidential election. The effects of the policy would be “immediate and devastating”, the lawsuit said. “This agency action will result in layoffs, suspension of clinical trials, disruption of ongoing research programs, and laboratory closures.”\n\nJudge Angel Kelley’s orders temporarily prevent the NIH from enacting its policy nationwide; she set a hearing for 21 February to further consider the petitions.\n\n‘Generational restructuring’\n\nBy Monday, some research institutions had already taken precautionary measures in response to the cut. In an e-mail seen by Nature, the University of Florida in Gainesville, which has an indirect-costs rate of 52.5%, told its staff members that new awards and the projects they fund at the 15% rate would be frozen, because its accounting department has not been authorized to charge the agency the lower rate.\n\nThe US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?\n\nResearchers say that the policy would upend the biomedical-research ecosystem. Alondra Nelson, who directed the US Office of Science and Technology Policy for eight months under former US president and Democrat Joe Biden, wrote on the social-media platform Bluesky that the policy would lead to a “generational restructuring” of the US research and development ecosystem.\n\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, was already losing money on federally funded clinical trials, and relied on philanthropy to make up the difference, says Charles Roberts, director of the hospital’s cancer centre. The NIH rate cut would further cost the hospital nearly $40 million each year, he says. “This will likely mean that fewer experimental treatments will get to children,” he adds. “More children will die.”\n\nThe NIH referred Nature to its parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for comments on the lawsuits. It also did not answer questions from Nature about whether it would give more money to researchers for their direct costs to make up for the cap. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said that the agency does not discuss ongoing litigation and declined to answer Nature’s inquiries regarding the lawsuits or scientists’ concerns about the indirect-costs policy.\n\nA question of cost\n\n‘Direct costs’ paid for by research grants help scientists to buy equipment for specific projects and cover the salaries of lab personnel. But research institutions also need to pay for air conditioning, electricity, computing resources, hazardous-waste disposal, administrative personnel and much more to support these projects.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nTo help cover these essential utilities and resources, the federal government has since 1947 been adding ‘indirect costs’ to research grants. These rates ranged from 8% to about 20% until 1965, when individual institutions began negotiating their own rates with the HHS. For example, on a $1.2-million grant, a 20% indirect-costs rate would mean that $200,000 goes to the university to pay for overhead.\n\nThese rates have risen steadily since the 1960s, in part because of an increasing number of regulations governing lab research and how federal funds are spent. The regulations include measures to ensure data privacy; protect animal welfare and human participants in research; and govern international collaborations.",

          "authors": "Kaori Hayashi",
          "abstract": "Last year, my colleagues and I displayed a provocative poster across the campus of the University of Tokyo (UTokyo), sparking both delight and dismay among staff and students alike. It featured a large letter ‘Q’ at its centre, for question, and challenged viewers with this enquiry: “Why are there so few women at the University of Tokyo?”\n\nIndeed, some 90% of the university’s full professors, 83% of its associate professors and — perhaps even more shockingly — 77% of its undergraduate students are men. These numbers echo those throughout the country’s higher-education institutions. Many campuses across the world similarly struggle with gender and other imbalances.\n\nJapan can be a science heavyweight once more — if it rethinks funding\n\nAs the executive vice-president of the university, leading its diversity efforts and global affairs, I have spent the past four years struggling with this inequity. The poster was part of a larger effort to improve recognition across the campus community, prompt reflection on such a skewed ratio and promote change. Although Japan’s constitution guarantees women equal rights, men have historically dominated society, including on campuses. This imbalance cannot continue.\n\nThis is why, in 2022, my colleagues and I launched the #WeChangeUTokyo programme, aimed at driving institutional change through five key actions.\n\nFirst, raise awareness among those that make up the majority of UTokyo’s community — Japanese men. Studies show that members of over-represented groups are more likely to not notice a lack of diversity, whether deliberately or not, and do not always welcome diversity, equity and inclusion efforts that they think they don’t benefit from (A. Iyer Soc. Personal. Psychol. Compass 16, e12666; 2022). We introduced initiatives to improve gender awareness, including unconscious-bias training to improve hiring processes and retention. We run courses to familiarize participants with gender stereotypes, and have workshops on consent and dealing with sexual harassment.\n\nSecond, support women in research. We do this through networking opportunities that improve people’s career-development prospects, and provide financial support for travel for those with caring commitments. These funds are available to all, but benefit mostly women, who disproportionately take on caring responsibilities for children, elder family members and others in Japan. And we offer mentorship programmes to help women to navigate their academic and professional journeys.\n\nAre women in research being led up the garden path?\n\nThird, set numerical targets. We aim to increase the proportion of women in faculty from 18% in May 2024 to 25% by the end of the 2027 academic year. Some critics argue that this target is too modest — why not 50%, because women comprise half of humanity? But, on the basis of data from the past 20 years, my colleagues and I think that this would be too big a jump right now. Setting realistic goals instead, then building on those, will be more effective.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Monty Rakusen/Getty\n\nLast Thursday, 30 January, bioinformatician Niema Moshiri received a late-night message from a long-time collaborator urging him to back up the website of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). At the time, rumours had been circulating that the public-health agency, which tracks disease outbreaks and makes its data publicly available, would start removing pages from its website, in response to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump directing government departments to take down public information on gender and diversity.\n\nMoshiri, who is based at the University of California, San Diego, and is a self-described “data hoarder” who creates backups of his personal videos and online receipts and bills, was happy to help. “I never thought I would have to do it for information pages from the federal government,” he says.\n\nIn the past week, some US federal government websites containing important data sets and information on public health and demographics have been taken down, including those for global programmes to combat HIV and national surveys of chronic disease. Some have been reinstated; others not. “It was kind of shocking to me that they would just delete pages willy-nilly,” says Moshiri.\n\nMoshiri is one of dozens of researchers in the United States and globally who are scrambling to capture public information on US federal government websites before it is tampered with or disappears. “A lot of people did similar parallel efforts, especially within their own areas of expertise,” says virologist Angela Rasmussen, who is based at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, and was the collaborator who messaged Moshiri. She stayed up till 2 a.m. last Friday manually downloading data sets, such as on influenza surveillance. Having created these backups, researchers are now working out how to make them publicly available, she adds.\n\nThe CDC and its parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services, say that all changes to their websites are in accordance with Trump’s executive orders.\n\nGlobal effort\n\nOver the weekend, Moshiri got in touch with Charles Gaba, a health-care policy and data analyst based near Detroit, Michigan.\n\nMoshiri helped Gaba to create an alphabetical list of every CDC web link — amounting to more than 7,000 pages, which Gaba manually redirected to the version on the Wayback Machine, a service maintained by Internet Archive, a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, that regularly archives web pages, including material from government websites such as that of the CDC. Gaba then posted the entire list on his blog. “It took a couple of days,” says Gaba. “A lot of it is vital, and you don’t know what’s still there, what isn’t there.” Gaba has since posted a similar list of the entire website for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), organized by subject.\n\nOn his hard drive, Moshiri now has backups of the CDC’s website and data sets, as well as the websites for the FDA and other government agencies. Some of these he downloaded himself and others were first downloaded and shared by others online. He is also in the process of backing up the US Department of Agriculture’s website — all of these sites amount to hundreds of thousands of files and more than 130 gigabytes of uncompressed data, and yet all could fit on a USB flash drive. “These are pretty tiny,” he says.\n\nMoshiri hasn’t shared his backups publicly. If his university agrees that it falls within his role as a faculty member, Moshiri wants to publish an exact untouched copy of the CDC website. And his long-term goal is to back up every federal-government website. “I have 100 terabytes of storage under my desk. In theory, I could stick all of these on.”\n\nKendra Albert, an attorney with the public-interest technology and media law firm Albert Sellars LLP in Philadelphia, says that works produced by federal government employees as part of their jobs are in the public domain. Generally speaking, it is legal to download government data sets, make backups of government websites and share them, they say. In circumstances in which copyrighted material is included in those data, making copies and sharing them would often fall under the doctrine of fair use if it is done for the purposes of research, advocacy or as a historical record to show what the site looked like at an earlier date, says Albert.\n\nInternet Archive also supports an initiative, known as the End of Term Web Archive, to archive government web pages at the beginning and end of every US presidential term. James Jacobs, a librarian at Stanford University in California who works on the archive, hopes that it could become a central place for the public to access scientists’ archives of government websites.",

The results are described in a preprint posted on the arXiv1 server.\n\n“I imagine it won’t be long before computers are getting full marks on the IMO,” says Kevin Buzzard, a mathematician at Imperial College London.\n\nSolving problems in Euclidean geometry is one of four topics covered by IMO problems — the others cover the branches of number theory, algebra and combinatorics. Geometry problems demand specific skills of an artificial intelligence (AI), because competitors must provide a rigorous proof for a statement about geometric objects on a plane. Last July, AlphaGeometry 2 made its public debut alongside a new system, AlphaProof, which DeepMind developed to solve the non-geometry questions in the IMO problem sets.\n\nMathematical language\n\nAlphaGeometry comprises a combination of components that include a specialized language model and a ‘neuro-symbolic’ system — one that does not train by learning from data, as neural networks do, but that has abstract reasoning coded in by humans. The team trained the language model to speak a formal mathematical language, which makes it possible to automatically check its output for logical rigour — and to weed out ‘hallucinations’, the incoherent or false statements that AI chatbots are prone to making.\n\nFor AlphaGeometry 2, the team made several improvements, including the integration of Google’s state-of-the-art large language model, Gemini. The team also introduced the ability for the AI to reason by moving geometric objects around a plane — allowing it to move a point along a line to change the height of a triangle, for instance — and for it to solve linear equations.\n\nThe International Mathematical Olympiad is a prestigious annual competition for gifted high-school students.Credit: Valerie Kuypers/AFP via Getty\n\nThe system was able to solve 84% of all geometry problems set in IMOs over the past 25 years, compared with the 54% achieved by the original AlphaGeometry. (Teams in India and China used different approaches last year to achieve gold-medal-level performance in geometry, but on a smaller subset of IMO geometry problems2,3.)\n\nThe authors of the DeepMind paper write that future improvements to AlphaGeometry will include dealing with maths problems that involve inequalities and non-linear equations, which will be required to fully “solve geometry”.",

The findings, published today in Nature Medicine1, raise questions about the role of the proteins that ravage the brain during the disease and the drugs that target them.\n\nSince 2011, a study called the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) has been following a family in which many members have a mutation in a gene called PSEN2. The mutation causes the brain to produce versions of the amyloid protein that are prone to clumping into the sticky plaques thought to drive neurodegeneration. Family members with the mutation invariably develop Alzheimer’s at around age 50.\n\nThis is how an Alzheimer’s gene ravages the brain\n\nThen, a 61-year-old man from this family showed up at the DIAN study’s clinic with full cognitive function, and the researchers were shocked to discover that he had the fateful PSEN2 mutation. The man’s mother had had the same mutation, as had 11 of her 13 siblings; all had developed dementia around age 50.\n\nThe researchers were even more shocked when scans revealed that his brain looked like that of someone with Alzheimer’s. “His brain was full of amyloid,” says behavioural neurologist and study co-author Jorge Llibre-Guerra at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nWhat the man’s brain didn’t contain, however, were clusters of tau — another protein that forms tangled threads inside neurons. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans revealed that he had a small amount of abnormal tau and that it was only in the occipital lobe, a brain region involved in visual perception that is not usually affected in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nCognitive resilience\n\nOver the course of ten years, Llibre-Guerra and his colleagues ran memory tests and other cognitive assessments to determine whether the man really was resistant to Alzheimer’s. Overall, his test scores were normal and remained constant over the years. Some scores even rose owing to practice.\n\nNext, the researchers looked for genetic explanations for the man’s resilience. Previous research has found protective mutations in two people who carry a gene that invariably causes early-onset Alzheimer’s. But the man in the DIAN study didn’t carry either of these mutations.",

          "abstract": "Mice immediately bolt for shelter when they see the looming shadow of a bird, just as humans jump when they see a spider. But these instinctive reactions, which are controlled by the brainstem, can be suppressed if animals learn that a scary stimulus is harmless.\n\nIn Science today, neuroscientists reveal the precise regions of the brain that suppress fear responses in mice1 — a finding that might help scientists to develop strategies for treating post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety in people.\n\nThe study showed that two parts of the brain work together to learn to suppress fear. But, surprisingly, only one of these regions is involved in later recalling the learnt behaviour. “This is the first evidence of that mechanism,” says neuroscientist Pascal Carrive at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.\n\nIn the study, an expanding dark circle was used to imitate a swooping bird, and caused naive mice to run to a shelter. To teach the mice that this looming stimulus was not dangerous, a barrier was added to prevent the animals from hiding.\n\n“I like their behavioural model,” says Christina Perry, a behavioural neuroscientist at Macquarie University in Sydney. “It’s very simple,” she adds. The mice “don’t get eaten, so they learn that this fake predator is not, in fact, a threat”.\n\nAs the mice were learning to be bolder, the researchers switched specific types of neurons on or off using optogenetics — a well-established technique that allows neurons to be controlled with light.\n\nWhen researchers silenced the parts of the cerebral cortex that analyse visual stimuli (called the posterolateral higher visual areas), the mice did not learn to suppress fear and continued to try to escape from the fake bird — suggesting that this area of the brain is necessary for learning to suppress this fear reaction.\n\n‘Unexpected’ result\n\nHowever, mice already trained to overcome their fear could still enact the new, courageous behaviour when the posterolateral higher visual areas were switched off. This is because the memory was stored in a region near the centre of the brain called the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus, “an area of the brain that can inhibit others; it’s quite a strong control region”, says co-author Sonja Hofer, a systems neuroscientist at University College London (UCL).",

          "abstract": "Lactobacillus bacteria (artist’s illustration) have been genetically engineered to make molecules that travel from the nose to the brain.Credit: Artur Plawgo/SPL\n\nA healthier brain could one day be just a snort away: bacteria that colonize the nose have been engineered to ferry drugs to the brains of mice.\n\nOn 5 February, scientists reported in Cell1 that they have used nasal bacteria to deliver appetite-suppressing hormones to obese mice, which subsequently lost weight. Although the approach is still a long way from being used in humans, it is one of the latest examples of widespread efforts to harness bacteria to deliver drugs to where they are needed in the body more effectively. Another study, published today in Cell Systems2, uses a different bacterial species to deliver a protective enzyme to skin cells.\n\n“Drugs often don’t get to where they need to go very well,” says Shannon Sirk, a bioengineer at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, who was not involved in the studies. “If you can improve delivery, you can minimize side effects and reduce the burden on patients.”\n\nGut feeling\n\nMany attempts to engineer drug-secreting bacteria have focused on delivering molecules to the gut, says Sirk. The microbial flora in the gut is lush with bacteria that could carry a medical payload, including strains of Escherichia coli, a laboratory workhorse that is easy to genetically engineer. But the studies reported this week have ventured to other regions of the body and explored the capabilities of less familiar bacteria.\n\nThe brain is a particularly unusual site for a bacterial delivery system to target, says Cammie Lesser, a synthetic microbiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, because it is protected by a barrier that generally excludes microbes, as well as some molecules.\n\nEngineered brain parasite ferries useful proteins into neurons\n\nTo get around this, Matthew Wook Chang, a synthetic biologist at the National University of Singapore, and his colleagues decided to harness a little-studied gateway to the brain: the nose. The first step was to determine which potentially useful microbes reside there. “The nasal microbiome remains relatively unexplored, despite the nasal cavity’s direct connection to the brain,” says Chang.\n\nThe authors examined several bacteria, including five strains of Lactobacillus, a genus that is generally considered safe and is sometimes used in health supplements. The team then screened these strains for their ability to bind to a molecule that is found on a membrane called the olfactory epithelium. This lines part of the upper nasal passageway and is connected to the brain by nerves that are important for the sense of smell. Although bacteria are unlikely to travel from the nose to the brain, some molecules can diffuse along this path.\n\nOnce the researchers had found a suitable strain, Lactobacillus plantarum, they genetically engineered it to produce and secrete a variety of molecules, including three appetite-regulating hormones. Obese mice that received a dose of the bacteria in their nose each day for eight weeks ate less and lost weight during the treatment period1.\n\nSlow starter",

          "title": "How to end outrage and detoxify politics: share stories, not statistics",
          "authors": "Leor Zmigrod",
          "abstract": "Outraged: Why We Fight About Morality and Politics and How to Find Common Ground Kurt Gray Pantheon (2025)\n\nSocial psychologist Kurt Gray’s timely book Outraged begins with a dramatic swerve he made on a motorway — a teenage driving mishap, a chase and an escape from the clutches of road rage. That frightening early life experience sparked Gray’s academic exploration of the roots of moral disagreement, which underpins conflicts in politics and media, and even on gridlocked streets.\n\nBy dissecting the rich body of research on how we make judgments about right and wrong, Gray delivers a second swerve — a bold conceptual turn in explaining why people collide over morality and how such collisions can be avoided.\n\nMisinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might think\n\nHe argues that our moral reflexes reveal an innate motivation to protect ourselves and others from harm. Although outrage might seem aggressive — a loud fury hollered across town halls and digital echo-chambers — it is in fact a defensive stance.\n\nOutrage, Gray suggests, can be understood once we recognize that moral anger is often an expression of fear. In many cases, when someone is outraged, it is because they are scared that a vulnerable person will be hurt or mistreated by an action or a policy.\n\nMany liberals and conservatives disagree on climate policies because they focus on different victims. US Democrats lobby for tighter environmental regulations to protect ecosystems, whereas Republicans support plans to ease environmental regulations to prevent job losses in the fossil-fuel industry. Each group is seeking to protect someone from harm.\n\nFor Gray, this dynamic is the source of our divisions, but also a source of hope. If everyone has the same moral impulses and pursues the same moral project, then there is something uniting us. Gray’s pragmatic solution to polarization is simple: share your perspective on who is being harmed by an action, and listen to others’ fears. By doing this, we will all become more sympathetic citizens.\n\nMoral myths\n\nDespite its title, Outraged is a remarkably calm and inoffensive book. Its conversational style mirrors its conciliatory message. In pursuit of relatability, personal anecdotes are woven in along with psychological experiments, recounted with a clarity that renders them fresh and interesting.\n\nGray draws on his own psychological experiments and studies from other psychologists who study morality have sought to explore our intuitions about right and wrong through clever experiments and large surveys. The book aims to debunk three myths: that we are prone to aggression because we evolved as apex predators; that there are harmless wrongs; and that facts can change people’s attitudes and bridge divides.\n\nStructurally, these three sections align with a chronology of the past, present and future of human morality. Starting with our evolutionary heritage, Gray argues that “humans express online outrage for the same reason they expressed outrage in Stone Age tribes: to guard against societal harm and reinforce moral norms”. Same mindset, different era.\n\nHow conspiracies took root in our culture\n\nCrucially, Gray proposes that archaeologists have made a grievous error in their interpretation of the fossil record. Protection, not aggression, is the name of our evolutionary game. He urges us to discard the image of early humans as brutal hunters sharpening their spears for a predatory chase; instead, we should view them as hunted creatures trying to survive amid roving dangers. Evolutionarily, we were not predatory villains, Gray maintains — we were pretty weak prey.\n\nGray cares about this because “the assumption that humans are predators makes our moral opponents seem predatory — cold and calculating — when they do bad things”.\n\nDebunking a myth often entails denying the old narrative and completely reversing it — replacing one story with its opposite. In this case, the temptation is to claim that we were not predators, we were prey. But weren’t we both? In its early sections, the book gets a little stuck between presenting a clear theory and promoting misleading binaries. This is a wider disciplinary challenge for evolutionary psychology; amid sparse evidence and stretched implications, it can fall prey to a rigid retrospective logic that often oversimplifies the complexities of human nature.\n\nThe master key\n\nBut, fortunately, Outraged is a contemporary book concerned mostly with our present predicaments. The second myth it aims to disprove is the idea that our morality is a scattered assemblage of many heterogeneous components and levers. Instead of many moral foundations governing our instincts about good and evil, Gray insists that harm is “the master key of morality” (a recurring refrain).\n\nHe critiques theories that anchor moral concerns beyond harm, especially social psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s The Righteous Mind, whose shadow looms large over moral psychology and how people perceive the field. Outraged thus wishes to refute the notion (disseminated by Haidt) that there are ‘harmless wrongs’ – actions we perceive to be wrong but which we think hurt no one.\n\nMarshalling a range of real and thought experiments, Gray argues that “all moral judgments are psychologically grounded in harm, no matter whether you lean left or right”. Gray’s physiological experiments reveal that when a person is asked to physically imitate an act that is typically harmful, such as holding a realistic toy gun to someone else’s head, their body will be biologically disturbed.",

          "abstract": "Monica Saavedra advises people on how to move from academia into industry.Credit: National Institute of Agricultural Botany\n\nLambda Agri, based in Cambridge, UK, develops advanced materials to convert incident high-energy (ultraviolet, or UV) light into lower-energy (red) light efficiently. The applications of these materials include spray coatings for glass greenhouses that can increase crop yields.\n\nMonica Saavedra, the company’s chief executive, grew up wanting to be an astronaut and first developed a taste for experimental work during her bachelor’s degree in physics, when she did a summer placement at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK, helping researchers to make and test carbon-nanotube-based soft-matter detectors for α-, β- and γ-radiation.\n\nAfter a master’s degree in nanotechnology, she undertook a doctorate in nanomaterials at the UK National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. Alongside describing her own career journey, Saavedra offers advice to early-career researchers who want to move from academia to industry. She also highlights the importance of moving fast in commercial environments, using her company’s pivot from energy to agritech as an example. This month Saavedra won a 2025 Women in Innovation award, run by Innovate UK, the country's innovation agency.\n\nTell us about your career journey as an entrepreneur.\n\nIn 2012, I joined Nexeon, an early-stage company based in Abingdon, UK, developing silicon batteries. The following year, I left for a research-scientist role at Cambridge-based DNA-sequencing developer Base4 Innovation.\n\nFour years later, I joined Solaris Photonics, also based in Cambridge, as its chief technology officer (CTO), developing materials to increase the output of solar cells. Around that time, a colleague and I discussed setting up a company to make solar cells using quantum dots, which would have a bigger output than conventional silicon solar cells. I had had a similar idea around ten years previously, when I was doing my MSc — it was one of those scribbles that you do at the side of the page while the lecturer is speaking.\n\nThe company became Lambda Agri. I was its CTO originally and became chief executive in March last year.\n\nBeing a founder enabled me to wear lots of hats — one day CTO, marketing or human resources, another day chief executive. I especially enjoy hands-on involvement, making things in the laboratory, doing prototyping projects using computer-aided design and 3D printing or advising the scientists on optical physics.\n\nI also like how start-up companies are more agile than the large corporates; they are better enablers for inventiveness. I like the challenge of working fast. Smaller companies can bring more novelty into the practical realms of everyday life and, therefore, be instrumental in saving lives and the planet more quickly.\n\nWhat were the challenges and benefits of switching roles?\n\nSince switching to chief executive, my key focus is the financing and investor-relations side of the business. I was already involved in applying for funding, updating the pitch deck and having conversations with investors, so it was not a complete change. Investors expect the chief executive to be technical at an early-stage company, to increase credibility, so my CTO experience is beneficial.\n\nThe investment environment over recent years has been challenging, and even more so for women. In Europe, for example, start-up companies founded by women raised only 1.8% of the capital invested in start-ups by venture capitalists in 2023.\n\nAfter becoming chief executive, I adopted a range of measures to get it on a firmer financial footing.\n\nFirst, to minimize gender bias, I decided to approach raising funds through diversity-friendly pitch competitions (Santander X and Tech Nation are two examples).\n\nThe competitions and accelerators we participated in deviated from the current venture-capital landscape by having a much stronger female presence as the funding decision makers: approximately 30–40% female. In my experience, typically around 10–20% of venture-capital investors are female.\n\nSecond, I prioritized accelerators with grants that didn’t require match funding (a mechanism in which companies have to invest an equal sum from another source into the grant-funded project). Third, I sought equity-free funding (capital funding that does not transfer ownership of the company to investors).\n\nThese measures help to keep investors happy by minimizing dilution, which is the reduction in the percentage of existing shareholders’ equity that occurs when new shares are issued.\n\nOn one occasion, I attended a national pitch competition when I was heavily pregnant with my second child. Luckily, a representative of a family office (an investment fund managing a family’s private wealth) who was in the audience really enjoyed the pitch, and invested £100,000 (US$124,000).\n\nI live in hope that pitching events will one day be baby-friendly. At the time, I was working days, nights and weekends, with a toddler to look after as well. I have not had a day off, not even on the day my second child was born four months ago. The company has always been the ‘other baby’. I do not necessarily recommend this way of working to others, but it works for me as a mother, and I do have support, which is important.\n\nFundraising requires a focused effort that cannot stop until it’s achieved by a drop-dead deadline. Your employees have families to feed. People you care about have invested money in the business. You have to make it work if you believe in the vision, which we all do.\n\nGetting the funding in place, despite the challenges, has helped me to work on my communication skills, which I always found difficult. Previously, I was much more comfortable with computers than with people. I have had to work hard to understand how to relate better to others and in the male-dominated corporate environment.\n\nHow do you attract talent?\n\nSome scientists are technically brilliant and bold, but lack the commercial or contextual view needed to produce things as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. This is sometimes difficult to deduce before making a new hire. When I’m hiring, I only stop looking once at least one very talented and driven woman has applied.\n\nCurrently, we employ five people and the overall gender balance is 40:60 female to male. We are striving to attain a better one, ideally a 50:50 split, particularly at board level. Just now, it’s me and two white British men, both very knowledgeable angel investors.\n\nI try to ensure that women’s technical skills are being recognized, and I do not let anyone assume that they will be more suited to people-facing roles, for example. Stereotypes about women’s capabilities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics still persist.",

Credit: johnandersonphoto/Getty\n\nOne of the world’s most fearsome crustaceans has evolved to deliver deadly punches to its prey without damaging its own body — and now, scientists have shown how. A study published on 6 February in Science1 reveals that the mantis shrimp’s punching limb — known as the dactyl club — has a multilayered structure that allows it to absorb the shock waves it generates when cracking the shells of molluscs or other crustaceans.\n\nThe findings could provide inspiration for the design of artificial materials with useful properties, says study co-author Maroun Abi Ghanem, a physicist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research who studies biomaterials at the University of Lyon, France. These could be used to make surgical implants that can collect energy beamed through tissue during ultrasounds, or mechanical filters for mobile phones and other electronics.\n\nChitin construction\n\nAbi Ghanem and his colleagues analysed the club of the peacock mantis shrimp (Odontodactylus scyllarus), a species native to the Indian and Pacific oceans.\n\nThe club’s exoskeleton, which contains a natural polymer called chitin and a calcium-containing mineral similar to that in human bones and teeth, has three layers. The innermost layer contains the ‘Bouligand structure’: in this layer, fibres of chitin are arranged like bundles of pencils that fan out in different directions, so that some point towards the exterior layers, some are parallel to them and some are at angles in between. The fibres’ orientations aren’t random, but vary in a periodic fashion that repeats every 500 micrometres or so.\n\nMantis shrimp's super colour vision debunked",

          "abstract": "For many countries in the Global South traditional poverty estimates are available only infrequently and at coarse spatial resolutions, if at all. This limits decision-makers’ and analysts’ ability to target humanitarian and development interventions and makes it difficult to study relationships between poverty and other natural and human phenomena at finer spatial scales. Advances in Earth observation and machine learning-based methods have proven capable of generating more granular estimates of relative asset wealth indices. They have been less successful in predicting the consumption-based poverty measures most commonly used by decision-makers, those tied to national and international poverty lines. For a study area including four countries in southern and eastern Africa, we pilot a two-step approach that combines Earth observation, accessible machine learning methods, and asset-based structural poverty measurement to address this gap. This structural poverty approach to machine learning-based poverty estimation preserves the interpretability and policy-relevance of consumption-based poverty measures, while allowing us to explain 72 to 78% of cluster-level variation in a pooled model and 40 to 54% even when predicting out-of-country.",

We also investigate the qualities teachers perceive top performers who are successful role models to have. We show that teachers associate a greater sense of learning autonomy and sense of being an example with top-performing girls compared to top-performing boys. Estimated effects are more pronounced among teachers with children and teachers in urban areas. Administrative data from a representative sample show limited observed differences between top-performing boys’ and girls’ educational outcomes that could justify the differences in teachers’ gender perceptions.

Across four multimethod studies ( N = 37,920) spanning both field and lab settings, we demonstrate that a gender debiasing intervention that replaces masculine language in job postings with synonymous gender-neutral language increases application rates among women and men whose self-identities are less aligned with masculinity.

          "abstract": "The Cassini missions have identified the tiger stripes on Enceladus as the source of both thermal emission and plume jets. The hot spots in the tiger stripes are highly localized, and the plumes suggest active hydrothermal processes within the subglacial ocean of Enceladus. However, understanding the mechanism responsible for the heat anomalies in the tiger stripes remains a challenge. About 60 y ago, geoscientist George Veronis proposed a model for cold water oceans, along with the classical notion of a 1/3 scaling relationship between vertical heat transfer and the Rayleigh number ( Ra ), a dimensionless number representing the strength of buoyancy driving the convection within the fluid body. In this study, by delving into the steady coherent rolls arising in Veronis’ model, we first confirm the existence of the classical scaling as proposed. We identify two distinct pathways, characterized by different flow patterns, that converge to the unified classical scaling. In scenarios where stratification resulting from the density’s nonlinear temperature dependence is insignificant, convection rolls with fixed (width-to-height) aspect ratios achieve the classical scaling as Ra approaches infinity. Conversely, under high stratification levels, convection rolls with a heat-transport-maximizing aspect ratio achieve the classical scaling. This investigation also reveals a notable correspondence between optimal coherent rolls and turbulent flow patterns. Based on these coherent rolls, we offer insights into the formation of heat anomalies in the tiger stripes. The predicted heat flux through the ocean and the lateral flow length, are consistent with the measurements obtained by the Cassini spacecraft.",

          "abstract": "Samaras are known for their elegant and robust autorotation, a resilience that persists in the adverse conditions imposed by high-speed raindrops. Like flying insects, samaras descending from tall trees are likely to be struck by raindrops in an intense storm. In this study, we detail the collision dynamics for impact regions across the samara body and the drop-shedding mechanisms that samaras exhibit to return to autorotation. Impacts across the samara body can pitch the samara up to 60 degrees and, in some cases, induce spanwise roll. Raindrops may shatter or remain intact upon impact, pushing the undamaged samara downward before autorotation is recovered. Drops that strike near the wingtip elicit the greatest recovery distance, while impacts onto the nutlet mass are the least disruptive to the samara and most likely to cause the drop to induce fragmentation. Faster drops allow for quicker drop shedding and a subsequent rapid return to autorotation in less than 50 ms. Our results indicate that samaras are robust to raindrop impacts and consistently recover autorotation, resulting in a minor reduction in dispersal distance. To recover, the entire drop is shed from the spinning samara over a time closely tied to the shedding mode and ensuing drop rejection forces.",

          "abstract": "We recently reported that microinjection of Xenopus nodal-related ( xnr ) mRNAs into β-catenin-depleted Xenopus embryos rescued a complete dorsal axis. Xnrs mediate the signal of the Nieuwkoop center that induces the Spemann–Mangold organizer in the overlying mesoderm, a process inhibited by the Nodal antagonist Cerberus-short (CerS). However, β-catenin also induces a second signaling center in the dorsal prospective ectoderm, designated the Blastula Chordin and Noggin Expression (BCNE) center, in which the homeobox gene siamois ( sia ) plays a major role. In this study, we asked whether the Xnrs and Sia depend on each other or function on parallel pathways. Expression of both genes induced β-catenin-depleted embryos to form complete axes with heads and eyes via the activation of similar sets of downstream organizer-specific genes. Xnrs did not activate siamois , and, conversely, Sia did not activate xnrs , although both were induced by β-catenin stabilization. Depletion with morpholinos revealed a robust role for the downstream target Chordin. Remarkably, Chordin depletion prevented all ectopic effects resulting from microinjection of the mRNA encoding the maternal cytoplasmic determinant Huluwa , including the radial expansion of brain tissue and the ectopic expression of the ventral gene sizzled . The main conclusion was that the BCNE and Nieuwkoop centers provide a double assurance mechanism for axial formation by independently activating similar downstream transcriptional target gene repertoires.

          "abstract": "Cell surface receptors, including erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A4 (EphA4), are important in regulating hippocampal synapse loss, which is the key driver of memory decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the cell-specific roles and mechanisms of EphA4 are unclear. Here, we show that EphA4 expression is elevated in hippocampal CA1 astrocytes in AD conditions. Specific knockout of astrocytic EphA4 ameliorates excitatory synapse loss in the hippocampus in AD transgenic mouse models. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis revealed that EphA4 inhibition specifically decreases a reactive astrocyte subpopulation with enriched complement signaling, which is associated with synapse elimination by astrocytes in AD. Importantly, astrocytic EphA4 knockout in an AD transgenic mouse model decreases complement tagging on excitatory synapses and excitatory synapses within astrocytes. These findings suggest an important role of EphA4 in the astrocyte-mediated elimination of excitatory synapses in AD and highlight the crucial role of astrocytes in hippocampal synapse maintenance in AD.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 sometimes appear to be creative, solving novel tasks often with a few demonstrations in the prompt. These tasks require the models to generalize on distributions different from those from training data—which is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach OOD generalization remains an open and underexplored question. We examine OOD generalization in settings where instances are generated according to hidden rules, including in-context learning with symbolic reasoning. Models are required to infer the hidden rules behind input prompts without any fine-tuning. We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic example and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs, focusing on a type of component known as induction heads. We found that OOD generalization and composition are tied together—models can learn rules by composing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization. Furthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts as a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we refer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the Z 2 QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a hidden large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.",

          "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis , remains a significant global health threat, affecting an estimated 10.6 million people in 2022. The emergence of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant strains necessitates the development of novel and effective drugs. Accelerating the determination of mechanisms of action (MOAs) for these drugs is crucial for advancing TB treatment. This study introduces MycoBCP, a unique adaptation of bacterial cytological profiling (BCP) tailored to M. tuberculosis , utilizing the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within BCP to overcome challenges posed by traditional image analysis techniques. Using MycoBCP, we analyzed the morphological effects of various antimicrobial compounds on M. tuberculosis , capturing broad patterns rather than relying on precise cell segmentation. This approach circumvented issues such as cell clumping and uneven staining, which are prevalent in M. tuberculosis . In a blind test, MycoBCP accurately identified the MOA for 96% of the compounds, with a single misclassification of rifabutin, which was incorrectly categorized as affecting translation rather than transcription. The similar morphologies resulting from transcription and translation inhibition indicate a need for further refinement to distinguish them more effectively. Application of MycoBCP to a series of antitubercular agents successfully identified known MOAs and revealed unique effects, demonstrating its utility in early drug discovery and development. Our findings underscore the potential of CNN-based BCP to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MOA determination, particularly for challenging pathogens like M. tuberculosis . MycoBCP represents a significant advancement in TB drug development, offering a robust and adaptable method for high-throughput screening of antimicrobial compounds.",

          "abstract": "Fluid flows are dominant features of many bacterial environments, and flow can often impact bacterial behaviors in unexpected ways. For example, the most common type of cardiovascular infection is heart valve colonization by gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis (endocarditis). This behavior is counterintuitive because heart valves experience high shear rates that would naively be expected to reduce colonization. To determine whether these bacteria preferentially colonize higher shear rate environments, we developed a microfluidic system to quantify the effect of flow conditions on the colonization of S. aureus and E. faecalis . We find that the preferential colonization in high flow of both species is not specific to heart valves and can be found in simple configurations lacking any host factors. This behavior enables bacteria that are outcompeted in low flow to dominate in high flow. Surprisingly, experimental and computational studies reveal that the two species achieve this behavior via distinct mechanisms. S. aureus grows in cell clusters and produces a dispersal signal whose transport is affected by shear rate. Meanwhile, E. faecalis grows in linear chains whose mechanical properties result in less dispersal in the presence of higher shear force. In addition to establishing two divergent mechanisms by which these bacteria each preferentially colonize high-flow environments, our findings highlight the importance of understanding bacterial behaviors at the level of collective interactions among cells. These results suggest that distinct multicellular nanocolony morphologies have previously unappreciated costs and benefits in different environments, like those introduced by fluid flow.",

It is widely accepted that hemolysis-derived toxic molecules are cleared by macrophages or metabolized in hepatocytes. In zebrafish, we found that scavenger endothelial cells (SECs), a specialized endothelium with remarkable endocytosis capability, engulf both macromolecular hemoglobin (Hb) and small molecular unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), two primary toxic byproducts of hemolysis. These engulfment processes are mediated by the scavenger receptor Stab2. To demonstrate the protective function of SECs during hemolysis, we employed a zebrafish model of erythropoietic porphyria, characterized by excessive protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation due to ferrochelatase mutation, leading to light-sensitive hemolysis and larva death. We found that SECs facilitate the clearance of excess PPIX via Stab2, thereby mitigating PPIX-induced larval mortality. In addition, mouse SECs possess a conserved capability of scavenging Hb/UCB/PPIX. In conclusion, our study identifies SECs as a detoxification system during physiological and pathological hemolysis, shedding light on their protective role against hemolysis-induced damage.",

Performing the experiments as a function of temperature demonstrates that the G4 reshapes the underlying driving forces of protein folding.

          "abstract": "Hemizygous genes, which are present on only one of the two homologous chromosomes of diploid organisms, have been mainly studied in the context of sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes. However, these genes can also occur on the autosomes of diploid plants due to structural variants (SVs), such as a deletion/insertion of one allele, and this phenomenon largely unexplored in plants. Here, we investigated the genomic and epigenomic landscapes of hemizygous genes across 22 genomes with varying propagation histories: eleven clonal lineages, seven outcrossed samples, and four inbred and putatively homozygous genomes. We identified SVs leading to genic hemizygosity. As expected, very few genes (0.01 to 1.2%) were hemizygous in the homozygous genomes, representing negative controls. Hemizygosity was appreciable among outcrossed lineages, averaging 8.7% of genes, but consistently elevated for the clonal samples at 13.8% genes, likely reflecting heterozygous SV accumulation during clonal propagation. Compared to diploid genes, hemizygous genes were more often situated in centromeric than telomeric regions and experienced weaker purifying selection. They also had reduced levels of expression, averaging ~20% of the expression levels of diploid genes, violating the evolutionary model of dosage compensation. We also detected higher DNA methylation levels in hemizygous genes and transposable elements, which may contribute to their reduced expression. Finally, expression profiles showed that hemizygous genes were more specifically expressed in contexts related to fruit development, organ differentiation, and stress responses. Overall, hemizygous genes accumulate in clonally propagated lineages and display distinct genetic and epigenetic features compared to diploid genes, shedding unique insights into genetic studies and breeding programs of clonal crops.",

          "abstract": "The seed is a landmark plant adaptation where the embryo is sheltered by a protective seed coat to facilitate dispersion. In Arabidopsis , the seed coat, derived from ovular integuments, plays a critical role in maintaining dormancy, ensuring germination occurs during a favorable season. Dormancy is enhanced by cold temperatures during seed development by affecting seed coat permeability through changes in apoplastic barriers. However, their localization and composition are poorly understood. This study identifies and investigates a polar barrier in the seed coat’s outer integument (oi1) cells. We present histological, biochemical, and genetic evidence showing that cold promotes polar seed coat lignification of the outer integument 1 (oi1) cells and suberization throughout the entire oi1 cell boundary. The polar oi1 barrier is regulated by the transcription factors MYB107 and MYB9. MYB107, in particular, is crucial for the lignified polar oi1 barrier formation under cold temperatures. The absence of the oi1 barrier in mutant seeds correlates with increased permeability and reduced dormancy. Our findings elucidate how temperature-induced modifications in seed coat composition regulate dormancy, highlighting the roles of suberin and lignin in this process.",

The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer and plays a pivotal role in tumor suppression. RPRM is a target gene of p53 known to be involved in tumor suppression, but its molecular function has remained elusive. Here, we report that Reprimo (the protein product of RPRM ) is secreted and extrinsically induces apoptosis in recipient cells. We identified FAT1, FAT4, CELSR1, CELSR2, and CELSR3, members of the protocadherin family, as receptors for Reprimo. Subsequent analyses revealed that Reprimo acts upstream of the Hippo–YAP/TAZ–p73 axis and induces apoptosis by transactivating various proapoptotic genes. In vivo analyses further support the tumor-suppressive effects of secreted Reprimo. These findings identify the p53–Reprimo–Hippo–YAP/TAZ–p73 axis as an extrinsic apoptosis pathway that plays a crucial role in tumor suppression.

Among them, thermosalient crystals are particularly favored thanks to their efficient energy conversions and rapid responses. However, the mechanisms for the mechanical responses of thermosalient crystals remain largely unclear. Herein we demonstrate that thermosalient effects of molecular crystals could be driven by thermoelastic twisting behaviors. The crystal, based on a model compound with rigid dibenzothiophene sulfone planes and flexible ethoxy chains, can spontaneously self-heal from mechanical fractures. Upon heating, the crystal undergoes remarkable thermosalient behaviors driven by a distinctive left- or right-handed twisting. This thermoelastic twisting converts thermal energy into elastic potential energy, which is further released as kinetic energy upon untwisting to drive the crystal jump. Our demonstration on thermoelastic twisting–induced crystal jumping offers a different perspective on the origins of thermosalient crystals and could provide inspiration for future engineering and application of dynamic molecular crystals.",

FSH is essential for female fertility because mice lacking FSH ( Fshb KO ) are anestrous and infertile. Although several in vitro cell culture and ex vivo approaches combined with pharmacological hormone treatment were used to identify FSH-regulated genes, how FSH orchestrates ovarian gene networks in vivo has not been investigated. Whether FSH-regulated genes display estrous stage–specific expression changes has also not been studied. Here, we functionally rescued Fshb null mice with a gonadotrope-targeted HFSHB transgene and performed RNA-Seq analysis on ovarian RNAs obtained from FSH-intact ( WT ), FSH-deficient ( Fshb KO ), and FSH-rescue ( HFSHB + rescue) mice. By comparing WT vs. Fshb KO and Fshb KO vs. HFSHB + rescue ovarian gene expression datasets, we identified FSH-responsive genes in vivo. Cross interrogation of these datasets further allowed us to identify several transcription factors (TFs) and RNA-binding proteins specific to FSH-regulated genes. In an independent set of experiments, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on ovarian RNAs from mice in diestrous (DE), proestrous (PE), and estrous (E) and identified estrous stage–specific ovarian gene expression patterns. Interestingly, many of the FSH-regulated TFs themselves were estrous-stage specifically expressed. We found that ESR2 and GATA6, two known FSH-responsive TFs, and their target genes are reciprocally regulated with distinct patterns of expression in estrous stages. Together, our in vivo models and RNA-Seq analyses identify FSH-regulated ovarian genes in specific estrous stages that are under transcriptional and posttranscriptional control.",

Here, we present a yellow-breasted capuchin ( Sapajus xanthosternos ) stone tool assemblage from Fazenda Matos, Brazil, to explore the variability of the material signatures associated with percussive tool use. Our analysis of this record demonstrates many archaeological features previously associated with intentional flake production. This includes hammerstones with substantial percussive damage and a range of flaked and detached pieces. Comparative analyses with other flaked primate and hominin assemblages reveals that, unintentional flake production is a universal component of stone hammer and anvil percussive behaviors, suggesting that similar behaviors by early hominins may have led to stone flake technology and that this record may have been highly variable. To fully understand the origins of hominin stone technology, a broad spectrum of material records including both hominin and primate must be considered.",

Tumors progress during therapy to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by restoring AR signaling and maintaining luminal identity or by converting through lineage plasticity to a neuroendocrine (NE) identity or double-negative CRPC (DNPC) lacking luminal or NE identities. Here, we show that DNPC cells express genes defining basal, club, and hillock epithelial cells from benign prostate. We identified KLF5 as a regulator of genes defining this mixed basal, club, and hillock cell identity in DNPC models. KLF5-mediated upregulation of RARG uncovered a DNPC sensitivity to growth inhibition by retinoic acid receptor agonists, which down-regulated KLF5 and up-regulated AR. These findings offer CRPC classifications based on prostate epithelial cell identities and nominate KLF5 and RARG as therapeutic targets for CRPC displaying a mixed basal, club, and hillock identity.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how time perception adapts to cognitive demands remains a significant challenge. In some contexts, the brain encodes time categorically (as “long” or “short”), while in others, it encodes precise time intervals on a continuous scale. Although the ventral premotor cortex (VPC) is known for its role in complex temporal processes, such as speech, its specific involvement in time estimation remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated how the VPC processes temporal information during a time interval comparison task (TICT) and a time interval categorization task (TCT) in primates. We found a notable heterogeneity in neuronal responses associated with time perception across both tasks. While most neurons responded during time interval presentation, a smaller subset retained this information during the working memory periods. Population-level analysis revealed distinct dynamics between tasks: In the TICT, population activity exhibited a linear and parametric relationship with interval duration, whereas in the TCT, neuronal activity diverged into two distinct dynamics corresponding to the interval categories. During delay periods, these categorical or parametric representations remained consistent within each task context. This contextual shift underscores the VPC’s adaptive role in interval estimation and highlights how temporal representations are modulated by cognitive demands.",

          "abstract": "The two-line hybrid rice system, a cutting-edge hybrid rice breeding technology, has greatly boosted global food security. In thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines, the critical sterility-inducing temperature (CSIT; the temperature at which TGMS lines change from male fertile to complete male sterile) acts as a key threshold. We recently uncovered that thermo-sensitive genic male sterility 5 ( tms5 ), a sterile locus presenting in over 95% of TGMS lines, leads to the overaccumulation of 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (cP)-ΔCCA-tRNAs and a deficiency of mature tRNAs, which underlies the molecular mechanism of tms5 -mediated TGMS. However, there are a few reports on the regulatory mechanism controlling CSIT. Here, we identified a suppressor of tms5 , an amino acid substitution (T552I) in the rice Rqc2 (ribosome-associated quality control 2), increases the CSIT in tms5 lines through its C-terminal alanine and threonine modification (CATylation) activity. This substitution alters tRNA selectivity, leading to the recruitment of different tRNAs to the A-site of ribosome and CATylation rate by OsRqc2 during ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a process that rescues stalled ribosomes and degrades abnormal nascent chains during translational elongation. Further, the mutation restores the levels of mature tRNA-Ser/Ile to increase the CSIT of tms5 lines. Our findings reveal the origin of overaccumulated cP-ΔCCA-tRNAs in tms5 lines, further deepening our understanding of the regulatory network in governing CSIT of TGMS lines containing tms5.",

          "abstract": "Plant cytokinesis requires coordination between the actin cytoskeleton, microtubules, and membranes to guide division plane formation and cell plate expansion; how these regulatory factors are coordinated remains unknown. The actin cytoskeleton assembly is controlled by several actin nucleation factors, such as the SCAR/WAVE complex, which regulates actin nucleation and branching through the activation of the ARP2/3 complex. The activity of these actin regulatory proteins is likely influenced by interactions with specific membranes; however, the molecular basis and the biological relevance of SCAR–membrane interactions are also unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the ER–PM tethering protein VAP27-1 directly interacts with SCAR2 at the ER membrane and that they colocalize to guide cell plate orientation during cell division. In the root meristem, both VAP27-1 and SCAR2 exhibit polarized localization at the cell plates, where the interaction between ER and PM is abundant. VAP27-1 recruits SCAR2 to the cell division plane, where there is a high concentration of actin filaments. In the vap27-1346 mutant, the densities of cortical ER, SCAR2, and consequently actin filaments are significantly reduced at the cell division plane, affecting cell plate orientation, cell division, and root development. A similar phenomenon is also observed in the scar1234 mutant, suggesting that VAP27 and SCAR proteins regulate cell division through a similar pathway. In conclusion, our data reveal a plant-specific function of VAP27-regulated ER–PM interaction and advance our understanding of plant ER–PM contact site and its role in cell division.",

          "abstract": "In most eukaryotic organisms, cells that rely on continuous cell division employ the enzyme telomerase which replenishes chromosome termini through the addition of telomeric repeats. In budding yeast, the telomerase holoenzyme is composed of a catalytic core associated with two regulatory subunits, Est1 and Est3. The Est1 protein binds a telomere-specific RPA-like complex to recruit telomerase to chromosome ends. However, the regulatory function of the Est3 subunit has remained elusive. We report here that an interaction between Est3 and the canonical RPA complex is required for in vivo telomerase function, as revealed by mutations in RPA2 that confer an Est (Ever shorter telomeres) phenotype, characteristic of a defect in the telomerase pathway. Binding between RPA and telomerase, which is supported by compensatory charge-swap mutations in EST3 and RPA2 , utilizes a surface on Est3 that is structurally analogous to an interface on the human TPP1 protein that is required for telomerase processivity. Mutations in a subset of conserved DNA contact residues in RPA also result in short telomeres and senescence, which we show is due to a requirement for DNA binding after RPA interacts with telomerase. We propose that once RPA forms a complex with telomerase, RPA utilizes a subset of DNA-binding domains to stabilize the interaction between the telomerase active site and telomeric substrates, thereby facilitating enzyme processivity. These results, combined with prior observations, show that yeast telomerase interacts with two different high-affinity ssDNA-binding complexes, indicating that management of single-stranded DNA is integral to effective telomerase function.",

Here, we built a global dataset of trace-fossil occurrences from a comprehensive survey of 720 Ediacaran–Devonian units and show that the establishment of a modern-style deep-marine benthic ecosystem was protracted and coincident with global cooling and increase in oxygenation during the Ordovician. The formation of open burrows may have increased bioirrigation in the uppermost sediment zone, promoting ventilation and generating an ecosystem engineering feedback loop between bioturbation and pore-water oxygenation. Sharp changes in deep-marine bioturbation during the Devonian may have originated from oxygen variations resulting from climate-controlled oceanic circulation.",

          "abstract": "The tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau has been influenced by continental collision and postcollisional convergence of Indian and Eurasian plates, both of which have undoubtedly imposed their imprints on the lithosphere and upper-mantle structures beneath the collision zone. However, the mode by which the Indian Plate has subducted beneath Tibet, and its driving forces, have been highly uncertain. Here, we present seismic evidence from a full-waveform tomographic model that reveals flat subduction of the Indian Plate beneath nearly the entire plateau at ∼ 300 km depth, implying that the slab may have transitioned to positive/neutral buoyancy and is no longer capable of supporting steep-angle deep subduction. The horizontal distance over which the flat slab slides northward increases from west (where it collides with the Tarim lithospheric keel) to east (where it has resided approximately north of the Songpan-Ganzi Fold Belt beyond the Qiangtang Block). The Asian lithosphere is subducting beneath northeastern Tibet without colliding with the Indian slab. The low-velocity zone, with a thickness of 50 to 110 km, sandwiched between the Tibetan crust and Indian slab, is positively correlated with the high-elevation, low-relief topography of Tibet, suggesting partial melting of the uppermost mantle that has facilitated the growth and flatness of the plateau by adding buoyant material to its base. We propose that deep mantle convective currents, traced to the Réunion plume and imaged as large-scale low-velocity anomalies from the upper mantle under the Indian Plate downward toward the uppermost lower mantle under the Baikal-Mongolia Plateau, are the primary force driving the ongoing India–Asia postcollisional convergence.",

          "abstract": "The polyketide synthases (PKSs) in microbes and the cytoplasmic fatty acid synthases in humans (FASs) are related enzymes that have been well studied. As a result, there is a paradigm explaining in general terms how FASs repeatedly use a set of enzymatic domains to produce simple fats, while PKSs use the domains in a much more complex manner to produce pharmaceuticals and other elaborate molecules. However, most animals also have PKSs that do not conform to the rules described in microbes, including a large family of enzymes that bridge fatty acid and polyketide metabolism, the animal FAS-like PKSs (AFPKs). Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structures of two AFPKs from sea slugs. While the AFPK resemble mammalian FASs, their chemical products mimic those of PKSs in complexity. How then does the architecture of AFPKs facilitate this structural complexity? Unexpectedly, chemical complexity is controlled not solely by the enzymatic domains but is aided by the dynamics of the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a shuttle that moves intermediates between these domains. We observed interactions between enzyme domains and the linker-ACP domain, which, when manipulated, altered the kinetic properties of the enzyme to change the resulting chemical products.

Some information is much more salient for the decision at hand and merits closer scrutiny. The inattention decision model formalizes this choice and deduces how best to navigate through the potentially vast array of data when making decisions. In the rational formulation, the decision-maker commits fully to a subjective prior distribution over the possible states of the world that could be realized. We relax this assumption and look for a robustly optimal solution to the inattention problem by allowing the decision-maker to be ambiguity averse with respect to this prior. We feature a setup that is deliberately simple by a) assuming a discrete set of choices, b) using Shannon’s mutual information to quantify attention costs, and c) imposing relative entropy with respect to a baseline probability distribution to quantify prior divergence. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the robust solution and develop numerical methods to solve it. In comparison to the rational solution with no prior uncertainty, our decision-maker slants priors in more cautious or pessimistic directions when deducing how to allocate attention over the range of available information. This approach implements a form of robustness to prior misspecification, or equivalently, a form of ambiguity aversion. We explore some examples that show how the robust solution differs from the rational solution with a commitment to a subjective prior distribution and how it differs from imposing risk aversion.",

An SSP was engineered by fusing GFP lacking the C-terminal β-strand and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) lacking the N-terminal β-strand with an overlapping linker, which can be competitively incorporated into either the GFP or the DHFR moiety. In vivo and biochemical analyses, including atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, demonstrated that the SSP adopts two alternative conformations, which can be biased by point mutations and ligand binding. The drastic conformational change upon the ligand binding was directly visualized by high-speed AFM. Furthermore, the balance of the seesaw can be reversibly changed depending on buffer conditions. In summary, our design strategy for SSP provides a unique direction for creating artificial proteins with on–off behaviors.",

Many genetic ripening regulators have been identified, especially in the model system tomato, yet more remain to be discovered and integrated into comprehensive regulatory models. Most tomato ripening genes have been studied in pericarp tissue, though recent evidence indicates that locule tissue is a site of early ripening-gene activities. Here, we identified and functionally characterized an Ethylene Response Factor (ERF) gene, SlERF.D6 , by investigating tomato transcriptome data throughout plant development, emphasizing genes elevated in the locule during fruit development and ripening. SlERF.D6 loss-of-function mutants resulting from CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing delayed ripening initiation and carotenoid accumulation in both pericarp and locule tissues. Transcriptome analysis of lines altered in SlERF.D6 expression revealed multiple classes of altered genes including ripening regulators, in addition to carotenoid, cell wall, and ethylene pathway genes, suggesting comprehensive ripening control. Distinct regulatory patterns in pericarp versus locule tissues were observed, indicating tissue-specific activity of this transcription factor (TF). Analysis of SlERF.D6 interaction with target promoters revealed an APETALA 2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) TF ( SlDEAR2 ) as a target of SlERF.D6.

This exposure is associated with many negative health outcomes, from premature birth to sudden infant death syndrome and adverse neurodevelopmental disorders. This study demonstrates the use of surface-enhanced Raman and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopies for direct detection of PAHs/PACs in human placental tissue. We applied two spectroscopy-informed machine learning algorithms, Characteristic Peak Extraction (CaPE) and Characteristic Peak Similarity (CaPSim), to identify the specific PAHs and PACs present in the placenta of women who smoked tobacco cigarettes in pregnancy compared to spectra of the placenta from self-reported nonsmokers. CaPE and CaPSim analysis enabled a clear distinction between these two groups. Independent verification was accomplished by detecting PAH-DNA and PAC-DNA adducts in the smoking group by means of a 32 P-postlabeling assay. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining surface-enhanced spectroscopies with informed ML analysis for the streamlined detection of hazardous environmental compounds in human tissues, suggesting broader applications in clinical diagnostics and public health surveillance.",

          "abstract": "Male germ cells, which are responsible for producing millions of genetically diverse sperm through meiosis in the testis, rely on lactate as their central energy metabolite. Recent study has revealed that lactate induces epigenetic modification in cells through histone lysine lactylation. Here, we report dynamic histone lactylation at histone H4-lysine 5 (K5), -K8, and -K12 during meiosis prophase I in mouse spermatogenesis. By profiling the genome-wide occupancy of histone H4-K8 lactylation (H4K8la), which peaks at zygotene, our data show that H4K8la mark is observed at the promoters of genes exhibiting active expression with Gene Ontology functions enriched for meiosis. Notably, our data also demonstrate that H4K8la is closely associated with recombination hotspots, where machinery involved in the processing DNA double-stranded breaks, such as SPO11, DMC1, RAD51, and RPA2, is engaged. In addition, H4K8la was also detected at the meiosis-specific cohesion sites (marked by RAD21L and REC8) flanking the recombination hotspots. Functionally, our data show that lactate induces upregulation of key meiotic genes through H4K8la modifications. Additionally, H4K8la shows colocalization and interaction with PRDM9 at recombination hotspots. Finally, our data show that HBO1, a lactyltransferase, is highly expressed in meiotic germ cells. In vitro lactylation assays reveal that HBO1 induces H4K8la, and pharmacological inhibition of HBO1 in mice reduces H4K8la levels and disrupts meiosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that histone lactylation serves as an epigenetic mechanism that is involved in meiotic gene expression and recombination in male germ cells during spermatogenesis.",

Coupled with deep learning, explainable AI, and transfer learning data processing, the smart garment is capable of classifying six sleep states with an accuracy of 98.6%, maintaining excellent explainability (classification with low bias) and generalization (95% accuracy on new users with few-shot learning less than 15 samples per class) in practical applications, paving the way for next-generation daily sleep healthcare management.",

          "abstract": "Despite the rising challenge of antibiotic resistance, current approaches to eradicate nasal pathobionts Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae rely on antibacterials. An alternative is the artificial inoculation of commensal bacteria, i.e., probiotic treatment, supported by the increasing evidence for commensal-mediated inhibition of pathogens. To systematically investigate the potential of this approach, we developed a quantitative framework simulating the nasal microbiome dynamics by combining mathematical modeling with longitudinal microbiota data. By inferring community parameters using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing data and simulating the nasal microbial dynamics of patients colonized with S. aureus , we compared the decolonization performance of probiotic and antibiotic treatments under different assumptions on patients’ community composition and susceptibility profile. To further compare the robustness of these treatments, we simulated an S. aureus challenge and quantified the recolonization probability. Through in vitro experiments using nasal swabs of adults colonized with S. aureus , we confirmed that after antibiotic treatment, recolonization of S. aureus was inhibited in samples treated with a probiotic mixture compared to the nontreated control. Our results suggest that probiotic treatment outperforms antibiotics in terms of decolonization performance, recolonization robustness, and leads to less collateral reduction in the microbiome diversity. Thus, probiotic treatment may provide a promising alternative to combat antibiotic resistance, with the additional advantage of personalized treatment options via using the patient’s own metagenomic data. The combination of an in silico framework with in vitro experiments using clinical samples reported in this work is an important step forward to further investigate this alternative in clinical trials.",

In order to gain more detailed insight into PL33 activities we recombinantly expressed 10 PL33 members derived from all major environments and further elucidated the detailed biochemical and biophysical properties of five, showing that their substrate specificity is conferred by variations in tunnel length and topography. The key amino acids involved in catalysis and substrate interactions were identified, and employing a combination of complementary biochemical, structural, and modeling approaches, we show that the tunnel topography is induced by substrate binding to the glycan.

RNA imaging methods for spatiotemporal monitoring of RNA dynamics would facilitate the discovery of unknown functions of RNA, yet improving RNA imaging is challenging because of limitations in methods for directly monitoring native RNA, especially the dynamics of RNA transport and concentration fluctuation. Herein, a label-free and conformation switching–based genetically encoded sensor, termed the Dual-locked RNAtracker (Ducker), that realizes spatiotemporal monitoring of endogenous RNA dynamics in living cells is developed. In this Ducker system, a distinctive strategy is developed by employing one RNA target to initiate an allosteric event that triggers the two locked fluorogenic RNA aptamer (M18 Pepper) to restore the active structure and transmit adequate fluorescence signals. The intracellular circular Ducker (circDucker) realizes high-contrast and unbiased imaging of native mRNA abundance and monitors the fluctuations in RNA concentration. Importantly, it also enables spatiotemporal dynamic tracking of RNA translocation by directly visualizing the process of the mitochondrial lncCyt b undergoing bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic transport, indicating the bidirectional regulatory events in mitochondria and nucleus. Therefore, this highly accessible sensor affords a universal and robust platform for spatiotemporal monitoring of RNA abundance and translocation in complicated dynamic reaction networks in live systems, including mRNA, lncRNA, and microRNA, expanding the current toolbox of RNA research and shedding light on the unknown functions of RNA.",

Here, we study the evaporation dynamics of a tricomponent liquid film, consisting of water, ethanol, and trans-anethole oil (known as “ouzo”). With the preferential evaporation of ethanol, cellular convective structures are observed both in the thermal patterns and in the nucleated oil droplet patterns. However, the feature sizes of these two patterns can differ, indicating dual instability mechanisms dominated by either temperature or solute concentration. Using numerical simulations, we quantitatively compare the contributions of temperature and solute concentration on the surface tension. Our results reveal that the thermal Marangoni effect predominates at the initial evaporation stage, resulting in cellular patterns in thermal images, while the solutal Marangoni effect gradually becomes dominant. By regulating the transition time of this thermal-solutal-induced bistability and the nucleation time of oil microdroplets in the ternary mixture, the oil droplet patterns can be well controlled. This capability not only enhances our understanding of the evaporation dynamics but also paves the way for precise manipulation of nucleation and deposition processes at larger scales.",

Local mean-reversion and trend are found to be two additional key features, allowing us to identify new classes of jumps. Using our wavelet-based representation, we investigate the endogenous or exogenous nature of cojumps, which occur when multiple stocks experience price jumps within the same minute.

          "abstract": "HflX is a highly conserved ribosome-associated GTPase implicated in rescuing stalled ribosomes and mediating antibiotic resistance in several bacteria, including macrolide-lincosamide antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria. Mycobacterial HflXs carry a distinct N-terminal extension (NTE) and a small insertion, as compared to their eubacterial homologs. Here, we present several high-resolution cryo-EM structures of mycobacterial HflX in complex with the 70S ribosome and its 50S subunit, with and without antibiotics. These structures reveal a distinct mechanism for HflX-mediated ribosome splitting and antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria. Our findings indicate that the NTE of mycobacterial HflX induces persistent disordering of multiple 23S rRNA helices, facilitating the dissociation of the 70S ribosome and generating an inactive pool of 50S subunits. During this process, HflX undergoes a large conformational change that stabilizes its NTE. Mycobacterial HflX also acts as an anti-association factor by binding to predissociated 50S subunits. Our structures show that a mycobacteria-specific insertion in HflX reaches far into the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), such that it would overlap with the ribosome-bound macrolide antibiotics. However, in the presence of antibiotics, this insertion retracts, adjusts around, and interacts with the antibiotic molecules. These results suggest that mycobacterial HflX is agnostic to antibiotic presence in the PTC. It mediates antibiotic resistance by splitting antibiotic-stalled 70S ribosomes and inactivating the resulting 50S subunits.",

We recently reported that Mec1 regulates glucose starvation–induced autophagy through its direct binding to Atg13. However, the role of Mec1’s kinase activity in autophagy remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the kinase activity of Mec1 is required for glucose starvation–induced autophagy by regulating the phagophore assembly site (PAS) recruitment of Atg9 vesicles. Mechanistic and functional analyses identified Atg9 as a direct phosphorylation substrate of Mec1, with phosphorylation occurring at the S35, T203, and T243 sites. Mutations at these sites reduce the association of Atg9 with Atg17, Atg23, and Atg27, thereby impairing the PAS recruitment of Atg9 vesicles. Notably, we found that the Mec1–Atg13 binding is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of Atg9 by Mec1. Furthermore, Mec1-mediated phosphorylation of Atg9 is also crucial for the PAS recruitment of Atg9 vesicles in response to DNA damage. We thus propose that Mec1’s kinase activity regulates the PAS recruitment of Atg9 vesicles by phosphorylating Atg9 in response to energy stress and DNA damage.",

While recent studies have significantly advanced the understanding of seagrass wave attenuation in pure-wave conditions, the presence of a current introduces several complications that have yet to be fully explored. In the present study, we quantify the wave attenuation of seagrass canopies in the presence of a current parallel to the direction of wave propagation via experiments conducted with dynamically scaled mimics of seagrass installed in a laboratory flume facility. The dataset we present is the largest of its kind and spans a broad range of wave properties, current velocities, water depths, and plant densities for a total of over 300 experiments. Using our experimental results, we show that the commonly employed approach of modeling wave attenuation as a result of vegetation drag works well for a range of conditions but underpredicts systematically when turbulence generated by the interaction between the seagrass canopy and the current is sufficiently strong. We then employ phenomenological arguments and experimental data to identify a nondimensional parameter that effectively quantifies the relative importance of turbulence and drag in dictating the overall observed wave attenuation. Moreover, we propose a simple but physically based modeling approach that is consistent with the proposed phenomenology and can be used for applications in coastal waters.",

The acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) by an ancestral nidovirus enabled crossing of the 20 kb barrier. Other factors constraining genome size variations in nidoviruses remain poorly defined. We assemble 76 genome sequences of invertebrate nidoviruses from &gt;500.000 published transcriptome experiments and triple the number of known nidoviruses with &gt;36 kb genomes, including a 64 kb RNA genome. Many of the identified viral lineages acquired putative enzymatic and other protein domains linked to genome size, host phyla, or virus families. The inserted domains may regulate viral replication and virion formation, or modulate infection otherwise. We classify ExoN-encoding nidoviruses into seven groups and four subgroups, according to canonical and noncanonical modes of viral replicase expression by ribosomes and genomic organization (reModes). The most-represented group employing the canonical reMode comprises invertebrate and vertebrate nidoviruses, including coronaviruses. Six groups with noncanonical reModes include invertebrate nidoviruses with 31-to-64 kb genomes. Among them are viruses with segmented genomes and viruses utilizing dual ribosomal frameshifting that we validate experimentally. Moreover, largest polyprotein length and genome size in nidoviruses show reMode- and host phylum-dependent relationships. We hypothesize that the polyprotein length increase in nidoviruses may be limited by the host-inherent translation fidelity, ultimately setting a nidovirus genome size limit. Thus, expansion of ExoN-encoding RNA virus genomes, the vertebrate/invertebrate host division, the control of viral replicase expression, and translation fidelity are interconnected.",

Plasma separation cards (PSC) collect and preserve a dried specimen, which makes them practical solutions for decentralized sample collection and transport in limited-resource settings. However, physiological variations in hematocrit levels can introduce significant variability in the quality of plasma generated by commercial PSCs and can lead to inaccurate test results and clinical decisions. In addition to hematocrit-dependent sampling, the Roche PSC, a standard for dried plasma collection, is known to induce considerable hemolysis, which further impacts specimen quality, concordance with liquid plasma, and the overall benefit of microsampling. We address these gaps with a patterned dried plasma spot (pDPS) card, which generates plasma with improved hematocrit independence and minimal hemolysis. This study directly compares pDPS cards to the Roche PSC to measure HIV viral load. Analysis of viral load from 75 donors revealed strong agreement in sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and viral load band placement between devices, with quantitative metrics suggesting improved performance for pDPS cards. In reflexive genotyping, remnant dried blood from pDPS cards exhibited greater success than Roche PSC in amplification and sequencing (71% vs. 62%) and detecting drug resistance mutations (63% vs. 42%). Based on this performance, pDPS cards can be versatile across multiple analytical platforms, integrate seamlessly into existing clinical laboratory workflows, and aid clinicians in making accurate treatment decisions.",

Zymocin is encoded by a killer plasmid or virus-like element (VLE), which is a linear DNA molecule located in the cytosol. We hypothesized that a tRNA-cleaving toxin similar to zymocin may have caused the three parallel changes to the nuclear genetic code that occurred during yeast evolution, in which the codon CUG became translated as Ser or Ala instead of Leu. However, zymocin-like toxins are rare — both among species, and among strains within a species —and only four toxins of this type have previously been discovered. Here, we identified 45 zymocin-like toxin genes in Saccharomycotina, the budding yeast subphylum, using a bioinformatics strategy, and verified that many of them are toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae when expressed. Some of the toxin genes are located on cytosolic VLEs, whereas others are on VLE-derived DNA integrated into the nuclear genome. The toxins are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and show evidence of positive selection. Toxin genes were found in five taxonomic orders of budding yeasts, including two of the three orders that reassigned CUG codons, indicating that VLEs have been parasites of yeast species for at least 300 My and that their existence predates the genetic code changes.",

This finding opens avenues for the rational design and development of inhibitors that selectively target proteins in this pathway, thereby mitigating AG ototoxicity. In this study, we generated a mouse model with a targeted deletion of GABARAPL1, a homolog of GABARAP, and another model deficient in both GABARAP and GABARAPL1. We found that normal hearing is unaffected by the depletion of these proteins. Remarkably, both proteins are essential for AG-induced hearing loss, with GABARAP playing a more significant role. To further explore the therapeutic potential, we designed and validated short hairpin RNAs targeting the mouse and human GABARAP gene. By inhibiting GABARAP expression in inner ear hair cells using adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference, we successfully prevented AG-induced hair cell death and subsequent hearing loss. Our findings underscore the critical role of GABARAP in AG ototoxicity and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing AG-induced hearing loss.",

This arms race between proteins encoded by X-linked Slxl1 / Slx and Y-linked Sly gene families can distort offspring sex ratio, but how these proteins compete remains unknown. Here, we report how Slxl1 / Slx and Sly encoded proteins compete in a protein family–specific and dose-dependent manner using yeast. Specifically, SLXL1 competes with SLY1 and SLY2 for binding to the Spindlin SPIN1. Similarly, SLX competes with SLY2 for binding the Spindlin SSTY2. These competitions are driven by the N termini of SLXL1, SLX, SLY1, and SLY2 binding to the third Tudor domains of SPIN1 and SSTY2. SLY1 and SLY2 form homo- and heterodimers, suggesting that the competition is between complex multimers. Residues under positive selection mapping to the interaction domains and rapid exon gain/loss are consistent with competition between the X- and Y-linked gene families. Our findings support a model in which dose-dependent competition of these X- and Y-linked encoded proteins to bind Spindlins occurs in haploid X- and Y-spermatids to influence X- versus Y-sperm fitness and thus sex ratio.",

The average decomposition rates of various litter types ranged from 0.74 to 4.01 y −1 across polar to tropics, showing a large geographical span. Litter substrate and climate directly explained 36 and 30% of the variations in decomposition rates, with the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio identified as the best predictor. In the absence of climate variables, litter substrate can effectively explain the variation, while the model’s predictive capacity decreased significantly after litter substrate was excluded.

A sat increased 12 to 15% and Rubisco enzyme activity ~40% in three independent transgenic events of both species.

          "abstract": "True to his campaign promises, on 20 January 2025, US President Donald Trump signed a broad range of Executive Orders, the scope of which ranged from renaming the Gulf of Mexico to “Gulf of America” to reinterpreting the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution by curtailing birthright citizenship. At least one order is relevant to social scientists studying political communication because it aims to “ restore freedom of speech and end federal censorship ” in online forums. At first glance, this is a laudable endeavor; who would disagree with bolstering freedom of speech? On closer inspection, however, this order is unlikely to live up to its stated intent. On the contrary, there are three reasons to fear that it may, ironically, have adverse implications for free speech and for democracy.",

          "abstract": "Ice streams are major regulators of sea level change. However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power due to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations reveal a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, they appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude to those measured geodetically, thereby providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.",

          "abstract": "Insulin resistance is a hallmark of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. Insulin’s actions go beyond metabolic cells and also involve blood vessels, where insulin increases capillary blood flow and delivery of insulin and nutrients. We show that adrenomedullin, whose plasma levels are increased in obese humans and mice, inhibited insulin signaling in human endothelial cells through protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B–mediated dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide–synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance. Endothelial loss or blockade of the adrenomedullin receptor improved obesity-induced insulin resistance. These findings identify a mechanism underlying obesity-induced systemic insulin resistance and suggest approaches to treat obesity-associated type 2 diabetes.",

          "abstract": "Cells have evolved mechanisms to distribute ~10 billion protein molecules to subcellular compartments where diverse proteins involved in shared functions must assemble. Here, we demonstrate that proteins with shared functions share amino acid sequence codes that guide them to compartment destinations. A protein language model, ProtGPS, was developed that predicts with high performance the compartment localization of human proteins excluded from the training set. ProtGPS successfully guided generation of novel protein sequences that selectively assemble in the nucleolus. ProtGPS identified pathological mutations that change this code and lead to altered subcellular localization of proteins. Our results indicate that protein sequences contain not only a folding code, but also a previously unrecognized code governing their distribution to diverse subcellular compartments.",

These symmetries often determine the system topology, which is made ever more complex with increased dimensionality. Quasicrystals have neither translational nor global rotational symmetry, yet they intrinsically inhabit a higher-dimensional space in which symmetry resurfaces. Here, we discovered topological charge vectors in four dimensions (4D) that govern the real-space topology of 2D quasicrystals and reveal their inherent conservation laws. We demonstrate control over the topology in pentagonal plasmonic quasilattices, mapped by both phase-resolved and time-domain near-field microscopy, showing that their temporal evolution continuously tunes the 2D projections of their distinct 4D topologies. Our work provides a route to experimentally probe the thermodynamic properties of quasicrystals and topological physics in 4D and above.",

          "abstract": "Under current nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, global warming is projected to reach 2.7°C above preindustrial levels. In this review, we show that at such a level of warming, the Arctic would be transformed beyond contemporary recognition: Virtually every day of the year would have air temperatures higher than preindustrial extremes, the Arctic Ocean would be essentially ice free for several months in summer, the area of Greenland that reaches melting temperatures for at least a month would roughly quadruple, and the area of permafrost would be roughly half of what it was in preindustrial times. These geophysical changes go along with widespread ecosystem disruptions and infrastructure damage, which, as we show here, could be substantially reduced by increased efforts to limit global warming.",

Spatial differences in soil moisture are perceived by root tips, leading to the patterning of new root branches toward available water in a process called hydropatterning.

Here, we developed an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and revealed substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection. Genetic analysis of hydropatterning confirmed the regulatory role of auxin and revealed that the gaseous hormone ethylene locally inhibits root branching from air-exposed tissues. Our results demonstrate how distinct signaling pathways translate spatial patterns of water availability to developmental programs that determine root architecture.",

Large-scale genome engineering methods effective in model organisms are frequently inapplicable, and systematic studies of gene function are few. We generated more than 175,000 transposon insertions in the Plasmodium knowlesi genome, averaging an insertion every 138 base pairs, and used this “supersaturation” mutagenesis to score essentiality for 98% of genes. The density of mutations allowed mapping of putative essential domains within genes, providing a completely new level of genome annotation for any Plasmodium species. Although gene essentiality was largely conserved across P. knowlesi , Plasmodium falciparum , and rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei , a large number of shared genes are differentially essential, revealing species-specific adaptations. Our results indicated that Plasmodium essential gene evolution was conditionally linked to adaptive rewiring of metabolic networks for different hosts.",

These two archetypes also form on eukaryotic exogenous sequences, depend on sequence composition, and can be predicted using neural networks trained on the native genome. They do not mix in the nucleus, leading to a bipartite nuclear compartmentalization, reminiscent of the organization of vertebrate nuclei.",

We used a long- and short-read hybrid approach to obtain a high-quality male genome. Comparative analysis of the sex chromosomes with their homologs in outgroups showed that the Y is highly rearranged and degenerated. Recombination suppression between X and Y extended in several steps and triggered a massive accumulation of repeats on the Y as well as in the nonrecombining pericentromeric region of the X, leading to giant sex chromosomes. Using sex phenotype mutants, we identified candidate sex-determining genes on the Y in locations consistent with their favoring recombination suppression events 11 and 5 million years ago.",

Major knowledge gaps in critical processes—spanning the atmosphere, ocean, ice sheets, underlying beds, ice shelves, and sea ice—create uncertainties in future projections, hindering climate adaptation and risk assessments of ice intervention strategies. Antarctica’s ice sheet could contribute 28 centimeters to sea level by 2100, and potentially more if we surpass warming thresholds that trigger instabilities and rapid retreat. We review recent advances in understanding the changing stability of the ice sheet margins and identify key processes that require further research. Progress requires high-resolution satellite data, targeted field campaigns, improved modeling, and refined theory. Increased investment and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to uncovering Antarctica’s hidden processes and reducing uncertainties in future projections.",

Our results demonstrate that the dactyl club’s periodic region functions as a dispersive, high-quality graded system, exhibiting Bloch harmonics, flat dispersion branches, ultraslow wave modes, and wide Bragg bandgaps in the lower megahertz range.

Here, we report that dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control engages a retrograde (mitonuclear) signaling program that impairs cellular identity and maturity in β-cells, hepatocytes, and brown adipocytes. Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Indeed, pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored β-cell identity following loss of mitochondrial quality control. Targeting mitochondrial retrograde signaling may therefore be promising in the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders.",

However, only with a whole Y chromosome assembly can candidate genes be validated experimentally and their locations determined and related to the suppression of recombination.

          "abstract": "Kidney dysfunction is a major cause of mortality, but its genetic architecture remains elusive. In this study, we conducted a multiancestry genome-wide association study in 2.2 million individuals and identified 1026 (97 previously unknown) independent loci. Ancestry-specific analysis indicated an attenuation of newly identified signals on common variants in European ancestry populations and the power of population diversity for further discoveries. We defined genotype effects on allele-specific gene expression and regulatory circuitries in more than 700 human kidneys and 237,000 cells. We found 1363 coding variants disrupting 782 genes, with 601 genes also targeted by regulatory variants and convergence in 161 genes. Integrating 32 types of genetic information, we present the “Kidney Disease Genetic Scorecard” for prioritizing potentially causal genes, cell types, and druggable targets for kidney disease.",

          "abstract": "The class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complexes I and II (PI3KC3-C1 and -C2) have vital roles in macroautophagy and endosomal maturation, respectively. We elucidated a structural pathway of enzyme activation through cryo-EM analysis of PI3KC3-C1. The inactive conformation of the VPS15 pseudokinase stabilizes the inactive conformation, sequestering its N -myristate in the N-lobe of the pseudokinase. Upon activation, the myristate is liberated such that the VPS34 lipid kinase catalyzes PI3P production on membranes. The VPS15 pseudokinase domain binds tightly to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and stabilizes a web of interactions to autoinhibit the cytosolic complex and to promote the activation upon membrane binding. These findings show in atomistic detail how the VPS34 lipid kinase is activated in the context of a complete PI3K complex.",

          "abstract": "Humpback whale song is a culturally transmitted behavior. Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law. These properties facilitate learning and may therefore arise because of their contribution to the faithful transmission of language over multiple cultural generations. If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.",

          "abstract": "Fast instinctive responses to environmental stimuli can be crucial for survival but are not always optimal. Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.",

However, the impact of nutrient metabolism on epigenetic modifications that control TEX differentiation remains unclear. We showed that TEX cells shifted from acetate to citrate metabolism by down-regulating acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) while maintaining ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) activity. This metabolic switch increased citrate-dependent histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferase KAT2A-ACLY interactions, at TEX signature genes while reducing acetate-dependent histone acetylation, dependent on p300-ACSS2 complexes, at effector and memory T cell genes. Nuclear ACSS2 overexpression or ACLY inhibition prevented TEX differentiation and enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses. These findings unveiled a nutrient-instructed histone code governing CD8 + T cell differentiation, with implications for metabolic- and epigenetic-based T cell therapies.",

However, quantum mechanics ultimately limits the metrological precision achievable with laser frequency combs. Quantum squeezing has led to substantial measurement improvements with continuous wave lasers, but experiments demonstrating metrological advantage with squeezed combs are less developed. Using the Kerr effect in nonlinear optical fiber, a 1-gigahertz frequency comb centered at 1560 nanometers is amplitude-squeezed by &gt;3 decibels (dB) over a 2.5-terahertz bandwidth. Dual-comb interferometry yields mode-resolved spectroscopy of hydrogen sulfide gas with a signal-to-noise ratio nearly 3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit. The quantum noise reduction leads to a twofold quantum speedup in the determination of gas concentration, with implications for high-speed measurements of multiple species in dynamic chemical environments.",

          "abstract": "Dengue fever poses major public health challenges, with climate change complicating control efforts. Yet, the full extent of climate change’s impact on dengue remains elusive. To investigate this, we used an advanced causal inference method to 16 diverse climatic regions in the Philippines. This method is capable of detecting nonlinear and joint effects of temperature and rainfall to dengue incidence. We found that temperature consistently increased dengue incidence throughout all the regions, while rainfall effects differed depending on the variation in dry season length, a factor previously overlooked. Specifically, our results showed that regions with low variation in dry season length experience a negative impact of rainfall on dengue incidence likely due to strong flushing effect on mosquito habitats, while regions with high variation in dry season length experience a positive impact, likely due to increased mosquito breeding sites. Our findings emphasize the need for tailored prevention strategies based on local climate conditions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.",

Previous assessments of temperature-related mortality, however, lack a comprehensive analysis of distinct impacts of temperature change across different timescales and characteristics. Using a longitudinal survey of 27,233 elderly Chinese citizens from 2005 to 2018, we establish connections between rising temperatures, temperature variability, and extreme heat with increased mortality risk, assessed through four annual metrics that combine temperature and humidity. The intensity and prolonged duration of extreme heat are found to have the greatest impact on mortality risk. Furthermore, by identifying heterogeneous impacts based on location, sex, age, obesity, income, and diet, we reveal the pathways through which temperature metrics are likely to influence mortality risk. Our study highlights the compound effects of rising temperatures for elderly populations, and it could be expanded to other countries and regions experiencing similar challenges due to an aging population experiencing warming conditions.",

We show that Asgard ESCRT-IIIB assembles into parallel arrays on planar membranes to initiate membrane deformation, from where it recruits ESCRT-IIIA to generate composite polymers. Last, we show that Asgard ESCRT-IIIA is able to remodel membranes into tubes as a likely prelude to scission.

Microtubule reorganization supports plant survival in saline-rich soils, but the underlying molecular mechanism in tree species remains unclear. In this study, we identified a salinity stress response mechanism in hybrid poplar seedlings. This mechanism involves regulation of microtubule dynamics by the microtubule-associated protein PLASMA MEMBRANE–ASSOCIATED CATION BINDING PROTEIN 1a (PagPCaP1a). Salinity stress induced PagPCaP1a expression and phase separation of PagPCaP1a protein to form PagPCaP1a condensates in a calcium-dependent manner. The formation of PagPCaP1a condensates was partially driven by the VEEEKK motif within the carboxyl terminus of the protein, which rapidly depolymerizes microtubules under salinity stress. Our study reveals that the liquid-liquid phase separation of PagPCaP1a represents an additional regulatory layer for microtubule depolymerization, and we propose an effective strategy to manipulate the phase separation of PagPCaP1a to improve plant stress tolerance.",

A fundamental question in understanding the plasma dynamics is how energy is transported and dissipated across scales. Here, we present spacecraft measurements in the terrestrial foreshock, a region upstream of the bow shock where the solar wind population coexists with the reflected ions. In this region, the fluid-scale, ultralow-frequency waves resonate with the reflected ions to modify the velocity distributions, which in turn cause the growth of the ion-scale, magnetosonic-whistler waves. The latter waves then resonate with the electrons, and the accelerated electrons contribute to the excitation of electron-scale, high-frequency whistler waves. These observations demonstrate that the chain of wave-particle resonances is an efficient mechanism for cross-scale energy transfer, which could redistribute the kinetic energy and accelerate the particles upstream of the shocks.",

Last, we introduce how organoid technology offers a potentially valuable approach to advance our understanding of MAIT cell tissue homing by providing a more physiologically relevant model that mimics the human gut tissue. These models may enable a detailed investigation of the gut-specific homing mechanisms of MAIT cells.

In a series of 150 patients with CO poisoning, we found marked elevations of blood-borne inflammatory filamentous (F-) actin–coated microparticles (MPs), neutrophil activation, and a 90% reduction in the normal level of plasma gelsolin (pGSN), a protein capable of lysing F-actin–coated MPs. This led to studies in a murine model where the same events occur and cause neuroinflammation with cognitive dysfunction. All events are recapitulated when F-actin MPs are injected intravenously, which establishes a blood-to-brain-to-blood inflammatory cycle that persists for weeks. All changes, including cognitive dysfunction, can be abrogated by an injection of human recombinant pGSN within 2 weeks after CO poisoning. These findings demonstrate that CO-induced neurological injury has an inflammatory etiology. Because of MP-mediated communications between the brain and systemic circulation, CO-induced cognitive deficits may be reversible with a pharmaceutical intervention.",

Our approach facilitates rapid approximate solutions with a scalable circuit topology and expedites the high-precision refinement process by substantially reducing the digital-to-analog conversion overhead. We experimentally validated this methodology using a heterogeneous computing system. We performed simulations of multiple scientific problems on these circuits, including solving the diffusion equation and modeling equilibration in silicon P-N junctions. Notably, our memristive solver, combined with digital refinement, achieved software-equivalent precision (with an error of 10 −12 ). Compared to conventional digital processing units, this approach offered a 128-fold improvement in solution speed and a 160-fold reduction in energy consumption.

Based on the skin, we design a soft mask that allows switching between at least eight human faces at a time. The soft mask is lightweight, thin, and fits the wearer’s head. Its actuation is silent and safe, and can realize facial switching, including facial color and shape. By wearing the soft mask, robots can show facial changes and expression modulation, and humans can change their faces as needed. Our work enables the implementation of transforming a human into other humans in the real world to achieve camouflage and expression, which, to date, exists only in people’s imagination.",

Here, we investigate changes in permafrost under net-zero and negative emissions, based on idealized emission-driven simulations using a state-of-the-art Earth system model. While acting as a net ecosystem carbon sink during most of the positive emission phase, permafrost becomes a net ecosystem carbon source just before reaching net-zero and negative emissions. Permafrost slowly recovers, especially in regions with high organic carbon content, and net ecosystem carbon loss persists until the end of simulations, resulting in a cumulative net ecosystem carbon loss of approximately 14 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in both scenarios. In addition, methane emissions increase under net-zero and negative emissions, due to the irreversibility of the inundated areas. We conclude that the permafrost ecosystem carbon loss may continue under net-zero and negative emissions, which could hinder climate change mitigation efforts.",

Retromer (VPS26/VPS35/VPS29) binds multiple sorting nexin (SNX) proteins on endosomal membranes, but assembly mechanisms of metazoan SNX/Retromer complexes remain elusive. We combine biochemical and biophysical approaches with AlphaFold modeling to identify a previously unidentified direct interaction between SNX27 and VARP. A full biochemical reconstitution system using purified proteins systematically tests how and when coats are recruited to membranes to generate tubules. We demonstrate and measure how specific combinations of Retromer with SNX27, ESCPE-1 (SNX2/SNX6), or both complexes, remodel membranes containing physiological cargo and phospholipids. SNX27, alone and with Retromer, remodels membranes with PI(3)P and PDZbm cargo. ESCPE-1 deforms membranes with bis-phosphoinositides and CI-MPR cargo but surprisingly does not recruit Retromer. VARP co-immunoprecipitates all coat components in cells and is required to reconstitute a proposed endosomal “supercomplex” (SNX27, ESCPE-1, and Retromer) in vitro. These data suggest VARP regulates metazoan endosomal coat assembly to promote cargo sorting out of endosomes.",

To date, model limitations have prevented quantifying climate-lightning-wildfire interactions comprehensively. We exploit advances in Earth System modeling to examine these three-way interactions and their sensitivities to idealized CO 2 forcing in 140-year simulations. Lightning sensitivity to global temperature change (+1.6 ± 0.1% per kelvin) is mitigated by compensating atmospheric effects. Global burned area sensitivity to temperature (+13.8 ± 0.3% per kelvin) is largely driven by intensified fire weather and increased biomass but marginally by lightning changes. We find a universal law characterizing regional-scale modeled fire activity and its CO 2 sensitivity, consistent with basic principles of statistical mechanics. Last, a negative climate feedback through intensified aerosol direct effect from fire emissions reaches an equivalent decrease of 0.91 ± 0.01% in CO 2 radiative forcing. However, this feedback contributes to polar amplification. Our analysis shows that climate-lightning-wildfire interactions involve multiple compensating and amplifying feedbacks, which are sensitive to anthropogenic CO 2 forcing.",

Dinoflagellates play pivotal roles in marine ecosystems, particularly as major contributors of harmful algal blooms. Despite vital roles of cysts in blooming cycles and dinoflagellate ecology, the molecular processes controlling cyst dormancy have largely remained unexplored due to technological difficulties. Using DinoSL as a dinoflagellates-specific mRNA “hook” and SMRT sequencing, we analyzed metatranscriptomes of sediment-buried dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. The data show that most major metabolic and regulatory pathways, except photosynthesis, were transcriptionally active. This suggests the crucial importance of broad metabolic pathways in sustaining cyst viability and germination potential. Further expression analyses of 11 genes (relevant to autophagy and phytohormone gibberellin), lysosome/autolysosome staining, and germination experiments revealed vital roles of autophagy in energy generation, nutrient recycling, and of phytohormones abscisic acid/gibberellin in modulating dormancy/germination of resting cysts.

Diabetes-associated immune cell dysfunction plays a minor role in the emergence of resistance, while hyperglycemia plays a dominant role facilitating the expansion and takeover of resistant mutants in diabetic infections. Furthermore, vancomycin intermediate resistant isolates display a pronounced fitness defect in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice.

However, improving one performance of a material often sacrifices another performance, making it difficult to create materials with optimal performance profiles. Here we report a liquid-infused porous piezoelectric scaffold (LIPPS) that simultaneously enhances its load-bearing and energy dissipation capability under cyclic loading. For example, after 12 million loading cycles, LIPPS increases its modulus by 3600% and hysteresis by 3000%. From a CT study, this behavior is attributed to the self-recoverable mineralization under mechanical loading. Moreover, LIPPS shows a reprogrammable stiffness distribution based on the loading distribution, which enables the material to generate multiple shapes by self-folding. Our findings can contribute toward unprecedented opportunities in soft robotics, vehicles, infrastructure, and tissue engineering and contribute to the new paradigm of material selection with improved resilience and sustainability.",

However, current flexible pyroelectric energy harvesters suffer from low output. Here, we present a nanocomposite of liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) and pyroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanoparticles and demonstrate a flexible heat harvesting device with high output. The overall pyroelectricity is enhanced by the secondary pyroelectricity generated from the thermal stress imposed on the LCE. Calculations and simulations corroborate with experiments, suggesting that the monodomain LCE/PZT with fixed boundaries offers the most enhancement. At a maximum heating rate of 0.20 kelvin per second, the fixed monodomain film (42.7 weight % PZT) shows an output current of 2.81 nanoamperes and a voltage of 6.23 volts, corresponding to a pyroelectric coefficient p of −4.01 nanocoulombs per square centimeter per kelvin, 49% higher than that of the widely used polyvinylidene fluoride.

The PCM comprises hundreds of proteins, and there is much debate about its physical nature. Here, we show that Drosophila Spd-2 (human CEP192) fluxes out from centrioles, recruiting Polo and Aurora A kinases to catalyze the assembly of two distinct mitotic-PCM scaffolds: a Polo-dependent Cnn scaffold, and an Aurora A–dependent TACC scaffold, which exhibit solid- and liquid-like behaviors, respectively. Both scaffolds can independently recruit PCM proteins, but both are required for proper centrosome assembly, with the Cnn scaffold providing mechanical strength, and the TACC scaffold concentrating centriole and centrosome proteins. Recruiting Spd-2 to synthetic beads injected into early embryos reconstitutes key aspects of mitotic centrosome assembly on the bead surface, and this depends on Spd-2’s ability to recruit Polo and Aurora A. Thus, Spd-2 orchestrates the assembly of two scaffolds, with distinct biophysical properties, that cooperate to build mitotic centrosomes in flies.",

However, existing VS catheters with phase-changing materials are slow in softening and stiffening rates (≈90 s), which can lead to substantial increase in surgery duration. To address the slow stiffness change, we propose a VS catheter based on fiber jamming (FJ) that achieves instant stiffness changes (≤300 ms), enabling seamless catheter operations without delays. Moreover, our catheter, incorporating hundreds of ultrathin fibers into a slender 2.3-mm catheter body, achieves up to 6.5-fold stiffness changes. With adequate stiffness change, our two-segment catheter achieves complex bending profiles within seconds. In addition, the FJ-based design does not require electric currents or heating inside the human body, minimizing patient risks. This FJ-based VS catheter, with instantaneous response, adequate stiffness change, and enhanced safety, can potentially establish benchmarks in MIS, allowing medical practitioners to effectively address formidable diseases.",

The neuron array can function as double-opponent receptive fields for spatial-chromatic opponent preprocessing to color signals, emulating the neural pathway from the retina to the cortex. With the color spiking preprocessing function of the neuron array, the recognition accuracy is improved almost twofold compared to direct perception of underexposure objects, and the noise robustness is also strengthened. This architecture leverages biological mechanisms for simultaneous spike encoding and antagonistic preprocessing of color information, offering the potential for highly efficient neuromorphic vision systems.",

However, this mutation type has not been studied in other cancer genes. Here, we explore somatic nonstop mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 Associated Protein 1 ( BAP1 ) and Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) enriched in renal cell carcinoma. For BAP1 , nonstop mutations generate an extremely long extension. Instead of proteasomal degradation, the extension decreases translation and depletes BAP1 messenger RNA from heavy polysomes. For VHL , the short extension leads to proteasomal degradation. Unexpectedly, the mutation alters the selection of the translational start site shifting VHL isoforms. We identify germline VHL nonstop mutations in patients leading to the early onset of severe disease manifestations. In summary, nonstop extension mutations inhibit the expression of renal tumor suppressor genes with pleiotropic effects on translation and protein stability.",

To this end, we leverage cell-cell “NETwork” of neutrophils to deliver SERCA activator-loaded SR-localized nanoparticles (L-P-NPs) to the damaged myocardial cells, following a hierarchical targeting process: (i) chemotactic neutrophils deliver L-P-NPs to ischemia-reperfused heart, achieving tissue level targeting; (ii) neutrophils produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to transport L-P-NPs to injured myocardial cell, achieving cellular level targeting; (iii) L-P-NPs escort therapeutic payloads to the SR, achieving subcellular targeting. We showed that this platform profoundly restored SERCA activity, augmented cardiac function, and ameliorated adverse heart remodeling.

We show that in Arabidopsis mur1 mutant, CWI defects from compromising dimerization of RG-II pectin, a key component of cell wall, attenuate the expression of auxin response factors ARF7-ARF19 . As a result, polar auxin transport components are misexpressed, disrupting auxin response asymmetry, leading to defective apical hook development. Accordingly, mur1 hook defects are suppressed by enhancing ARF7 expression. In addition, expression of brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes is down-regulated in mur1 mutant, and supplementing brassinosteroid or enhancing brassinosteroid signaling suppresses mur1 hook defects. Intriguingly, brassinosteroid enhances RG-II dimerization, showing hormonal feedback to the cell wall. Our results thus reveal a previously unrecognized link between cell wall defects from reduced RG-II dimerization and growth regulation mediated via modulation of auxin-brassinosteroid pathways in early seedling development.",

We found a bacilysin transmembrane transporter ( Tg MFS4) in Tg , critical during cross-kingdom dialogue with B v. Deleting Tgmfs4 (Δ Tgmfs4 ) mitigated Bv - Tg antagonism, reduced bacilysin import into Tg , and elevated its level in the coculture environment.

Simulations for two Cr(V) coordination compounds under this framework show a marked improvement in accuracy and demonstrate that relaxation in spin-1/2 molecules is enabled by virtual transitions to molecular excited states with energy approaching 20,000 cm –1 .

We studied circadian clocks of blind cave spiders and their sighted relatives. In the field, cave spiders exhibit low per expression and maintain constant activity levels. Curiously, their clocks are not permanently lost; exposure to monochromatic blue light restores both circadian gene expression and behavioral rhythms. Conversely, blocking blue light in sighted relatives induces an arrhythmic “cave phenotype.” Our RNA interference experiments suggest that clock genes regulate the rhythmicity of the huddle response, establishing a link between circadian gene networks and this behavioral rhythm. We demonstrate that circadian regulation is readily toggled and may play a latent role, even in constant darkness. Overall, our study expands understanding of circadian clock variations and paves the way for future research on the maintenance of silent phenotypes.",

We found that expression of MAGE-A4 was highly associated with the loss of PTEN , a tumor suppressor, in human non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Here, we show that constitutive expression of human MAGE-A4 with Pten loss in mouse airway epithelia results in metastatic adenocarcinoma. Tumors showed distinct enrichment in IgA + CD138 + CXCR4 + plasma cells (PCs) and increased expression of CXCL12 in endothelial cells. Consistently, human NSCLC expressing MAGE-A4 showed increased CD138 + IgA + PCs surrounding tumors. Abrogation of PCs decreased tumor burden, increased activated T cell infiltration, and reduced CD163 + CD206 + macrophages in the MAGE-A4–induced lung tumors.

          "abstract": "Temporal patterning of neural progenitors is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism generating neural diversity. In Drosophila , postembryonic neurogenesis requires the RNA binding proteins (RBPs) Imp/IGF2BP and Syp/SYNCRIP. However, how they coachieve their function is not well understood. Here, we elucidate the in vivo temporal RNA interactome landscapes of Imp and Syp during larval brain development. Imp and Syp bind a highly overlapping set of conserved mRNAs encoding proteins involved in neurodevelopment. We identify transcripts differentially occupied by Imp/Syp over time, featuring a network of known and previously unknown candidate temporal regulators that are post-transcriptionally regulated by Imp/Syp. Furthermore, the physical and coevolutionary relationships between Imp and Syp binding sites reveal a combinatorial, rather than competitive, mode of molecular interplay. Our study establishes an in vivo framework for dissecting the temporal coregulation of RBP networks as well as providing a resource for understanding neural fate specification.",

Building on this and our previous research into PI3K and AR signaling interactions, we aimed to define the mechanisms of response and resistance to Akt inhibition. We discovered that restoration of mTOR signaling was the early dominant driver of resistance to Akt inhibition. Mechanistically, this can be achieved through molecular alterations, resulting in loss of negative regulators of mTOR. Unexpectedly, we discovered that this was dominated by restoration of mTOR signaling through the nutrient sensing arm. This can be achieved by loss of the components of the GATOR/KICSTOR complexes or through cellular processes, leading to the recycling of amino acids. The addition of an mTOR inhibitor restored sensitivity to Akt inhibition and represents a precision-based strategy to overcome resistance in the clinic.",

The capacity to induce regeneration exogenously is limited and usually confined to meristematic-like tissues. We show that bacterial cellulose (BC), but not other structurally similar matrixes, induces postwounding regeneration in nonmeristematic plant tissues via a distinctive route to callus-mediated regenerative programs. The BC-specific program involves cytokinin operating concurrently with strongly activated plant biotic response genes to induce plant regeneration. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, normally associated with defense responses, is sustained upon BC application, involving a network of tightly interconnected transcription factors, where WRKY8, known for regulating stress responses, shows a clustering and hierarchical prevalence. WRKY8 regulates BC-mediated plant regeneration and ROS homeostasis, including superoxide anion accumulation, to potentially promote cell proliferation after wounding. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the cytokinin- and ROS-associated defense responses can be targeted by BC application to promote plant wound regeneration through alternative regenerative programs.",

Despite excessive accumulation of α-syn being key to the pathogenesis of PD, the mechanisms governing its clearance remain elusive. In this study, we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system plays a crucial role in capturing and facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated α-syn. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin was found to promote K27-linked polyubiquitination of α-syn, directing it to the endosome for subsequent degradation. We showed that the deletion of the Listerin gene exacerbates the neurodegenerative progression in a mouse model of PD, whereas the overexpression of Listerin effectively mitigates disease progression in PD mice. Consequently, our study reveals a mechanism for α-syn degradation and identifies Listerin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.",

To facilitate systematic studies, we here present a targeted approach to determine the impact of cancer-associated protease variants (TACAP). Starting with the semiautomated identification of potential specificity-modulating SNVs, our workflow comprises mass spectrometry–based cleavage specificity profiling and substrate identification, localization, and inhibitor studies, followed by functional analyses investigating cancer cell properties. To demonstrate the feasibility of TACAP, we analyzed the meprin β R238Q variant.

Subsequently, existing protein fitness landscapes were used to benchmark novel ML methods in realistic protein design settings. We focused on the traditional problems of protein design: sampling and scoring. A major finding of our study is that ML approaches are better at purging the sampling space from deleterious mutations. Nevertheless, scoring resulting mutations without model fine-tuning showed no clear improvement over scoring with Rosetta.

In our work, we demonstrate that an anomalous logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy (EE) persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. On the basis of quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE on SU( N ) DQCP spin models, we show that for a series of N smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists, which implies that previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when N ≥ N c with an N c we evaluate to lie between 7 and 8, DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory.",

However, the mechanism by which DNA damage is sensed and translated into PafBC activation has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the binding of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to the WYL domains of PafBC activates the transcription factor. Our cryo–electron microscopy structure of full-length PafBC in its active conformation, bound to the transcription initiation complex, reveals a previously unknown mode of interaction between the ssDNA and the WYL domains. Using biochemical experiments, we show that short ssDNA fragments bind to PafBC dynamically, resulting in deactivation as ssDNA levels decrease postrepair. Our findings shed light on the mechanism linking DNA damage to PafBC activation and expand our understanding of WYL domain–containing proteins.",

GATA6 protein also physically interacts with CTCF, suggesting its critical role in 3D genome organization. The ablation of GATA6 through AID and CRISPR systems severely impaired cancer cell clonogenicity and proliferation.

Rituximab in vasculitis exacerbates neutralization deficits over standard immunosuppressive therapy, although impairment resolves over time since dosing. We observed discordance between detectable IgG binding and neutralizing activity specifically in the context of rituximab use, with high proportions of individuals showing reasonable IgG titer but no neutralization. ADCC response was more frequently detectable compared to neutralization in the context of rituximab, indicating that a notable proportion of binding antibodies are non-neutralizing.

Magnetic exchange maps obtained from the molecular tip revealed the presence of a hydrogen superstructure and a 90° rotation of the magnetization compared to the pristine island. Ab initio calculations corroborate these observations, indicating that hydrogen hybridization with Co atoms on the island surface drives the spin reorientation of the island. This reorientation is further reinforced by hydrogen penetration into the island that locates at the Co/Cu interface.

That IgA may amplify postimmune IgG production is suggested by the impaired IgG response to pneumococcal vaccines in some IgA-deficient patients. Here, we found that antipneumococcal but not total IgG production was impaired in mice with IgA deficiency. The positive effect of gut IgA on antipneumococcal IgG responses started very early in life and could implicate gut bacteria, as these responses were attenuated in germ-free mice recolonized with gut microbes from IgA-deficient donors. IgA could exert this effect by constraining the systemic translocation of gut antigens, which was associated with chronic immune activation, including T cell overexpression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibitory receptor may attenuate antipneumococcal IgG production by causing B cell hyporesponsiveness, which improved upon anti–PD-1 treatment.

In this work, we introduce a previously unexplored canalization phenomenon in a single-thin vdW layer (α-MoO 3 ) interfaced with a substrate exhibiting a given negative permittivity. This enables a proof-of-concept application of polariton canalization: super-resolution nanoimaging (~λ 0 /220). Canalization-based imaging transcends conventional projection constraints, allowing the super-resolution images to be obtained at any desired location in the image plane. This versatility stems from the synergetic manipulation of three key parameters: incident frequency, rotation angle of the thin vdW layer, and thickness.

          "abstract": "Nucleosomes at promoters of active genes are marked by specific histone post-translational modifications and histone variants. These features are thought to promote the formation and maintenance of an “open” chromatin environment that is suitable for transcription. However, recent reports have drawn conflicting conclusions about whether these histone modifications depend on active transcription. To further interrogate this relationship, we inhibited transcription initiation using triptolide, which triggered degradation of RNA polymerase II, and examined the impact on histone modifications. Transcription initiation was not required for either hormone-induced or steady-state active histone modifications at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. Rather, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. P300 activity was dispensable for this effect, but inhibition of histone deacetylases masked the increased acetylation. Together, our results demonstrate that active histone modifications occur independently of transcription.

          "abstract": "Metamorphosis is an important way for insects to adapt to the environment. In this process, larval tissue destruction regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and adult tissue reconstruction regulated by insulin-like peptides (ILPs) occur simultaneously, but the detailed mechanism is still unclear. Here, the results of succinylome, subcellular localization, and protein interaction analysis show that non-succinylated insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) localizes in the cytoplasm, binds to insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2-like), and degrades it. When the metamorphosis is initiated, 20E up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A ( Cpt1a ) through transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), thus increasing the level of IDE succinylation on K179. Succinylated IDE translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus, combined with ecdysone receptor to promote 20E signaling pathway, causing larval tissue destruction, while IGF-2-like was released to promote adult tissue proliferation. That is, succinylation alters subcellular localization of IDE so that it can bind to different target proteins and act as a hub of metamorphosis.",

DMS is a particle method that uses quantum mechanically derived interaction potentials to simulate molecular collisions within a flow field. Since these interaction potentials are the only modeling inputs used in the simulation, all flow features can solely be attributed to the ab initio potential energy surfaces. Hence, providing a comparison of a hypersonic ground test and numerical data anchored to quantum mechanics. The fundamental nature of DMS is leveraged to investigate molecular level mechanisms prevalent in the flow, and comparisons with lower fidelity simulations are presented to highlight the role of these first principles calculations as benchmark solutions.",

A receptor-kinase signaling pathway for plant stomatal development shares components with the immunity pathway. The mechanism ensuring their signal specificities remains unclear. Using chemical genetics, here, we report the identification of a small molecule, kC9, that triggers excessive stomatal differentiation by inhibiting the canonical ERECTA pathway. kC9 binds to and inhibits the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK6, perturbing its substrate interaction. Notably, activation of immune signaling by a bacterial flagellin peptide nullified kC9’s effects on stomatal development. This cross-regulation depends on the immune receptor FLS2 (FLAGELLIN SENSING 2) and occurs even in the absence of kC9 if the ERECTA family receptor population becomes suboptimal. Proliferating stomatal lineage cells are vulnerable to this immune signal penetration. Our findings suggest that the signal specificity between development and immunity can be ensured by mitogen-activated protein kinase homeostasis, reflecting the availability of upstream receptors, thereby providing an unanticipated view on signal specificity.",

Particularly, BAMs and activated CD11c + microglia localized near β amyloid (Aβ) plaques exhibited a pronounced lipid-associated gene signature and a high LD load. Having observed that elevated intracellular LD content correlated inversely with microglial phagocytic activities, we subsequently inhibited LD formation specifically in CX3CR1 + brain macrophages using an inducible APP-KI/ Fit2 i Δ M φ transgenic mouse model. We demonstrated that reducing LD content in microglia and CX3CR1 + BAMs remarkably improved their phagocytic ability. Furthermore, lowering microglial LDs consistently enhanced their efferocytosis capacities and notably reduced Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma. Therefore, mitigating LD accumulation in brain macrophages provides perspectives for AD treatment.",

On the basis of a recent generative model, recursive cortical networks, that demonstrated excellent performance on vision benchmarks, we derive a theoretical cortical microcircuit by placing the requirements of the computational model within biological constraints. The derived model suggests precise algorithmic roles for the columnar and laminar feed-forward, feedback, and lateral connections, the thalamic pathway, blobs and interblobs, and the innate lineage-specific interlaminar connectivity within cortical columns. The model also explains several visual phenomena, including the subjective contour effect and neon-color spreading effect, with circuit-level precision.

Crucially, F3FT and N3FT are able to efficiently penetrate cells and eliminate intracellular bacteria and sniping inflammation. Moreover, F3FT and N3FT kill bacteria mainly by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and inducing excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species.

The proposed learning rule, described as three-factor Hebbian plasticity, is effective for datasets such as entangled rings and MNIST, comparable to t -SNE. We further show that the algorithm could be working in olfactory circuits in Drosophila by analyzing the multiple experimental data in previous studies.

Here, we assessed the evidence for both laws in cetaceans by analyzing vocal sequences from 16 baleen and toothed whale species and comparing them to 51 human languages. Eleven whale species exhibit Menzerath’s law, sometimes with greater effect sizes than human speech. Two of the five whale species with categorized element types exhibit Zipf’s law of abbreviation. On average, whales also tend to shorten elements and intervals toward the end of sequences, although this varies by species.

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence holds great promise for the design of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs); however, current models face limitations in generating AMPs with sufficient novelty and diversity, and they are rarely applied to the generation of antifungal peptides. Here, we develop an alternative pipeline grounded in a diffusion model and molecular dynamics for the de novo design of AMPs. The peptides generated by our pipeline have lower similarity and identity than those of other reported methodologies. Among the 40 peptides synthesized for an experimental validation, 25 exhibit either antibacterial or antifungal activity. AMP-29 shows selective antifungal activity against Candida glabrata and in vivo antifungal efficacy in a murine skin infection model. AMP-24 exhibits potent in vitro activity against Gram-negative bacteria and in vivo efficacy against both skin and lung Acinetobacter baumannii infection models. The proposed approach offers a pipeline for designing diverse AMPs to counteract the threat of antibiotic resistance.",

          "abstract": "There is an estimated chance of 0.037% that asteroid Bennu will collide with Earth in 2182 CE. The potential collision of such medium-sized asteroids can inject massive amounts of dust into the atmosphere, with unknown consequences for terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Here, we use the coupled high-top Community Earth System Model Version 2 with interactive chemistry to investigate how medium-sized asteroid strikes would affect climate, vegetation, and marine productivity. Our simulations, which inject up to 400 million tons of dust into the stratosphere, show marked disruptions in climate, atmospheric chemistry, and global photosynthesis. Global mean temperatures are projected to drop by 4°C, and global precipitation decreases by 15% in our simulations. The largest relative reductions in global terrestrial and marine net primary productivity reach 36 and 25%, respectively. Depending on the iron amount of the asteroid and the subsequent marine dust deposition, large diatom blooms occur in iron-limited regions such as the Southern Ocean and the eastern equatorial Pacific.",

          "abstract": "Most edible fish species have been fished for centuries or millennia, leaving little record or understanding of their population responses prior to human impact and thus no baseline for population conservation. Here, we reconstruct the population dynamics of Atlantic cod, one of the world’s most harvested fish species, from the pristine state during the Viking era through more than 1100 years of fishing. Analysis of cod otoliths recovered during archaeological excavations of Icelandic fish processing sites revealed that cod in the 10th to 12th centuries were 25% larger and up to 300% older than modern, despite slower density-dependent growth rates attributed to the sixfold increase in abundance. Fishing mortality came to dominate a time-invariant natural mortality rate and other population characteristics after the 14th century, with minimal evidence of environmental effects at the century scale. Despite the absence of catch records and surveys, biological reference points based on pristine fish populations are now possible where otolith collections are available.",

          "abstract": "Trichome initiation and development is regulated by a diverse range of environmental signals. However, how leaf carbohydrate status determines the trichome initiation and development of systemic developing leaves remains unclear. Here, we found that a specific organ (such as a mature leaf) could function as a nutrient sensor, subsequently promoting or suppressing nonautonomous regulation of trichome initiation and development in response to alternations in nutrient levels. This physical phenomenon was regulated by a sucrose ⟶ ACS7 ⟶ ethylene ⟶ EIN3 ⟶ SUC4 ⟶ sucrose pathway in mature leaves, with a remote control of trichome production in newly developing leaves via a sucrose ⟶ ACS7 ⟶ ethylene ⟶ EIN3 ⟶ TTG1 pathway. These data provide insights into how mature leaves function as nutrient sensors that control trichome formation within distant developing leaves through a nutrient sensor–relay mechanism. Our findings uncover both a previously unidentified, nutrient sensing–regulatory mechanism and the cognate underpinning molecular architecture.",

          "abstract": "Conformational isomerism determines the performance of materials and the activity of biomolecules. However, a complete dynamic study of conformational isomerization is still a formidable challenge at the single-molecule level. In this work, we present real-time in situ electrical monitoring of the full rotation dynamics of a single aromatic chain covalently embedded in graphene electrodes with single-event resolution. We reveal that the dynamic process of phenyl ring rotations at low temperature is dominated by quantum rotation tunneling rather than the quasi-free rotation process. The emergent complexity of different intramolecular rotations in a single aromatic molecule is demonstrated, including the alternating unidirectional rotation with multi-, single-, and half-circle delays driven by inelastic electron tunneling, which has not been previously adequately considered at the macroscopic level. This work builds a bridge between macroscopic and microscopic worlds and improves our understanding of structure-activity relationships, potentially bringing different functions to ordinary materials.",

          "abstract": "Transplantation of beneficial bacteria to specific microbiota has been widely exploited to treat diseases by reshaping a healthy microbial structure. However, direct exposure of exogenous bacteria in vivo suffers from low bioavailability and infection risk. Here, we describe a noncontact microbiota transplantation system (NMTS) by core-shell microgel-enabled nonleakage envelopment. Bacteria are encapsulated into the core of core-shell microgels via two-step light-initiated emulsion polymerization of gelatin methacrylate. NMTS is versatile for biocontainment of diverse strains, showing near complete encapsulation and negligible influence on bacterial activity. As a proof-of-concept study on probiotic transplantation to the gut microbiota, NMTS demonstrates the shielding effect to protect sealed bacteria from intraluminal insults of low pH and bile acid, the toughness to prevent bacterial leakage during entire gastrointestinal passage and reduce infection risk, and the permeability to release beneficial metabolites and reconstruct a balanced intestinal microbial structure, proposing a contactless fashion for advanced microbiota transplantation.",

          "abstract": "Proper chromosome segregation during cell division is essential for genomic integrity and organismal development. This process is monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which delays anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. The kinetochore protein KNL1 plays a critical role in recruiting SAC proteins. Here, we reveal that Arabidopsis KNL1 regulates SAC silencing through the direct recruitment of type one protein phosphatase (TOPP) to kinetochores. We show that KNL1 interacts with all nine TOPPs via a conserved RVSF motif in its N terminus, and this interaction is required for the proper localization of TOPPs to kinetochores during mitosis. Disrupting KNL1-TOPP interaction leads to persistent SAC activation, resulting in a severe metaphase arrest and defects in plant growth and development. Our findings highlight the evolutionary conservation of KNL1 in coordinating kinetochore-localized phosphatase to ensure timely SAC silencing and faithful chromosome segregation in Arabidopsis .",

          "abstract": "The depletion of moderately volatile elements (MVEs) in terrestrial planets remains poorly understood, with explanations including partial nebular condensation and MVE loss during planetesimal differentiation or collisions. In this study, we use magmatic iron meteorites to reconstruct the MVE inventory of the earliest inner [noncarbonaceous (NC)] and outer [carbonaceous (CC)] Solar System planetesimals. We show that several NC and CC iron meteorite parent bodies (IMPBs) exhibit chondrite-like MVE abundances, indicating that “first-generation” inner Solar System planetesimals were remarkably MVE rich. Consistent with isotopic signatures of MVEs in Earth and Mars, these planetesimals made a substantial contribution to the MVE inventories of terrestrial planets. Variations in MVE abundances among IMPBs, particularly the two volatile-depleted NC and CC IMPBs (IVA and IVB), reflect secondary volatile loss after disruption of their parent bodies. Consequently, MVE depletion in terrestrial planets is more closely linked to the protracted history of MVE loss during planetesimal collisions rather than incomplete condensation or MVE loss during planetesimal differentiation.",

          "abstract": "The impact of invasive predators during the early stages of invasion is often variable in space and time. Such variation is expected to initially favor plasticity in prey defenses, but fixed defenses as invaders become established. Coincident with the range expansion of an invasive predatory crab in the Gulf of Maine, we document rapid changes in shell thickness—a key defense against shell crushing predators—of an intertidal snail. Field experiments, conducted 20 years apart, revealed that temporal shifts in shell thickness were driven by the evolution of increased trait means and erosion of thickness plasticity. The virtual elimination of the trade-off in tissue mass that often accompanies thicker shells is consistent with the evolution of fixed defenses under increasingly certain predation risk.",
