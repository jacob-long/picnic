          "authors": "Tristan L. Botelho, Sora Jun, Demetrius Humes, Katherine A. DeCelles",
          "abstract": "Online platforms are rife with racial discrimination1, but current interventions focus on employers2,3 rather than customers. We propose a customer-facing solution: changing to a two-point rating scale (dichotomization). Compared with the ubiquitous five-star scale, we argue that dichotomization reduces modern racial discrimination by focusing evaluators on the distinction between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ performance, thereby reducing how personal beliefs shape customer assessments. Study 1 is a quasi-natural experiment on a home-services labour platform (n = 69,971) in which the company exogenously changed from a five-star scale to a dichotomous scale (thumbs up or thumbs down). Dichotomization eliminated customers’ racial discrimination whereby non-white workers received lower ratings and earned 91 cents for each US dollar paid to white workers for the same work. A pre-registered experiment (study 2, n = 652) found that the equalizing effect of dichotomization is most prevalent among evaluators holding modern racist beliefs. Further experiments (study 3, n = 1,435; study 4, n = 528) provide evidence of the proposed mechanism, and eight supplementary studies support measurement and design choices. Our research offers a promising intervention for reducing customers’ subtle racial discrimination in a large section of the economy and contributes to the interdisciplinary literature on evaluation processes and racial inequality.",

          "abstract": "Infectious disease threats to individual and public health are numerous, varied and frequently unexpected. Artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies, which are already supporting human decision making in economics, medicine and social science, have the potential to transform the scope and power of infectious disease epidemiology. Here we consider the application to infectious disease modelling of AI systems that combine machine learning, computational statistics, information retrieval and data science. We first outline how recent advances in AI can accelerate breakthroughs in answering key epidemiological questions and we discuss specific AI methods that can be applied to routinely collected infectious disease surveillance data. Second, we elaborate on the social context of AI for infectious disease epidemiology, including issues such as explainability, safety, accountability and ethics. Finally, we summarize some limitations of AI applications in this field and provide recommendations for how infectious disease epidemiology can harness most effectively current and future developments in AI.",

          "abstract": "Neoantigen vaccines are under investigation for various cancers, including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR )-driven lung cancers 1,2 . We tracked the phylogenetic history of an EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with erlotinib, osimertinib, radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine (NPV) targeting ten somatic mutations, including EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del). The ex19del mutation was clonal, but is likely to have appeared after a whole-genome doubling (WGD) event. Following osimertinib and NPV treatment, loss of the ex19del mutation was identified in a progressing small-cell-transformed liver metastasis. Circulating tumour DNA analyses tracking 467 somatic variants revealed the presence of this EGFR wild-type clone before vaccination and its expansion during osimertinib/NPV therapy. Despite systemic T cell reactivity to the vaccine-targeted ex19del neoantigen, the NPV failed to halt disease progression. The liver metastasis lost vaccine-targeted neoantigens through chromosomal instability and exhibited a hostile microenvironment, characterized by limited immune infiltration, low CXCL9 and elevated M2 macrophage levels. Neoantigens arising post-WGD were more likely to be absent in the progressing liver metastasis than those occurring pre-WGD, suggesting that prioritizing pre-WGD neoantigens may improve vaccine design. Data from the TRACERx 421 cohort 3 provide evidence that pre-WGD mutations better represent clonal variants, and owing to their presence at multiple copy numbers, are less likely to be lost in metastatic transition. These data highlight the power of phylogenetic disease tracking and functional T cell profiling to understand mechanisms of immune escape during combination therapies.",

          "abstract": "The complex life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum involves several major differentiation stages, each requiring strict control of gene expression. Fundamental changes in chromatin structure and epigenetic modifications during life cycle progression suggest a central role for these mechanisms in regulating the transcriptional program of malaria parasite development 1–6 . P. falciparum chromatin is distinct from other eukaryotes, with an extraordinarily high AT content (&gt;80%) 7 and highly divergent histones resulting in atypical DNA packaging properties 8 . Moreover, the chromatin remodellers that are critical for shaping chromatin structure are not conserved and are unexplored in P. falciparum . Here we identify P. falciparum Snf2L ( Pf Snf2L, encoded by PF3D7_1104200 ) as an ISWI-related ATPase that actively repositions P. falciparum nucleosomes in vitro. Our results demonstrate that Pf Snf2L is essential, regulating both asexual development and sexual differentiation. Pf Snf2L globally controls just-in-time transcription by spatiotemporally determining nucleosome positioning at the promoters of stage-specific genes. The unique sequence and functional properties of Pf Snf2L led to the identification of an inhibitor that specifically kills P. falciparum and phenocopies the loss of correct gene expression timing. The inhibitor represents a new class of antimalarial transmission-blocking drugs, inhibiting gametocyte formation.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions3. Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons4,5,6,7,8,9 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.",

They raised important concerns, which led them to conclude that our dataset was underpowered to be informative about human evolution during the Black Death. We agree that small sample sizes are an inherent limitation of ancient DNA studies. To address this, we incorporated multiple lines of evidence, including genomic data spanning before, during and after the Black Death; replication across two distinct population cohorts; and experimental data on cellular responses to Yersinia pestis infection, to build a case for selection. Our functional analyses—a rarity in ancient DNA studies—are further supported by independent epidemiological data, showing that the putatively selected ERAP2 allele does indeed protect against severe respiratory infection in contemporary populations3. Together, all lines of evidence continue to support selection on ERAP2.",

The extreme temperature contrasts between their day- and night-sides pose a fundamental climate puzzle: how is energy distributed? To address this, we must observe the 3D structure of these atmospheres, particularly their vertical circulation patterns, which can serve as a testbed for advanced Global Circulation Models (GCM) e.g.1. Here we show a dramatic shift in atmospheric circulation in an ultra-hot Jupiter: a unilateral flow from the hot star- facing side to the cooler space-facing side of the planet sits below an equatorial super-rotational jet stream. By resolving the vertical structure of atmospheric dynamics, we move beyond integrated global snapshots of the atmosphere, enabling more accurate identification of flow patterns and allowing for a more nuanced comparison to models. Global Circulation Models based on first principles struggle to replicate the observed circulation pattern3 underscoring a critical gap between theoretical understanding of atmospheric flows and observational evidence. This work serves as a testbed to develop more comprehensive models applicable beyond our Solar System as we prepare for the next generation of giant telescopes.",

          "abstract": "The generation of large-scale entangled states is crucial for quantum technologies, such as quantum computation1, communication2 and metrology3. Integrated quantum photonics that enables on-chip encoding, processing and detection of quantum light states offers a promising platform for the generation and manipulation of large-scale entangled states4,5. Generating entanglement between qubits encoded in discrete variables within single photons is challenging, owing to the difficulty of making single photons interact on photonic chips6,7,8,9,10,11. Devices that operate with continuous variables are more promising, as they enable the deterministic generation and entanglement of qumodes, in which information is encoded in light quadratures. Demonstrations so far have been limited to entanglement between two qumodes12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Here we report the deterministic generation of a continuous-variable eight-mode entanglement on an integrated optical chip. The chip delivers a quantum microcomb that produces multimode squeezed-vacuum optical frequency combs below the threshold. We verify the inseparability of our eight-mode state and demonstrate supermode multipartite entanglement over hundreds of megahertz sideband frequencies through violation of the van Loock–Furusawa criteria. By measuring the full matrices of nullifier correlations with sufficiently low off-diagonal noises, we characterize multipartite entanglement structures, which are approximate to the expected cluster-type structures for finite squeezing. This work shows the potential of continuous-variable integrated photonic quantum devices for facilitating quantum computing, networking and sensing.",

          "abstract": "The survival of malignant cells within tumours is often seen as depending on ruthless competition for nutrients and other resources1,2. Although competition is certainly critical for tumour evolution and cancer progression, cooperative interactions within tumours are also important, albeit poorly understood3,4. Cooperative populations at all levels of biological organization risk extinction if their population size falls below a critical tipping point5,6. Here we examined whether cooperation among tumour cells may be a potential therapeutic target. We identified a cooperative mechanism that enables tumour cells to proliferate under the amino acid-deprived conditions found in the tumour microenvironment. Disruption of this mechanism drove cultured tumour populations to the critical extinction point and resulted in a marked reduction in tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that tumour cells collectively digest extracellular oligopeptides through the secretion of aminopeptidases. The resulting free amino acids benefit both aminopeptidase-secreting cells and neighbouring cells. We identified CNDP2 as the key enzyme that hydrolyses these peptides extracellularly, and loss of this aminopeptidase prevents tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. These data show that cooperative scavenging of nutrients is key to survival in the tumour microenvironment and reveal a targetable cancer vulnerability.",

However, it is challenging for ultrasmall CsPbI3 QDs to retain their solution-phase properties when they assemble into conductive films, greatly hindering their device application3,6. Here we report an approach for in situ deposit stabilized ultrasmall CsPbI3 QD conductive solids, by constructing CsPbI3 QD/quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite heteroepitaxy. The well-aligned periodic array of edge-oriented ligands at heterointerface triggers a substantial octahedral tilting in a critical layer thickness of CsPbI3 QDs, which heightens the Gibbs free energy difference between the tilted-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 leading to thermodynamic stabilization of CsPbI3 QDs. The approach allows us to fabricate stabilized CsPbI3 QD conductive films with tunable emission covering the entire red spectral region from 600 nm to 710 nm. Here we report the pure-red PeLEDs with narrow electroluminescence peak centred at 630 nm, matching the Rec. 2100 standard for ultrahigh-definition display. The champion device exhibits a certified external quantum efficiency of 24.6% and a half-lifetime of 6,330 min, ranking as one of the most efficient and stable pure-red PeLED reported to date.

          "abstract": "Gas samples relevant to health1,2,3 and the environment4,5,6 typically contain many molecular species that span a huge concentration dynamic range. Mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy with high-finesse cavity enhancement has allowed the most sensitive multispecies trace-gas detections so far2,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. However, the robust performance of this technique depends critically on ensuring absorption-path-length enhancement over a broad spectral coverage, which is severely limited by comb–cavity frequency mismatch if strongly absorbing compounds are present. Here we introduce modulated ringdown comb interferometry, a technique that resolves the vulnerability of comb–cavity enhancement to strong intracavity absorption or dispersion. This technique works by measuring ringdown dynamics carried by massively parallel comb lines transmitted through a length-modulated cavity, making use of both the periodicity of the field dynamics and the Doppler frequency shifts introduced from a Michelson interferometer. As a demonstration, we measure highly dispersive exhaled human breath samples and ambient air in the mid-infrared with finesse improved to 23,000 and coverage to 1,010 cm−1. Such a product of finesse and spectral coverage is orders of magnitude better than all previous demonstrations2,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, enabling us to simultaneously quantify 20 distinct molecular species at above 1-part-per-trillion sensitivity varying in concentrations by seven orders of magnitude. This technique unlocks next-generation sensing performance for complex and dynamic molecular compositions, with scalable improvement to both finesse and spectral coverage.",

          "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) disrupt the continuity of the genome, with consequences for malignant transformation. Massive DNA damage can elicit a cellular checkpoint response that prevents cell proliferation1,2. However, how highly aggressive cancer cells, which can tolerate widespread DNA damage, respond to DSBs alongside continuous chromosome duplication is unknown. Here we show that DSBs induce a local genome maintenance mechanism that inhibits replication initiation in DSB-containing topologically associating domains (TADs) without affecting DNA synthesis at other genomic locations. This process is facilitated by mediators of replication and DSBs (MRDs). In normal and cancer cells, MRDs include the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex and the WEE1 kinase, which actively dislodges the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex from replication origins adjacent to DSBs and prevents initiation of DNA synthesis at DSB-containing TADs. Dysregulation of MRDs, or disruption of 3D chromatin architecture by dissolving TADs, results in inadvertent replication in damaged chromatin and increased DNA damage in cancer cells. We propose that the intact MRD cascade precedes DSB repair to prevent genomic instability, which is otherwise observed when replication is forced, or when genome architecture is challenged, in the presence of DSBs3,4,5. These observations reveal a previously unknown vulnerability in the DNA replication machinery that may be exploited to therapeutically target cancer cells.",

Here, using 18 single, double and triple whole-body and tissue-specific knockout and mutant mice, along with systematic mitochondrial morphology analysis, untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered that the synergy between two stress-responsive systems—the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin and the metalloprotease OMA1—safeguards mitochondrial structure and genome by mitochondrial fusion, mediated by the outer membrane GTPase MFN1 and the inner membrane GTPase OPA1. Whereas the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses. Thus, our data show that Parkin and OMA1 maintain a dual regulatory mechanism that controls mitochondrial fusion at the two membranes, even in the absence of extrinsic stress.",

          "abstract": "Glaciers are indicators of ongoing anthropogenic climate change 1 . Their melting leads to increased local geohazards 2 , and impacts marine 3 and terrestrial 4,5 ecosystems, regional freshwater resources 6 , and both global water and energy cycles 7,8 . Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present 9,10 and future 11–13 sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series 14–16 . Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet 17 . Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments 14–16 at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles 12,16,18 , which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century 11,12,18 .",

Most cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are infiltrated by PNS neurons, contributing to the complex tumor microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumor mass. Thus, cancer or healthy organ-innervating neurons elude current tissue sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single cell resolution, we developed “Trace-n-seq”. This method employs retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing >5.000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons with about 4.000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas we reveal novel neuronal cell types and unique molecular networks distinct to pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC, or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuro-cancer-microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic cancer-nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a proinflammatory TME and increases immune-checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness. Nab-Paclitaxel causes intra-tumor neuropathy which attenuated PDAC growth and in combination with sympathetic denervation results in synergistic tumor regression. Our multi-dimensional data reveal new insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, supporting inclusion of denervation in future therapies.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental challenge for cancer vaccines is to generate long-lived functional T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Here we find that mRNA–lipoplex vaccines against somatic mutation-derived neoantigens may solve this challenge in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal cancer with few mutations. At an extended 3.2-year median follow-up from a phase 1 trial of surgery, atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitory antibody), autogene cevumeran1 (individualized neoantigen vaccine with backbone-optimized uridine mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles) and modified (m) FOLFIRINOX (chemotherapy) in patients with PDAC, we find that responders with vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8) have prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS; median not reached) compared with non-responders without vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8; median RFS 13.4 months; P  =  0.007). In responders, autogene cevumeran induces CD8+ T cell clones with an average estimated lifespan of 7.7 years (range 1.5 to roughly 100 years), with approximately 20% of clones having latent multi-decade lifespans that may outlive hosts. Eighty-six percent of clones per patient persist at substantial frequencies approximately 3 years post-vaccination, including clones with high avidity to PDAC neoepitopes. Using PhenoTrack, a novel computational strategy to trace single T cell phenotypes, we uncover that vaccine-induced clones are undetectable in pre-vaccination tissues, and assume a cytotoxic, tissue-resident memory-like T cell state up to three years post-vaccination with preserved neoantigen-specific effector function. Two responders recurred and evidenced fewer vaccine-induced T cells. Furthermore, recurrent PDACs were pruned of vaccine-targeted cancer clones. Thus, in PDAC, autogene cevumeran induces de novo CD8+ T cells with multiyear longevity, substantial magnitude and durable effector functions that may delay PDAC recurrence. Adjuvant mRNA–lipoplex neoantigen vaccines may thus solve a pivotal obstacle for cancer vaccination.",

Concretely, we introduce a state-of-the-art generative model, the World and Human Action Model (WHAM), and show that it can generate consistent and diverse gameplay sequences and persist user modifications—three capabilities that we identify as being critical for this alignment.

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide 1,2 . HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulate progressive driver mutations 3 , with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin 2 . However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is broadly independent of the underlying aetiologies 4 . Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC, outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations 5,6 . Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC 7 . Here we generated a suite of genetically driven immunocompetent in vivo and matched in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance and metastasis. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human–mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with the human histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard-of-care treatment and used a linked in vitro–in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not previously been linked to HCC treatment. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy.",

In multiple mouse models of gastric cancer, nociceptive nerves demonstrated the greatest degree of nerve expansion in an NGF-dependent manner. Neural tracing identified CGRP+ peptidergic neurons as the primary gastric sensory neurons. Three-dimensional co-culture models showed that sensory neurons directly connect with gastric cancer spheroids. Chemogenetic activation of sensory neurons induced the release of calcium into the cytoplasm of cancer cells, promoting tumour growth and metastasis. Pharmacological ablation of sensory neurons or treatment with CGRP inhibitors suppressed tumour growth and extended survival. Depolarization of gastric tumour membranes through in vivo optogenetic activation led to enhanced calcium flux in jugular nucleus complex and CGRP release, defining a cancer cell–peptidergic neuronal circuit. Together, these findings establish the functional connectivity between cancer and sensory neurons, identifying this pathway as a potential therapeutic target.",

We identified T cell receptor clones capable of recognizing and targeting neoantigens derived from aberrant splicing in GNAS and RPL22 . In cases with multi-site biopsies, we detected the tumour-wide expression of the GNAS neojunction in glioma, mesothelioma, prostate cancer and liver cancer. These neoantigens are endogenously generated and presented by tumour cells under physiologic conditions and are sufficient to trigger cancer cell eradication by neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells. Moreover, our study highlights a role for dysregulated splicing factor expression in specific cancer types, leading to recurrent patterns of neojunction upregulation.

In one-dimensional topological superconductors (1DTSs)2,3,4, fusion amounts to a determination of the shared fermion parity of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here we introduce a device architecture5 that is compatible with future tests of fusion rules. We implement a single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity6,7,8,9,10,11 in indium arsenide–aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire12,13,14. The interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of the quantum capacitance of these quantum dots of up to 1 fF. Our quantum-capacitance measurements show flux h/2e-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1 in 3.6 μs at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum-capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states that is longer than 1 ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2 T. We discuss the interpretation of our measurements in terms of both topologically trivial and non-trivial origins. The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a parity measurement with an assignment error probability of 1%.",

However, the reaction rates of these minerals under ambient conditions are far too slow for practical use. Here we show that CaCO3 and CaSO4 react quantitatively with diverse Mg-rich silicates (for example, olivine, serpentine and augite) under thermochemical conditions to form Ca2SiO4 and MgO. On exposure to ambient air under wet conditions, Ca2SiO4 is converted to CaCO3 and silicic acid, and MgO is partially converted into a Mg carbonate within weeks, whereas the input Mg silicate shows no reactivity over 6 months. Alternatively, Ca2SiO4 and MgO can be completely carbonated to CaCO3 and Mg(HCO3)2 under 1 atm CO2 at ambient temperature within hours. Using CaCO3 as the Ca source, this chemistry enables a CDR process in which the output Ca2SiO4/MgO material is used to remove CO2 from air or soil and the CO2 process emissions are sequestered. Analysis of the energy requirements indicates that this process could require less than 1 MWh per tonne CO2 removed, approximately half the energy of CO2 capture with leading direct air capture technologies. The chemistry described here could unlock Mg-rich silicates as a vast resource for safe and permanent CDR.",

          "abstract": "High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the leading cause of brain cancer-related death. HGGs include clinically, anatomically and molecularly distinct subtypes that stratify into diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), such as H3K27M-altered diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and hemispheric HGGs, such as IDH wild-type glioblastoma. Neuronal activity drives glioma progression through paracrine signalling1,2 and neuron-to-glioma synapses3,4,5,6. Glutamatergic AMPA receptor-dependent synapses between neurons and glioma cells have been demonstrated in paediatric3 and adult4 high-grade gliomas, and early work has suggested heterogeneous glioma GABAergic responses7. However, neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by neurotransmitters other than glutamate remain understudied. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, in vivo optogenetics and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models, we identified functional, tumour-promoting GABAergic neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by GABAA receptors in DMGs. GABAergic input has a depolarizing effect on DMG cells due to NKCC1 chloride transporter function and consequently elevated intracellular chloride concentration in DMG malignant cells. As membrane depolarization increases glioma proliferation3,6, we found that the activity of GABAergic interneurons promotes DMG proliferation in vivo. The benzodiazepine lorazepam enhances GABA-mediated signalling, increases glioma proliferation and growth, and shortens survival in DMG patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models. By contrast, only minimal depolarizing GABAergic currents were found in hemispheric HGGs and lorazepam did not influence the growth rate of hemispheric glioblastoma xenografts. Together, these findings uncover growth-promoting GABAergic synaptic communication between GABAergic neurons and H3K27M-altered DMG cells, underscoring a tumour subtype-specific mechanism of brain cancer neurophysiology.",

          "abstract": "When two insulating, neutral materials are contacted and separated, they exchange electrical charge 1 . Experiments have long suggested that this ‘contact electrification’ is transitive, with different materials ordering into ‘triboelectric series’ based on the sign of charge acquired 2 . At the same time, the effect is plagued by unpredictability, preventing consensus on the mechanism and casting doubt on the rhyme and reason that series imply 3 . Here we expose an unanticipated connection between the unpredictability and order in contact electrification: nominally identical materials initially exchange charge randomly and intransitively, but—over repeated experiments—order into triboelectric series. We find that this evolution is driven by the act of contact itself—samples with more contacts in their history charge negatively to ones with fewer contacts. Capturing this ‘contact bias’ in a minimal model, we recreate both the initial randomness and ultimate order in numerical simulations and use it experimentally to force the appearance of a triboelectric series of our choosing. With a set of surface-sensitive techniques to search for the underlying alterations contact creates, we only find evidence of nanoscale morphological changes, pointing to a mechanism strongly coupled with mechanics. Our results highlight the centrality of contact history in contact electrification and suggest that focusing on the unpredictability that has long plagued the effect may hold the key to understanding it.",

Using a point-mutation strategy, we reveal that Mg2+ is essential for the DNA-cleavage activity of this complex in vitro, as confirmed by knock-in mice carrying a point mutation in SPO11 that disrupts its binding to Mg2+, thereby abolishing DSB formation. However, the activity of the SPO11 complex is ATP-independent. We also present evidence that the mouse SPO11 complex is biochemically distinct from the ancestral topoisomerase VI.

          "abstract": "Modular structure and function are ubiquitous in biology, from the organization of animal brains and bodies to the scale of ecosystems. However, the mechanisms of modularity emergence from non-modular precursors remain unclear. Here we introduce the principle of peak selection, a process by which purely local interactions and smooth gradients can drive the self-organization of discrete global modules. The process combines strengths of the positional and Turing pattern-formation mechanisms into a model for morphogenesis. Applied to the grid-cell system of the brain, peak selection results in the self-organization of functionally distinct modules with discretely spaced spatial periods. Applied to ecological systems, it results in discrete multispecies niches and synchronous spawning across geographically distributed coral colonies. The process exhibits self-scaling with system size and ‘topological robustness’1, which renders module emergence and module properties insensitive to most parameters. Peak selection ameliorates the fine-tuning requirement for continuous attractor dynamics in single grid-cell modules and it makes a detail-independent prediction that grid module period ratios should approximate adjacent integer ratios, providing a highly accurate match to the available data. Predictions for grid cells at the transcriptional, connectomic and physiological levels promise to elucidate the interplay of molecules, connectivity and function emergence in brains.",

SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species, but it generates dangerous DSBs with mutagenic 2 and gametocidal 3 potential. Cells must therefore utilize the beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks 4 —how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to TOP6BL. SPO11–TOP6BL complexes are monomeric (1:1) in solution and bind tightly to DNA, but dimeric (2:2) assemblies cleave DNA to form covalent 5′ attachments that require SPO11 active-site residues, divalent metal ions and SPO11 dimerization. SPO11 can also reseal DNA that it has nicked. Structure modelling with AlphaFold 3 suggests that DNA is bent prior to cleavage 5 . In vitro cleavage displays a sequence bias that partially explains DSB site preferences in vivo. Cleavage is inefficient on complex DNA substrates, partly because SPO11 is readily trapped in DSB-incompetent (presumably monomeric) binding states that exchange slowly. However, cleavage is improved with substrates that favour dimer assembly or by artificially dimerizing SPO11. Our results inform a model in which intrinsically weak dimerization restrains SPO11 activity in vivo, making it exquisitely dependent on accessory proteins that focus and control DSB formation.",

We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization for the reconstitution of two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyses DNA cleavage with an activity similar to that of SPO11 alone. However, this complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role after cleavage. We propose a model in which additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11–TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage.

          "abstract": "The US Environmental Protection Agency, with headquarters in Washington DC, regulates pollution to protect the environment and human health.Credit: Aaron Schwartz/ZUMA Press/Alamy\n\nBefore Donald Trump became US president for the second time last month, one of his Republican allies revealed a plan to put US government employees “in trauma” so that they would leave their jobs. The strategy, articulated by Russell Vought, now a key figure on Trump’s White House team, was one part of a larger plan to downsize and defund government agencies. Less than a month into the new administration, many scientists at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) say Vought’s plan seems to be working.\n\nDread and determination: how climate scientists are preparing for Trump 2.0\n\n“I’m scared to open my computer every morning,” says one EPA scientist who asked for anonymity because they fear reprisal. They are one of the more than 1,000 employees tasked with regulating air pollution, researching the health effects of toxic chemicals and more who were notified last week that they might be fired. These staff members are still in their initial, ‘probationary’ period — usually within one year of starting their jobs — and therefore can be fired at any time, said an agency e-mail they received. “It’s just cruel,” says the scientist.\n\nTermination notices for probationary employees started going out today at the EPA as the Trump administration accelerated efforts to fire this category of worker across the federal government. Thus far, the scientists who spoke to Nature have not been affected, but they fear they could be at any moment.\n\nWhite House officials declined to respond to Nature’s questions. In a statement, the EPA said that the agency is “diligently implementing President Trump's executive orders and associated guidance” and “remains committed to our mission of protecting human health and the environment”. The goal, it added, “is to create a more effective and efficient federal government”.\n\nAn agency under fire\n\nThe EPA has long been a target of Trump and his Republican allies. The politicians say that the agency hampers the US economy by issuing excessively strict pollution regulations. Republicans, including Vought, had called for the agency to be downsized and its authority reined in, as set out in ‘Project 2025’, a proposed blueprint for a second Trump administration.\n\nAnother action that EPA scientists say has been demoralizing is the announcement, on 11 February, by Trump-appointed agency administrator Lee Zeldin that 171 staff members were being placed on administrative leave. These employees work on programmes related to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental justice, which focuses on protecting poor communities that are vulnerable to pollution and climate change. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order asking all agencies to eliminate “radical and wasteful government DEI programs”, including environmental-justice positions.\n\nLee Zeldin was appointed by US President Donald Trump to lead the EPA during his second administration.Credit: Anna Moneymaker/Getty\n\nIn his announcement, Zeldin accused the administration of former US president Joe Biden, a Democrat, of pushing “ideological” goals with those programmes. “This ends now,” Zeldin said in a statement. “We will be good stewards of tax dollars and do everything in our power to deliver clean air, land, and water to every American, regardless of race, religion, background, and creed.”\n\nSo far, EPA scientists interviewed by Nature say that core research activities at the agency, such as papers being published and studies being run, have not been significantly affected, although two of its main science advisory panels, which provide technical guidance to the agency, have been disbanded so that new members can be appointed. And the agency has taken down the website of an environmental-justice tool known as EJScreen, which maps threats such as pollution alongside demographic trends to identify vulnerable communities. But many scientists fear it’s just a matter of time.\n\n“The only good news right now is that the administration’s attention seems to be elsewhere,” says Andy Miller, who retired from the EPA’s primary-research branch, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), in December. “It’s unlikely that will continue.”\n\nWorries over safety\n\nNature spoke to multiple staff members in the EPA’s environmental-justice programme who also asked for anonymity because they fear retribution. One of them, now among those on administrative leave, says the situation has injected uncertainty into every facet of their life, from career prospects to the mortgage payments on their home. They also worry about their personal safety. Last week, reports emerged of a ‘DEI Watch List’ created by a right-wing organization that exposed the names, photos and salaries of federal workers, many of them people of colour, whose jobs are linked to DEI efforts. Its aim, the group says, is to restore “common sense” to the US government.\n\n“I’ve got close friends” on that list, one EPA staff member says, and fears they’ll be added, too, if the organization turns its attention to the agency. “It’s not even about targeting institutions and funding and priorities: people are actually being targeted as individuals.”\n\nEPA contractors remove hazardous waste from a home destroyed in the Los Angeles wildfires that raged in January.Credit: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nOne environmental scientist at the agency says that this is their second time as a probationary employee under Trump. They re-entered probationary status recently because of a transfer to a new role in the agency. They note that many probationary employees can appeal a termination if it was because of discrimination or for political reasons, but that assumes that normal rules in the government remain intact.",

Other companies using a similar technology to build machines — called neutral-atom quantum computers — are also making gains on industry leaders such as IBM.\n\n‘A truly remarkable breakthrough’: Google’s new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone\n\nNeutral-atom technology “is catching up”, says Doug Finke, a computer scientist who works at business-analysis firm Global Quantum Intelligence and is based in Orange County, California. “As far as we know, this is the largest venture investment in a neutral-atom company.”\n\nNeutral atoms are stable and can remain in their quantum states without the need for bulky cooling systems. These are features that should make them excellent qubits, the building blocks of a quantum computer, equivalent to classical bits of information. But for years, progress in neutral-atom quantum computing was stymied by how precisely physicists could coax the particles to carry out calculations.\n\nQuantum race\n\nAdvances in ways to configure and control the atoms since 2019 mean that operations are now close in accuracy to those in other hardware types. “Over the past few years, we’ve seen major breakthroughs,” says Wenchao Xu, a physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. “There is definitely a lot of excitement.”\n\nAtom-based quantum computers are catching up with those made by firms such as IonQ or Google, which use trapped ions or tiny superconducting circuits to represent quantum states. QuEra in Boston, Massachusetts, is not alone in pursing neutral-atom technology: Atom Computing in Berkeley, California, Infleqtion in Boulder, Colorado, and Pasqal in Massy, France, have created machines with hundreds of qubits.\n\nThis billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed?\n\nTheir road maps to expand the number of interacting qubits are among the industry’s most aggressive. Making a computer that can start to perform useful calculations will probably take tens of thousands of qubits, working together to overcome errors that are inherent to quantum systems.\n\nQuEra was spun off from research at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both in Cambridge. In its system, physicists trap an array of rubidium atoms using laser light and store quantum information in the energy levels of the atom’s electrons.",

          "title": "China made waves with Deepseek, but its real ambition is AI-driven industrial innovation",
          "authors": "Jacob Dreyer",
          "abstract": "When US technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel’s book Zero to One was published in Chinese in 2015, it struck at an insecurity felt by many in China. Thiel suggested that although the country excelled at scaling and commercializing emerging technologies, it lagged behind the United States in true innovation — creating something entirely original from scratch. Take the iPhone: engineers in Cupertino, California, design them; workers in -Shenzhen, China, build them.\n\nFor more than a decade, Chinese policymakers have aimed to shed this image, embedding the pursuit of innovation into national industrial policies, such as Made in China 2025. And there are some early results to show. For instance, in 2023, the Shenzhen-based technology company Huawei launched the Mate 60 smartphone, which is powered by a domestically produced chip. This was celebrated as a symbolic breakthrough — demonstrating that China could manufacture advanced semiconductors despite stringent US sanctions on crucial tools and high-end design software. And last month’s release of Deepseek-R1, a Chinese large language model developed at a fraction of the cost of its Western counterparts, sent shockwaves through the US tech establishment.\n\nProminent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen described it as “AI’s Sputnik moment” — a reference to the mid-twentieth-century US–Soviet space race that began with the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik, by the Soviet Union. Accessing Deepseek through an application programming interface (API) — a protocol for connecting software applications — is roughly 13 times cheaper than similar models developed by OpenAI, based in San Francisco, California.\n\nThe sudden rise of Deepseek has put the spotlight on China’s wider artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, which operates differently from Silicon Valley. Although consumer-facing applications garner much attention, Chinese AI firms, unlike their US counterparts, are in fact more invested in solving industrial and manufacturing problems at scale. The divergence in priorities reflects the forces driving innovation in each economy: venture capital in the United States and large-scale manufacturing enterprises and organs of the state in China.\n\nTechnology split\n\nAt the root of the difference is China’s comparative advantage in the world economy — manufacturing — along with the government being the largest client for new technologies. The Chinese government aims to develop low-cost, scalable AI applications that can modernize the rapidly developing country.\n\nAt a press conference last September, for example, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian laid out the view of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that tech innovation is a core component of “national development”. To stay in the good books of Beijing, AI research laboratories have responded by building practical applications — to make trains run on time, monitor fish stocks and provide automated telehealth services.\n\nBeijing-based company Zhipu AI has partnered with several local governments and state-owned enterprises to deploy its agent model, which automates tasks such as form-filling and financial-report analysis. Last month, tech behemoth Alibaba, headquartered in Hangzhou, China, reached a deal with the Beijing-based startup 01.AI to set up an ‘industrial large model laboratory’ focused on deploying AI to optimize business and industrial processes.\n\nNvidia is a US company that manufactures chips needed to build AI systems.Credit: Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nAI also has an interesting role in China’s energy transition, from large-scale trials of integrated smart homes to the roll-out of a major investment (equivalent to US$800 billion) for a national smart grid.\n\nThus, Beijing’s goal is not necessarily to attain global leadership in AI chatbots, but to use the underlying technology to develop affordable, commercially viable business solutions. Its applications can then be exported, especially to lower-income countries. In other words, China’s target is not necessarily ‘frontier AI’, but ‘mass-market AI’. Its emerging AI playbook mirrors its approach to other technologies, such as electric vehicles and clean energy: not the first to innovate, but the first to make them affordable for widespread use.\n\nOut of necessity\n\nThe technological ‘stack’, an interconnected set of resources needed to develop advanced AI models, includes hardware, such as semiconductors; cutting-edge learning algorithms optimized for that hardware; and a backend comprising energy-intensive data centres and predictable capital flows.\n\nTo maintain its global lead in AI technology, the United States has periodically imposed export sanctions on key components. On 7 October 2022, the administration of former US president Joe Biden released a set of export controls on advanced computing and semiconductor-manufacturing items, aiming to block China from purchasing high-performance chips from companies such as Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California. Then--national-security-adviser Jake Sullivan called it the “small yard, high fence” strategy: the United States would erect a ‘fence’ around crucial AI technologies, encouraging even companies in allied countries, such as the Netherlands and South Korea, to restrict shipments to China.\n\nChina–US research collaborations are in decline — this is bad news for everyone\n\nMeanwhile, the CCP sees moving up the manufacturing supply chain, particularly into categories such as airplanes and semiconductors, as crucial for sustained economic growth. In that sense, the rivalry adds urgency and intensity to China’s efforts. If the United States owns the technology of the future and is willing to use export controls, then China runs the risk of economic stagnation — and the political turbulence that might accompany it. The battle for supremacy over AI is part of this larger geopolitical matrix.\n\nAnd China has been preparing for this scenario for a while. In 2019, the US added Huawei to its entity list, a trade-restriction list published by the Department of Commerce. This spurred China to rethink how to become less vulnerable to US export controls. The Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE) created a set of integrated research platforms (IRPs), a major institutional overhaul to help the country to catch up in key areas, including robotics, driverless cars and AI, that are vulnerable to US sanctions or export controls. There are now 30 IRPs.\n\nTake the IRP for new-generation integrated circuit technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, for instance — the sort of state-driven research enterprise that could drive breakthroughs. The 2022 export restrictions targeted chips with ‘nodes’ — the smallest component on a semiconductor — of 14 nanometres or less. Chips with smaller nodes can pack more transistors into the same area, potentially improving performance and efficiency. In 2021, the Fudan IRP was ahead of the curve, and already recruiting for roles to support research on even smaller nodes, of 3–4 nanometres. These high-performance chips now fuel the AI tech stack. To address manufacturing bottlenecks, the third round of China’s ‘Big Fund’ — a state-backed investment initiative to pool in resources from -public enterprises and local governments — was announced last year, with a planned US$47 billion investment in its semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nThis shows that China is serious about indigenizing AI capabilities by investing significant institutional, academic and scientific resources. By restricting access to chips, US policy has forced China to explore workarounds and unconventional methods. Many of these endeavours might fail. But it doesn’t take many successes to make a global impact.\n\nThe IRPs have emerged as ideal platforms to train a cadre of engineers, filling a talent gap that existed even a decade ago. The Deepseek success story is, in part, a reflection of this years-long investment.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Credit: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty\n\nA new and seemingly more impressive artificial intelligence (AI) tool is released almost weekly, and researchers are flocking to try them out. Whether they are looking to edit manuscripts, write code or generate hypotheses, researchers have more generative AI tools to choose from than ever before.\n\nEach large language model (LLM) is suited to different tasks. Some are available through free chatbots, whereas others use a paid-for application programming interface (API) that means they can be integrated with other software. A few can also be downloaded, allowing researchers to build their own custom models.\n\nAlthough LLMs produce human-like responses, they all remain too error-prone to be used on their own, says Carrie Wright, a data scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, headquartered in Seattle, Washington.\n\nSo which LLM is best for what task? Here, researchers share their current favourites with Nature to help guide those in need.\n\no3-mini (the reasoner)\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, California, introduced the world to LLMs in 2022 with its free-to-use ChatGPT bot. Scientists have mainly used the bot to look up information or as a writing assistant, for example to draft abstracts, but newer models are broadening the technology’s potential uses. Last September, in the firm’s most significant advance since then, OpenAI wowed scientists with its o1 ‘reasoning model’, which it followed with the more advanced o3 in December. Both reasoning models work more slowly than an LLM alone does, because they have been trained to answer queries in a step-by-step way. This ‘chain of thought’ process, aimed at simulating human reasoning, has helped them to smash tough benchmarks in science and mathematics. It has also made them good at technical tasks, such as solving coding issues and reformatting data.\n\nAfter the little-known Chinese start-up DeepSeek in Hangzhou launched a rival reasoner on 20 January, OpenAI responded with a range of new tools. These include a speedy o3-mini — a reasoner that is free for registered chatbot users — and ‘deep research’, which allows some paying subscribers to create reports that synthesize information, with citations, from hundreds of websites, akin to carrying out a literature review. The models excel when used in combination, says Andrew White, a chemist and AI expert at FutureHouse, a start-up in San Francisco.\n\nWhen it comes to tasks such as picking apart unfamiliar concepts in a new mathematical proof, o3-mini does a “really good job”, says Simon Frieder, a mathematician and AI researcher at the University of Oxford, UK. But even the best models “are still not even close to rivalling a mathematician”, he says.\n\nDeepSeek (the all-rounder)\n\nDeepSeek-R1, launched last month, has abilities on a par with o1’s, but is available through an API at a fraction of the cost. It also stands apart from OpenAI’s models because it is open weight, meaning that although its training data have not been released, anyone can download the underlying model and tailor it to their specific research project. R1 has “just unlocked a new paradigm” in which communities, particularly those with relatively few resources, can build specialized reasoning models, says White.\n\nRunning the full model requires access to powerful computing chips, which many academics lack. But researchers such as Benyou Wang, a computer scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, are creating versions that can run or train on a single machine. Like o1, DeepSeek-R1’s forte is maths problems and writing code. But it is also good at tasks such as generating hypotheses, says White. This is because DeepSeek has opted to publish the model’s ‘thought processes’ in full, which allows researchers to better refine their follow-up questions and ultimately improve its outputs, he says. Such transparency could also be hugely powerful for medical diagnostics. Wang is adapting R1 in experiments that use the model’s reasoning-like powers to build “a clear and logical pathway from patient assessment to diagnosis and treatment recommendation”, he says.\n\nDeepSeek-R1 has some cons. The model seems to have a particularly long ‘thought’ process, which slows it down and makes it less useful for looking up information or brainstorming. Concerns about the security of data input into its API and chatbot have led several governments to ban workers at national agencies from using the chatbot. DeepSeek also seems to have taken fewer measures to mitigate its models generating harmful outputs than have its commercial competitors. Adding filters to prevent such outputs — instructions to make weapons, for instance — takes time and effort. Although it is unlikely that this was done on purpose, “the lack of guard rails is worrisome”, says Simon.\n\nOpenAI has also suggested that DeepSeek may have “inappropriately distilled” its models, referring to a method for training a model on another algorithm’s outputs, which OpenAI’s conditions of use prohibit.\n\nDeepSeek could not be reached for comment on these criticisms before this article was published.\n\nSome researchers see such distillation as commonplace and are happy to use R1, but others are wary of using a tool that could be subject to future litigation. There’s a chance that scientists using R1 could be forced to retract papers, if using the model was considered a violation of the journal's ethical standards, says Ana Catarina De Alencar, a lawyer at EIT Manufacturing in Paris who specializes in AI law. A similar situation could apply to the use of models by OpenAI and other firms accused of intellectual-property violations, says De Alencar. News organizations claim that the firms used journalistic content to train their models without permission.\n\nLlama (the workhorse)\n\nLlama has long been a go-to LLM for the research community. A family of open-weight models first released by Meta AI in Menlo Park, California, in 2023, versions of Llama have been downloaded more than 600 million times through the open-science platform Hugging Face alone. The fact it can be downloaded and built on is “probably why Llama has been embraced by the research community”, says Elizabeth Humphries, a data scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.\n\nBeing able to run an LLM on personal or institutional servers is essential when working with proprietary or protected data, to avoid sensitive information being fed back to other users or to the developers, says Wright.\n\nResearchers have built on Llama’s models to make LLMs that predict materials’ crystal structure, as well as to simulate the outputs of a quantum computer. Tianlong Chen, a machine-learning scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says Llama was a good fit for simulating a quantum computer because it was relatively easy to adapt it to understand specialized quantum language.\n\nBut Llama requires users to request permission to access it, which is minor point of friction for some, says White. As a result, other open models such as OLMo, developed by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, or Qwen, built by the Chinese firm Alibaba Cloud, based in Hangzhou, are now often the first choice in research, he adds. DeepSeek’s efficient underlying V3 model is also a rival base for building scientific models.\n\nClaude (the coder)",

Credit: Sam Pellock\n\nResearchers have used artificial intelligence (AI) to design brand-new enzymes that can go through multi-step reactions, a key feature of natural enzymes. The structures they made accelerated a four-step chemical reaction pivotal to many biological and industrial processes, including plastic recycling.\n\n“This is a milestone in enzyme engineering,” says Huimin Zhao, a synthetic biologist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “[It] shows that now it’s possible to design enzymes with native-like activity that could make them useful practically.”\n\nEarlier efforts to design enzymes from scratch using AI have had limited success, often producing ones that stall after the first step of a reaction. In the latest study, published in Science on 13 February1, researchers overcame this challenge by combining several machine-learning approaches. The new enzymes were 60,000 times better at speeding up the reaction than ones previously designed to work in a similar way.\n\nTailoring enzymes\n\nEarlier efforts have focused on tweaking the structures of existing enzymes to create new ones that work faster or have different functions. But this approach makes it difficult to create efficient enzymes capable of multi-step reactions.\n\n“It is like going to the thrift store and buying a suit, and that suit probably won’t fit you perfectly. That’s what happens when we try to design enzymes that way,” says study co-author Anna Lauko, a protein designer at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nAI has dreamt up a blizzard of new proteins. Do any of them actually work?\n\nLauko and her colleagues wanted to build enzymes that can undergo a four-step chemical reaction called serine hydrolysis, which involves breaking an ester bond between molecules. Serine hydrolases are the natural enzymes that carry out this reaction, and they are involved in many biological processes, including digestion, metabolizing fats and blood clotting.\n\nThe researchers started with an AI tool called RFdiffusion, a program they had previously developed to generate new enzyme structures from scratch2. They then created a deep neural network, called PLACER, to refine the structural design by modelling the locations of atoms in the enzyme and the molecules it binds to during every step of the reaction. This AI works like “a filter”, says Zou: it checks whether the enzyme’s active sites — the parts that interact with molecules — are compatible and properly arranged to carry out each step of the reaction. This is “very innovative”, says Zhao.",

          "title": "Researchers overlooked airborne diseases for centuries — then COVID-19 changed everything",
          "authors": "Linsey C. Marr",
          "abstract": "Air-Borne: The Hidden History of the Life We Breathe Carl Zimmer Dutton (2025)\n\nIn the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, one of the most pressing questions for researchers was how the SARS-CoV-2 virus was transmitted. Some physicians and public-health specialists argued that the virus spread solely in wet droplets from coughing. Others — backed by aerosol scientists — thought that it also spread through the air.\n\nIn Air-borne, acclaimed science writer Carl Zimmer examines why it took more than a year of vociferous debate to establish that the second theory was correct. His book is an enthralling historical exploration of the role of airborne microorganisms in disease, and examines why these pathogens have been overlooked for centuries.\n\nVaccine specialist Peter Hotez: scientists are ‘under attack for someone else’s political gain’\n\nThe beginning of ‘aerobiology’, as -Zimmer labels it, had its roots in ancient Greece. -Hippocrates, a physician and philosopher, was the first to propose that a miasma — “an invisible corruption of the air” — caused disease. The concept endured: from the fourteenth century onwards, miasmas were often wrongly blamed for plague outbreaks that devastated cites across the world. Now, we know that the disease was caused by a bacterium carried by fleas that live on rodents.\n\nA long history\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Italian physician -Girolamo Fracastoro wrote a book about tiny, invisible ‘seeds’ that could multiply in a host and spread through the air. Proponents of his theory, known as contagionists, would lock horns with miasmatists — who maintained that the air itself was the cause of disease — for the next 300 years. It wasn’t until the late 1800s — after physician Robert Koch proved that anthrax was caused by bacteria — that the idea that microbes cause infectious diseases became accepted and miasma theory was rejected.\n\nIn the 1930s, scientists began seriously considering the idea that microbes can spread disease through the air. Mildred Wells was an insightful, rigorous researcher who found that poliovirus was airborne. Her husband William — inspired by his wife’s work — pivoted from studying waterborne to airborne pathogens, and made the revolutionary discovery that bacteria released in sneezes could linger in the air of a classroom after the students had left.\n\nDr Semmelweis review: Mark Rylance play shows how hand washing saved hundreds of lives\n\nIn their landmark theory of airborne disease transmission, they proposed that diseases not only are spread through the droplets that are dispelled by coughs and sneezes and fall quickly to the ground, but also can be transmitted in microdroplets, now known as aerosol particles. These tiny particles, they argued, are released with every exhalation, settle very slowly and drift long distances.\n\nMildred went on to show that disinfecting air in schools with ultraviolet light reduced cold and flu incidence. William, meanwhile, found that hospitalized people with tuberculosis could infect guinea pigs through bacteria in aerosol particles — much to the annoyance of hospital staff, who for years had to run extra tuberculosis tests and autopsy dozens of guinea pigs. Unfortunately, the duo’s work was largely dismissed — perhaps owing to concern about reviving the discredited miasma theory and their “cantankerous and wearying” personalities.\n\nReading Air-borne, I felt frustrated by how long it took for researchers to accept that pathogens could spread through the air. Zimmer synthesizes research from various fields in a way that makes airborne transmission seem obvious, illustrating how scientific siloing inhibits progress. For example, plant pathologists knew from the early 1900s that the fungus that causes rust on wheat could spread to farms hundreds of kilometres away. Yet physicians — focused on the idea that -diseases spread through contact with infected people or contaminated objects — vehemently rejected the idea of airborne transmission indoors, even as late as the 1950s.",

          "abstract": "Almost all humans carrying a gene variant called NOVA1 that is not present in ancient human relatives and has been implicated in the development of speech.Credit: 10'000 Hours/Getty\n\nMice carrying a gene variant present in nearly every human on Earth — and not by extinct relatives including Neanderthals — produce more complex chirps than normal rodents1.\n\nThe finding suggests that the mutation — which changes a protein called NOVA1 that has a role in orchestrating gene activity in the brain — might have contributed to cognitive differences between humans and their closest relatives, and possibly to aspects of complex speech and language.\n\nRobert Darnell, a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York City, first encountered the NOVA1 gene 30 years ago, when his team linked it to an autoimmune disorder that caused severe movement problems in people. The gene is usually switched on only in the brain where the NOVA1 protein controls the expression of dozens of other brain-active genes.\n\nDarnell thought that NOVA1 might be involved in speech when, as a neurologist, he treated a boy with language and movement problems, who had one working copy of the gene2. Another team had found that nearly all humans have a version of NOVA1 that is distinct from Neanderthals and another extinct human group called Denisovans (as well as other mammals, including mice)3.\n\nChirp change\n\nThe genetic change — which swaps an isoleucine amino acid for a valine in the encoded protein — was one of just a handful of protein-altering changes that evolved in the more than 500,000 years after the hominin groups split from a common ancestor in Africa. This suggests that the changes benefited early humans so greatly that the mutations became ubiquitous.\n\nTo study the effects of the change a neuroscientist in Darnell’s group Yoko Tajima used CRISPR gene editing to engineer mice carrying the human version of NOVA1.\n\nExhaustive analysis identified only subtle differences between the ‘humanized’ mice and normal rodents: when newborn mice were isolated from their mothers, pups with the human version of NOVA1 had altered distress calls. Similarly, in the presence of a female mouse in heat, male mice carrying the change made more complex courtship calls.\n\nIn the mouse brains, the human version of NOVA1 affected a molecular process, called alternative splicing, in which coding sequences of other individual genes are mixed and matched to create diverse proteins. Some of the ‘alternatively spliced’ genes have been implicated in vocal behaviour. The results were published1 on 18 February in Nature Communications.\n\nLanguage contribution",

          "abstract": "Cave-bat fieldwork often looked like a scene from the 1995 film Outbreak.Credit: Warner Bros/AJ Pics/Alamy\n\nFor years, I was a bat ecologist, fully immersed in the grind of data collection and publications. My research on cave-bat conservation took me to remote locations, crawling through caves knee-deep in guano, catching bats. Back then, taking photos felt like a distraction from my research.\n\nBut two years ago, I left the academic world for a career as a science communicator at the GENUS hub at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in South Africa. Today, I work alongside researchers, helping them to bring their science to life through compelling stories. Visuals, particularly photographs, are a key part of this work.\n\nLooking back, I wish I’d captured more of my field experiences. Photos are priceless tools for public engagement, yet many researchers fail to see their value. Now, I understand that science doesn’t just live in publications — it lives in stories, visuals and the personal connections that we create with people.\n\nPics, or it didn’t happen\n\nDuring my postdoctoral position in ecology and viral zoonosis at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, my team and I worked mainly in a rural part of Limpopo, on the northeastern side of South Africa, in a small village called Ga-Mafefe. The landscape was lush and green, dotted with ancient fig trees and alive with the rhythm of daily life.\n\nPhotography: Science on camera\n\nWithin minutes of arriving at the cave site at the base of a steep hill, my team from the Centre for Viral Zoonoses would transform a patch of wilderness into a fully functioning research station, complete with a working centrifuge, powered by portable car batteries. We would dress head-to-toe in white, crinkly Tyvek suits (a type of lightweight, protective, plastic onesie that could shield both us and the bats from contaminants). With respirators humming, we looked like something straight out of the 1995 medical-disaster movie Outbreak.\n\nFor a week every month, this was my reality. I’d catch bats with specialized traps, and then spend hours hunched over folding camping tables carefully measuring the animals and collecting biological samples. Summer nights were sweltering, with sweat pooling in our suits; meanwhile, winters had us shivering, our noses running faster than we could wipe them, although wiping wasn’t exactly an option. It was exhausting, repetitive and, at times, comically miserable — but it was also exhilarating. We were a well-oiled machine, driven by a shared passion and the late-night humour that only a sleep-deprived team in the middle of nowhere could understand.\n\nThen in 2022, I did a three-month science-storytelling fellowship with the Nature, Environment and Wildlife Filmmakers — an organization that aims to build a network of visual storytellers, led by Indigenous African voices, celebrating and protecting Africa’s natural history — and it completely changed my perspective. I rediscovered my creative side and came to understand that scientific exchange can take many forms beyond just research papers. Armed with this newfound inspiration, I started taking photographs of everything during our fieldwork, capturing the beauty and intensity of our work.\n\nMariëtte van der Walt back in her bat-fieldwork days.Credit: Mariette van der Walt\n\nBack home in Johannesburg, my family and friends were captivated by the stories my photos told. Through my lens, they saw breathtaking landscapes, rough conditions and, of course, cute bats. I felt like my work could connect with people in a way data alone never could.\n\nWith this perspective, I realized that as much as I loved my research, my postdoctoral studies weren’t the right place to pursue my newfound passion for storytelling. I decided to leave academia and embrace a career in science communication.\n\nEcologists: don’t lose touch with the joy of fieldwork",

Cross/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nScientists are bracing for major changes in the direction of US biomedical research as Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has promoted vaccine misinformation and public-health conspiracies, gains control over a vast swathe of science policy.\n\nThe Senate voted today to confirm Kennedy as President Donald Trump’s secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which has an annual budget of roughly US$1.7 trillion and includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. Kennedy has embraced some fields of biomedical research. But he has shown hostility to others, and has rejected established science on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the safety of vaccines in general and other topics. (Kennedy told the Senate that he supports vaccines and believes that they have saved lives.)\n\n“The future of America as a superpower in research appears grim,” says Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, who creates new models for studying HIV — which Kennedy has falsely suggested is not the cause of AIDS. “Even on issues he claims he supports, he does not follow scientific evidence. Picking a person like this to lead is like having the wolf guard the sheep.”\n\nFalse dichotomy\n\nDuring his own presidential campaign, Kennedy said that he would prioritize research on chronic diseases and would give infectious-disease research at the NIH “a break” for eight years. Speaking before a Senate committee in January, Kennedy asserted that chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, asthma and some cancers have historically received less attention than infectious diseases, but are mostly responsible for rising health-care costs. (Data from the NIH show that cancer alone receives more federal funding than that allotted to all infectious diseases combined.)\n\nUneven attention hampers the drive to control infectious diseases\n\nEven some researchers who could benefit from an emphasis on chronic disease are wary. Eric Lau, a cancer researcher at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, says that although it would certainly be nice to see more money poured into studying cancer, the federal government should focus on increasing funding for biomedical research in general.\n\nBoth he and Larry Schlesinger, a physician-scientist and chief executive of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio, say that the idea of cutting one field to benefit another creates a false dichotomy between chronic and infectious disease that isn’t rooted in scientific reality.\n\nAs an example of how tightly the two are linked, researchers cite increasing evidence that some chronic conditions stem from infectious diseases: infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), for instance, can cause cancer of the cervix and other tissues. “Prioritizing chronic conditions increasingly means prioritizing infectious diseases,” says Schlesinger, who was himself diagnosed with oral cancer after an infection with HPV decades before. “We are appreciating more and more that infections, and the inflammation they cause, play an important role in these chronic conditions.”\n\nScientists also say that the ongoing outbreak of bird flu, which has made at least 68 people in the United States ill since the start of 2024, makes this an especially bad time to cut research into infectious diseases.\n\nFocus on food\n\nAs part of his ‘Make America Healthy Again’ pledge, Kennedy has repeatedly called for further studies into diet and nutrition, as well as research on the links between environmental pollution and human health. During his January hearing, Kennedy said that scientists “know” that obesity is caused by “an environmental toxin”, and asked why researchers haven’t dedicated themselves to finding and eliminating it.\n\nFood systems: seven priorities to end hunger and protect the planet",

          "title": "Money and murder: the dark side of the Asilomar meeting on recombinant DNA",
          "authors": "Matthew Cobb",
          "abstract": "On 24 February 1975, some 150 people met at the Asilomar Conference Grounds near Monterey on the Californian coast. They were mostly scientists from the United States, together with representatives of various companies and government agencies, and 16 journalists. Their subject was the new technology of recombinant DNA — molecules created in a laboratory by stitching together genetic material from different organisms. Researchers were excited by the possibilities for discoveries, and the potential of the technique to produce drugs, for example using specially engineered bacteria to make insulin. But they were also terrified that they might inadvertently create diseases that could infect lab workers and the wider community.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, its participants had agreed to adopt biosafety protocols that are still in force in the United States, and which have hugely influenced similar regulations worldwide. The meeting has become known simply as Asilomar, a byword for how a scientific community came together to forge consensus on a thorny topic. It is often held up as an example of how science can self-regulate without the involvement of politicians (although some criticize it for just those same reasons). Periodic calls can be heard for ‘another Asilomar’ in other potentially hazardous fields such as synthetic biology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence.\n\nBut grasping the full significance of a historic event often involves understanding what was not discussed and highlighting the decisions that were not taken. Half a century on from Asilomar, that longer view provides a different perspective on two unspoken, yet essential, issues that loomed in the background of the meeting — the technology’s potential for creating riches and for destroying human life.\n\nAsilomar 1975: DNA modification secured\n\nDebates about the possible hazards of recombinant DNA first came to the fore in June 1971. Robert Pollack, a postdoctoral researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, New York, learnt from Janet Mertz, a PhD student on a course he was teaching, that her supervisor wanted her to transfer DNA from simian virus 40 (SV40) into the gut bacterium Escherichia coli. SV40 could cause uncontrolled growth in hamster cells, and it was feared it might cause cancer in humans.\n\nMertz’s supervisor was Paul Berg at Stanford University in California, a leading molecular biologist in his mid-40s. Pollack, more than ten years Berg’s junior, had never met him but was deeply alarmed at the idea, and so telephoned him the next day to ask why he was planning to do such a “crazy” experiment. The conversation did not last long; according to Pollack, Berg responded, “Who the bleep are you?”.\n\nBerg later recalled that he thought the concerns were “bunk” and “outrageous”. But this exchange and subsequent conversations with friends, colleagues and students kindled doubts in his mind. The experiment he had given to Mertz was not central to his research project, and faced with opposition and the slight possibility that the experiment might go awry, he abandoned this part of it.\n\nBerg’s creation of the first recombinant DNA the following year — inserting a DNA segment from E. coli into SV40 — did not cause outrage. Indeed, it helped him to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980. But the subsequent discovery1 of the powerful method of plasmid-based gene cloning by a team including Stanley Cohen at Stanford University and Herb Boyer at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), did lead to great alarm. By allowing researchers to move any piece of DNA into a bacterium where its function could be studied, this technique “made it possible for anybody to do anything”, as Berg put it later. When Boyer presented the technique at a conference in June 1973, participants raised their concerns with the meeting’s organizers, who published a letter2 in Science warning that the creation of “new kinds of hybrid plasmids or viruses, with biological activity of unpredictable nature … may prove hazardous to laboratory workers and to the public”.\n\nThe US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) tasked Berg with convening a working group to address these concerns. In July 1974, Berg, Boyer, Cohen and eight others — including James Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA — wrote an open letter3 calling on scientists to defer all such experiments “until the potential hazards of such recombinant DNA molecules have been better evaluated or until adequate methods are developed for preventing their spread”. They also announced a meeting to be held in early 1975 to discuss the matter. For perhaps the first time in history, scientists had publicly decided to stop doing an experiment until it was safe. This soon became known as a moratorium — a word adopted from opposition to atomic-weapons testing.\n\nThis was the backdrop to the Asilomar meeting, organized by Berg under the auspices of the NAS. Its main aim was to agree biosafety protocols that could be adopted by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a condition of funding, without fractious lawmakers getting involved. Researchers from Europe were culturally less hostile to the prospect of legislation. In many countries outside the United States, laws using protocols very similar to those adopted at Asilomar eventually governed recombinant DNA research.\n\nThe lure of lucre\n\nIn early 1975, Berg learnt to his horror that administrators at Stanford and UCSF had applied for a patent on the Cohen–Boyer cloning technique4. If all went well, both universities — as well as Cohen and Boyer — stood to become very rich. Berg was keen to see the moratorium lifted to enable research to continue. He disagreed with the Cohen–Boyer patent, but immediately understood that, were the patent application to become widely known, the Asilomar meeting would be fatally compromised. It would look as if the researchers wanted to lift the moratorium so that they could make money. Caught in a bind, Berg had no alternative but to press on in the hope that no one would leak the story.\n\nThis was more problematic than it might seem. There were curious reporters at Asilomar, including Michael Rogers, a writer for Rolling Stone, a US counter-cultural music magazine. In an article5 about the meeting, Rogers described the possibility of producing insulin in a recombinant microorganism, adding drily, “The prospect is sufficiently realistic that the conference includes representatives from the research arms of drug manufacturers Merck, Roche, G. D. Searle — and even General Electric.” However, despite the twitching of Rogers’ journalistic antennae, there was no revelation of the patent at Asilomar or in the immediate aftermath.\n\nChildren at a military barracks in Kineshma, Russia, simulate a biochemical attack in 1999.Credit: Oleg Nikishin/Hulton Archive/Getty\n\nThe Asilomar recommendations were accepted by the NIH in 1976. These involved increasingly strict biosafety measures with increasing levels of perceived hazard. They were later summarized by Gwladys Caspar, a biosafety officer at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as: level 1 — don’t eat it; level 2 — don’t touch it; level 3 — don’t breathe it; level 4 — don’t do it.\n\nAt the end of 1977, researchers working with a tiny start-up company co-founded by Boyer, named Genentech, produced a human growth hormone in a microbe6 and then repeated the trick with insulin7. Debate began to focus not on the morality of patenting processes that had been developed with public money, but instead on who was going to get rich. The US Patent Office eventually accepted the Stanford–UCSF application in early December 1980, following a landmark US Supreme Court ruling, Diamond v. Chakrabarty. Less than two weeks after the patent was finally granted, the Bayh–Dole Act was signed into law, which encouraged recipients of federal funding to take out patents on discoveries and to license them.\n\nThis all led to an explosion of venture-capital-funded biotechnology. The excitement soon infected Nature, which created the “Nature guide to bio-riches”, an index of US biotechnology stocks that was published in the journal each month. Taking Boyer and Cohen’s patent alone, during its lifetime (17 years in the United States, 20 in Europe) more than 2,000 products were developed using the technique, generating billions in sales. The total revenue was around $255 million; each university received $90 million, with Boyer and Cohen sharing the rest8.\n\nThe intrusion of vast potential wealth also had a profound effect on relations between scientists. Competition became even greater, with inevitable conflicts of interest (although as late as 1997, a Nature editorial9 dismissed such concerns). Scientists stopped speaking openly about their research, as Berg complained a few years later: “No longer do you have this free flow of ideas. You go to scientific meetings and people whisper to each other about their companies’ products. It’s like a secret society.” Had the underlying conflict of interest of some of those debating at Asilomar been revealed in 1975, the meeting’s decisions would surely have been the focus of greater political opposition.\n\nHidden menace\n\nAt the opening session of Asilomar, biologist David Baltimore at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, speaking for the organizing committee, ruled that there would be no discussion of the danger of recombinant DNA being used to create bioweapons, for example by introducing toxin genes into highly infectious bacteria. As he explained, although the issue of bioweapons was a very serious one “which many of us care about and have cared about for a long time”, the meeting was “not designed to deal with that question”, which was “peripheral” and might “confuse” the discussion.\n\nMany people felt that the menace of biological warfare had been hugely reduced by the 1972 United Nations Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). This entered into force a month after Asilomar, following ratification by the Soviet Union, the United States and 20 other countries. The BWC was partly prompted by then US president Richard Nixon’s unexpected and unilateral cancellation in 1969 of the US biological warfare programme, which used natural microbial pathogens and had been developed during the Second World War. All US bioweapon stockpiles were declared destroyed.\n\nHowever, the microbiologist and anti-bioweapons campaigner Richard Novick, together with colleagues working on plasmids, wanted the final Asilomar declaration to include a clear statement on the threat of recombinant DNA bioweapons10. The hectic last session of the conference saw Berg and Baltimore invoking the right of academic enquiry as they rejected any declaration that some dangerous experiments should never be carried out. Berg’s compromise formulation, adopted by the meeting — “there is a class of experiments that should not be done at all irrespective of the type of containment available today” — left it open whether such experiments would be permissible in the future.\n\nThe February 1975 meeting at the Asilomar resort in California lifted a moratorium on a controversial strand of DNA research.Credit: John D. Ivanko/Alamy\n\nUnknown to almost everyone at Asilomar, exactly this kind of work was being proposed in the Soviet Union. In April 1974, the federation had launched a top-secret biological-warfare programme, overseen by an agency called Biopreparat, that would use recombinant DNA alongside existing bioweapons such as anthrax and plague11. The Soviet delegation to Asilomar included three men who were deeply involved with Biopreparat: at the time of its launch, Alexander Baev and Andrej Mirzabekov were members of the military–scientific body that oversaw the recombinant DNA bioweapons project, and Vladimir Engelhardt, who at 80 years old was the senior Soviet delegate, was director of the Moscow-based Institute of Molecular Biology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, one of the main contractors for this research.\n\nThese cultured and knowledgeable men had excellent scientific reputations and were close friends of many Western molecular biologists. Their involvement in the bioweapons project was a consequence of the terrible situation in Soviet genetics. From the 1930s to the mid-1950s, the Soviet regime had been virulently hostile to genetics, driven by the ideas and ambition of the agronomist Trofim Lysenko, a favourite of the country’s then-leader Josef Stalin. Even though Lysenko’s influence eventually waned in the 1960s, Soviet genetics was in a parlous state. This led Soviet molecular biologists to agree to create bioweapons in return for a huge increase in funding.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to have been the slightest suspicion among the Western scientists that anything might be amiss. Looking back, the age and behaviour of the Soviet delegation at Asilomar seemed almost designed to deflect attention. According to the Rolling Stone article, one US microbiologist chuckled: “These Russians, they just send over the old guys from the [Soviet Academy of Sciences] who don’t know anything. You ask them something and they hedge around — and it’s not that they’re hiding things … they just don’t know in the first place”. Delegates were further amused when one of the Soviets used a camera fitted with a flashbulb to take photographs of slides that were being presented (all that would have appeared on the film would be a white screen). Convinced that the Soviets were harmless, the chortling Americans paid them no further attention, although one of the conference organizers, Maxine Singer, later officially noted their support and cooperation.\n\nApart from Rogers, the journalists were equally incurious. He found the Soviet presence “somewhat puzzling”, and asked one of the delegates whether the Soviet Union viewed molecular biology as militarily significant (there was no direct answer). Rogers also noted that the delegation was accompanied by “a charming, dapper, San Francisco vice-consul, performing chaperon service”. You do not need to be a spy novelist to realize this man’s real role — the Soviet Union’s consulate in San Francisco was the notorious centre of a huge spy operation (and was closed down by the US government in 2017). It seems unlikely that Western security agencies blithely allowed their scientists to discuss the future of genetic engineering, with its evident potential for bioweapons development, and in the presence of Soviet scientists, without any supervision or surveillance. What form that might have taken is unknown.\n\nBiological arms race\n\nWhether or not the Soviet delegation learnt anything at Asilomar that was of direct relevance to the Biopreparat programme, the conference and its decisions did provide civilian cover for the huge expansion of biotechnology in the Soviet Union. On 20 February 1977, the Los Angeles Times suggested Soviet interest in this area could be used to develop bioweapons, but Baev insisted that any use of recombinant DNA in biological warfare would breach both the BWC and “the moral code of science”. The US Defense Intelligence Agency was similarly sanguine (or unimaginative), reporting in 1976 that the sudden increase in Soviet genetic-engineering capacity was simply a response to “embarrassment” at the US lead in the field.",

          "authors": "Rachel Brazil",
          "abstract": "Could you double the lifespan of a mouse, decipher passages in scrolls destroyed nearly 2,000 years ago or, in less than 30 minutes, detect bacteria that cause urinary-tract infections? If so, you would have been eligible to win one of a barrage of ‘challenge prizes’ — the above examples alone provide rewards of more than £12 million (US$15 million). Such prizes have seen a resurgence in the past decade, in the hope that a hefty reward can turbocharge innovation and solve some of society’s stickiest problems.\n\nThe concept of a challenge prize is not new. One of the most famous examples is the 1714 Longitude prize, offered by the UK Parliament to find a method for determining longitude at sea. More than 50 years later, clockmaker John Harrison won it with a marine chronometer that was able to accurately keep time on a rough sea journey.\n\nThe winning solution “changed the world”, says Tris Dyson, managing director of Challenge Works, the London-based non-profit organization that runs challenge prizes across the globe. In 2014, 300 years after the original, Challenge Works launched its own Longitude prize to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Dyson says that running a successful innovation prize takes a lot more than simply dangling a pot of money, and Challenge Works now provides support ranging from funding grants to community-building events.\n\nThe current interest in such prizes came out of concerns that the pace of innovation was slowing, and with public finances becoming more constrained, prizes could offer a cheaper way to stimulate new ideas.\n\nPrizes can de-risk innovation spending, and this is one attraction of the American-Made programme, launched in 2018 by the US Department of Energy to advance technologies to support clean energy. The programme has administered more than 100 prizes, including the annual flagship Solar prize, and has allocated $400 million in prize money. “We reward people for the work that they already do,” says programme manager Debbie Brodt-Giles. “To the government, it’s very low-risk.” The programme also diversifies who is funded by providing a low barrier to entry. “It could be an innovator working out of their garage, or a large-scale company.”\n\nFor researchers, it’s a chance to apply their knowledge to real-world challenges and move in a direction that conventional research funding often doesn’t allow. Even for unsuccessful applicants, participation can lead to a start-up venture, an advance in a research goal or a renewed enthusiasm for innovation.\n\nDyson describes the modern Longitude prize as Challenge Works’ most audacious and high-risk venture. “We didn’t know if we were going to get a winner,” he says.\n\nEncouraging innovators in stages\n\nA partnership with the UK government, the prize featured a public vote on the BBC to select the topic. AMR won, and the £8-million contest was designed around creating an affordable, accurate, rapid and easy-to-use diagnostic test for bacterial urinary-tract infections (UTIs).\n\nMicrobiologist Emma Hayhurst took up the challenge. Then at the University of Cardiff, UK, she is now chief executive of Llusern Scientific in Cardiff, a company she co-founded to commercialize the technology she and her collaborators developed. “I can absolutely 100% say that without the Longitude prize, that wouldn’t have got off the ground,” she says. In 2016, she had just returned to science after maternity leave and was looking to kick-start her research by focusing on AMR. She used skills she had already developed in replicating DNA and RNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a single-test-tube molecular technique that can amplify nucleic acids without having to cycle temperatures. Eventually, she created Lodestar DX, a device that uses LAMP to identify six common UTI-causing pathogens in 35 minutes (J. Diggle et al. JCR-Antimicrob. 6, dlae148; 2024).\n\nThe SunFlex team won $650,000 from the American-Made programme for its solar modules.Credit: Sunflex Solar\n\nAn important aspect of the competition, Hayhurst says, was the clear requirement that the winning solution should be user-friendly and inexpensive, two of eight mandatory criteria. “It made us focus very early on,” she says, and provided concrete goals.\n\nBut having a clear brief and offering a seven-figure reward is often not enough to stimulate innovation, says Anton Howes, head of innovation research at The Entrepreneurs Network, a London-based think tank. People think of the Longitude prize “as a big sum of money that was put up for solving this big problem, and then people came forth with their solutions”, he says. “That’s not really how it works.” The 1714 prize, he points out, awarded small sums along the way to develop promising ideas. Harrison, for example, received £250 in 1737 to improve his sea clock.\n\nThe AMR Longitude prize also provided partial funding. “They gave us £16,000, enough to employ a research assistant for 6 months,” says Hayhurst. Unlike a conventional grant, the funding was not dependent on having a proven track record in the field. “Anyone from anywhere can apply, as long as the idea is good,” she says. Her team also sourced small amounts of money from the University of Cardiff and the Welsh government, crucial to help produce a prototype.\n\nThe American-Made prizes also provide some funding to help lower the barriers to entry, and the programme employs ‘power connectors’ — people who help with outreach and the recruitment of innovators beyond the organization’s typical networks.\n\nHolly Jamieson, executive director of Challenge Works, says that many of its prizes now include more competition stages: the organization funds an initial cohort that is whittled down, with increased funding at each stage. Challenge Works used this model for its second Longitude prize, launched in 2022, which offered £4.4 million to create technology to help people with dementia live independently. In 2023, 24 semi-finalists each got £80,000 to produce a prototype, with five finalists then getting £300,000 each to develop innovations such as smart glasses to aid memory and a remote safety-monitoring system. The winner, to be announced next year, will get £1 million. Similarly, the American-Made Solar prize awards 20 first-stage competitors $50,000, ”enough to keep them energized and working towards that next goal”, says Brodt-Giles, with $100,000 for ten finalists and then two final $500,000 prizes. The competition also awards vouchers that grant access to US national lab facilities to help accelerate innovations.\n\nThe 2022 winner, Origami Solar, based in Bend, Oregon, produces steel frames that house solar panels and that use less materials than existing set-ups, drastically lowering the carbon footprint of installation. The company received $150,000 in vouchers which it used at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to investigate whether the frames could be used in any climate. “Solar can provide energy in even extreme climates, but you have to have panels able to handle snow loads,” says founder Eric Hafter. “With Sandia, we’ve been doing extensive snow-load testing.”\n\nHafter says the competition has been central to their success. “That level of validation was like going from a stationary concrete diving board to a springboard, something that really gave us so much more momentum.”\n\nRunner-up rewards\n\nEnvironmental systems modeller John Gallagher, at Trinity College Dublin, vied for one of the first European Commission Horizon prizes. The 2018 award was €3 million (US$3.1 million) for ways to reduce the concentration of particulates in urban areas. He had been working for several years with a colleague to provide a pre-filtration process for mechanical ventilation systems in urban buildings, to remove particulates from the air.\n\nGallagher received funding to move his ideas forwards, and says that compared with other European funding, the prize “didn’t have the same level of reporting required around it, which was fantastic”. His team’s prototype reduced the energy consumption of ventilation systems by one-third and was one of only two to progress to the final stage, but the prize ultimately went to a large multinational company. “We went to the ceremony and sat beside the winner and clapped for the winner, and they received €3 million as a company, and we received zero,” he remembers. “I think that was the hardest part”, because both teams’ work contained innovations. Hayhurst also missed out on the Longitude prize but feels her team came close. “I’d love it if there were second and third prizes, not just all to one winner, because I feel that we could have done an awful lot with even some of that money.”\n\nInnovator and entrepreneur Emma Hayhurst.Credit: Llusern Scientific\n\nUnlike Hayhurst’s, Gallagher’s innovation ultimately stalled for lack of more-substantial funding. Undeterred, he is now competing in Science Foundation Ireland’s Sustainable Communities Challenge. His team’s entry is a phone app that helps rural communities to manage water scarcity, contamination and infrastructure issues, using real-time monitoring and artificial intelligence for better decision-making. It is one of 12 projects to make the penultimate round, each of which was awarded €250,000.\n\nEven if he doesn’t win this time, Gallagher says that taking part in these competitions has made him keener to explore the commercial opportunities that arise from his research. “It can accelerate real-world impact” more so than continuing at the pace of basic research, he adds.\n\nIn the end, the 2024 AMR Longitude prize was awarded to diagnostic company Sysmex Astrego, based in Uppsala, Sweden. Its PA-100 AST point-of-care test captures bacterial cells directly from urine samples using a microfluidic chip, and monitors their growth rates when exposed to nine antibiotics (Ö. Baltekin et al. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 114, 9170–9175; 2017), to indicate which drug should work best against a UTI.\n\nOriginally called Astrego, the firm was acquired by a Japanese company called Sysmex in 2022, which helped it to grow. But being part of the competition provided the company with both external validation and inspiration for its technology. “It gives some legitimacy to what we’re doing, that this is something that is needed,” says chief executive Mikael Olsson. “It has motivated a lot of people within the team.”\n\nContests that spur collaboration\n\nDo challenge prizes elevate competition above cooperation? They are competitive, especially in the later stages, agrees Dyson, but earlier on, “can actually be quite collaborative”. Jamieson adds that there are cases of teams combining during Challenge Works competitions.\n\nThe Vesuvius Challenge successfully blended competition and cooperation in its contest to use machine learning and computer vision to read the Herculaneum scrolls that were buried and carbonized by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in ad 79. “For me, this is the gold standard” of how a challenge prize should be run, says Howes.",

          "title": "Migraine is more than a headache — a radical rethink offers hope to one billion people",
          "authors": "Fred Schwaller",
          "abstract": "Andrea West remembers the first time she heard about a new class of migraine medication that could end her decades of pain. It was 2021 and she heard a scientist on the radio discussing the promise of gepants, a class of drug that for the first time seemed to prevent migraine attacks. West followed news about these drugs closely, and when she heard last year that atogepant was approved for use in the United Kingdom, she went straight to her physician.\n\nWest had endured migraines for 70 years. Since she started taking the drug, she hasn’t had one. “It’s marvellous stuff. It’s genuinely changed my life,” she says.\n\nFor ages, the perception of migraine has been one of suffering with little to no relief. In ancient Egypt, physicians strapped clay crocodiles to people’s heads and prayed for the best. And as late as the seventeenth century, surgeons bored holes into people’s skulls — some have suggested — to let the migraine out. The twentieth century brought much more effective treatments, but they did not work for a significant fraction of the roughly one billion people who experience migraine worldwide.\n\nWhat causes migraines? Study of ‘brain blackout’ offers clues\n\nNow there is a new sense of progress running through the field, brought about by developments on several fronts. Medical advances in the past few decades — including the approval of gepants and related treatments — have redefined migraine as “a treatable and manageable condition”, says Diana Krause, a neuropharmacologist at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nAt the same time, research is leading to a better understanding about the condition — and pointing to directions for future work. Studies have shown, for example, that migraine is a broad phenomenon that originates in the brain and can manifest in many debilitating symptoms, including light sensitivities and aura, brain fog and fatigue. “I used to think that disability travels with pain, and it’s only when the pain gets severe that people are impaired. That’s not only false, but we have treatments to do something about it,” says Richard Lipton, a neurologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.\n\nResearchers are trying to discover what triggers a migraine-prone brain to flip into a hyperactive state, causing a full-blown attack, or for that matter, what makes a brain prone to the condition. A new and broader approach to research and treatment is needed, says Arne May, a neurologist at the University Medical Center Hamburg–Eppendorf in Germany. To stop migraine completely and not just headache pain, he says, “we need to create new frameworks to understand how the brain activates the whole system of migraine”.\n\nWonder drugs?\n\nWhen May started researching migraine in the 1990s, the leading hypotheses were that migraine was either a psychological issue or a vascular headache disorder, with throbbing pain caused by dilation of blood vessels. The psychological associations came with stigma, May says. “No one believed people who had migraine, they just thought they didn’t want to work. Nearly all of my patients at that time had to see a psychologist or psychiatrist.” The field, Krause says, is still recovering from these ideas. Most clinicians have abandoned the idea that the problem is psychological, but the notion that migraine is akin to a particularly bad headache persists even now.\n\nA lot changed in the 1990s, when May and others began conducting brain scans of people with migraine. The researchers saw for the first time that brain regions were activated during headache attacks, showing that it was more than just a vascular issue1. “From that point on, a lot of things changed. It was the very first time someone could point to migraine and say it’s a biological disease,” says May.\n\nResearchers found that changes in the brain’s activity start appearing at what’s known as the premonitory phase, which begins hours to days before an attack (see ‘Migraine is cyclical’). The premonitory phase is characterized by a swathe of symptoms, including nausea, food cravings, faintness, fatigue and yawning. That’s often followed by a days-long migraine attack phase, which comes with overwhelming headache pain and other physical and psychological symptoms. After the attack subsides, the postdrome phase has its own associated set of symptoms that include depression, euphoria and fatigue. An interictal phase marks the time between attacks and can involve symptoms as well.\n\nSource: N. Karsan & P. J. Goadsby Nature Rev. Neurol. 14, 699–710 (2018).\n\nBut the type, severity and causes of migraine symptoms can differ between people. Dom Horton, who is 53 and an editor in the United Kingdom, never gets headaches. But he experiences other migraine symptoms all the time. “Constant dizziness and a swimming mind are always present,” he says, and they sometimes build to a severity that prevents him from leaving his house. Fiona Gartside, a 60-year-old veterinary surgeon in Scotland, experiences sensitivities to noise, light and movement, overwhelming exhaustion and headaches that get so severe that she occasionally loses consciousness, “which is a relief”, she says. Migraine can even drive full-blown visual hallucinations similar to the ‘reflections of the living light’ painted by Hildegard von Bingen, a twelfth-century abbess who was thought to have experienced a condition that is now called migraine with aura.\n\nDespite the variety of symptoms, it was research into normal, non-migraine associated headaches that led to revolutionary treatments for migraine. Gepant drugs and a handful of monoclonal antibodies have been designed to block activity of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). They came from decades of research on the role of CGRP in headache and are a real “bench to bedside success story”, according to Peter Goadsby, a neurologist at King’s College London, who pioneered the research along with Lars Edvinsson, a neuroscientist at Lund University, Sweden, and collaborators in the 1980s.\n\nChronic pain can be treated — so why are millions still suffering?\n\nHeadache begins when sensory nerves called nociceptors in the meninges become sensitized, sending information to the brain to evoke pain. Goadsby’s work showed that CGRP is a key factor in sensitizing these nociceptors. Clinical trials of drugs that block the peptide in people with migraine proved effective both in alleviating headache and sometimes in preventing attacks from starting2. Goadsby says it’s been stunning to see the completeness of people’s responses to gepants. “Patients come back and literally cry,” he says. “They’d forgotten before what normal was.”\n\nFrom the successes of CGRP blockers, it’s tempting to view CGRP as a ‘factor X’ of migraine. Yet it’s clear that other elements are at play. CGRP blockers work only for a subset of people, as few as one in five according to some studies3. And for those who do respond well to the drugs, some migraine symptoms often persist. West, for example, still has bouts of nausea even though the drug she takes, atogepant, stops her migraine attacks. And although atogepant has minimized Gartside’s symptoms, migraine still dominates her life. “There is a constant juggle between prevention, medication, trigger avoidance, fatigue, fear and anticipation of attacks,” she says.\n\nMigraine in the brain\n\nGoadsby says the mixed results of CGRP blockers show a huge gap in the biological understanding of migraine. “This tells us there are other frameworks of migraine that need to be discovered, and other pathways,” he says. May agrees. He thinks the field needs a radical change in thinking to find new mechanisms of migraine. “We’re focusing too much on migraine as a headache disease,” he says. “The thinking for most people stops at CGRP, but CGRP isn’t the only answer.” The problem, he says, is that scientists don’t fully understand what a migraine attack looks like in the brain.\n\nStudies in the past seven years or so have solidified the hypothalamus as a centre of the condition4. “It must involve the limbic system, of which the hypothalamus is the king,” May says. The limbic system is a group of interconnected brain structures that process sensory information and regulate emotions. Studies that scanned the brains of people with migraine every few days for several weeks showed that hypothalamic connectivity to various parts of the brain increases just before a migraine attack begins, then collapses during the headache phase5.\n\nUS drug agency approves potent painkiller — the first non-opioid in decades\n\nMay and others think that the hypothalamus loses control over the limbic system about two days before the attack begins, and it results in changes to conscious experiences that might explain symptoms such as light- and sound-sensitivity, or cognitive impairments. At the same time, the breakdown of hypothalamic control puts the body’s homeostatic balance out of kilter, which explains why symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, yawning and food cravings are common when a migraine is building up, says Krause.\n\nGoadsby agrees that the hypothalamus is important, but thinks it’s more complex than simply a loss of control. He hypothesizes that an attack could begin when any part of a ‘migraine network’, potentially including the hypothalamus, thalamus and limbic system, is overstimulated. Researchers have yet to pinpoint precisely which brain regions are part of the network, or the “exact order of batting” of when these regions are activated during an attack, Goadsby says.\n\nPredispositions and triggers\n\nMigraine researchers now talk of a hypothetical ‘migraine threshold’ in which environmental or physiological triggers tip brain activity into a dysregulated state.\n\nThe list of potential triggers is extensive. West’s migraines are closely linked to certain foods and to hunger, stress and hormonal changes. She used to get terrible headaches with her period, then after menopause they developed into full-blown three-day migraines. More than half of women with migraine experience attacks every month during menstruation. And migraine is also three times more prevalent in women than in men; it’s the number one debilitating issue for cisgender women in their reproductive years, and it seems equally prevalent in transgender women taking hormone replacement therapy.",

The meeting, scheduled for 3 March, comes after more than 1,300 scientists signed an open letter expressing “deep concerns” about the conduct of billionaire Musk, who is a fellow.\n\nMusk is working closely with US President Donald Trump on sweeping government reforms that threaten flagship US research programmes and are causing havoc for scientists in the United States and globally. He is also accused of spreading misinformation on the social-media site X, which he owns.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nTwo Royal Society fellows have resigned over the institution’s perceived lack of action over Musk’s behaviour in recent months.\n\n“It is tarnishing their reputation and to some degree devalues the honour of awarding fellowships. Does one want to be associated to a society that does not stand up for its values?” says Stephen Curry, a retired structural biologist at Imperial College London, who wrote the letter and published it on his blog on 11 February.\n\nA spokesperson for the Royal Society says that issues raised about individual fellows are dealt with in confidence and in accordance with its code-of-conduct processes. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPrestigious appointment\n\nMusk became a fellow of the society — the world’s oldest science academy — in 2018 for his companies’ development of technologies such as space rockets, electric cars and brain implants. The society has about 1,800 living fellows and foreign members, and being elected is considered one of the most prestigious appointments in UK science. Scientists are nominated for making a “substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge”, and selected through a rigorous competitive process.\n\nTrump appointed Musk, the world’s richest man, to lead an advisory group called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that is tasked with finding cuts to government spending and reducing regulation. So far, the administration has attempted to freeze federal research grants and slash funding by the US National Institutes of Health.\n\nCurry’s letter describes “an assault on scientific research”. “It has sought to impose huge cuts in funding and a regime of censorship (particularly with regard to [equity, diversity and inclusion] and climate issues) that is a direct threat to freedom of expression and academic freedom.” These actions contravene the society’s code of conduct for fellows, he says.\n\n‘High anxiety moment’: Biden’s NIH chief talks Trump 2.0 and the future of US science\n\nResearchers worldwide have signed the letter, which calls for the society to stand up for the scientific community and “the values it claims to believe in”.\n\nNature understands that the society has scheduled a meeting of fellows next month to “discuss public pronouncements and behaviours of other fellows”.\n\nIt has been more than 150 years since a fellow has been expelled from the society, according to the spokesperson.",

          "title": "Why is it so hard to rewrite a genome?",
          "authors": "Michael Eisenstein",
          "abstract": "When Patrick Yizhi Cai reflects on the state of synthetic genomics, he recalls the Big DNA Contest. Launched in 2004, the competition challenged synthetic biologists to design a novel, functional 40,000-base-pair DNA sequence that the contest sponsor, US DNA-synthesis firm Blue Heron Biotech (now Eurofins Genomics Blue Heron) would manufacture for free.\n\nIt was no small prize: at the time, producing this modest slab of DNA — less than 1% the length of the Escherichia coli genome — would have cost roughly US$250,000. The company’s aim was to energize the then-nascent field of synthetic biology. “In the end, zero applications were received,” says Cai, a synthetic biologist at the University of Manchester, UK. “That just tells you that even if you could make synthetic DNA for free, nobody really had enough imagination 20 years ago.”\n\nEngineered yeast breaks new record: a genome with over 50% synthetic DNA\n\nToday, steady progress in genomics and computational biology — not to mention DNA synthesis and assembly — have yielded multiple examples of what an ambitious, imaginative genome-writing effort can achieve. The synthetic bacterial strain JCVI-syn3A, developed at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in La Jolla, California, is a streamlined version of Mycoplasma mycoides that survives and replicates despite having had several hundred non-essential genes stripped away1. Various groups are engineering E. coli strains in which the genetic code has been altered to enable production of proteins containing amino acids beyond the 20 typically observed in nature. And last year, the multinational Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0) completed construction of heavily engineered versions of every chromosome in the eukaryotic budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae — comprising some 12 million base pairs in all.\n\nThese efforts have been invaluable learning experiences, says Akos Nyerges, a synthetic-genomics researcher involved with the E. coli rewriting effort in George Church’s lab at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. “You can mimic and test evolutionary steps which otherwise would have taken billions of years to evolve — or wouldn’t have evolved ever,” he says. But they have also laid bare how much we still don’t understand about the fundamental language of the genome. Every genome-rewriting program so far has grappled with substantial and unexpected challenges, and the era of made-to-order genomes remains out of reach. When it comes to heavily modified genomes, says Nyerges, “we underestimated how complex biology is”.\n\nBack to basics\n\nMost synthetic-genome projects are ‘top-down’ efforts that take a naturally occurring organism and pare away or redesign its DNA. That provides a valuable initial framework relative to ‘bottom-up’ approaches, in which the goal is to build a working genome from scratch. After all, explains Farren Isaacs, a genome engineer at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, when it comes to tinkering with genomes, the margin for error is surprisingly slim. “If you create an error in an essential gene, you’re going to wipe the organism out.”\n\nA key goal of the JCVI and Sc2.0 projects was to determine which genes are truly essential — a characteristic that is surprisingly hard to predict. John Glass, leader of the JCVI’s synthetic-biology programme, says that when he and his team published2 their 2016 report on their first minimal cell, nearly one-third of the cell’s remaining genes (149 of 473) had no known function. “I’d say it’s 78 now,” he adds.\n\nTo determine which genes were necessary, both projects used random mutagenesis — basically, introducing untargeted perturbations throughout the genome and asking which ones the cells could tolerate and which ones severely undermined cellular viability.\n\nHow to build a genome\n\nBut essentiality is a slippery concept, particularly given that most genomes contain redundancies and ‘fail-safe’ mechanisms to minimize the impact of individual mutations. Glass and his colleagues encountered dozens of instances in which mutagenesis revealed pairs of seemingly dissimilar genes that unexpectedly performed overlapping functions. As a result, there is no single minimal genome, he explains. “You take away one [gene], and with each choice, you’re going down a different road to a slightly different minimal cell.” Furthermore, many bacterial genes have multiple jobs, making it difficult to recognize which is the essential function. Glass cites the example of enolase, an enzyme with a well-known role in carbohydrate metabolism that also, it turns out, helps to degrade unwanted RNA.\n\nIncreasingly sophisticated computational ‘whole-cell models’ could help to remove some of the guesswork from future genome-trimming efforts. In 2020, mathematician Lucia Marucci and synthetic biologist Claire Grierson, both at the University of Bristol, UK, led an effort to simulate genome-reduction strategies in a whole-cell model of Mycoplasma genitalium — a close relative of the microorganism edited by the JCVI3. Their analysis, which used elaborate models of cellular processes and their interactions, suggested two redesigns with distinct sets of genes deleted, each yielding genomes that were roughly 40% smaller than the natural M. genitalium genome.\n\nMore recently, Marucci and Grierson have begun working with sophisticated whole-cell models of E. coli. As described in a 2024 preprint4, their current efforts combine mechanistic models with machine learning to predict the consequences of genome manipulation across a broad range of biological functions. These are described by thousands of interlinked equations, yielding blueprints for bacteria that have 40% fewer genes than wild-type E. coli. “We now have a bunch of minimized reduced genomes that we want to test in the laboratory,” Marucci says.\n\nFind and replace\n\nRather than making abridged editions of the genome, other groups have set out to subtly reword the genetic text — encountering an entirely different set of challenges.\n\nSynthetic yeast genome reveals its versatility\n\nProtein-coding sequences are built of nucleotide triplets known as codons. With 61 possible codons for the 20 naturally occurring amino acids as well as 3 ‘stop’ codons that terminate protein synthesis, there is considerable redundancy in the resulting code. Various teams have shown that, by comprehensively converting each instance of a given codon to one of its ‘synonyms’, one can repurpose that codon. This month, for example, Isaacs and his colleagues described an E. coli strain called Ochre in which two stop codons were reassigned to direct the incorporation of the non-natural amino acids para-acetyl-l-phenylalanine and Nε-Boc-l-lysine5. These amino acids have chemical properties and functions that don’t exist in nature, but recoding can also serve as a ‘firewall’ that prevents the interaction and exchange of genetic material with other organisms in natural environments.\n\nSuch work might sound straightforward — simply substituting one codon for another — but genome recoding requires much planning and effort. After researchers have found all instances of the codon they wish to eliminate, they must then work out how to replace it without disrupting the affected genes or regulatory machinery. Bacterial genes often contain regulatory sequences in the protein-coding sequence, Nyerges points out, and a gene on one DNA strand can overlap with a gene on the opposite strand. Seemingly minor changes can thus have major, unexpected consequences.\n\nNyerges, Church and their colleagues are grappling with this challenge at an unprecedented scale as they finalize a heavily recoded variant of E. coli that uses only 57 of the 61 naturally occurring amino-acid codons6. This effort has entailed more than 73,000 changes to the strain’s 4-megabase genome, which inevitably creates unintended effects. “Some things will happen readily with no impact on growth or fitness, while others have a striking impact,” says Nyerges. Some changes disabled existing regulatory elements or unwittingly created new one; others established new protein-coding sequences. “And we’re only learning about this as we go.”\n\nComputer-generated models of the synthetic minimal cell created by researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, California.Credit: Laboratory of Zaida Luthey-Schulten\n\nSorting out these issues is a substantial undertaking in its own right. For example, throughout the recoding process for their Ochre strain, Isaacs and his team used extensive ‘multi-omic’ analyses to characterize the bacterium. “We collected metabolic profiling data under different [culture] conditions,” he says. “We also collected proteomics data comparing the recoded cell to a few different progenitors, including wild-type cells.” In this way, they systematically tweaked the genome until the cells were able to grow under standard culture conditions at roughly the same rate as unmodified bacteria — a non-trivial result, given that genome recoding often impairs growth. Nyerges and his colleagues likewise turned to multi-omics to troubleshoot their 57-codon genome. They also used an experimental strategy that spurs rapid evolution of bacteria in culture, to promote the selection of genome mutations that improve fitness.\n\nAlgorithmic tools are also helping researchers to model and predict the outcomes of some genome-rewriting experiments in advance. For instance, synthetic biologist Howard Salis’s team at Pennsylvania State University in University Park uses quantitative data from high-throughput screens of both genetically modified cells and strands of synthetic DNA to develop algorithms that can define, characterize and even design sequences that govern processes such as transcription and translation. “A typical paper for us nowadays is anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 different defined, designed experiments,” says Salis. The results are used to extract testable physical principles that allow the algorithms to predict, for example, how changes to a gene’s promoter sequence alter downstream expression.\n\n“You can ground-truth everything,” says Salis. “And we can combine our existing models to design the next experiments to understand the remaining misunderstood stuff.” Indeed, the Church lab has used several of Salis’s tools to design its 57-codon microbe. Nyerges says such algorithms have been a substantial asset — albeit not enough to prevent considerable troubleshooting. “Even very tiny changes can cumulatively lead to significant fitness problems once you add up thousands of genes in a genome,” he says.\n\nBrewing progress in eukaryotes",

          "abstract": "Psychologist Laura Steenbergen speaking at a TEDx event.Credit: TEDx\n\nLaura Steenbergen met her scientific mentor as an undergraduate. In 2009, she began a bachelor’s degree in psychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands and did her undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Lorenza Colzato, a cognitive psychologist with a prolific academic output. Steenbergen soon realized she enjoyed research, and with Colzato’s help, she transitioned into a master’s degree, then a PhD. They made a good team, Steenbergen thought.\n\nSteenbergen says she found it hard at first as a student with hardly any research experience to know whether Colzato’s research practices were unusual. Steenbergen had always appreciated that her mentor worked efficiently. Sometimes, for example, according to Steenbergen, Colzato would say that she had obtained ethics approval from the university for studies involving research participants after just one or two weeks. And once Steenbergen started talking to participants herself to collect data, she noticed that Colzato would report the findings in their papers for substantially fewer people than had actually participated in a research project, without specifying why some people’s results were omitted from the data analysis.\n\nAccording to Steenbergen, Colzato dismissed her concerns and would instead question whether science was an appropriate choice for the PhD student — a painful thing for Steenbergen to hear because she knew she wanted a scientific career.\n\nWhistleblowing in science: this physician faced ostracization after standing up to pharma\n\nEventually, after speaking to another PhD student and a postdoctoral researcher in Colzato’s laboratory, Steenbergen realized that her concerns weren’t all in her head. It wasn’t clear what the junior researchers could do about it, however. The Cognitive Psychology Unit within the Institute of Psychology where they worked was headed by Colzato’s husband, Bernhard Hommel. Because of this, they felt that they had limited recourse to other colleagues, Steenbergen says.\n\nSteenbergen continued to work with Colzato, starting a one-year postdoc position in 2016. She explains that, because she completed her PhD in only two years, she had no time to consider jobs elsewhere.\n\nAfter that, she worked briefly at other universities, including the University of Amsterdam and Ohio State University in Columbus, exposing her to other workplaces and making her realize that Colzato’s research practices were unusual.\n\nData doubt\n\nIn 2018, she returned to Leiden University as an assistant professor. It was at that point that new students working with Colzato asked Steenbergen why data were being deleted, she says.\n\nThis prompted her and a former colleague to report their concerns about research integrity to Sander Nieuwenhuis, the head of the Cognitive Psychology Unit (by this stage, Hommel had moved on from that position). In 2019, Philip Spinhoven, scientific director of the Institute of Psychology, submitted an internal complaint regarding Colzato and a suspected violation of academic integrity, based on what he had been told.\n\nThe university’s Academic Integrity Committee conducted an investigation, considering four allegations in total. In its 27-page ruling in 2019 (in which names are redacted), it stated: “The Defendant has repeatedly selectively omitted research results and has not reported this or given reasons for it. She has thus violated academic integrity.”\n\nThe committee also acknowledged that the group’s young, less experienced researchers were not responsible for the violations.\n\nCollection: Career resources for PhD students\n\nColzato was suspended by the university in 2019 and then resigned. In 2020, a journal article co-authored by her and Steenbergen was retracted1, followed by a second in 20212. Data manipulation was given as the reason in each case. The retractions were a relief to Steenbergen, although she still struggled with anxiety over her decision to report the problems, saying: “It feels like I filed a process against my scientific mother.”\n\nIn Colzato’s response to a 2019 Retraction Watch article about the outcome of the misconduct hearing, she described herself as a scapegoat, and maintained that she had experienced “wonderful” working relationships with Steenbergen and the colleagues who had raised the concerns.\n\nShe admitted obtaining blood from human participants when approval had not been granted by Leiden University’s Medical Ethics Review Committee, but in the Retraction Watch article points out that Steenbergen carried out the procedures.\n\nSteenbergen says that power dynamics were in play around the blood collection, and that “being a PhD student, it feels like you have to do that”.\n\nTaking action\n\nSteenbergen says the case has exacted a personal toll. During the investigation, when all the publications she had co-authored with Colzato came under scrutiny, “I felt frozen in science, because who’s going to take you seriously if everything about your work is suspicious? So I needed things to be open.”\n\nOn returning to work after a period of absence in 2023 and seeing that her PhD dissertation had recently been downloaded by others, she wanted to take action but wasn’t sure how to proceed. There are examples of authors choosing to retract their own papers and of dissertations being retracted against the authors’ wishes. But Steenbergen says she had no model for acknowledging the issues in her own dissertation.\n\nOn talking to other faculty members, she proposed to print “retracted” over the two chapters of her nine-chapter dissertation that had been affected by Colzato’s misconduct, and to write a cover note for the document. “I didn’t want to erase it or change it,” Steenbergen explains. She remembers thinking, “It’s more constructive if I use it.”\n\nSteenbergen says the university was supportive. In October 2024, two months after she made her proposal, the dissertation was corrected with retractions for two chapters and an expression of concern for another chapter on which a journal publication was based.\n\n“This is unprecedented in my experience,” says Dorothy Bishop, a retired developmental neuropsychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who writes about scientific integrity. “It looks like Steenbergen did the right thing, which can’t have been easy for her.”\n\nBishop says that this case illustrates the potentially catastrophic effect of a principal investigator’s research misconduct on an early-career researcher in their lab, adding: “Many leave the field,” which is especially likely when universities do not back whistleblowers.",

          "abstract": "Superconductors would make make many technologies radically more efficient.Credit: Patrick Gaillardin/Look At Sciences/SPL\n\nA new family of superconductors is exciting physicists. Compounds containing nickel have been shown to carry electricity without resistance at the relatively high temperature of 45 kelvin (–228 °C), and without being squeezed under pressure.\n\nPhysicists at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China, observed the key hallmarks of superconductivity in a thin film of crystals of nickel oxide, which they grew in the laboratory. They published their work1 in Nature on 17 February.\n\nHow would room-temperature superconductors change science?\n\n“There’s a huge hope that we could eventually raise the critical temperature and make [such materials] more useful for applications,” says Danfeng Li, a physicist at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\nNickelates now join two groups of ceramics — copper-based cuprates and iron-based pnictides — as ‘unconventional superconductors’ that operate at room pressure and at temperatures as high as 150K (–123 °C). This new data point could help physicists to finally explain how high-temperature superconductors work, and ultimately to design materials that operate under ambient conditions. This would make technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging, radically cheaper and more efficient.\n\nHow unconventional superconductors operate at warmer temperatures remains mostly a mystery, whereas the mechanism behind how some metals can carry electricity without resistance at colder temperatures, or extreme pressures, has been understood2 since 1957.\n\nThe advancement by the SUSTech researchers in precisely engineering the material’s properties will help them to understand unconventional superconductivity, says Lilia Boeri, a physicist at the Sapienza University of Rome. “The idea that you have a system that you can sort of tune experimentally is something quite exciting.”\n\nRaising temperatures\n\nExcitement about nickelates has been growing since 2019, when Li and his colleagues found hints that compounds containing nickel behaved similarly to superconductors, albeit at low temperatures. These materials’ structural similarity to cuprates raised hopes that nickelates could be coaxed to conduct at higher temperatures. A separate group demonstrated this in 2023, but the materials were under high pressure.\n\nCrystals of a nickelate compound.Credit: Argonne National Laboratory\n\nIn December, researchers at Stanford University in California saw the first signs of nickelate superconductivity under ambient pressure. The SUSTech researchers went further in latest study, showing that the nickelate crystals lost resistance at a critical temperature and expelled magnetic fields.\n\nNickelates have a way to go before their critical temperature — at which superconductivity kicks in — matches that of the cuprates. Increasing this is “a priority”, says Zhuoyu Chen, a physicist at SUSTech and a study co-author. The team is trying various tricks to tweak how the material is grown and its precise composition, he says.",

          "abstract": "NASA’s diverse astronaut corps was an example of the agency’s support for diversity and inclusion.Credit: James Blair/NASA/JSC\n\nIn the corridors of NASA buildings across the United States, Pride flags and pictures celebrating women in science are being taken down. Scientists are adding space-mission stickers to their laptops to cover ones that displayed rainbows and other symbols of LGBT+ support. Employees are stripping pronouns from their e-mail signatures and holding darkly humorous conversations in which they try to avoid saying any pronouns at all.\n\nThese and other changes are rippling through NASA, which is purging programmes involving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) throughout the agency. The directive to do so came from US President Donald Trump, who on 20 January issued an order to eliminate DEI initiatives across the federal government.\n\n“I get a sinking feeling in my stomach when I have to check my [work] e-mail,” says an early-career NASA scientist, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns about their career prospects. “Every time I reload it, it’s like, ‘oh god, will there be some new heinous missive in there?’”\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nNature spoke to scientists inside and outside NASA about the impacts of its DEI changes — and heard anger, fear and confusion. Although the orders affect all federal agencies, they are keenly felt at NASA, which has a long history of working towards inclusivity. In 2020, Trump appointee Jim Bridenstine, then head of NASA, added inclusion to the agency’s list of core values, joining safety, integrity, teamwork and excellence. That fifth value has now been removed from many NASA websites.\n\n“How do you go from something being so important that it’s a pillar [of the agency], to being so reviled that it’s off of everything?” asks Julie Rathbun, a planetary scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.\n\n“It feels like a betrayal by NASA,” says Kas Knicely, a planetary geophysicist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. “It’s inefficient, it’s wasteful, and it’s also just messed up.”\n\nIn a statement, NASA said the agency “is committed to engaging the best talent to drive innovation and achieve our mission for the benefit of all. As new guidance comes in, we’re working to adhere to new requirements in a timely manner.”\n\nA changed agency\n\nNASA’s push towards inclusivity is one of the most visible in the US government. In the 1950s and 1960s, all of the agency’s astronauts were white men. By 1978, it had bowed to internal and external pressure and had chosen several women and people of colour to fly to space. Today, NASA’s astronauts, as well as its world-renowned scientific and engineering teams, are measurably diverse.\n\nBut signs of NASA’s efforts to make space for everyone are disappearing. These removals have been triggered both by official edicts — such as the requirement to remove pronouns from employees’ e-mail signatures — and by unofficial notices, such as verbal suggestions to remove flags or other displays from workspaces.\n\n‘Mind-boggling’: US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers\n\nTrump’s changes have also halted projects by employee affinity organizations ― groups ranging from military veterans, to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, to Black employees. Before 20 January, NASA celebrated these groups’ efforts with many glowing, now-deleted web articles.\n\n“The work these groups did was wholesome and good for the agency — things like, discussing how do we publish data in a way that works with screen readers, so people with visual disabilities can get at our content,” says a senior NASA scientist, who requested anonymity to avoid possible reprisals. “Or bringing Star Trek legends in to inspire the workforce.” Pausing the work of these groups “promotes fear”, the scientist says, because employees worry that they might be targeted for participating.\n\nOther cancellations include a programme that paired undergraduates from underrepresented groups with active planetary missions, giving the students a chance to observe scientists at work.\n\nMany NASA employees are angry about the changes to DEI, but are buckling down to work nevertheless. “We believe in the mission, and we know that our work is important,” says the senior scientist. “We know that it matters for the nation.”\n\nGrassroots protest\n\nAs federal workers, NASA employees can’t push back against the changes, no matter how much they personally support DEI efforts, says Knicely, who co-chairs a community working group on best practices for DEI at NASA. But space scientists outside NASA are voicing their frustration with the agency’s rejection of years of progress towards a more diverse community. Several of them wrote an open letter to NASA leadership on 6 February protesting the changes, which has garnered more than 1,000 signatures.",

Standard treatments had been unable to hold the cancer back. It had spread to her bones, and the prognosis was poor.\n\nThe race to supercharge cancer-fighting T cells\n\nNineteen years later, she is cancer-free and the mother of two children. The remarkable success story, published on 17 February in Nature Medicine1, is the longest reported cancer remission following treatment with engineered immune cells called CAR T cells.\n\nIn the years since the girl’s treatment in 2006, CAR T cells have produced stunning results in some blood cancers such as leukaemia. Seven CAR-T-cell therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration since 2017, and some early recipients of CAR-T therapy have been cancer-free for more than a decade.\n\nBut researchers have struggled to repeat that success against solid tumours such as those caused by neuroblastoma, a nerve-cell cancer that is typically diagnosed in young children. That makes the latest results particularly good news, says Sneha Ramakrishna, a paediatric oncologist and cancer researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“This provides me with a lot of hope,” she says. “We’re going to unlock CAR T cells for people with solid tumours.”\n\nCell target\n\nCAR T cells are immune cells that have been engineered to make a protein called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). This protein is designed to latch onto a target found on a cancer cell, triggering the immune cell to attack and destroy it.\n\nWhy are so many young people getting cancer? What the data say\n\nWhen the Texas neuroblastoma study began in 2004, CAR-T-cell therapy was still a bit of a wild idea, says Helen Heslop, an immunotherapy researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and a member of the team that ran the trial. “This is some kind of weird synthetic biology,” she remembers thinking. “Will it actually work?”\n\nThe CAR-T-cell therapies Heslop and her colleagues tested then are now considered first-generation editions of the molecules. Later versions, including those that are now approved medicines, contain extra modifications to bolster their power. Heslop calls her first CAR-T-cell study “a vintage trial”.",

          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "Limited jobs in academia are deterring students from enroling in doctoral degrees in some countries.Credit: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty\n\nNumbers of people enrolling in PhD programmes have dropped in a handful of countries in the past few years, which policy specialists are calling a worrying trend. From Australia and Japan to Brazil and the United Kingdom, there are concerns that high living costs, low stipends and limited job options after graduation are deterring people from pursuing doctoral degrees.\n\nThese declining numbers should “act as a wake-up call” for those countries, says Cláudia Sarrico, a project lead at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris. “This is a signal you need to reform working conditions and think about diversifying career options — otherwise, you risk a talent drain that will ultimately slow down scientific progress.”\n\nThe most recent figures on this trend, released by Universities Australia and the Australian Council of Graduate Research (ACGR) in January, revealed an 8% reduction in the number of domestic PhD enrolments in Australia from 2018 to 2023, although the population of the country grew by more than 7% over the same period.\n\nPhD poverty\n\nIn many countries, one of the biggest factors deterring students from pursuing doctoral degrees is the high cost of living relative to how much they get paid.\n\nIn Australia, the average PhD stipend is roughly Aus$32,000 (US$20,000). “It is well under the minimum wage,” says Louise Sharpe, president of the ACGR, based in Melbourne, Australia. And although it is just above the poverty line for people who are single, the average doctoral student in the country is in their late thirties — often having come with experience working in different sectors — and have families and other responsibilities, Sharpe adds.\n\nFinancial insecurity is also one of the chief concerns for doctoral students in Japan, where the number of PhD students has been dropping since the early 2000s. In 2023, the number of domestic PhD enrolments was 15,014, compared with a high of 18,232 in 2003. In response to this issue, Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), announced plans last year to provide extra funding for doctoral students.\n\nPeople have also been losing an interest in postgraduate education on the other side of the ocean. Last year, the Brazilian Federal Agency for the Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES) released a report revealing that, in 2022, the country saw its lowest number of domestic PhD entrants in almost a decade. One factor was the COVID-19 pandemic, but that was not the only reason for the drop, says CAPES president Denise Pires de Carvalho, headquartered in Brasilia. The economic crisis in Brazil, along with the government’s unwillingness to increase funding for science and technology were also major contributors, Pires de Carvalho says.\n\nThings are beginning to shift. In 2023, the Brazilian government increased the value of grants for master’s and doctoral students by 40% — the first increase in a decade. This change brought with it a slight increase in enrolments in that same year.\n\nIn Canada, where PhD numbers haven’t yet dropped, a need for more funding to provide a living wage for doctoral students has been a big discussion over the past few years, says Adam Sarty, president-elect of the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies, who is based in Halifax. Last year, the Canadian government responded to this need by increasing graduate-student scholarships for the first time in more than two decades. This has been a welcome change, but Sarty notes that these grants only go to the top students — and extra changes are needed to provide more financial security to those who don’t win these scholarships.\n\nBut many Canadian universities are under financial strain because of a dip in enrolments in professional graduate programmes, such as MBAs, owing to a cap on international students that was put into place in 2024. Countries such as the United Kingdom have seen similar rules put in place in recent years — raising concerns about universities’ abilities to support early-career researchers.\n\nJob precarity",

The recent availability of fine-grained mobility data and context attributes ranging from venue type to demographic mixture offer researchers a deeper understanding of experienced inequalities at scale, and pose many new questions. Here we review emerging uses of urban mobility behaviour data, and propose an analytic framework to represent mobility patterns as a temporal bipartite network between people and places. As this network reconfigures over time, analysts can track experienced inequality along three critical dimensions: social mixing with others from specific demographic backgrounds, access to different types of facilities, and spontaneous adaptation to unexpected events, such as epidemics, conflicts or disasters. This framework traces the dynamic, lived experiences of urban inequality and complements prior work on static inequalities experience at home and work.",

          "abstract": "An enormous body of literature argues that recommendation algorithms drive political polarization by creating “filter bubbles” and “rabbit holes.” Using four experiments with nearly 9,000 participants, we show that manipulating algorithmic recommendations to create these conditions has limited effects on opinions. Our experiments employ a custom-built video platform with a naturalistic, YouTube-like interface presenting real YouTube videos and recommendations. We experimentally manipulate YouTube’s actual recommendation algorithm to simulate filter bubbles and rabbit holes by presenting ideologically balanced and slanted choices. Our design allows us to intervene in a feedback loop that has confounded the study of algorithmic polarization—the complex interplay between supply of recommendations and user demand for content—to examine downstream effects on policy attitudes. We use over 130,000 experimentally manipulated recommendations and 31,000 platform interactions to estimate how recommendation algorithms alter users’ media consumption decisions and, indirectly, their political attitudes. Our results cast doubt on widely circulating theories of algorithmic polarization by showing that even heavy-handed (although short-term) perturbations of real-world recommendations have limited causal effects on policy attitudes. Given our inability to detect consistent evidence for algorithmic effects, we argue the burden of proof for claims about algorithm-induced polarization has shifted. Our methodology, which captures and modifies the output of real-world recommendation algorithms, offers a path forward for future investigations of black-box artificial intelligence systems. Our findings reveal practical limits to effect sizes that are feasibly detectable in academic experiments.",

          "abstract": "Photosynthesis, the fundamental process using light energy to convert carbon dioxide to organic matter, is vital for life on Earth. It relies on capturing light through light-harvesting complexes (LHC) in photosystem I (PSI) and PSII and on the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Composition and organization of PSI and PSII core complexes are well conserved across evolution. PSII is particularly sensitive to photodamage but benefits from a large diversity of photoprotective mechanisms, finely tuned to handle the dynamic and ever-changing light conditions. Light Harvesting Complex protein family members (LHC and LHC-like families) have acquired a dual function during evolution. Members of the LHC antenna complexes of PS capture light energy, whereas others dissipate excess energy that cannot be harnessed for photosynthesis. This process mainly occurs through nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). In this work, we focus on the Light Harvesting complex-Like 4 (LHL4) protein, a LHC-like protein induced by ultraviolet-B (UV-B) and blue light through UV Resistance locus 8 (UVR8) and phototropin photoreceptor-activated signaling pathways in the model green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . We demonstrate that alongside established NPQ effectors, LHL4 plays a key role in photoprotection, preventing singlet oxygen accumulation in PSII and promoting cell survival upon light stress. LHL4 protective function is distinct from that of NPQ-related proteins, as LHL4 specifically and uniquely binds to the transient monomeric form of the core PSII complex, safeguarding its integrity. LHL4 characterization expands our understanding of the interplay between light harvesting and photoprotection mechanisms upon light stress in photosynthetic microalgae.",

Currently, no vaccine is available. To develop an effective multivalent vaccine against this free-living opportunistic eukaryotic pathogen, it is critical to identify protective antigens. We previously discovered ZNF2 oe strains elicit protective host immune responses and increase the abundance of antigens present in the capsule, which is required for its immunoprotection. Capsule is a defining feature of Cryptococcus species and composed of polysaccharides and mannoproteins. Here, we found increased levels of exposed mannoproteins in ZNF2 oe cells. As mannoproteins are the primary components recognized by anticryptococcal cell-mediated immune responses and few have been characterized, we systemically screened all 49 predicted GPI-mannoproteins in Cryptococcus neoformans for enhanced host recognition. We identified those highly present in ZNF2 oe cells and found Cig1 to be a protective antigen against cryptococcosis either as a recombinant protein vaccine or an mRNA vaccine. Cig1 is induced by iron limitation and is highly expressed by this fungus in infected mice and in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Remarkably, iron restriction by the host induces cryptococcal cells to express iron-uptake proteins including Cig1, which act as cryptococcal antigens and in turn enhance host detection. Our results highlight an arms race between the pathogen and the host centered on iron competition, and the trade-off between cryptococcal iron acquisition and antigen exposure. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging this host–pathogen interaction for vaccine development.",

          "abstract": "The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays an important role in neuronal signaling throughout the nervous system. Its implication in neurological disorders and inflammation has spurred the development of numerous compounds that enhance channel activation. However, the therapeutic potential of these compounds has been limited by the characteristically fast desensitization of the α7 receptor. Using recent high-resolution structures from cryo-EM, and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations augmented by Markov state modeling, here we explore the mechanism of α7 receptor desensitization and its implication on allosteric modulation. The results provide a precise characterization of the desensitization gate and illuminate the mechanism of ion-pore opening/closing with an agonist bound. In addition, the simulations reveal the existence of a short-lived, open-channel intermediate between the activated and desensitized states that rationalizes the paradoxical pharmacology of the L247T mutant and may be relevant to type-II allosteric modulation. This analysis provides an interpretation of the signal transduction mechanism and its regulation in α7 receptors.",

          "abstract": "The unsupervised and principled diagnosis of multiscale data is a fundamental obstacle in modern scientific problems from, for instance, weather and climate prediction, neurology, epidemiology, and turbulence. Multiscale data are characterized by a combination of processes acting along multiple dimensions simultaneously, spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, nonstationarity, and/or invariances such as translation and rotation. Existing methods are not well-suited to multiscale data, usually requiring supervised strategies such as human intervention, extensive tuning, or selection of ideal time periods. We present the multiresolution coherent spatio-temporal scale separation (mrCOSTS), a hierarchical and automated algorithm for the diagnosis of coherent patterns or modes in multiscale data. mrCOSTS is a variant of dynamic mode decomposition which decomposes data into bands of spatial patterns with shared time dynamics, thereby providing a robust method for analyzing multiscale data. It requires no training but instead takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of multiscale systems. We demonstrate mrCOSTS using complex multiscale datasets that are canonically difficult to analyze: 1) climate patterns of sea surface temperature, 2) electrophysiological observations of neural signals of the motor cortex, and 3) horizontal wind in the mountain boundary layer. With mrCOSTS, we trivially retrieve complex dynamics that were previously difficult to resolve while additionally extracting hitherto unknown patterns of activity embedded in the dynamics, allowing for advancing the understanding of these fields of study. This method is an important advancement for addressing the multiscale data which characterize many of the grand challenges in science and engineering.",

However, whether there is a regulatory and functional relationship between these snoRNAs and GAS5 is unknown. Here, we show that the expression of SNORD80, but not the other snoRNAs, parallels GAS5 expression and is regulated alongside GAS5 in response to cellular stress. The 2′-O-methylation at the A496 site, located within a segment of GAS5 complementing the conserved RNA-binding region on SNORD80, promotes GAS5 stability and consequent upregulation. This methylation requires SNORD80, as it is diminished by knockdown of SNORD80 and increased by SNORD80 overexpression, similar to the effects of manipulating the expression of fibrillarin, the methyltransferase of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle (snoRNP). The upregulation of SNORD80 in response to cellular stress is due to an enhancement in its stability, which is associated with an increase in its interaction with fibrillarin. Collectively, these results identify a role for SNORD80 in guiding 2′-O-methylation to stabilize GAS5. This uncovers a feedforward regulatory loop at the GAS5 gene locus in response to cellular stress and sheds light on posttranscriptional mechanisms governing lncRNA expression.",

In this study, we report the identification of a potent proactivator of SARM1, G10, which is converted into a direct activator (M1) by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. Cryoelectron microscopy structures of SARM1 bound to M1, as well as to M1 and a nonhydrolyzable NAD + analog (1AD), captured two intermediate activation states and the fully active state, revealing a stepwise mechanism of SARM1 activation. Further, introducing a disulfide bond to prevent conformational transitions between the two intermediate states mediated by M1 stabilized SARM1 in its inactive form and blocked M1-induced cell death. Together, these findings propose a sequential, stepwise activation model for SARM1 and offer a framework for developing potential SARM1 inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the two-domain capsid protein dimerizes, and this dimer connects individual chains in the mature capsid lattice. Previous NMR studies have shown that different dimer arrangements can be formed by isolated capsid protein chains and in assembled capsid lattices; however, the dynamics and functional relevance of these alternate dimers are unknown. To explore the conformational landscape of the CA-CTD dimer, we carried out atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using the weighted ensemble path sampling strategy, generating an ensemble of conformations. Focusing on the two dimer forms previously observed via solution NMR, we refined the conformational ensemble to highlight two metastable states using a Markov state model. Experimentally, we measured the interconversion rates between the two alternate dimers using 19 F NMR, and these rates showed good agreement with the interconversion rates derived from the simulations. After identifying the key interactions that distinguish the dimer states, the alternate dimer was further experimentally verified through disulfide crosslinking. Our results demonstrate the advantages of pairing weighted ensemble path sampling with 19 F NMR to gain atomistic insights into the hidden dimer state of the HIV-1 capsid protein.",

Such is the case for Trypanosoma cruzi , a parasite that causes Chagas disease, a severely neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America that is often fatal. Our knowledge of the identity of essential genes and their functions in T. cruzi has been severely constrained by historical challenges in very basic genetic manipulation and the absence of RNA interference machinery. Here, we describe the development and use of self-cleaving RNA sequences to conditionally regulate essential gene expression in T. cruzi . Using these tools, we identified essential roles for Polo-like and Aurora kinases in T. cruzi cell division, mirroring their functions in Trypanosoma brucei . Importantly, we demonstrate conditional knockdown of essential genes in intracellular amastigotes, the disease-causing stage of the parasite in its human host. This conditional knockdown system enables the efficient and scalable functional characterization of essential genes in T. cruzi and provides a framework for the development of conditional gene knockdown systems for other nonmodel organisms.",

In this study, we report two cell-based methods to produce Fc-GlcNAc antibody and Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies with improved effector functions. First, we expressed endoglycosidase S2 in Expi293F GnT1- cells to trim all N-glycans to Fc-GlcNAc antibody for in vitro transglycosylation to generate homogeneous antibodies with well-defined Fc glycan. Second, we engineered the glycosylation pathway of HEK293T cells through knock-out of undesired glycosyltransferases and knock-in of desired glycosyltransferases to produce Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies and evaluated their binding to Fc receptors, and we found that the Fc-SCT-enriched antibody is like or better than the homogeneous Fc-SCT antibody in binding to the Fc receptors associated with ADCC, ADCP, and ADVE.",

One adaptation strategy is to maintain distinct phenotypic subsets within the population and to modulate their relative abundances via gene regulation. Another strategy involves genetic mutations, which can be augmented by stress-response pathways. Here, we studied how a migrating bacterial population regulates its phenotypic distribution to traverse diverse environments. We generated isogenic Escherichia coli populations with varying distributions of swimming behaviors and observed their phenotype distributions during migration in liquid and porous environments. We found that the migrating populations became enriched with high-performing swimming phenotypes in each environment, allowing the populations to adapt without requiring mutations or gene regulation. This adaptation is dynamic and rapid, reversing in a few doubling times when migration ceases. By measuring the chemoreceptor abundance distributions during migration toward different attractants, we demonstrated that adaptation acts on multiple chemotaxis-related traits simultaneously. These measurements are consistent with a general mechanism in which adaptation results from a balance between cell growth generating diversity and collective migration eliminating underperforming phenotypes. Thus, collective migration enables cell populations with continuous, multidimensional phenotypes to flexibly and rapidly adapt their phenotypic composition to diverse environmental conditions.",

          "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation is causing the collapse of seed dispersal interactions and ecosystem functioning. When management and conservation strategies aim to sustain ecosystem functioning of fragmented forests, species’ traits and functional performance are critical in guiding decisions. However, to date, we lack a quantitative understanding of the role of frugivores’ body size and dispersal ability in ecosystem sustainability among fragmented forests. Focusing on avian frugivory and seed dispersal in a multi-island setting, we address the data gap by recording more than 20,000 frugivory events in an artificial insular fragmented landscape constructed in 1959 and nearby unfragmented forests on the mainland. We show that large-bodied and dispersal-limited frugivorous birds are largely confined to large islands and the unfragmented mainland, whereas on small islands, small-bodied and highly mobile birds predominantly engage in frugivory interactions. The plant–frugivore meta-network exhibits a distinct compartmentalization, driven by island area and bird mobility. Birds with smaller size and greater mobility have higher topological importance, and the presence of small-bodied birds significantly enhances meta-network robustness. These results suggest that among insular fragmented forests where frugivory interactions are degraded, small-bodied and highly mobile birds disproportionately contribute to meta-community cohesion and ecosystem functioning because of the lack of large-bodied and dispersal-limited birds. We thus advocate for the restoration of landscapes to facilitate seed dispersal and functional connectivity, ensuring the presence of large patches along with small patches as stepping-stones. Meanwhile, we recommend prioritizing conservation on small-bodied and highly mobile birds in fragmented landscapes, a subset of underappreciated species that yet play crucial roles in ecosystem functioning.",

Our method establishes a robust “spectrum-structure” relationship, enabling the recovery of three-dimensional structures across a wide variety of proteins. It demonstrates broad applicability in predicting dynamic structures along different protein folding trajectories, spanning timescales from microseconds to milliseconds.

However, the variability in peptide lengths and the diverse composition of proteasomes make their comprehensive identification and characterization particularly challenging.

Control of gene expression by GPCRs has been studied almost exclusively at the transcriptional level, neglecting an extensive amount of regulation that takes place translationally. Hence, little is known about the nature and mechanisms of gene-specific posttranscriptional regulation downstream of receptor activation. Here, we apply an unbiased multiomics approach to delineate an extensive translational regulatory program initiated by the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) and provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are orchestrated. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we identify nearly 120 gene targets of adrenergic receptor activity for which expression is exclusively regulated at the level of translation. We next show that all translational changes are induced selectively by endosomal β2-ARs and report that this proceeds through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Specifically, within the set of translational GPCR targets, we find significant enrichment of genes with 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, a gene class classically known to be translationally regulated by mTOR. We then demonstrate that endosomal β2-ARs are required for mTOR activation and subsequent mTOR-dependent TOP mRNA translation. This site-selective crosstalk between the pathways is observed in multiple cell models with native β2-ARs, across a range of endogenous and synthetic adrenergic agonists, and for other GPCRs with intracellular activity. Together, this comprehensive analysis of drug-induced translational regulation establishes a critical role for location-biased GPCR signaling in fine-tuning the cellular protein landscape.",

We previously reported that ACAs with acidic pH-sensitive binding to CTLA-4 exhibit higher antitumor activity with fewer irAE. We now test a panel of variants of Ipilimumab (Ipi), the first ACA cancer therapeutic, for tumoricidal efficacy and irAE. Surprisingly, not all pH-sensitive Ipi variants exhibited an enhanced therapeutic index. Ipi13, which retained binding to CTLA-4 at pH 6.0 but dissociated at lower pH, showed no enhancement. By contrast, Ipi25, which dissociates from CTLA-4 at pH 6.0, the pH of the early endosome (EE), showed greater tumor regression and less severe irAE. Confocal microscopy showed that Ipi13 maintained colocalization with CTLA-4 at the late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes resulting in lysosomal degradation of CTLA-4. Conversely, Ipi25 did not colocalize with CTLA-4 in LE or lysosomes after endocytosis but allowed both proteins to transfer to recycling endosomes. EE dissociation was also characteristic of variants of Tremelimumab (Treme), another clinical ACA, that showed better efficacy and fewer side effects.

Most land plants have evolved two N uptake pathways, a direct root pathway and a symbiotic pathway, via association with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, the interaction between the two pathways is ambiguous. Here, we report that OsNAR2.1–OsNRT2s, the nitrate (NO 3 − ) transporter complexes with crucial roles in direct NO 3 − uptake, are also recruited for symbiotic NO 3 − uptake. OsNAR2.1 and OsNRT2.1/2.2 are coregulated by NIN-like protein 3 (OsNLP3), a key regulator in NO 3 − signaling, and OsPHR2, a major regulator of phosphate starvation responses. More importantly, AM symbiosis induces expression of OsNAR2.1 – OsNRT2s, OsNLP3, and OsSPX4 , encoding an intracellular Pi sensor, in arbuscular-containing cells, but weakens their expression in the epidermis. OsNAR2.1 and OsNLP3 can activate both mycorrhizal NO 3 − uptake and mycorrhization efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate that OsNLP3 and OsPHR2 orchestrate the direct and mycorrhizal NO 3 − uptake pathways by regulating the NAR2.1–NRT2s complexes in rice.",

In order to ensure equitable health outcomes from their application, MHC binding prediction methods must work well across the vast landscape of MHC alleles observed across human populations. Here, we show that there are alarming disparities across individuals in different racial and ethnic groups in how much binding data are associated with their MHC alleles. We introduce a machine learning framework to assess the impact of this data imbalance for predicting binding for any given MHC allele, and apply it to develop a state-of-the-art MHC binding prediction model that additionally provides per-allele performance estimates. We demonstrate that our MHC binding model successfully mitigates much of the data disparities observed across racial groups. To address remaining inequities, we devise an algorithmic strategy for targeted data collection.

Intriguingly, despite the absence of a canonical Calmodulin binding motif, Ca 2+ -Calmodulin activated PSKH1 while, in contrast, the ER-resident Ca 2+ sensor of the Cab45, Reticulocalbin, Erc55, Calumenin (CREC) family, Reticulocalbin-3, suppressed PSKH1 catalytic activity. In addition to antagonistic regulation of the PSKH1 kinase domain by Ca 2+ sensing proteins, we identified UNC119B as a protein interactor that activates PSKH1 via direct engagement of the kinase domain. Our findings identify complementary allosteric mechanisms by which regulatory proteins tune PSKH1’s catalytic activity and raise the possibility that different Ca 2+ sensors may act more broadly to tune kinase activities by detecting and decoding extremes of intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations.",

          "abstract": "All glioblastoma (GBM) molecular subsets share the common trait of accelerated progression following necrosis, which cannot be adequately explained by cellular proliferation arising from accumulated genetic alterations. Counter to dogma that “cancer outgrows its blood supply,” we suggest that development of necrosis is not merely a consequence of aggressive neoplastic growth but could be a contributing force causing tumor microenvironment (TME) restructuring and biologic progression. Mechanisms related to necrotic contributions are poorly understood due to a lack of methods to study necrosis as a primary variable. To reveal spatiotemporal changes related to necrosis directly, we developed a mouse model and methodology designed to induce clinically relevant thrombotic vaso-occlusion within GBMs in an immunocompetent RCAS/tv-a mouse model to study TME restructuring by intravital microscopy and demonstrate its impact on glioma progression. Diffuse high-grade gliomas are generated by introducing RCAS-PDGFB-RFP and RCAS-Cre in a Nestin/tv-a; TP53 fl/fl PTEN fl/fl background mouse. We then photoactivate Rose Bengal in specific, targeted blood vessels within the glioma to induce thrombosis, hypoxia, and necrosis. Following induced necrosis, GBMs undergo rapid TME restructuring and radial expansion, with immunosuppressive bone marrow–derived, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and glioma stem cells (GSCs) increasing dramatically in the perinecrotic niche. Collectively, this model introduces necrosis as the primary variable and captures glioma TME and growth dynamics in a manner that will facilitate therapeutic development to antagonize these mechanisms of progression.",

Careful regulation of these molecules is critical to control apoptosis, pyroptosis, and inflammation. Here, we found a pivotal role of Raver1 as an essential regulator of Ripk1 pre-mRNA splicing, expression, and functionality and the subsequent caspase-8-dependent inflammatory cell death. We show that Raver1 influences mRNA diversity primarily by repressing alternative exon inclusion. Macrophages from Raver1 -deficient mice exhibit altered splicing of Ripk1 . As a result, Raver1 -deficient primary macrophages display diminished cell death and decreased interleukin-18 and interleukin-1ß production, when infected with Yersinia bacteria, or by restraining TGF-ß-activated kinase 1 or IKKβ in the presence of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor family members, or interferon-γ. These responses are accompanied by reduced activation of caspase-8, Gasdermin D and E, and caspase-1 in the absence of Raver1 . Consequently, Raver1 -deficient mice showed heightened susceptibility to Yersinia infection. Raver1 and RIPK1 also controlled the expression and function of the C-type lectin receptor Mincle. Our study underscores the critical regulatory role of Raver1 in modulating innate immune responses and highlights its significance in directing in vivo and in vitro inflammatory processes.",

          "abstract": "The often-distinctive pigment patterns of vertebrates are varied in form and function and depend on several types of pigment cells derived from embryonic neural crest or latent stem cells of neural crest origin. These cells and the patterns they produce have been useful for uncovering features of differentiation and morphogenesis that underlie adult phenotypes, and they offer opportunities to discover how patterns and the cell types themselves have diversified. In zebrafish, a body pattern of stripes arises by self-organizing interactions among three types of pigment cells. Yet these fish also exhibit white ornamentation on their fins that depends on the transdifferentiation of black melanophores to white cells, “melanoleucophores.” To identify mechanisms underlying this conversion we used ultrastructural, transcriptomic, mutational, and other approaches. We show that melanophore–melanoleucophore transition depends on regional BMP signals transduced through noncanonical receptors (Rgmb-Neo1a-Lrig2) as well as BMP-dependent signaling by Agouti genes, asip1 and asip2b . These signals lead to expression of transcription factor genes including foxd3 and runx3 that are necessary to induce loss of melanin, curtail new melanin production, and deploy a pathway for accumulating guanine crystals that, together, confer a white phenotype. These analyses uncover an important role for positional information in specifying ornamentation in zebrafish and show how tissue environmental cues and an altered gene regulatory program have allowed terminal addition of a distinct phenotype to a preexisting cell type.",

Both ceVP28 and its parental counterpart, VP28, share the same host cell binding partner Rab7, which is a host receptor for WSSV. Coadministration of recombinant ceVP28 protein and WSSV to penaeid shrimps reduced both viral copy numbers and mortality upon WSSV challenges. These findings uncovered a host defense mechanism by which a protein encoded by a viral circRNA modulates virus–receptor interactions, resulting in blocking of viral entry.",

Using mice lacking K ATP channel activity (e.g., Kir6.2 −/− mice), we explored how changes in glucose utilization affect cortical electroencephalography (EEG) activity and sleep/wake homeostasis. In the brain, Kir6.2 −/− mice shunt glucose toward glycolysis, reducing neurotransmitter biosynthesis and dampening cortical EEG activity. Kir6.2 −/− mice spent more time awake at the onset of the light period due to altered ISF lactate dynamics.

          "abstract": "Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) are electromotile and implicated in amplification of responses to sound that enhance sound sensitivity and frequency tuning. They send afferent information through glutamatergic synapses onto type II spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). These synapses are weaker than those from cochlear inner hair cells onto type I SGN, suggesting that type II SGNs respond only to intense sound levels. OHCs also receive efferent innervation from medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons. MOC neurons are cholinergic yet inhibit OHCs due to the functional coupling of alpha9/alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to calcium-activated SK potassium channels. The resulting hyperpolarization reduces OHC activity-evoked electromotility and is implicated in cochlear gain control, protection against acoustic trauma, and attention. MOC neurons also label for markers of GABA and GABA synthesis. GABA B autoreceptor (GABA B R) activation on MOC terminals has been demonstrated to reduce ACh release, confirming important negative feedback roles. However, the full complement of GABAergic activity in the cochlea is not currently understood, including mechanisms of GABA release from MOC axons, whether GABA diffuses from MOC axons to other postsynaptic cells, and the location and function of GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs). We used optical neurotransmitter detection, immunohistochemistry, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate that in addition to presynaptic GABA B autoreceptor activation, MOC efferent terminals release GABA onto type II SGN afferent dendrites with postsynaptic activity mediated by GABA A Rs. This synapse may have roles including developmental regulation of cochlear innervation, fine-tuning of OHC activity, or providing feedback to the brain about MOC and OHC activity.",

          "abstract": "Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus, pose significant public health threats globally. Extensive efforts have led to the development of promising highly active compounds against DENV targeting viral non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) protein. However, due to the cocirculation of flaviviruses and to prepare for emerging flaviviruses, there is a need for more broadly acting antivirals. Host-directed therapy where one targets a host factor required for viral replication may be active against multiple viruses that use similar replication strategies. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 library that we designed to target the druggable genome and identified signal peptide peptidase (SPP, encoded by Histocompatibility Minor 13, HM13), as a critical host factor in DENV infection. Genetic knockout or introducing mutations that disrupt the proteolytic activity of SPP markedly reduced the replication of multiple flaviviruses. Although their substrates differ, SPP has structural homology with γ-secretase, which has been pursued as a pharmacological target for Alzheimer’s disease. Notably, SPP-targeting compounds exhibited potent anti-DENV activity at low nanomolar concentrations across multiple primary and disease-relevant cell types, acting specifically through SPP inhibition rather than γ-secretase inhibition. Importantly, SPP inhibitors were active at low nanomolar concentrations against flaviviruses other than DENV including ZIKV while DENV NS4B inhibitors lost activity. This study emphasizes the strong potential of SPP as a pan-flaviviral target and provides a framework for identifying host druggable targets to screen for broad-spectrum antivirals.",

OPN3 was first identified in the brain (and named encephalopsin) and subsequently found to be expressed in other tissues. In adipocytes, OPN3 is necessary for light responses that modulate lipolysis and glucose uptake, while OPN3 in human skin melanocytes regulates pigmentation in a light-independent manner. Despite its initial discovery in the brain, OPN3 functional mechanisms in the brain remain elusive. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of OPN3 function in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. We show that Opn3 is coexpressed with the melanocortin 4 receptor ( Mc4r ) in a population of PVN neurons, where it negatively regulates MC4R-mediated cAMP signaling in a specific and Gα i/o -dependent manner. Under baseline conditions, OPN3 via Gα i/o potentiates the activity of the inward rectifying Kir7.1 channel, previously shown to be closed in response to agonist-mediated activation of MC4R in a Gα s -independent manner. In mice, we found that Opn3 in Mc4r -expressing neurons regulates food consumption. Our results reveal the first mechanistic insight into OPN3 function in the hypothalamus, uncovering a unique mechanism by which OPN3 functions to potentiate Kir7.1 activity and negatively regulate MC4R-mediated cAMP signaling, thereby promoting food intake.",

We employed a imaging method called spatiotemporal optical coherence tomography, which ensures high contrast and phase stability within the strongly scattering photoreceptor– Retinal Pigment Epithelium complex. Using this approach, we recorded nanometer-scale changes in human cones and rods in response to photopic flicker stimulation and observed length changes in rodent rods under scotopic conditions following a single pulse of light, in the absence or presence of sildenafil, which inhibits the catalytic activity of PDE6. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that during phototransduction conformational changes in PDE6 structure, which occur on an angstrom scale, are amplified to the nanometer scale due to the unique structure of the photoreceptor outer segments and sequential stimulation. This finding opens up possibilities for the informed use of photopic flicker optoretinography measurements as a diagnostic tool, as the observed nanometer-scale changes in rod and cone dimensions as a function of light stimulus can now be directly linked to molecular events involved in the phototransduction pathway.",

We previously reported that the functional and molecular profiles of layer 2/3 (L2/3) cell types in the primary visual cortex (V1) are vision-dependent [S. Cheng et al. , Cell 185 , 311–327.e24 (2022)]. Here, we characterize the spatial organization of L2/3 cell types with and without visual experience. Spatial transcriptomic profiling based on 500 genes recapitulates the zonation of L2/3 cell types along the pial–ventricular axis in V1. By applying multitasking theory, we suggest that the spatial zonation of L2/3 cell types is linked to the continuous nature of their gene expression profiles, which can be represented as a 2D manifold bounded by three archetypal cell types. By comparing normally reared and dark reared L2/3 cells, we show that visual deprivation-induced transcriptomic changes comprise two independent gene programs. The first, induced specifically in the visual cortex, includes immediate-early genes and genes associated with metabolic processes. It manifests as a change in cell state that is orthogonal to cell-type-specific gene expression programs. By contrast, the second program impacts L2/3 cell-type identity, regulating a subset of cell-type-specific genes and shifting the distribution of cells within the L2/3 cell-type manifold. Through an integrated analysis of spatial transcriptomics with single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we describe how vision patterns cortical L2/3 cell types during the critical period.",

          "abstract": "Crosstalk between cell death programs confers appropriate host anti-infection immune responses, but how pathogens co-opt host molecular switches of cell death pathways to reprogram cell death modalities for facilitating infection remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify mammalian cell entry 3C (Mce3C) as a pathogenic cell death regulator secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which causes tuberculosis featured with lung inflammation and necrosis. Mce3C binds host cathepsin B (CTSB), a noncaspase protease acting as a lysosome-derived molecular determinant of cell death modalities, to inhibit its protease activity toward BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID) and receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), thereby preventing the production of proapoptotic truncated BID (tBID) while maintaining the abundance of pronecroptotic RIPK1. Disrupting the Mce3C–CTSB interaction promotes host apoptosis while suppressing necroptosis with attenuated Mtb survival and mitigated lung immunopathology in mice. Thus, pathogens manipulate host lysosomal protease activity–dependent plasticity in cell death modalities to promote infection and pathogenicity.",

          "abstract": "Upon viral infection, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) detect viral RNA to initiate antiviral innate immune response, which is mediated by the mitochondrial adaptor protein VISA virus-induced signaling adaptor; also known as mitochondiral antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). The stability and activity of VISA are tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications, among which polyubiquitination plays important roles. Various E3 ubiquitin ligases, including atrophin interacting protein 4 (AIP4), mediate polyubiquitination of VISA and result in its degradation. However, how polyubiquitination of VISA is regulated remains unclear. Here, we uncovered a dual function for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key enzyme in cholesterol homeostasis and a well-known therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases, modulating host responses to RNA viruses both extracellularly and intracellularly. Secreted PCSK9 inhibited sendai virus (SeV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, while the intracellular PCSK9 potentiated RLRs-mediated interferons (IFNs) induction by stabilizing VISA on mitochondria. Viral infection induced the translocation of PCSK9 to mitochondria where it competed with AIP4 for VISA, thereby inhibiting its polyubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, overexpression of PCSK9 enhanced VISA-mediated innate immune response against RNA viral infection, whereas its deficiency had the opposite effects and resulted in more robust replication of the virus. Pcsk9 −/− mice produced lower levels of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines, rendering the increased sensitivity to VSV and influenza A virus infection. Altogether, our findings uncovered an important and unexpected role of PCSK9 in virus–host interaction and contribute to the understanding of the sophisticated mechanism governing the proper and efficient immune response to viral infection.",

          "abstract": "Developmental transitions require precise temporal and spatial control of gene expression. In plants, such regulation is critical for flower formation, which involves the progressive maturation of stem cell populations within shoot meristems to floral meristems, followed by rapid sequential differentiation into floral organs. Across plant taxa, these transitions are orchestrated by the F-box transcriptional cofactor gene UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS ( UFO ). The conserved and pleiotropic functions of UFO offer a useful framework for investigating how evolutionary processes have shaped the intricate cis- regulation of key developmental genes. By pinpointing a conserved promoter sequence in an accessible chromatin region of the tomato ortholog of UFO , we engineered in vivo a series of cis- regulatory alleles that caused both loss- and gain-of-function floral defects. These mutant phenotypes were linked to disruptions in predicted transcription factor binding sites for known transcriptional activators and repressors. Allelic combinations revealed dosage-dependent interactions between opposing alleles, influencing the penetrance and expressivity of gain-of-function phenotypes. These phenotypic differences support that robustness in tomato flower development requires precise temporal control of UFO expression dosage. Bridging our analysis to Arabidopsis , we found that although homologous sequences to the tomato regulatory region are dispersed within the UFO promoter, they maintain similar control over floral development. However, phenotypes from disrupting these sequences differ due to the differing expression patterns of UFO . Our study underscores the complex cis- regulatory control of dynamic developmental genes and demonstrates that critical short stretches of regulatory sequences that recruit both activating and repressing machinery are conserved to maintain developmental robustness.",

In vitro evolution and whole genome analysis in Plasmodium falciparum with the most potent member, NPDG-F (EC 50 of 550 nM in Dd2; 290 nM in 3D7), shows that parasite resistance to methyldeoxaphomins is strongly associated with mutations in PfActin1 (PF3D7_1246200), a critically essential ATPase needed for all stages of parasite development. Molecular docking study with available PfActin1 crystal structure shows NPDG-F occupies the same allosteric binding pocket as the known actin inhibitor cytochalasin D. The direct PfActin1 target engagement in the allosteric site was supported by cross-resistance studies, isobologram analysis with other PfActin1 inhibitors, and the structure–activity relationships for the methyldeoxaphomin family. When added to in vitro culture, NPDG-F induced morphological abnormalities in merozoite cellularization during schizogony in both the Plasmodium blood and liver stages.

          "abstract": "The ability of parasitic plants to withdraw nutrients from their hosts depends on the formation of an infective structure known as the haustorium. How parasites regulate their haustoria numbers is poorly understood, and here, we uncovered that existing haustoria in the facultative parasitic plants Phtheirospermum japonicum and Parentucellia viscosa suppressed the formation of new haustoria located on distant roots. Using Phtheirospermum, we found that this effect depended on the formation of mature haustoria and could be induced through the application of external nutrients. To understand the molecular basis of this root plasticity, we analyzed hormone response and found that existing infections upregulated cytokinin-responsive genes first at the haustoria and then more distantly in Phtheirospermum shoots. We observed that infections increased endogenous cytokinin levels in Phtheirospermum roots and shoots, and this increase appeared relevant since local treatments with exogenous cytokinins blocked the formation of both locally and distantly formed haustoria. In addition, local overexpression of a cytokinin-degrading enzyme in Phtheirospermum prevented this systemic interhaustoria repression and increased haustoria numbers locally. We propose that a long-distance signal produced by haustoria negatively regulates future haustoria, and in Phtheirospermum , such a signaling system is mediated by a local increase in cytokinin to regulate haustoria numbers and balance nutrient acquisition.",

          "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast carcinogenesis and drug resistance remain incompletely understood. Elevated expression of CCND1 is linked to enhanced invasiveness, poorer prognosis, and resistance to drug therapies in ER-positive breast cancer. In this study, we identify a highly expressed circular RNA (circRNA) derived from FOXK2 , called circFOXK2, which plays a key role in stabilizing CCND1 mRNA, thereby promoting cell cycle progression, cell growth, and endocrine therapy resistance in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, circFOXK2 binds directly to CCND1 mRNA via RNA–RNA pairing and recruits the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1/HuR, stabilizing the CCND1 mRNA and enhancing CCND1 protein levels. This results in activation of the CCND1–CDK4/6–p-RB–E2F signaling axis, driving the transcription of downstream E2F target genes and facilitating the G1/S transition during cell cycle progression. Notably, targeting circFOXK2 with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO-circFOXK2) suppresses ER-positive breast cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, combination therapy with ASO-circFOXK2 and tamoxifen exhibits synergistic effects and restores tamoxifen sensitivity in tamoxifen-resistant cells. Clinically, high circFOXK2 expression is positively correlated with CCND1 levels in both ER-positive breast cancer cell lines and patient tumor tissues. Overall, our findings reveal the critical role of circFOXK2 in stabilizing the oncogene CCND1 and promoting cancer progression, positioning circFOXK2 as a potential therapeutic target for ER-positive breast cancer in clinical settings.",

We show that this analysis allows determination of the structure of both mycobacterial ATP synthase and the supercomplex of respiratory complexes III and IV in their native membrane. The latter structure reveals that the enzyme malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo) physically associates with the respiratory supercomplex, an interaction that is lost on extraction of the proteins from the lipid bilayer. Mqo catalyzes an essential reaction in the Krebs cycle, and in vivo survival of mycobacterial pathogens is compromised when its activity is absent. We show with high-speed spectroscopy that the Mqo:supercomplex interaction enables rapid electron transfer from malate to the supercomplex. Further, the respiratory supercomplex is necessary for malate-driven, but not NADH-driven, electron transport chain activity and oxygen consumption. Together, these findings indicate a connection between the Krebs cycle and aerobic respiration that directs electrons along a single branch of the mycobacterial electron transport chain.",

          "abstract": "Generation of membrane curvature is fundamental to cellular function. Recent studies have established that the glycocalyx, a sugar-rich polymer layer at the cell surface, can generate membrane curvature. While there have been some theoretical efforts to understand the interplay between the glycocalyx and membrane bending, there remain open questions about how the properties of the glycocalyx affect membrane bending. For example, the relationship between membrane curvature and the density of glycosylated proteins on its surface remains unclear. In this work, we use polymer brush theory to develop a detailed biophysical model of the energetic interactions of the glycocalyx with the membrane. Using this model, we identify the conditions under which the glycocalyx can both generate and sense curvature. Our model predicts that the extent of membrane curvature generated depends on the grafting density of the glycocalyx and the backbone length of the polymers constituting the glycocalyx. Furthermore, when coupled with the intrinsic membrane properties such as spontaneous curvature and a line tension along the membrane, the curvature generation properties of the glycocalyx are enhanced. These predictions were tested experimentally by examining the propensity of glycosylated transmembrane proteins to drive the assembly of highly curved filopodial protrusions at the plasma membrane of adherent mammalian cells. Our model also predicts that the glycocalyx has curvature-sensing capabilities, in agreement with the results of our experiments. Thus, our study develops a quantitative framework for mapping the properties of the glycocalyx to the curvature generation capability of the membrane.",

          "abstract": "Natural selection often acts on multiple traits simultaneously. For example, the virus HIV-1 faces pressure to evade host immunity while also preserving replicative fitness. While past work has studied selection during HIV-1 evolution, as in other examples where selection acts on multiple traits, it is challenging to quantitatively separate different contributions to fitness. This task is made more difficult because a single mutation can affect both immune escape and replication. Here, we develop an evolutionary model that disentangles the effects of escaping CD8 + T cell–mediated immunity, which we model as a binary trait, from other contributions to fitness. After validation in simulations, we applied this model to study within-host HIV-1 evolution in a clinical dataset. We observed strong selection for immune escape, sometimes greatly exceeding past estimates, especially early in infection. Conservative estimates suggest that roughly half of HIV-1 fitness gains during the first months to years of infection can be attributed to T cell escape. Our approach is not limited to HIV-1 or viruses and could be adapted to study the evolution of quantitative traits in other contexts.",

These antimicrobial peptides kill off ecological competitors and allow S. mutans to dominate the microenvironment of dental plaques and form dental caries. One class of bacteriocins produced by S. mutans , the lantibiotic mutacins, are particularly effective at killing due to their broad spectrum of activity. Despite years of study, the regulatory mechanisms governing production of lantibiotic mutacins I, II, and III in S. mutans have never been elucidated. We identified a distinct class of quorum-sensing system, MutRS, that regulates mutacins and is widespread among the streptococci. We demonstrate that MutRS systems are activated by a short peptide pheromone (Mutacin Stimulating Peptide) and show that MutRS controls production of three separate lantibiotic mutacins in three different strains of S. mutans . Finally, we show that paralogous MutRS systems participate in inter- and intrastrain crosstalk, providing further evidence of the interplay between quorum-sensing systems in the oral streptococci.",

Herein, we report a strategy, coined self-assembled proteomimetic (SAP), to mimic such three-helix bundle architecture with a hybridization-enforced two-helix coiled coil that is obtained by templated native chemical ligation (T-NCL) of PNA–peptide conjugates. This SAP strategy stands out by its synthetic accessibility, reducing the length on the longest synthetic peptide to less than 30 amino acids which is readily attainable by standard SPPS methodologies. We show that the T-NCL dramatically accelerates the ligation, enabling this chemistry to proceed in a combinatorial fashion at low micromolar concentrations. We demonstrate that small combinatorial libraries of SAPs can be prepared in one operation and used directly in affinity selections against a target of interest with an LC–MS analysis of the fittest binders. Moreover, we show that the underlying design paradigm is functional for SAPs based on structurally distinct three-helix peptides aimed at different therapeutic targets, namely HER2 and spike’s RBD, reaching picomolar affinities. We further illustrate that the affinity of the SAP can be allosterically regulated using a toehold displacement of the hybridizing PNAs to disrupt the coiled coil stabilization. Finally, we show that an RBD-targeting SAP effectively inhibits viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with an IC 50 of 2.8 nM.",

How do such antagonistic interactions impact the growth and survival of competing strains, while being spatially advected by turbulent flows? By using numerical simulations of a continuum model, we study the dynamics of two antagonistic strains that are dispersed by incompressible turbulent flows in two spatial dimensions. A key parameter is the ratio of the fluid transport time to that of biological reproduction, which determines the winning organism that ultimately takes over the whole population from an initial heterogeneous state, a process known as fixation. By quantifying the probability and mean time for fixation along with the spatial structure of concentration fluctuations, we demonstrate how turbulence raises the threshold for biological nucleation and antagonism suppresses flow-induced mixing by depleting the population at interfaces. Our work highlights the unusual biological consequences of the interplay of turbulent fluid flows with antagonistic population dynamics, with potential implications for marine microbial ecology and origins of biological chirality.",

          "abstract": "Spacecraft using combustion engines require substantial amounts of oxygen for their propellant. The Moon could be a source of oxygen for rocket propellant, since the material composing the lunar surface can be processed to extract oxygen. However, little is known about overall energy requirements of the processes described in the literature for oxygen extraction from lunar regolith. This knowledge gap constrains the planning of lunar missions, since the scale of energy infrastructure required for oxygen production facilities is not well characterized. This study presents an energy consumption model for oxygen production via hydrogen reduction of the mineral ilmenite (FeTiO 3 ). We consider an end-to-end production chain starting from dry regolith as the feedstock. The production includes the following process steps: excavation, transportation, beneficiation, hydrogen reduction, water electrolysis, liquefaction, and zero boil-off storage. The model predicts the energy demand per kilogram oxygen produced based on adjustable parameters for each process step. As expected, the model indicates a strong dependence on feedstock composition. For regolith composed of 10 wt% ilmenite, the model predicts that a total of 24.3 (± 5.8) kWh is needed per kg of liquid oxygen produced. This study confirms that the hydrogen reduction and electrolysis steps have the highest energy requirements in the production chain. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the enrichment factor of the beneficiation process is the most critical parameter for optimizing energy utilization. Overall, this study provides a parameterized end-to-end model of energy consumption that can serve as a foundation for various production systems on the Moon.",

It comprises seven subunits: actin-related proteins (Arps) 2 and 3 and five scaffolding subunits (ArpC1-5). The complex adopts two major conformations: inactive, with the Arps interacting end-to-end, and active, with the Arps aligned side-by-side like subunits in the actin filament. Activation involves several cofactors, including ATP, WASP-family nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs), actin monomers, and the mother actin filament. NPFs bind to two sites, one on Arp2–ArpC1 and one on Arp3, delivering actin subunits at the barbed end of the Arps to initiate branch elongation. However, the mechanisms by which each NPF drives the equilibrium toward activation remain unclear. We present two cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Arp2/3 complex at 2.9-Å resolution: one with NPFs bound to Arp3 and ArpC1 but not Arp2 and another with NPFs bound to Arp3 and Arp2–ArpC1. The structures reveal that NPF binding to Arp2 is allosterically linked to the release of ArpC5’s N-terminal tail from Arp2 and conformational changes in Arp2, including closure of its ATP-binding cleft and partial rotation and translation toward its position in the active complex at the branch. Previous work identified another allosteric switch linking NPF binding to Arp3 with the release of its inhibitory C-terminal tail, which we also observe. In summary, both NPF-binding sites induce allosteric changes in Arp2/3 complex, collectively shifting the equilibrium toward activation.",

          "abstract": "Modern ecosystems display complex associations of plants–insects that underwent a long evolutionary process since the appearance of mid-Paleozoic vascular plants. Although several major hypotheses explain the evolution of these plant–insect associations, the initial pattern of modern insect herbivory is poorly understood. To understand the antiquity of modern patterns of terrestrial arthropod herbivory, functional feeding group–damage type (FFG-DT) data were used to analyze a 305 My interval from Late Pennsylvanian to present, in which 134 plant assemblages were used to assess turnover (replacement of some species by other species between sites) and nestedness (difference in composition when no species are replaced between sites) in pairwise comparisons of DTs. Results of beta diversity analyses indicate that the prototype pattern for modern insect herbivory was established on gymnosperm-dominated plant assemblages by late Middle Jurassic, antedating angiosperm dominance by 60 My. Turnover among plant groups and FFGs declined in earlier late Paleozoic, whereas during the later Cenozoic, nestedness generally increased. Insect feeding on gymnosperms showed one pattern of change with low turnover and high nestedness, whereas a bimodal pattern characterized angiosperms. Ferns and angiosperms exhibited less DT functional breadth (host-plant “specificity” by herbivores) than gymnosperms, reflecting major differences in links between insect herbivores and their host plants. This fundamental trophic shift is consistent with the Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution, implying top–down control of herbivores by their consumers rather than bottom–up regulation of food sources that shaped the modern herbivory pattern. These findings provide a data-rich account of the ecological origins of modern herbivory.",

Here, we investigated in adolescents the independent roles of the endogenous circadian system and of the behavioral sleep/wake cycle (sleep/wake, fasting/eating, rest/activity, dark/dim light, social interaction, posture, etc.) on self-selected caloric intake using a Forced Desynchrony protocol. Fifty-one male and female adolescents across three weight status categories (24 with healthy weight, 13 with overweight, and 14 with obesity) completed the protocol where participants lived on seven 28-h sleep/wake cycles in dim light during wake and complete darkness during sleep. Results suggest that the circadian system and the behavioral cycle each affected caloric intake, with a decrease across the wake episode and an increase from circadian morning to circadian evening in caloric intake. The endogenous circadian rhythm in caloric intake showed a circadian peak-to-trough difference of 196 [CI 95% 164, 226] kcal per meal with peak timing of 296° [288°, 304°; equivalent to ~17:30 in these participants]. In those with overweight/obesity, more calories were consumed later in the waking episode and later in the circadian cycle, and with blunted amplitudes compared to those with healthy weight. Results implicate both the endogenous circadian system and the behavioral cycle in shaping the daily rhythm of food intake. Furthermore, these results help explain the increased drive for caloric intake toward the evening, especially in those at risk for obesity.",

The beneficial material properties and bioactivity of mucus stem from glycoproteins called mucins, motivating the development of mucin-derived hydrogels for wound dressings and antifouling coatings.

Inspired by the chemical cross-linking and water-tolerant adhesion of marine mussel adhesive structures, we use catechol–thiol bonding to drive gelation of native mucin proteins and synthetic mucin-inspired polymers, forming soft, adhesive hydrogels that can be coated onto diverse surfaces. The gelation dynamics and adhesive properties can be systematically tuned by varying the hydrogel composition, polymer architecture, and thiol availability, with gelation timescales adjustable from seconds to hours, and values of elastic modulus, failure stress, and debonding work spanning orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the functionality of these gels in two applications: as tissue adhesives, using porcine skin as a proxy for human skin, and as bioactive surface coatings to prevent bacterial colonization. The results highlight the potential of catechol–thiol cross-linking as a versatile platform for engineering multifunctional glycoprotein hydrogels with applications in wound repair and antimicrobial surface engineering.",

          "abstract": "Poststroke inflammation critically influences functional outcomes following ischemic stroke. Arginase-1 (Arg1) is considered a marker for anti-inflammatory macrophages, associated with the resolution of inflammation and promotion of tissue repair in various pathological conditions. However, its specific role in poststroke recovery remains to be elucidated. This study investigates the functional impact of Arg1 expressed in macrophages on poststroke recovery and inflammatory milieu. We observed a time-dependent increase in Arg1 expression, peaking at 7 d after photothrombotic stroke in mice. Cellular mapping analysis revealed that Arg1 was predominantly expressed in LysM-positive infiltrating macrophages. Using a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model, we examined the role of Arg1 expressed in infiltrating macrophages. Contrary to its presumed beneficial effects, Arg1 cKO in LysM-positive macrophages significantly improved skilled forelimb motor function recovery after stroke. Mechanistically, Arg1 cKO attenuated fibrotic scar formation, enhanced peri-infarct remyelination, and increased synaptic density while reducing microglial synaptic elimination in the peri-infarct cortex. Gene expression analysis of fluorescence-activated single cell sorting (FACS)-sorted CD45 low microglia revealed decreased transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and proinflammatory cytokine activity in peri-infarct microglia from Arg1 cKO animals. In vitro coculture experiments demonstrated that Arg1 activity in macrophages modulates microglial synaptic phagocytosis, providing evidence for macrophage–microglia interaction. These findings present unique insights into the function of Arg1 in central nervous system injury and highlight an interaction between infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia in shaping the poststroke inflammatory milieu. Our study identifies Arg1 in macrophages as a potential therapeutic target for modulating poststroke inflammation and improving functional recovery.",

We propose a generic physical mechanism that allows tuning the location and steepness of the response threshold of cellular processes activated by multivalent binding. The mechanism is based on the possibility to modulate the attraction between membrane receptors. We use theory and simulations to show how tuning interreceptor attraction can enhance or suppress the binding of multivalent ligand-coated particles to surfaces. The changes in the interreceptor attraction less than the thermal energy k B T can selectively switch the receptor-clustering and activation on or off in an almost step-wise fashion, which we explain by near-critical receptor density fluctuations. We also show that the same mechanism can efficiently regulate the onset of endocytosis for, e.g. , drug delivery vehicles.",

          "abstract": "Modern machine learning has achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacrifices interpretability, a critical consideration in high-stakes domains such as medicine. In such settings, practitioners often use highly interpretable decision tree models, but these suffer from inductive bias against additive structure. To overcome this bias, we propose Fast Interpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (FIGS), which generalizes the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm to simultaneously grow a flexible number of trees in summation. By combining logical rules with addition, FIGS adapts to additive structure while remaining highly interpretable. Experiments on real-world datasets show FIGS achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. To demonstrate the usefulness of FIGS in high-stakes domains, we adapt FIGS to learn clinical decision instruments (CDIs), which are tools for guiding decision-making. Specifically, we introduce a variant of FIGS known as Group Probability-Weighted Tree Sums (G-FIGS) that accounts for heterogeneity in medical data. G-FIGS derives CDIs that reflect domain knowledge and enjoy improved specificity (by up to 20% over CART) without sacrificing sensitivity or interpretability. Theoretically, we prove that FIGS learns components of additive models, a property we refer to as disentanglement. Further, we show (under oracle conditions) that tree-sum models leverage disentanglement to generalize more efficiently than single tree models when fitted to additive regression functions. Finally, to avoid overfitting with an unconstrained number of splits, we develop Bagging-FIGS, an ensemble version of FIGS that borrows the variance reduction techniques of random forests. Bagging-FIGS performs competitively with random forests and XGBoost on real-world datasets.",

Parvoviruses are simple molecular structures that display 60 repeated motifs on their capsid surface, and rapidly induce strong antibody responses that protect animals from infection. We recently showed that following canine parvovirus infection of its natural host, the polyclonal response in the sera contained only two or three dominant antibodies that bound two epitopes on the capsid. Here, we characterize key antibodies present in that immune response, identifying their sequences, defining their binding properties on the capsid by cryoelectron microscopic (cryoEM) analysis, and testing their effects on viral infectivity. Two antibodies sharing the same heavy chain bound to the side of the capsid threefold spike (B-site), while another distinct antibody bound close to the threefold axis (A-site). The epitopes of these antibodies overlapped the binding site of the host receptor, the transferrin receptor type-1, but to varying degrees. The antibodies varied widely in their neutralization efficiencies as either immunoglobulins (IgGs) or monomeric antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), which was consistent with their ability to compete for the receptor. The monoclonal antibodies characterized here matched the structures from the cryoEM analysis of polyclonal sera, including those present in a different dog than the monoclonal source. This shows that after infection, a focused response to the viral antigen is produced that protects against infection.",

Traditional approaches primarily focus on microscopic strategies such as bandgap engineering, chemical potential adjustments, and entropy engineering. However, these methods face substantial limitations in practical applications due to challenging material property requirements. Additionally, the efficiencies achieved remain modest, constrained by the interdependent nature of electrical and thermal conductivities, which typically vary concurrently. Inspired by the thermoregulation mechanisms in biological organisms, we propose here a macroscopic strategy based on an expanded-plane (EP) meta-structure. Such a meta-structure, of the thermal gradient regulator type, exploits the temperature gradient concentrating effect to significantly boost TCE. We prove, both numerically and experimentally, how the proposed device can achieve temperature gradient concentration under diverse conditions. Remarkably, under undistorted temperature background conditions, we measured an striking efficiency enhancement of 59.0 % . This work highlights the EP thermal gradient regulator’s ability to boost thermoelectric efficiency, valuable across domains: aiding efficient chip cooling in microelectronics and powering wearable medical devices.",

Using Douglas Biber’s set of lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical features, we identify systematic differences between LLMs and humans and between different LLMs. These differences persist when moving from smaller models to larger ones and are larger for instruction-tuned models than base models. This observation of differences demonstrates that despite their advanced abilities, LLMs struggle to match human stylistic variation. Attention to more advanced linguistic features can hence detect patterns in their behavior not previously recognized.",

Although fluorine (F) is known for its strong electronegativity and potential to form robust hydrogen bonds with NH 4 + , its specific influence on NH 4 + storage remains unexplored. Herein, we systematically investigate the effects of F-based hydrogen bond chemistry within a layered double hydroxide matrix, where F species are introduced and subsequently partially removed via an electrochemical method. Our findings demonstrate that while increasing F doping content accelerates NH 4 + diffusion due to F’s strong electronegativity, it also triggers crystal shrinkage and depresses storage capacity. To this end, controlled partial removal of F, employing a lye-assistant electrochemical strategy, induces expanded interlayer spacing and distinct edge lattice tearing, thereby facilitating improved NH 4 + accommodation. The retained F sites couple with emerging exposed O sites maintain a high hydrogen bonding capability, which is further enhanced by the formation of highly active, curved hydroxyl groups centered around F sites. These manipulations significantly boost the NH 4 + storage performance of the electrode, providing insights into leveraging the strongest F-based hydrogen bond chemistry in developing high-performance ammonium-ion energy storage devices.",

          "abstract": "The collective influence of animals on the processes shaping the Earth’s surface remains largely unknown, with most studies limited to individual species and well-known exemplars. To establish the global geomorphic significance of animals, we systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence across freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Over 600 animal taxa had reported geomorphic effects. For the 495 wild animals and 5 livestock identified to species level, we estimated their global abundance, and collective biomass and energy. While our census is global in scope, a lack of research in the tropics and subtropics, and on less visible animals, leaves them underrepresented in analyses. Most reported species are globally widespread, but some are rare, endemic, and/or threatened, leading to risks that key geomorphic processes cease before we fully understand them. We estimate the collective biomass in wild animal geomorphic agents at ≈0.2 Mt Carbon, equating to a biological energy content of ≈7.6 million GJ. If a conservative minimum 1% of this energy contributes to geomorphic work annually, this yields an energy contribution from wild animal geomorphic agents of ≈76,000 GJ—equivalent to the energy of hundreds of thousands of extreme floods. Uncertainties in biomass estimates and energy partitioning mean this value could credibly be an order of magnitude higher, and countless species remain unreported or undiscovered. The livestock estimates exceed the wild animals estimates by three orders of magnitude. The geomorphic energy of animals is far more influential than previously recognized and future losses, dispersal and introductions of zoogeomorphic species may induce substantive landscape changes.",

We used birthdating analysis, single-cell RNA and spatial transcriptomics, and mathematical modeling to compare the development and evolution of known pallial circuits across birds (chick), lizards (gecko), and mammals (mouse). We reveal that neurons within these circuits’ stations are generated at varying developmental times and brain regions across species and found an early developmental divergence in the transcriptomic progression of glutamatergic neurons. Our research highlights developmental distinctions and functional similarities in the sensory circuit between birds and mammals, suggesting the convergence of high-order sensory processing across amniote lineages.",

We demonstrate that a wide-ranging carnivore—the northern elephant seal—can serve as an ecosystem sentinel for the twilight zone. We link ocean basin–scale foraging success with oceanographic indices to estimate twilight zone fish abundance five decades into the past, and into the future. We discovered that a small variation in maternal foraging success amplified into larger changes in offspring body mass and enormous variation in first-year survival and recruitment. Worsening oceanographic conditions could shift predator population trajectories from current growth to sharp declines. As ocean integrators, wide-ranging predators could reveal impacts of future anthropogenic change on open ocean ecosystems.",

Several studies have suggested that plasmons are overdamped, whereas other studies have detected propagating plasmons. In this work, we present direct nano-optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl 2 . HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl 2 . Photoemission data presented here reveal a highly anisotropic Fermi surface, reconstructed and made partly incoherent, likely through electronic interactions as explained by many-body theory. HPPs remain long-lived despite this, revealing previously unseen imprints of many-body effects on plasmonic collective modes.",

We demonstrate global RNAPII elevations in mouse gliomas and assorted human tumors in small clinical samples and discover regional elevations corresponding to de novo HER2 amplifications punctuated by likely selective sweeps. RNAPII occupancy at S-phase-dependent histone genes correlated with WHO grade in meningiomas, accurately predicted rapid recurrence, and corresponded to whole-arm chromosome losses. Elevated RNAPII at histone genes in meningiomas and diverse breast cancers is consistent with histone production being rate-limiting for S-phase progression and histone gene hypertranscription driving overproliferation and aneuploidy in cancer, with general implications for precision oncology.",

The density of grain boundaries and, consequently, the number of 8-MR pores can be tuned by regulating the grain size. Optimized MoS 2 membranes outperformed the state-of-the-art membranes in forward osmosis tests by demonstrating both ultrahigh water/sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance. Creating precise pore structures on atomically thin films through grain boundary engineering presents a promising route for producing membranes suitable for various applications.",

Although reward-driven processing of palatable foods can promote overeating, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the selective appetite for sugar in states of satiety remain unclear. Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are principal regulators of satiety because they decrease food intake through excitatory melanocortin neuropeptides. We discovered that POMC neurons not only promote satiety in fed conditions but concomitantly switch on sugar appetite, which drives overconsumption. POMC neuron projections to the paraventricular thalamus selectively inhibited postsynaptic neurons through mu-opioid receptor signaling. This opioid circuit was strongly activated during sugar consumption, which was most notable in satiety states. Correspondingly, inhibiting its activity diminished high-sugar diet intake in sated mice.",

Whereas excitatory neuron types in amniote hippocampal regions show evolutionary conservation, those in other pallial regions have diverged. Neurons in the avian mesopallium display gene expression profiles akin to the mammalian claustrum and deep cortical layers, while certain nidopallial cell types resemble neurons in the piriform cortex.

Unexpectedly, we found that knockout of the TF Klf2 resulted in aberrant differentiation to exhausted-like CD8 T cells during acute infection. KLF2 was required to suppress the exhaustion-promoting TF TOX and to enable the TF TBET to drive effector differentiation. KLF2 was also necessary to maintain a polyfunctional tumor-specific progenitor state. Thus, KLF2 provides effector CD8 T cell lineage fidelity and suppresses the exhaustion program.",

HARMONI operates at subsecond resolution, estimating 3D mesh representations and spatial interactions of humans, and adapts to challenging natural environments using an environment-targeted synthetic data generation module. Deployed on 500 hours from the SEEDLingS dataset, HARMONI generates detailed quantitative measurements of 3D human behavior previously unattainable through manual efforts or 2D methods. HARMONI identifies longitudinal trends in child-caregiver interaction, including child movement, body pose, dyadic touch, visibility, and conversational turns. The integrated visual and audio analysis further reveals multimodal trends, including associations between child conversational turns and movement. Open-sourced for large-scale analysis, HARMONI facilitates advancements in human development research. HARMONI achieves 63 to 80% consistency on key attributes with human annotators on SEEDLingS and 84 to 93% consistency on videos taken from a laboratory setting while achieving &gt;100 times savings in time.",

To investigate this, we used an advanced causal inference method to 16 diverse climatic regions in the Philippines. This method is capable of detecting nonlinear and joint effects of temperature and rainfall to dengue incidence. We found that temperature consistently increased dengue incidence throughout all the regions, while rainfall effects differed depending on the variation in dry season length, a factor previously overlooked. Specifically, our results showed that regions with low variation in dry season length experience a negative impact of rainfall on dengue incidence likely due to strong flushing effect on mosquito habitats, while regions with high variation in dry season length experience a positive impact, likely due to increased mosquito breeding sites. Our findings emphasize the need for tailored prevention strategies based on local climate conditions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.",

Recently, this concept has been realized in classical photonic and acoustic systems. However, these implementations are constrained by adiabatic conditions, necessitating long operation distances and hindering practical applications. Here, we conceive and demonstrate shortcut to adiabatic (STA) braiding of light in three-dimensional silicon photonic chips. Our device comprises trilayer silicon waveguides embedded in the SU-8 polymer, using an STA strategy to expedite the braiding operations, resulting in compact devices that function as photonic quantum X, Y, and Z gates. We further experimentally observed non-Abelian braiding behaviors based on this STA-braiding scheme. Our work represents a compact braiding apparatus with a size reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to previous works. This work presents a feasible approach to accelerating adiabatic braiding evolutions, paving the way for compact, CMOS-compatible non-Abelian photonic devices.",

We demonstrated efficient LEDs with controllably tailored emission from n = 3, 4, 5, and ≥7 ALN perovskite NPs with specific and discrete major peaks at 607, 638, 669, and 728 nanometers. These LEDs demonstrated peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.8% and high wavelength reproducibility with less than 1 to 2 nm difference between batches. High color stability without observable EL spectral change and operating stability with the best T 50 of 267 minutes at 1.0 milliampere per square centimeter was also achieved.

We implemented a stable external field for each Ising spin as an interaction between a DOPO pulse and a group of ferromagnetically coupled auxiliary pulses. Consequently, the CIM delivered independent sets for dense graphs with up to 40,000 nodes. We compared the performance of the CIM with that of optimized simulated annealing algorithm implemented on a digital computer and found that the CIM outperformed the central processing unit (CPU) in terms of the time needed to obtain good approximate solutions when the graph size exceeded several thousand nodes.",

          "abstract": "According to the “hard-steps” model, the origin of humanity required “successful passage through a number of intermediate steps” (so-called “hard steps”) that were intrinsically improbable in the time available for biological evolution on Earth. This model similarly predicts that technological life analogous to human life on Earth is “exceedingly rare” in the Universe. Here, we critically reevaluate core assumptions of the hard-steps model through the lens of historical geobiology. Specifically, we propose an alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary singularities required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth’s surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps required for human existence, then the timing of human origins was controlled by the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history.",

Aptamers have emerged as promising alternatives over traditional biorecognition elements. However, the underlying aptamer-target binding interactions are often poorly understood. Here, we present a technique that can decode aptamer-protein binding interactions at the single-molecule level. We demonstrate that our single-molecule assay is able to decode the underlying binding kinetics of aptamers despite their similar binding affinity. Guided by computational simulations and validated with quartz crystal microbalance experiments, we show that the quantitative insights generated by this single-molecule technique enabled the rational understanding of biosensor performance (i.e., the sensitivity and limit of detection). This capability was demonstrated with thrombin as the analyte and the structurally similar aptamers HD1, RE31, and NU172 as the biorecognition elements. This work decodes aptamer-protein interactions with high temporal resolution, paving the way for the rational design of aptamer-based biosensors.",

Nuclear actin coordinates chromatin motility during differentiation and genome maintenance, yet it remains unclear how nuclear actin responds to mechanical force. The DNA-damage kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) translocates to the nuclear envelope to protect the nucleus during cell motility or compression. Here, we show that ATR drives nuclear actin assembly via recruitment of Filamin-A to the inner nuclear membrane through binding of the hippo pathway scaffold and ATR substrate, RASSF1A. Moreover, we demonstrate how germline RASSF1 mutation disables nuclear mechanotransduction resulting in cerebral cortex thinning and associates with common psychological traits.

An association of pathological tissue remodeling with a biglycan fragment 344 YWEVQPATFR, termed Bgm1, has been reported, however its role is yet to be defined. Using a custom antibody, we detected Bgm1 in human and mouse nucleus pulposus, with prominent intracellular expression in notochordal cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that Bgm1 interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6), a key player in ribosome biogenesis. Bgm1 dysregulates eIF6 localization in notochordal cells, affecting nucleocytoplasmic transport. Induced IDD in mice showed elevated nuclear eIF6 expression and reduced Bgm1 in degenerating nucleus pulposus. Transcriptome analysis suggests that Bgm1 regulates fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis in a transforming growth factor–β–dependent manner, highlighting its potential role in metabolic control in spinal joint homeostasis.",

We leverage this insight to propose a precise definition of a gene regulatory relationship and implement a new tool, CIMLA (Counterfactual Inference by Machine Learning and Attribution Models), to identify differences in gene regulatory networks between biological conditions, a problem that has received great attention in recent years. Using extensive benchmarking on simulated data, we show that CIMLA is more robust to confounding variables and is more accurate than leading methods.

In this study, we developed a chimeric repairing patch (CRP) featuring a double-disc structure, designed to seal TF defects and promote organized tissue regeneration. The CRP incorporates a double–cross-linking silk fibroin network and hierarchical micropores, resulting in a flexible, hydrophilic, and biocompatible patch with tissue-matching mechanical properties. The CRP could effectively seal defects and encourage tissue ingrowth, successfully repairing TF. A tissue-engineered epithelialized CRP (E-CRP) was further developed to enhance in situ reepithelialization. The CRP demonstrated reliable structural stability and facilitated effective tissue regeneration and functional reconstruction of TF defects in a large animal model. Furthermore, the customized CRPs might be preloaded into a bronchoscope and precisely delivered to TF defects via noninvasive implantation. Consequently, the proposed CRP/E-CRP represents a promising scaffold for TF treatment, with substantial transformative potential in clinical practice.",

While they are used for their ability to increase serotonergic signaling in the brain, SSRIs are also known to have a broad range of effects beyond the brain, including immune and metabolic effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are protective in animal models and humans against several infections, including sepsis and COVID-19; however, the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Here, we mechanistically link two previously described effects of the SSRI fluoxetine in mediating protection against sepsis. We show that fluoxetine-mediated protection is independent of peripheral serotonin and instead increases levels of circulating interleukin-10 (IL-10). IL-10 is necessary for protection from sepsis-induced hypertriglyceridemia, preventing cardiac effects including impairment of glucose oxidation, ectopic lipid accumulation, ventricular stretch and possibly cardiac failure. Our work reveals a beneficial “off-target” effect of fluoxetine, and reveals a protective immunometabolic defense mechanism with therapeutic potential.",

Here, we identify various polariton states via electrical bias within a monolayer of n-type MoS 2 . The MoS 2 channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting. Further, we observe a peculiar nonlinearity at intermediate power regime.",

Previous studies have primarily focused on how receiving plants respond. However, little is known about how these receivers communicate back to the emitter plants and their subsequent impacts. Our findings indicated increased plant tolerance when neighboring plants were present, suggesting bidirectional plant communication. Furthermore, we established a model to explore the role of signals from receiver plants, identifying squalene as a crucial feedback signal enhancing the cold tolerance in emitter plants by up-regulating CsCBF5 expression. Further analysis using yeast one-hybrid analysis coupled with inhibition of brassinosteroid pathways suggested that squalene-induced castasterone (CS) accumulation directly activated CsCBF5 expression modulated by CsBES1/BZR1 . Overall, these results demonstrated the role of the squalene-CS- BES1/BZR1 - CBF5 pathway in the bidirectional communication between plants, expanding our understanding of plant interactions.",

          "abstract": "Cuproptosis, a distinct cell death pathway, has been integrated into nanomedicine for disease theranostics. However, current nanosystems inducing cuproptosis rely on exogenous toxic copper ions, limiting the scope of biomaterials. Developing nanoplatforms that induce cuproptosis without exogenous copper holds substantial promise. Here, we engineered a two-dimensional iron (Fe) single-atom–doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) piezocatalyst (Fe-MoS 2 ) for tumor therapy. Incorporating single Fe atoms enhances MoS 2 piezoelectric polarization via charge redistribution and modulates Fe and Mo oxidation states, enabling multifaceted enzymatic activities, including peroxidase-, glutathione oxidase–, oxidase-, and catalase-like activities. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the Fe-MoS 2 nanocatalyst generates reactive oxygen species and depletes glutathione via synergistic piezocatalytic and enzyocatalytic effects, disrupting copper ion homeostasis and inducing cuproptosis, concurrently triggering ferroptosis and ferritinophagy, which collectively enhances tumor suppression. This study represents the first paradigm to introduce a copper-free piezocatalyst for initiating cuproptosis, substantially advancing the applications of cuproptosis in tumor therapy.",

Here, we construct an Earth System Model that integrates these proposed cooling mechanisms in detail. The model can reproduce the broad geologic record of ice cap expansion, allowing us to infer the primary drivers of long-term climate change. Our results indicate that recent icehouse climates required a combination of different cooling mechanisms acting simultaneously and were not driven by a single known process, potentially explaining why icehouses have been rarer than greenhouses over Earth history.",

We found lasting cell type–specific changes that included autism risk genes and several transcription factors associated with neurodevelopment.

The EB disruption is accompanied by the alternations in permeability and even the breakdown of tight junctions (TJs), leading to the leakage of albumin; thus, albumin can serve as a biomarker for EB disruption. Herein, we develop an albumin-specific, covalently tagged near-infrared II (NIR-II) dye, with its high selectivity for endogenous albumin, for targeted imaging EB disruption. Our albumin-tagging dye serves as a chromophore to construct NIR-II fluorescent proteins in situ, with substantially improved brightness. Thus, through in situ dye tagging of endogenous albumin as the efficient “targeting agent,” we can precisely image disruptions in various endothelial barriers. Unlike the traditional exogenous targeting agents (e.g., dye-labeled antibodies) with enzymatic degradation or immune system capture issues, in situ albumin tagging demonstrates superhigh performance for targeted imaging.",

We used computational methods to identify 149 sites across the HIV-1 clade B genome under HLA-II–associated selection. Functional assays, including activation-induced intracellular cytokine staining and enzyme-linked immunospot for interferon-γ, revealed diverse mechanisms of HIV-1 adaptation to HLA-II–associated immune pressure, ranging from loss to sustained antigen recognition. T cell receptor and RNA sequencing demonstrated variable clonotype overlap of T cell clones to recognize adapted versus non-adapted peptides, with cells targeting adapted peptides exhibiting a dysfunctional transcriptomic state. Moreover, incorporating HLA-II–associated adaptation strengthened the correlation between Gag-specific viral adaptation and poor disease outcomes.

Despite extensive structural investigations, the molecular structure, and basis of polyspecific anionic drug recognition of human OAT1 (hOAT1) have remained elusive. Here, we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of hOAT1 and its complexes with the antiviral drug cidofovir and an FDA-approved type II diabetes medication glibenclamide, respectively. Our findings reveal that both cidofovir and glibenclamide bind to a central binding site, capturing the transporter in inward-facing conformations.

Only in situ imaging unveils the inaccessibility when compared to the industry-accepted ex situ characterization methods. Selectively removing some of the functionalization with solvent restores pore access without substantially altering the single-molecule kinetics that underlie the separation and agree with bulk chromatography measurements.

Mechanical force and auxiliary binding partners converge to stabilize the cadherin-catenin complex’s inherently weak binding to actin filaments (F-actin) through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that afadin’s coiled-coil (CC) domain and vinculin synergistically enhance the cadherin-catenin complex’s F-actin engagement. The cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of an E-cadherin–β-catenin–αE-catenin–vinculin–afadin-CC supra-complex bound to F-actin reveals that afadin-CC bridges adjacent αE-catenin actin-binding domains along the filament, stabilizing flexible αE-catenin segments implicated in mechanical regulation. These cooperative binding contacts promote the formation of supra-complex clusters along F-actin. Additionally, cryo-EM variability analysis links supra-complex binding along individual F-actin strands to nanoscale filament curvature, a deformation mode associated with cytoskeletal forces. Collectively, this work elucidates a mechanistic framework by which vinculin and afadin tune cadherin-catenin complex–cytoskeleton coupling to support AJ function across varying mechanical regimes.",

The mechanism underlying such ultrafast photocurrent hysteresis arises from anomalous linear and circular photovoltaic effects synchronously fueled by a localized rearrangement of polarization. By harnessing the anisotropic photoferroelectric kinetics–induced relative phase between the in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations, we further demonstrate the flexible selection of chirality, tunable rotational angle, and optimizable ellipticity of THz waves.

This tension is illustrated at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where two motor inputs that differ in structural and functional properties coinnervate most muscles to coordinate locomotion. To stabilize NMJ activity, motor neurons augment neurotransmitter release following diminished postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). How these distinct inputs contribute to PHP plasticity remains enigmatic. We have used a botulinum neurotoxin to selectively silence each input and resolve their roles in PHP, demonstrating that PHP is input specific: Chronic (genetic) PHP selectively targets the tonic MN-Ib, where active zone remodeling enhances Ca 2+ influx to promote increased glutamate release. In contrast, acute (pharmacological) PHP selectively increases vesicle pools to potentiate phasic MN-Is. Thus, distinct homeostatic modulations in active zone nanoarchitecture, vesicle pools, and Ca 2+ influx collaborate to enable input-specific PHP expression.",

We introduce a novel deformable body fracture mechanics approach and high-resolution strain field imaging to reveal that nonuniform stress distributions cause EA clutches to fail through delamination and crack propagation. Using this insight, we developed EA clutches sustaining 22 newtons over 1 square centimeter at 100 volts, achieving the highest stress per voltage among similar clutches. This was achieved by incorporating a soft interlayer and peeling stopper for uniform stress distribution and mitigating the failure modes.

A full biochemical reconstitution system using purified proteins systematically tests how and when coats are recruited to membranes to generate tubules. We demonstrate and measure how specific combinations of Retromer with SNX27, ESCPE-1 (SNX2/SNX6), or both complexes, remodel membranes containing physiological cargo and phospholipids. SNX27, alone and with Retromer, remodels membranes with PI(3)P and PDZbm cargo. ESCPE-1 deforms membranes with bis-phosphoinositides and CI-MPR cargo but surprisingly does not recruit Retromer. VARP co-immunoprecipitates all coat components in cells and is required to reconstitute a proposed endosomal “supercomplex” (SNX27, ESCPE-1, and Retromer) in vitro.

This mechanism involves regulation of microtubule dynamics by the microtubule-associated protein PLASMA MEMBRANE–ASSOCIATED CATION BINDING PROTEIN 1a (PagPCaP1a). Salinity stress induced PagPCaP1a expression and phase separation of PagPCaP1a protein to form PagPCaP1a condensates in a calcium-dependent manner. The formation of PagPCaP1a condensates was partially driven by the VEEEKK motif within the carboxyl terminus of the protein, which rapidly depolymerizes microtubules under salinity stress. Our study reveals that the liquid-liquid phase separation of PagPCaP1a represents an additional regulatory layer for microtubule depolymerization, and we propose an effective strategy to manipulate the phase separation of PagPCaP1a to improve plant stress tolerance.",

Lightning sensitivity to global temperature change (+1.6 ± 0.1% per kelvin) is mitigated by compensating atmospheric effects. Global burned area sensitivity to temperature (+13.8 ± 0.3% per kelvin) is largely driven by intensified fire weather and increased biomass but marginally by lightning changes. We find a universal law characterizing regional-scale modeled fire activity and its CO 2 sensitivity, consistent with basic principles of statistical mechanics. Last, a negative climate feedback through intensified aerosol direct effect from fire emissions reaches an equivalent decrease of 0.91 ± 0.01% in CO 2 radiative forcing.

Our approach facilitates rapid approximate solutions with a scalable circuit topology and expedites the high-precision refinement process by substantially reducing the digital-to-analog conversion overhead. We experimentally validated this methodology using a heterogeneous computing system. We performed simulations of multiple scientific problems on these circuits, including solving the diffusion equation and modeling equilibration in silicon P-N junctions. Notably, our memristive solver, combined with digital refinement, achieved software-equivalent precision (with an error of 10 −12 ). Compared to conventional digital processing units, this approach offered a 128-fold improvement in solution speed and a 160-fold reduction in energy consumption. This work establishes a foundation for future scientific computing using imprecise analog devices.",

          "abstract": "The loss of ecosystem carbon (the sum of vegetation, litter, and soil carbon) may occur in a permafrost region under mitigation pathways, which could reduce the efficiency of carbon dioxide removal. Here, we investigate changes in permafrost under net-zero and negative emissions, based on idealized emission-driven simulations using a state-of-the-art Earth system model. While acting as a net ecosystem carbon sink during most of the positive emission phase, permafrost becomes a net ecosystem carbon source just before reaching net-zero and negative emissions. Permafrost slowly recovers, especially in regions with high organic carbon content, and net ecosystem carbon loss persists until the end of simulations, resulting in a cumulative net ecosystem carbon loss of approximately 14 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in both scenarios. In addition, methane emissions increase under net-zero and negative emissions, due to the irreversibility of the inundated areas. We conclude that the permafrost ecosystem carbon loss may continue under net-zero and negative emissions, which could hinder climate change mitigation efforts.",

However, current flexible pyroelectric energy harvesters suffer from low output. Here, we present a nanocomposite of liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) and pyroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanoparticles and demonstrate a flexible heat harvesting device with high output. The overall pyroelectricity is enhanced by the secondary pyroelectricity generated from the thermal stress imposed on the LCE. Calculations and simulations corroborate with experiments, suggesting that the monodomain LCE/PZT with fixed boundaries offers the most enhancement. At a maximum heating rate of 0.20 kelvin per second, the fixed monodomain film (42.7 weight % PZT) shows an output current of 2.81 nanoamperes and a voltage of 6.23 volts, corresponding to a pyroelectric coefficient p of −4.01 nanocoulombs per square centimeter per kelvin, 49% higher than that of the widely used polyvinylidene fluoride.

Diabetes-associated immune cell dysfunction plays a minor role in the emergence of resistance, while hyperglycemia plays a dominant role facilitating the expansion and takeover of resistant mutants in diabetic infections. Furthermore, vancomycin intermediate resistant isolates display a pronounced fitness defect in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice. Together, these data suggest that the diabetic infection environment represents an ideal reservoir for the emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance.

Here, we explore somatic nonstop mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 Associated Protein 1 ( BAP1 ) and Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) enriched in renal cell carcinoma. For BAP1 , nonstop mutations generate an extremely long extension. Instead of proteasomal degradation, the extension decreases translation and depletes BAP1 messenger RNA from heavy polysomes. For VHL , the short extension leads to proteasomal degradation. Unexpectedly, the mutation alters the selection of the translational start site shifting VHL isoforms. We identify germline VHL nonstop mutations in patients leading to the early onset of severe disease manifestations. In summary, nonstop extension mutations inhibit the expression of renal tumor suppressor genes with pleiotropic effects on translation and protein stability.",

To this end, we leverage cell-cell “NETwork” of neutrophils to deliver SERCA activator-loaded SR-localized nanoparticles (L-P-NPs) to the damaged myocardial cells, following a hierarchical targeting process: (i) chemotactic neutrophils deliver L-P-NPs to ischemia-reperfused heart, achieving tissue level targeting; (ii) neutrophils produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to transport L-P-NPs to injured myocardial cell, achieving cellular level targeting; (iii) L-P-NPs escort therapeutic payloads to the SR, achieving subcellular targeting.

We found a bacilysin transmembrane transporter ( Tg MFS4) in Tg , critical during cross-kingdom dialogue with B v. Deleting Tgmfs4 (Δ Tgmfs4 ) mitigated Bv - Tg antagonism, reduced bacilysin import into Tg , and elevated its level in the coculture environment. This increase acted as a feedback regulator, limiting overproduction and enhancing Bv biomass. Δ Tgmfs4 coinoculation with Bv demonstrated enhanced FWD control relative to wild-type Tg ( Tg -WT). In addition, the Tg -WT+ Bv consortium up-regulated antimycotic secretion pathways, whereas the Δ Tgmfs4 + Bv consortium enriched the CAZyme (carbohydrate-active enzyme) family gene expression in the rhizosphere, potentiating plant immune responses.

We studied circadian clocks of blind cave spiders and their sighted relatives. In the field, cave spiders exhibit low per expression and maintain constant activity levels. Curiously, their clocks are not permanently lost; exposure to monochromatic blue light restores both circadian gene expression and behavioral rhythms. Conversely, blocking blue light in sighted relatives induces an arrhythmic “cave phenotype.” Our RNA interference experiments suggest that clock genes regulate the rhythmicity of the huddle response, establishing a link between circadian gene networks and this behavioral rhythm. We demonstrate that circadian regulation is readily toggled and may play a latent role, even in constant darkness. Overall, our study expands understanding of circadian clock variations and paves the way for future research on the maintenance of silent phenotypes.",

We show that in Arabidopsis mur1 mutant, CWI defects from compromising dimerization of RG-II pectin, a key component of cell wall, attenuate the expression of auxin response factors ARF7-ARF19 . As a result, polar auxin transport components are misexpressed, disrupting auxin response asymmetry, leading to defective apical hook development. Accordingly, mur1 hook defects are suppressed by enhancing ARF7 expression. In addition, expression of brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes is down-regulated in mur1 mutant, and supplementing brassinosteroid or enhancing brassinosteroid signaling suppresses mur1 hook defects. Intriguingly, brassinosteroid enhances RG-II dimerization, showing hormonal feedback to the cell wall. Our results thus reveal a previously unrecognized link between cell wall defects from reduced RG-II dimerization and growth regulation mediated via modulation of auxin-brassinosteroid pathways in early seedling development.",

Subsequently, existing protein fitness landscapes were used to benchmark novel ML methods in realistic protein design settings. We focused on the traditional problems of protein design: sampling and scoring. A major finding of our study is that ML approaches are better at purging the sampling space from deleterious mutations.

We found that expression of MAGE-A4 was highly associated with the loss of PTEN , a tumor suppressor, in human non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Here, we show that constitutive expression of human MAGE-A4 with Pten loss in mouse airway epithelia results in metastatic adenocarcinoma. Tumors showed distinct enrichment in IgA + CD138 + CXCR4 + plasma cells (PCs) and increased expression of CXCL12 in endothelial cells. Consistently, human NSCLC expressing MAGE-A4 showed increased CD138 + IgA + PCs surrounding tumors. Abrogation of PCs decreased tumor burden, increased activated T cell infiltration, and reduced CD163 + CD206 + macrophages in the MAGE-A4–induced lung tumors.

We show that bacterial cellulose (BC), but not other structurally similar matrixes, induces postwounding regeneration in nonmeristematic plant tissues via a distinctive route to callus-mediated regenerative programs. The BC-specific program involves cytokinin operating concurrently with strongly activated plant biotic response genes to induce plant regeneration. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, normally associated with defense responses, is sustained upon BC application, involving a network of tightly interconnected transcription factors, where WRKY8, known for regulating stress responses, shows a clustering and hierarchical prevalence. WRKY8 regulates BC-mediated plant regeneration and ROS homeostasis, including superoxide anion accumulation, to potentially promote cell proliferation after wounding. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the cytokinin- and ROS-associated defense responses can be targeted by BC application to promote plant wound regeneration through alternative regenerative programs.",

In this study, we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system plays a crucial role in capturing and facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated α-syn. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin was found to promote K27-linked polyubiquitination of α-syn, directing it to the endosome for subsequent degradation. We showed that the deletion of the Listerin gene exacerbates the neurodegenerative progression in a mouse model of PD, whereas the overexpression of Listerin effectively mitigates disease progression in PD mice.

To facilitate systematic studies, we here present a targeted approach to determine the impact of cancer-associated protease variants (TACAP). Starting with the semiautomated identification of potential specificity-modulating SNVs, our workflow comprises mass spectrometry–based cleavage specificity profiling and substrate identification, localization, and inhibitor studies, followed by functional analyses investigating cancer cell properties. To demonstrate the feasibility of TACAP, we analyzed the meprin β R238Q variant. This amino acid exchange R238Q leads to a loss of meprin β’s characteristic cleavage preference for acidic amino acids at P1′ position, accompanied with changes in substrate pool and inhibitor affinity compared to meprin β wild type.",

Fullerenes represent an extreme case for nanoplasmonics: They are subnanometer carbon-based molecules showing high-energy and ultrabroad plasmon resonances; however, the fundamental mechanisms driving the plasmonic response and the corresponding collective electron dynamics are still elusive. Here, we uncover the dominant role of electron correlations in the dynamics of the giant plasmon resonance (GPR) of the subnanometer system C 60 by using attosecond photoemission chronoscopy. We find a characteristic photoemission delay of up to about 300 attoseconds that is purely induced by coherent large-scale electron correlations in the plasmonic potential. These results provide insights into the nature of the plasmon resonances in subnanometer systems and open perspectives for advancing nanoplasmonic applications.",

          "abstract": "The gut microbiota enhances systemic immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to vaccines, but it is unknown whether this effect involves IgA, which coats intestinal microbes. That IgA may amplify postimmune IgG production is suggested by the impaired IgG response to pneumococcal vaccines in some IgA-deficient patients. Here, we found that antipneumococcal but not total IgG production was impaired in mice with IgA deficiency. The positive effect of gut IgA on antipneumococcal IgG responses started very early in life and could implicate gut bacteria, as these responses were attenuated in germ-free mice recolonized with gut microbes from IgA-deficient donors. IgA could exert this effect by constraining the systemic translocation of gut antigens, which was associated with chronic immune activation, including T cell overexpression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibitory receptor may attenuate antipneumococcal IgG production by causing B cell hyporesponsiveness, which improved upon anti–PD-1 treatment. Thus, gut IgA functionally interacts with systemic IgG to enhance antipneumococcal vaccine responses.",

          "abstract": "The influence of hydrogen on magnetization is of substantial interest to spintronics. Understanding and controlling this phenomenon at the atomic scale, in particular in nanoscale systems, is crucial. In this study, we used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with a nickelocene molecule to sense the spin of a hydrogen-loaded nanoscale Co island grown on Cu(111). Magnetic exchange maps obtained from the molecular tip revealed the presence of a hydrogen superstructure and a 90° rotation of the magnetization compared to the pristine island. Ab initio calculations corroborate these observations, indicating that hydrogen hybridization with Co atoms on the island surface drives the spin reorientation of the island. This reorientation is further reinforced by hydrogen penetration into the island that locates at the Co/Cu interface. However, the subsurface sensitivity of the magnetic exchange maps indicates that this effect is limited. Our study provides valuable microscopic insights into the chemical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.",

          "abstract": "Immune suppression poses a challenge to vaccine immunogenicity. We show that serum antibody neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron descendants was largely absent post-doses 1 and 2 in individuals with vasculitis treated with rituximab. Detectable and increasing neutralizing titers were observed post-doses 3 and 4, except for XBB. Rituximab in vasculitis exacerbates neutralization deficits over standard immunosuppressive therapy, although impairment resolves over time since dosing. We observed discordance between detectable IgG binding and neutralizing activity specifically in the context of rituximab use, with high proportions of individuals showing reasonable IgG titer but no neutralization. ADCC response was more frequently detectable compared to neutralization in the context of rituximab, indicating that a notable proportion of binding antibodies are non-neutralizing. Therefore, use of rituximab is associated with severe impairment in neutralization against Omicron descendants despite repeated vaccinations, with better preservation of non-neutralizing antibody activity.",

          "abstract": "Canalization is an optical phenomenon that enables unidirectional light propagation without predefined waveguiding designs. Recently demonstrated using phonon polaritons in twisted van der Waals (vdW) layers of α-MoO 3 , it offers unprecedented possibilities for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, practical applications have been hindered by the complex sample fabrication of twisted stacks. In this work, we introduce a previously unexplored canalization phenomenon in a single-thin vdW layer (α-MoO 3 ) interfaced with a substrate exhibiting a given negative permittivity. This enables a proof-of-concept application of polariton canalization: super-resolution nanoimaging (~λ 0 /220). Canalization-based imaging transcends conventional projection constraints, allowing the super-resolution images to be obtained at any desired location in the image plane. This versatility stems from the synergetic manipulation of three key parameters: incident frequency, rotation angle of the thin vdW layer, and thickness. Our results provide insights into the properties of canalization and constitute a seminal step toward multifaceted photonic applications, including imaging, data transmission, and ultracompact photonic integration.",

However, daily mechanical scratches compromise their functionality, underscoring urgent need for self-healing E-Skins resistant to mechanical damage. Current materials have slow recovery times, impeding reliable signal measurement. The inability to heal within 1 minute is a major barrier to commercialization. A composition achieving 80% recovery within 1 minute has not yet been reported. Here, we present a rapidly self-healing E-Skin tailored for real-time monitoring of physical and physiological bioinformation. The E-Skin recovers more than 80% of its functionality within 10 seconds after physical damage, without the need of external stimuli. It consistently maintains reliable biometric assessment, even in extreme environments such as underwater or at various temperatures. Demonstrating its potential for efficient health assessment, the E-Skin achieves an accuracy exceeding 95%, excelling in wearable muscle strength analytics and on-site AI-driven fatigue identification. This study accelerates the advancement of E-Skin through rapid self-healing capabilities.",

          "abstract": "Fungi engage in diverse symbiotic relationships with phototrophs. Lichens, symbiotic complexes involving fungi and either cyanobacteria, green algae, or both, have fungi forming the external layer and much of the interior. We found an erect thallus resembling a lichen yet with an unexpected thallus structure composed of interwoven cyanobacterial filaments with numerous fungal hyphae inserted within individual cyanobacterial sheaths, contrasting with typical lichen structure. Phylogenetics identified the fungus as a previously undescribed species, Serendipita cyanobacteriicola , closely related to endophytes, and the cyanobacterium belongs to the family Coleofasciculaceae, representing a genus and species not yet classified, Symbiothallus taiwanensis . These thalli exhibit nitrogen-fixing activity similar to mosses but lower than cyanolichens. Both symbiotic partners are distinct from known lichen-forming symbionts, uncovering a phylogenetically and morphologically unprecedented thallus-forming fungus-cyanobacterium symbiosis. We propose the name “phyllosymbia” for these thalli to underscore their unique symbiotic nature and leaf-like appearance. This finding marks a previously unknown instance of fungi solely residing within structures generated by cyanobacteria.",
