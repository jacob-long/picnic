          "abstract": "Animals must navigate changing environments to find food, shelter or mates. In mammals, grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex construct a neural spatial map of the external environment 1–5 . However, how grid cell firing patterns rapidly adapt to novel or changing environmental features on a timescale relevant to behaviour remains unknown. Here, by recording over 15,000 grid cells in mice navigating virtual environments, we tracked the real-time state of the grid cell network. This allowed us to observe and predict how altering environmental features influenced grid cell firing patterns on a nearly instantaneous timescale. We found evidence that visual landmarks provide inputs to fixed points in the grid cell network. This resulted in stable grid cell firing patterns in novel and altered environments after a single exposure. Fixed visual landmark inputs also influenced the grid cell network such that altering landmarks induced distortions in grid cell firing patterns. Such distortions could be predicted by a computational model with a fixed landmark to grid cell network architecture. Finally, a medial entorhinal cortex-dependent task revealed that although grid cell firing patterns are distorted by landmark changes, behaviour can adapt via a downstream region implementing behavioural timescale synaptic plasticity 6 . Overall, our findings reveal how the navigational system of the brain constructs spatial maps that balance rapidity and accuracy. Fixed connections between landmarks and grid cells enable the brain to quickly generate stable spatial maps, essential for navigation in novel or changing environments. Conversely, plasticity in regions downstream from grid cells allows the spatial maps of the brain to more accurately mirror the external spatial environment. More generally, these findings raise the possibility of a broader neural principle: by allocating fixed and plastic connectivity across different networks, the brain can solve problems requiring both rapidity and representational accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and has the highest rate of recurrence1. The predominant standard of care for advanced TNBC is systemic chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy; however, responses are typically short lived1,2. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments. Components of the PI3K pathway represent plausible therapeutic targets; more than 70% of TNBCs have alterations in PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN3,4,5,6. However, in contrast to hormone-receptor-positive tumours, it is still unclear whether or how triple-negative disease will respond to PI3K pathway inhibitors7. Here we describe a promising AKT-inhibitor-based therapeutic combination for TNBC. Specifically, we show that AKT inhibitors synergize with agents that suppress the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and promote robust tumour regression in multiple TNBC models in vivo. AKT and EZH2 inhibitors exert these effects by first cooperatively driving basal-like TNBC cells into a more differentiated, luminal-like state, which cannot be effectively induced by either agent alone. Once TNBCs are differentiated, these agents kill them by hijacking signals that normally drive mammary gland involution. Using a machine learning approach, we developed a classifier that can be used to predict sensitivity. Together, these findings identify a promising therapeutic strategy for this highly aggressive tumour type and illustrate how deregulated epigenetic enzymes can insulate tumours from oncogenic vulnerabilities. These studies also reveal how developmental tissue-specific cell death pathways may be co-opted for therapeutic benefit.",

          "abstract": "Behavioural time scale plasticity (BTSP) is non-Hebbian plasticity induced by integrating presynaptic and postsynaptic components separated by a behaviourally relevant time scale (seconds) 1 . BTSP in hippocampal CA1 neurons underlies place cell formation. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable synapse-specific plasticity on a behavioural time scale are unknown. Here we show that BTSP can be induced in a single dendritic spine using two-photon glutamate uncaging paired with postsynaptic current injection temporally separated by a behavioural time scale. Using an improved Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) sensor, we did not detect CaMKII activation during this BTSP induction. Instead, we observed dendritic, delayed and stochastic CaMKII activation (DDSC) associated with Ca 2+ influx and plateau potentials 10–100 s after BTSP induction. DDSC required both presynaptic and postsynaptic activity, which suggests that CaMKII can integrate these two signals. Also, optogenetically blocking CaMKII 15–30 s after the BTSP protocol inhibited synaptic potentiation, which indicated that DDSC is an essential mechanism of BTSP. IP 3 -dependent intracellular Ca 2+ release facilitated both DDSC and BTSP. Thus, our study suggests that non-synapse-specific CaMKII activation provides an instructive signal with an extensive time window over tens of seconds during BTSP.",

          "abstract": "Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are luminous bursts of soft X-rays from the nuclei of galaxies, repeating on timescales of hours to weeks 1–5 . The mechanism behind these rare systems is uncertain, but most theories involve accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing instabilities 6–8 or interacting with a stellar object in a close orbit 9–11 . It has been suggested that this disk could be created when the SMBH disrupts a passing star 8,11 , implying that many QPEs should be preceded by observable tidal disruption events (TDEs). Two known QPE sources show long-term decays in quiescent luminosity consistent with TDEs 4,12 and two observed TDEs have exhibited X-ray flares consistent with individual eruptions 13,14 . TDEs and QPEs also occur preferentially in similar galaxies 15 . However, no confirmed repeating QPEs have been associated with a spectroscopically confirmed TDE or an optical TDE observed at peak brightness. Here we report the detection of nine X-ray QPEs with a mean recurrence time of approximately 48 h from AT2019qiz, a nearby and extensively studied optically selected TDE 16 . We detect and model the X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission from the accretion disk and show that an orbiting body colliding with this disk provides a plausible explanation for the QPEs.",

          "abstract": "Olfaction is a fundamental sensory modality that guides animal and human behaviour 1,2 . However, the underlying neural processes of human olfaction are still poorly understood at the fundamental—that is, the single-neuron—level. Here we report recordings of single-neuron activity in the piriform cortex and medial temporal lobe in awake humans performing an odour rating and identification task. We identified odour-modulated neurons within the piriform cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In each of these regions, neuronal firing accurately encodes odour identity. Notably, repeated odour presentations reduce response firing rates, demonstrating central repetition suppression and habituation. Different medial temporal lobe regions have distinct roles in odour processing, with amygdala neurons encoding subjective odour valence, and hippocampal neurons predicting behavioural odour identification performance. Whereas piriform neurons preferably encode chemical odour identity, hippocampal activity reflects subjective odour perception. Critically, we identify that piriform cortex neurons reliably encode odour-related images, supporting a multimodal role of the human piriform cortex. We also observe marked cross-modal coding of both odours and images, especially in the amygdala and piriform cortex. Moreover, we identify neurons that respond to semantically coherent odour and image information, demonstrating conceptual coding schemes in olfaction. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between animal models and non-invasive human studies and advance our understanding of odour processing in the human brain by identifying neuronal odour-coding principles, regional functional differences and cross-modal integration.",

          "abstract": "The fabrication of scalable all-perovskite tandem solar cells is considered an attractive route to commercialize perovskite photovoltaic modules1. However, The certified efficiency of 1-cm2 scale all-perovskite tandem solar cells lags behind their small-area (~0.1 cm2) counterparts2,3. This performance deficit originates from inhomogeneity in wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at a large scale. The inhomogeneity is known to be introduced at the bottom interface and within the perovskite bulk itself4,5. Here we uncover another crucial source for the inhomogeneity – the top interface formed during the deposition of the electron transport layer (ETL, C60). Meanwhile, the poor ETL interface is also a significant limitation of device performance. We address this issue by introducing a mixture of 4-fluorophenethylamine (F-PEA) and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA) to create a tailored two-dimensional perovskite layer (TTDL), in which F-PEA forms a two-dimensional perovskite at the surface reducing contact losses and inhomogeneity, CF3-PA enhances charge extraction and transport. As a result, we demonstrate a high open-circuit voltage of 1.35 V and an efficiency of 20.5% in 1.77-eV WBG PSCs at a square centimeter scale. By stacking with a narrow-bandgap perovskite sub-cell, we report 1.05 cm2 all-perovskite tandem cells delivering 28.5% (certified 28.2%) efficiency, the highest among all reported so far. Our work showcases the importance of treating the top perovskite/ETL contact for upscaling perovskite solar cells.",

          "abstract": "The rate of river migration affects the stability of Arctic infrastructure and communities1,2 and regulates the fluxes of carbon3,4, nutrients5 and sediment6,7 to the oceans. However, predicting how the pace of river migration will change in a warming Arctic8 has so far been stymied by conflicting observations about whether permafrost9 primarily acts to slow10,11 or accelerate12,13 river migration. Here we develop new computational methods that enable the detection of riverbank erosion at length scales 5–10 times smaller than the pixel size in satellite imagery, an innovation that unlocks the ability to quantify erosion at the sub-monthly timescales when rivers undergo their largest variations in water temperature and flow. We use these high-frequency observations to constrain the extent to which erosion is limited by the thermal condition of melting the pore ice that cements bank sediment14, a requirement that will disappear when permafrost thaws, versus the mechanical condition of having sufficient flow to transport the sediment comprising the riverbanks, a condition experienced by all rivers15. Analysis of high-resolution data from the Koyukuk River, Alaska, shows that the presence of permafrost reduces erosion rates by 47%. Using our observations, we calibrate and validate a numerical model that can be applied to diverse Arctic rivers. The model predicts that full permafrost thaw may lead to a 30–100% increase in the migration rates of Arctic rivers.",

          "abstract": "Multivesicular bodies are key endosomal compartments implicated in cellular quality control through their degradation of membrane-bound cargo proteins 1–3 . The ATP-consuming ESCRT protein machinery mediates the capture and engulfment of membrane-bound cargo proteins through invagination and scission of multivesicular-body membranes to form intraluminal vesicles 4,5 . Here we report that the plant ESCRT component FREE1 6 forms liquid-like condensates that associate with membranes to drive intraluminal vesicle formation. We use a minimal physical model, reconstitution experiments and in silico simulations to identify the dynamics of this process and describe intermediate morphologies of nascent intraluminal vesicles. Furthermore, we find that condensate-wetting-induced line tension forces and membrane asymmetries are sufficient to mediate scission of the membrane neck without the ESCRT protein machinery or ATP consumption. Genetic manipulation of the ESCRT pathway in several eukaryotes provides additional evidence for condensate-mediated membrane scission in vivo. We find that the interplay between condensate and machinery-mediated scission mechanisms is indispensable for osmotic stress tolerance in plants. We propose that condensate-mediated scission represents a previously undescribed scission mechanism that depends on the physicomolecular properties of the condensate and is involved in a range of trafficking processes. More generally, FREE1 condensate-mediated membrane scission in multivesicular-body biogenesis highlights the fundamental role of wetting in intracellular dynamics and organization.",

          "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have undergone a rapid development in the last decade. However, there is still a lack of systematic studies to investigate whether the empirical rules of working lifetime assessment used in silicon solar cells can be applied to pero-SCs. It is commonly believed that pero-SCs show enhanced stability under day/night cycling due to the reported self-healing effect in the dark.1,2 While we discovered that the degradation of highly efficient FAPbI3 pero-SCs is in fact much faster under natural day/night cycling mode, questioning the widely accepted approach to estimate the operational lifetime of pero-SCs based on continuous mode testing. We reveal the key factor to be the lattice strain caused by thermal expansion/shrinking of the perovskite during the operation, an effect that gradually relaxes under the continuous-illumination mode but cycles synchronously under the cycling mode.3,4 The periodic lattice strain under the cycling mode results in deep trap accumulation and chemical degradation during operation, decreasing the ion migration potential and hence the device lifetime.5 We introduce phenylselenenyl chloride (Ph-Se-Cl) to regulate the perovskite lattice strain during day/night cycling, which achieved the certified efficiency of 26.3% and a 10-time improved T80 lifetime under the cycling mode after the modification.",

          "abstract": "Undesired coupling to the surrounding environment destroys long-range correlations in quantum processors and hinders coherent evolution in the nominally available computational space. This noise is an outstanding challenge when leveraging the computation power of near-term quantum processors1. It has been shown that benchmarking random circuit sampling with cross-entropy benchmarking can provide an estimate of the effective size of the Hilbert space coherently available2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Nevertheless, quantum algorithms’ outputs can be trivialized by noise, making them susceptible to classical computation spoofing. Here, by implementing an algorithm for random circuit sampling, we demonstrate experimentally that two phase transitions are observable with cross-entropy benchmarking, which we explain theoretically with a statistical model. The first is a dynamical transition as a function of the number of cycles and is the continuation of the anti-concentration point in the noiseless case. The second is a quantum phase transition controlled by the error per cycle; to identify it analytically and experimentally, we create a weak-link model, which allows us to vary the strength of the noise versus coherent evolution. Furthermore, by presenting a random circuit sampling experiment in the weak-noise phase with 67 qubits at 32 cycles, we demonstrate that the computational cost of our experiment is beyond the capabilities of existing classical supercomputers. Our experimental and theoretical work establishes the existence of transitions to a stable, computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum processors.",

Yet attaining the best sensitivity allowed by quantum theory in the presence of noise is an outstanding challenge, requiring optimal probe-state generation and read-out strategies3,4,5,6,7. Neutral-atom optical clocks8, which are the leading systems for measuring time, have shown recent progress in terms of entanglement generation9,10,11 but at present lack the control capabilities for realizing such schemes.

Our demonstration in a tweezer clock platform9,12,13,14,15,16 enables a circuit-based approach to quantum metrology with neutral-atom optical clocks. To this end, we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates with 99.62(3)% fidelity—averaged over symmetric input states—through Rydberg interactions15,17,18 and dynamical connectivity19 for optical clock qubits, which we combine with local addressing16 to implement universally programmable quantum circuits. Using this approach, we generate a near-optimal entangled probe state1,4, a cascade of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states of different sizes, and perform a dual-quadrature5 Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger read-out. We also show repeated fast phase detection with non-destructive conditional reset of clock qubits and minimal dead time between repetitions by implementing ancilla-based quantum logic spectroscopy20 for neutral atoms. Finally, we extend this to multi-qubit parity checks and measurement-based, heralded, Bell-state preparation21,22,23,24. Our work lays the foundation for hybrid processor–clock devices with neutral atoms and more generally points to a future of practical applications for quantum processors linked with quantum sensors25.",

          "abstract": "Caloric restriction extends healthy lifespan in multiple species1. Intermittent fasting, an alternative form of dietary restriction, is potentially more sustainable in humans, but its effectiveness remains largely unexplored2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Identifying the most efficacious forms of dietary restriction is key for developing interventions to improve human health and longevity9. Here we performed an extensive assessment of graded levels of caloric restriction (20% and 40%) and intermittent fasting (1 and 2 days fasting per week) on the health and survival of 960 genetically diverse female mice. We show that caloric restriction and intermittent fasting both resulted in lifespan extension in proportion to the degree of restriction. Lifespan was heritable and genetics had a larger influence on lifespan than dietary restriction. The strongest trait associations with lifespan included retention of body weight through periods of handling—an indicator of stress resilience, high lymphocyte proportion, low red blood cell distribution width and high adiposity in late life. Health effects differed between interventions and exhibited inconsistent relationships with lifespan extension. 40% caloric restriction had the strongest lifespan extension effect but led to a loss of lean mass and changes in the immune repertoire that could confer susceptibility to infections. Intermittent fasting did not extend the lifespan of mice with high pre-intervention body weight, and two-day intermittent fasting was associated with disruption of erythroid cell populations. Metabolic responses to dietary restriction, including reduced adiposity and lower fasting glucose, were not associated with increased lifespan, suggesting that dietary restriction does more than just counteract the negative effects of obesity. Our findings indicate that improving health and extending lifespan are not synonymous and raise questions about which end points are the most relevant for evaluating aging interventions in preclinical models and clinical trials.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, perovskite has been widely adopted in series-connected monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs) to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction solar cells. Perovskite/organic TSCs, comprising a wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cell (pero-SC) as the front cell and a narrow-bandgap organic solar cell (OSC) as the rear cell, have recently drawn attention owing to the good stability and potential high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1,2,3,4. However, WBG pero-SCs usually exhibit higher voltage losses than regular pero-SCs, which limits the performance of TSCs5,6. One of the major obstacles comes from interfacial recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface, and it is important to develop effective surface passivation strategies to pursue higher PCE of perovskite/organic TSCs7. Here we exploit a new surface passivator cyclohexane 1,4-diammonium diiodide (CyDAI2), which naturally contains two isomeric structures with ammonium groups on the same or opposite sides of the hexane ring (denoted as cis-CyDAI2 and trans-CyDAI2, respectively), and the two isomers demonstrate completely different surface interaction behaviors. The cis-CyDAI2 passivation treatment reduces the Quasi–Fermi level splitting (QFLS)–open circuit voltage (Voc) mismatch of the WBG pero-SCs with a bandgap of 1.88 eV and enhanced its Voc to 1.36 V. Combining the cis-CyDAI2 treated perovskite and the organic active layer with a narrow-bandgap of 1.24 eV, the constructed monolithic perovskite/organic TSC demonstrates a PCE of 26.4% (certified as 25.7%).",

This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that temporarily exceed a targeted global warming limit before drawing temperatures back down to safer levels a priority for science and policy 2–5 . Here we show that global and regional climate change and associated risks after an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it. We find that achieving declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes. However, the possibility that global warming could be reversed many decades into the future might be of limited relevance for adaptation planning today. Temperature reversal could be undercut by strong Earth-system feedbacks resulting in high near-term and continuous long-term warming 6,7 . To hedge and protect against high-risk outcomes, we identify the geophysical need for a preventive carbon dioxide removal capacity of several hundred gigatonnes. Yet, technical, economic and sustainability considerations may limit the realization of carbon dioxide removal deployment at such scales 8,9 . Therefore, we cannot be confident that temperature decline after overshoot is achievable within the timescales expected today. Only rapid near-term emission reductions are effective in reducing climate risks.",

          "abstract": "The interplay between translation and mRNA decay is widespread in human cells 1–3 . In quality-control pathways, exonucleolytic degradation of mRNA associated with translating ribosomes is mediated largely by the cytoplasmic exosome 4–9 , which includes the exoribonuclease complex EXO10 and the helicase complex SKI238 (refs. 10–16 ). The helicase can extract mRNA from the ribosome and is expected to transfer it to the exoribonuclease core through a bridging factor, HBS1L3 (also known as SKI7), but the mechanisms of this molecular handover remain unclear 7,17,18 . Here we reveal how human EXO10 is recruited by HBS1L3 (SKI7) to an active ribosome-bound SKI238 complex. We show that rather than a sequential handover, a direct physical coupling mechanism takes place, which culminates in the formation of a cytoplasmic exosome–ribosome supercomplex. Capturing the structure during active decay reveals a continuous path in which an RNA substrate threads from the 80S ribosome through the SKI2 helicase into the exoribonuclease active site of the cytoplasmic exosome complex. The SKI3 subunit of the complex directly binds to HBS1L3 (SKI7) and also engages a surface of the 40S subunit, establishing a recognition platform in collided disomes. Exosome and ribosome thus work together as a single structural and functional unit in co-translational mRNA decay, coordinating their activities in a transient supercomplex.",

          "abstract": "For patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with CTLA4 inhibitors and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (hereafter, PD-(L)1 inhibitors) is associated with higher rates of anti-tumour activity and immune-related toxicities, when compared with treatment with PD-(L)1 inhibitors alone. However, there are currently no validated biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit from dual ICB1,2. Here we show that patients with NSCLC who have mutations in the STK11 and/or KEAP1 tumour suppressor genes derived clinical benefit from dual ICB with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab and the CTLA4 inhibitor tremelimumab, but not from durvalumab alone, when added to chemotherapy in the randomized phase III POSEIDON trial3. Unbiased genetic screens identified loss of both of these tumour suppressor genes as independent drivers of resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition, and showed that loss of Keap1 was the strongest genomic predictor of dual ICB efficacy—a finding that was confirmed in several mouse models of Kras-driven NSCLC. In both mouse models and patients, KEAP1 and STK11 alterations were associated with an adverse tumour microenvironment, which was characterized by a preponderance of suppressive myeloid cells and the depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but relative sparing of CD4+ effector subsets. Dual ICB potently engaged CD4+ effector cells and reprogrammed the tumour myeloid cell compartment towards inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-expressing tumoricidal phenotypes that—together with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells—contributed to anti-tumour efficacy. These data support the use of chemo-immunotherapy with dual ICB to mitigate resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition in patients with NSCLC who have STK11 and/or KEAP1 alterations.",

          "abstract": "Ferroelectric structures have spontaneous macroscopic polarization that can be inverted using external electric fields and have potential applications including information storage, energy transduction, ultralow-power nanoelectronics1,2 and biomedical devices3. These functions would benefit from nanoscale control of ferroelectric structure, the ability to switch polarization with lower applied fields (low coercive field) and biocompatibility. Soft ferroelectrics based on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)4,5,6 have a thermodynamically unstable ferroelectric phase in the homopolymer, complex semi-crystalline structures, and high coercive fields. Here we report on ferroelectric materials formed by water-soluble molecules containing only six VDF repeating units covalently conjugated to a tetrapeptide, with the propensity to assemble into the β-sheet structures that are ubiquitous in proteins. This led to the discovery of ribbon-shaped ferroelectric supramolecular assemblies that are thermodynamically stable with their long axes parallel to both the preferred hydrogen-bonding direction of β-sheets and the bistable polar axes of VDF hexamers. Relative to a commonly used ferroelectric copolymer, the biomolecular assemblies exhibit a coercive field that is two orders of magnitude lower, as the result of supramolecular dynamics, and a similar level of remnant polarization, despite having a peptide content of 49 wt%. Furthermore, the Curie temperature of the assemblies is about 40 °C higher than that of a copolymer containing a similar amount of VDF. This supramolecular system was created using a biologically inspired strategy that is attractive in terms of sustainability and that could lead to new functions for soft ferroelectrics.",

In the first few million years of a cluster’s life, massive stars are dynamically ejected and run away from the cluster at high speed2. However, the production rate of dynamically ejected runaways is poorly constrained. Here we report on a sample of 55 massive runaway stars ejected from the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. An astrometric analysis of Gaia data3,4,5 reveals two channels of dynamically ejected runaways. The first channel ejects massive stars in all directions and is consistent with dynamical interactions during and after the birth of R136. The second channel launches stars in a preferred direction and may be related to a cluster interaction. We found that 23–33% of the most luminous stars initially born in R136 are runaways. Model predictions2,6,7 have significantly underestimated the dynamical escape fraction of massive stars. Consequently, their role in shaping and heating the interstellar and galactic media and their role in driving galactic outflows are far more important than previously thought8,9.",

We further identified in the leading region a prevalence of promoters known to allow expression from single-stranded DNA 6 , potentially facilitating rapid protection against bacterial immunity during the early stages of plasmid establishment. We demonstrated experimentally the importance of anti-defence gene localization in the leading region for efficient conjugation.

Here we leveraged the rapid coevolution of female pheromone production and male pheromone perception in Drosophila1,2 to gain insight into how the architecture of mate recognition circuits facilitates their diversification. While in some Drosophila species females produce unique pheromones that act to arouse their conspecific males, the pheromones of most species are sexually monomorphic such that females possess no distinguishing chemosensory signatures that males can use for mate recognition3. We show that Drosophila yakuba males evolved the ability to use a sexually monomorphic pheromone, 7-tricosene, as an excitatory cue to promote courtship. By comparing key nodes in the pheromone circuits across multiple Drosophila species, we reveal that this sensory innovation arises from coordinated peripheral and central circuit adaptations: a distinct subpopulation of sensory neurons has acquired sensitivity to 7-tricosene and, in turn, selectively signals to a distinct subset of P1 neurons in the central brain to trigger courtship. Such a modular circuit organization, in which different sensory inputs can independently couple to parallel courtship control nodes, may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing novel sensory modalities to become linked to male arousal. Together, our findings suggest how peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly coordinated to underlie the rapid evolution of mate recognition strategies across species.",

          "abstract": "Advanced urothelial cancer is a frequently lethal disease characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity1. In this study, we investigated the evolution of genomic signatures caused by endogenous and external mutagenic processes and their interplay with complex structural variants (SVs). We superimposed mutational signatures and phylogenetic analyses of matched serial tumours from patients with urothelial cancer to define the evolutionary dynamics of these processes. We show that APOBEC3-induced mutations are clonal and early, whereas chemotherapy induces mutational bursts of hundreds of late subclonal mutations. Using a genome graph computational tool2, we observed frequent high copy-number circular amplicons characteristic of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)-forming SVs. We characterized the distinct temporal patterns of APOBEC3-induced and chemotherapy-induced mutations within ecDNA-forming SVs, gaining new insights into the timing of these mutagenic processes relative to ecDNA biogenesis. We discovered that most CCND1 amplifications in urothelial cancer arise within circular ecDNA-forming SVs. ecDNA-forming SVs persisted and increased in complexity, incorporating additional DNA segments and contributing to the evolution of treatment resistance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read whole-genome sequencing followed by de novo assembly mapped out CCND1 ecDNA structure. Experimental modelling of CCND1 ecDNA confirmed its role as a driver of treatment resistance. Our findings define fundamental mechanisms that drive urothelial cancer evolution and have important therapeutic implications.",

          "abstract": "The movement of large amounts of nutrients by migrating animals has ecological benefits for recipient food webs1,2 that may be offset by co-transported contaminants3,4. Salmon spawning migrations are archetypal of this process, carrying marine-derived materials to inland ecosystems where they stimulate local productivity but also enhance contaminant exposure5,6,7. Pacific salmon abundance and biomass are higher now than in the last century, reflecting substantial shifts in community structure8 that probably altered nutrient versus contaminant delivery. Here we combined nutrient and contaminant concentrations with 40 years of annual Pacific salmon returns to quantify how changes in community structure influenced marine to freshwater inputs to western North America. Salmon transported tonnes of nutrients and kilograms of contaminants to freshwaters annually. Higher salmon returns (1976–2015) increased salmon-derived nutrient and contaminant inputs by 30% and 20%, respectively. These increases were dominated by pink salmon, which are short-lived, feed lower in marine food webs than other salmon species, and had the highest nutrient-to-contaminant ratios. As a result, the delivery of nutrients increased at a greater rate than the delivery of contaminants, and salmon inputs became more ecologically beneficial over time. Even still, contaminant loadings may represent exposure concerns for some salmon predators. The Pacific salmon example demonstrates how long-term environmental changes interact with nutrient and contaminant movement across large spatial scales and provides a model for exploring similar patterns with other migratory species9.",

          "abstract": "Through their movements and migrations, many animals transport resources across ecosystem boundaries and thus fulfil crucial ecological roles by enabling flows of energy and nutrients to different communities1. These ‘subsidies’ can extend beyond the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus that all organisms need to grow, and include physiologically important organic molecules, such as omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA), which are increasingly appreciated as key limiting resources for a diversity of consumers2. However, migrating animals can transport contaminants in their bodies, too, through what has been referred to as the ‘dark side’ of resource subsidies3. Despite the awareness that animals can carry a range of both nutrients and contaminants, these transport roles are often studied separately. Writing in Nature, Brandt et al.4 explore spatial and temporal changes in the coupled nutrients and contaminants transported during Pacific salmon migrations to western North America between 1976 and 2015.",

The development of general methods that enable rapid synthesis of a broad range of compounds is therefore paramount. A common approach for expanding compound libraries is known as cross-coupling, in which pairs of molecular fragments are linked through the formation of a carbon–carbon bond1. Writing in Nature, Al Zubaydi et al.2 describe a general method for a type of cross-coupling that has proved particularly challenging: that between aliphatic molecular fragments, which are characterized by flexible 3D structures. This reaction increases the range of compounds that can be synthesized by chemists, unlocking opportunities for applications such as drug discovery.",

          "abstract": "Because the Arctic is among the fastest warming regions on Earth, scientists are making considerable efforts to measure and predict the resulting changes to its diverse landscapes. Rates of river migration — the lateral movement of river channels across floodplains — have been a principal focus, yet there is no scientific consensus even about whether Arctic river migration will increase or decrease with further warming. Writing in Nature, Geyman et al.1 report sub-monthly estimates of bank erosion along a 450-kilometre stretch of the Koyukuk River in Alaska. Importantly, they find that migration of this river is held in check by permafrost banks, which reduce riverbank erosion rates by 47%. The authors use these observations to generate a model that predicts how migration rates will change with rising Arctic temperatures as permafrost diminishes.",

Conventionally, this central question in neuroscience has been studied while recording activity from neurons in animals that have been trained to perform specific tasks in response to different stimuli, which provides only indirect measures of perception. Alternatively, experiments in humans, who can narrate their perceptual experiences, have typically been limited to indirect recording methods that report only bulk neural activity at low temporal or spatial resolution. This is changing with the increased prevalence of implanted ‘depth’ electrodes that can measure activity from deep inside the brain, and with rapid advances in technologies that enable recordings from large numbers of individual neurons. Together, this affords researchers the opportunity to study the activity of large populations of individual neurons in humans1,2 and to directly link neural activity to perception. In a study reported in Nature, Kehl et al.3 record odour-evoked neuronal activity from thousands of individual neurons in human volunteers, providing unprecedented insight into how odour information is processed in the brain.",

          "abstract": "As incarceration rates rise globally, the need to reduce re-offending grows increasingly urgent. We investigate whether positive group bonds can improve behaviours among incarcerated people via a unique soccer-based prison intervention, the Twinning Project. We analyse effects of participation compared to a control group (study 1, n = 676, n = 1,874 control cases) and longitudinal patterns of social cohesion underlying these effects (study 2, n = 388) in the United Kingdom. We also explore desistance from crime after release (study 3, n = 249) in the United Kingdom and the United States. As law-abiding behaviour also requires a supportive receiving community, we assessed factors influencing willingness to employ formerly incarcerated people in online samples in the United Kingdom and the United States (studies 4–9, n = 1,797). Results indicate that social bonding relates to both improved behaviour within prison and increased willingness of receiving communities to support re-integration efforts. Harnessing the power of group identities both within prison and receiving communities can help to address the global incarceration crisis.",

Despite enormous efforts devoted to understanding AI’s economic impacts, we lack a systematic understanding of the benefits to scientific research associated with the use of AI. Here we develop a measurement framework to estimate the direct use of AI and associated benefits in science. We find that the use and benefits of AI appear widespread throughout the sciences, growing especially rapidly since 2015. However, there is a substantial gap between AI education and its application in research, highlighting a misalignment between AI expertise supply and demand. Our analysis also reveals demographic disparities, with disciplines with higher proportions of women or Black scientists reaping fewer benefits from AI, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in science. These findings have implications for the equity and sustainability of the research enterprise, especially as the integration of AI with science continues to deepen.",

          "abstract": "Human infants are born with their eyes open and an otherwise limited motor repertoire; thus, studies measuring infant looking are commonly used to investigate the developmental origins of perception and cognition. However, scholars have long expressed concerns about the reliability and interpretation of looking behaviours. We evaluated these concerns using a pre-registered (https://osf.io/jghc3), systematic meta-analysis of 76 published and unpublished studies of infants’ early physical and psychological reasoning (total n = 1,899; 3- to 12-month-old infants; database search and call for unpublished studies conducted July to August 2022). We studied two effects in the same datasets: looking towards expected versus unexpected events (violation of expectation (VOE)) and looking towards visually familiar versus visually novel events (perceptual novelty (PN)). Most studies implemented methods to minimize the risk of bias (for example, ensuring that experimenters were naive to the conditions and reporting inter-rater reliability). There was mixed evidence about publication bias for the VOE effect. Most centrally to our research aims, we found that these two effects varied systematically—with roughly equal effect sizes (VOE, standardized mean difference 0.290 and 95% confidence interval (0.208, 0.372); PN, standardized mean difference 0.239 and 95% confidence interval (0.109, 0.369))—but independently, based on different predictors. Age predicted infants’ looking responses to unexpected events, but not visually novel events. Habituation predicted infants’ looking responses to visually novel events, but not unexpected events. From these findings, we suggest that conceptual and perceptual novelty independently influence infants’ looking behaviour.",

Here we show that children fact-check claims more and are better able to catch misinformation when they have been exposed to detectable inaccuracies. In two experiments (N = 122), 4–7-year-old children exposed to falsity (as opposed to all true information) sampled more evidence before verifying a test claim in a novel domain. Children’s evidentiary standards were graded: fact-checking increased with higher proportions of false statements heard during exposure. A simulation suggests that children’s behaviour is adaptive, because increased fact-checking in more dubious environments supports the discovery of potential misinformation. Importantly, children were least diligent at fact-checking a new claim when all prior information was true, suggesting that sanitizing children’s informational environments may inadvertently dampen their natural scepticism. Instead, these findings support the counterintuitive possibility that exposing children to some nonsense may scaffold vigilance towards more subtle misinformation in the future.",

Here we conducted an umbrella review encompassing 194 observational meta-analyses, 10 Mendelian randomization studies and 748 interventional meta-analyses to appraise the published evidence on the associations between maternal adiposity and perinatal and offspring outcomes. Evidence grading suggested that 17 (8.8%) observational meta-analyses were supported by convincing evidence for 12 outcomes: maternal adiposity was associated with an increased risk of caesarean delivery following labour induction, infant mortality, Apgar score <7 at 1 min, antenatal depression, offspring overweight and obesity, early timing of puberty onset in daughters, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, congenital heart disease and spina bifida (OR/RR ranging from 1.14 to 2.31), as well as increased offspring body fat percent and fat mass (SMD 0.31 and 0.35, respectively). Among these outcomes, interventional meta-analyses supported that maternal weight loss interventions significantly reduced the risk of antenatal depression but not low Apgar scores; these interventions also could not reduce offspring fat mass or body fat percent. Evidence from Mendelian randomization studies supported a causal relationship between maternal adiposity and gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, birth size and offspring adiposity. Our findings highlight that while observational meta-analyses reveal associations between maternal adiposity and various adverse perinatal and offspring outcomes, convincing, unbiased evidence or support from Mendelian randomization studies is limited. Maternal pre-conceptional and prenatal weight loss interventions can reduce some, but not all, of these adverse effects.",

          "abstract": "A sniff in humans typically lasts one to three seconds and is commonly considered to produce a long-exposure shot of the chemical environment that sets the temporal limit of olfactory perception. To break this limit, we devised a sniff-triggered apparatus that controls odorant deliveries within a sniff with a precision of 18 milliseconds. Using this apparatus, we show through rigorous psychophysical testing of 229 participants (649 sessions) that two odorants presented in one order and its reverse become perceptually discriminable when the stimulus onset asynchrony is merely 60 milliseconds (Cohen’s d = 0.48; 95% confidence interval, (55, 59); 120-millisecond difference). Discrimination performance improves with the length of stimulus onset asynchrony and is independent of explicit knowledge of the temporal order of odorants or the relative amount of odorant molecules accumulated in a sniff. Our findings demonstrate that human olfactory perception is sensitive to chemical dynamics within a single sniff and provide behavioural evidence for a temporal code of odour identity.",

          "abstract": "Based on current research, it is evident that the way people see themselves is shaped by their conversation partners. Historically, this literature focuses on how one individual’s expectations can shape another person’s self-views. Given the reciprocal nature of conversation, we wondered whether conversation partners’ self-views may mutually evolve. Using four-person round-robin conversation networks, we found that participants tended to have more similar self-views post-conversation than pre-conversation, an effect we term “inter-self alignment.” Further, the more two partners’ self-views aligned, the more they enjoyed their conversation and were inclined to interact again. This effect depended on both conversation partners becoming aligned. These findings suggest that the way we see ourselves is coauthored in the act of dialogue and that as shared self-views develop, the desire to continue the conversation increases.",

          "abstract": "We propose that experiencing a lack of personal control will increase people’s preferences for self-similar others and that this effect would be explained by a greater need for structure. Our hypotheses received support across 11 longitudinal, experimental, and archival studies composed of data from 60 countries (5 preregistered studies, N = 90,216). In an analysis of cross-country archival data, we found that respondents who indicated a lower sense of personal control were less likely to prefer to live with neighbors who had a different religion, race, or spoke a different language (Study 1). Study 2 found that participants who perceived lower (vs. higher) personal control indicated greater liking for coworkers who they perceived to be more self-similar across a wide range of characteristics (e.g., gender, personality). Studies 3a and 3b, two live-interaction experiments conducted in the United States and China, provided additional causal evidence for control-motivated similarity attraction. A causal experimental chain (Studies 4a to 4c) and a manipulation-of-mediation-as-a-moderator study (Study 5) provided evidence for the mediating effects of the need for structure. Study 6, a longitudinal study with Chinese employees, found that workers who reported perceiving a lower (vs. higher) sense of personal control preferred more self-similar coworkers, and this effect was mediated by a greater desire for structure. Finally, exploring downstream consequences, Studies 7a and 7b found that control-motivated similarity attraction was associated with a greater preference for homogenous (vs. diverse) groups. These findings highlight how the fundamental motive for personal control shapes the structure of social life.",

          "abstract": "Maximizing the welfare of society requires distributing goods between groups of people with different preferences. Such decisions are difficult because different moral principles impose irreconcilable solutions. For example, utilitarian efficiency (maximize overall outcome across individuals) may need trade-off against Rawlsian fairness norms (maximize the outcome for the worst-off individual). We identify a brain mechanism enabling decision-makers to solve such trade-offs between efficiency and fairness using separate neuroimaging and sham-controlled brain stimulation experiments. As activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) increases, people are more likely to implement the Rawlsian fairness criterion rather than efficiency or inequality concerns. Strikingly, reducing TPJ excitability with brain stimulation reduces the concern for fairness in fairness-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, the reduced fairness concerns statistically relate to stimulation-induced reductions in perspective-taking skills as measured in a separate task. Together, our findings not only reveal the neural underpinning of efficiency-fairness trade-offs but also recast the role of TPJ in social decision-making by showing that its perspective-taking function serves to promote fairness for the worst-off rather than efficiency or equality.",

A critical aspect for understanding the mechanism for microbial mercury (Hg) methylation is the origin of the methyl group. However, the origin of methyl group in methanogen-mediated Hg methylation remains unclear. This study aims to identify the source of methyl group for MeHg synthesis in methanogens. Our study revealed that Hg methylation in Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1 is closely related to methanogenesis process, according to the results of proteomic study and substrate limitation study. Next, we proved that nearly all methyl group in MeHg derives from the Wolfe cycle in this species, rather than the previously demonstrated acetyl-coenzyme A pathway, based on the results of 13 C labeling study. We then proposed the Wolfe cycle–dependent Hg methylation mechanism in this species. Further genome analyses and 13 C labeling experiments indicated that the involvement of the Wolfe cycle in Hg methylation is probably a universal feature among Hg-methylating methanogens. These findings reveal a unique Hg methylation mechanism in methanogens. Our study broadens the carbon substrates and controlling factors for MeHg synthesis in the environment, which can inform the prediction of MeHg production potential and remediation strategies for MeHg contamination.",

Here, we find that planktonic bacteria can transcriptionally respond to flow, inducing expression changes that are beneficial in flow. Specifically, we use microfluidic experiments and quantitative modeling to show that in the presence of flow, planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa induce shear rate–dependent genes that promote growth in low-oxygen environments. Untangling this mechanism revealed that in flow, motile P. aeruginosa spatially redistribute, leading to cell density changes that activate quorum sensing, which in turn enhances the oxygen uptake rate. In diffusion-limited environments, including those commonly encountered by bacteria, flow-induced cell density gradients also independently generate oxygen gradients that alter gene expression. Mutants deficient in this flow-responsive mechanism exhibit decreased fitness in flow, suggesting that this dynamic coupling of biological and mechanical processes can be physiologically significant.",

          "abstract": "The concurrent preservation of morphological, structural, and genomic attributes within biological samples is paramount for comprehensive insights into biological phenomena and disease mechanisms. However, current preservation methodologies (e.g., cryopreservation, chemical reagent fixation, and bioplasticization) exhibit limitations in simultaneously achieving these critical combined goals. To address this gap, inspired by natural fossilization, here we propose “deep silicification,” a room temperature technology that eliminates fixation requirements and overcomes the cold chain problem. By harnessing the synergy between ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide, deep silicification significantly enhances silica penetration and accumulation within bioorganisms, thereby reinforcing structural integrity. This versatile and cost-effective approach demonstrates remarkable efficacy in preserving organismal morphology across various scales. Accelerated aging experiments underscore a 4,723-fold enhancement in genomic information storage over millennia, with whole-genome sequencing confirming nearly 100% fidelity. With its simplicity and reliability, “deep silicification” represents a paradigm shift in biological sample storage.",

          "abstract": "Elevated lipid synthesis is one of the best-characterized metabolic alterations in cancer and crucial for membrane expansion. As a key rate-limiting enzyme in de novo fatty acid synthesis, ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is frequently up-regulated in tumors and regulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Despite emerging evidence showing O -GlcNAcylation on ACLY, its biological function still remains unknown. Here, we observed a significant upregulation of ACLY O -GlcNAcylation in various types of human tumor cells and tissues and identified S979 as a major O -GlcNAcylation site. Importantly, S979 O -GlcNAcylation is required for substrate CoA binding and crucial for ACLY enzymatic activity. Moreover, it is sensitive to glucose fluctuation and decisive for fatty acid synthesis as well as tumor cell proliferation. In response to EGF stimulation, both S979 O -GlcNAcylation and previously characterized S455 phosphorylation played indispensable role in the regulation of ACLY activity and cell proliferation; however, they functioned independently from each other. In vivo, streptozocin treatment- and EGFR overexpression-induced growth of xenograft tumors was mitigated once S979 was mutated. Collectively, this work helps comprehend how cells interrogate the nutrient enrichment for proliferation and suggests that although mammalian cell proliferation is controlled by mitogen signaling, the ancient nutrition-sensing mechanism is conserved and still efficacious in the cells of multicellular organisms.",

          "abstract": "Many human pathogens, including malaria, dengue, influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and cytomegalovirus, coexist as multiple genetically distinct strains. Understanding how these multistrain pathogens evolve is of critical importance for forecasting epidemics and predicting the consequences of vaccination. One factor believed to play an important role is naturally acquired immunity. Consequently, a large body of research has sought to predict how acquired immunity molds the genomics of pathogen populations (i.e., what shapes pathogen strain structure). The diversity of existing models has resulted in conflicting evolutionary predictions and has sparked an ongoing debate about which predictions are most broadly applicable. Here, we adopt a multilocus population genetics perspective that unifies the predictions of existing models. We identify three key factors that determine the role of naturally acquired immunity in the evolution of pathogen strain structure: i) the strength and specificity of immune protections, ii) the dynamic immunological landscape, and iii) the number of loci coding for the antigens of the pathogen. Isolating and discussing these three factors clarifies the relationship among previous models of multistrain dynamics, and establishes a solid theoretical foundation for the study of the evolutionary epidemiology of multistrain pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Lepidopterans commonly feed on plant material, being the most significant insect herbivores in nature. Despite plant resistance to herbivory, such as producing toxic secondary metabolites, herbivores have developed mechanisms encoded in their genomes to tolerate or detoxify plant defensive compounds. Recent studies also highlight the role of gut microbiota in mediating detoxification in herbivores; however, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of gut symbionts is rare in Lepidoptera. Here, we show that the growth of various lepidopteran species was inhibited by a mulberry-derived secondary metabolite, 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ); as expected, the specialist silkworm Bombyx mori grew well, but interestingly, gut microbiota of early-instar silkworms was affected by the DNJ level, and several bacterial species responded positively to enriched DNJ. Among these, a bacterial strain isolated from the silkworm gut ( Pseudomonas fulva ZJU1) can degrade and utilize DNJ as the sole energy source, and after inoculation into nonspecialists (e.g., beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua ), P. fulva ZJU1 increased host resistance to DNJ and significantly promoted growth. We used genomic and transcriptomic analyses to identify genes potentially involved in DNJ degradation, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis verified the function of ilvB , a key binding protein, in metabolizing DNJ. Furthermore, the ilvB deletion mutant, exhibiting normal bacterial growth, could no longer enhance nonspecialist performance, supporting a role in DNJ degradation in vivo. Therefore, our study demonstrated causality between the gut microbiome and detoxification of plant chemical defense in Lepidoptera, facilitating a mechanistic understanding of host–microbe relationships across this complex, abundant insect group.",

Here, we used a deterministic compartmental model to infer the effectiveness of the third-dose MMR vaccine in preventing mumps cases by analyzing the mumps outbreak that occurred at the University of Iowa between August 24, 2015, and May 13, 2016. The modeling approach further allowed us to evaluate the population-level impact of vaccination by different timing in relation to the start of the outbreak and varied coverage levels, and to account for potential sources of bias in estimating vaccine effectiveness. We found large uncertainty in vaccine effectiveness estimates; however, our models showed that early introduction of a third dose of MMR vaccine during a mumps outbreak can be effective in preventing transmission.

          "abstract": "Shear bands frequently appear in lattice architectures subjected to compression, leading to an unstable stress–strain curve and global deformation. This deformation mechanism reduces their energy absorption and loading-bearing capacity and causes the architectures to prioritize mechanical protection of external components at the expense of the entire structure. Here, we leverage the design freedom offered by additive manufacturing and the geometrical relation of dual-phase nanolamellar crystals to fabricate heterogeneous lamellar lattice architectures consisting of body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cells in alternating lamella. The lamellar lattice demonstrates more than 10 and 9 times higher specific energy absorption and energy absorption efficiency, respectively, compared to the BCC lattice. The drastic improvement arises as the nucleation of shear bands is inhibited by the discrete energy threshold for plastic buckling of adjacent heterogeneous lattice lamella during loading. Despite its lower density than the FCC lattice, the lamellar lattice exhibits significant enhancement in plateau stress and crushing force efficiency, attributed to the strengthening effect induced by simultaneous deformation of unit cells in the BCC lattice lamella and the resulting cushion shielding effect. The design improves the global mechanical properties, making lamellar lattices compare favorably against numerous materials proposed for mechanical protection. Additionally, it provides opportunities to program the local mechanical response, achieving programmable internal protection alongside overall external protection. This work provides a different route to design lattice architecture by combining internal and external dual mechanical protection, enabling a generation of multiple mechanical protectors in aerospace, automotive, and transportation fields.",

Auxin, together with local PIFs and their positive regulator CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), promotes hypocotyl growth to facilitate access to light. Whether shade alters the cellular redox status thereby affecting growth responses, remains unexplored. Here, we show that, under shade, high auxin levels increased reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide accumulation in the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis. This nitroxidative environment favored the promotion of hypocotyl growth by COP1 under shade. We demonstrate that COP1 is S-nitrosylated, particularly under shade. Impairing this redox regulation enhanced COP1 degradation by the proteasome and diminished the capacity of COP1 to interact with target proteins and to promote hypocotyl growth. Disabling this regulation also generated transversal asymmetries in hypocotyl growth, indicating poor coordination among different cells, which resulted in random hypocotyl bending and predictably low ability to compete with neighbors.

Microscopic structural signatures predicting these structural relaxations have been long searched for but have so far only been found in dynamic quantities such as vibrational quasi-localized soft modes or with structurally trained neural networks. A physically meaningful structural quantity remains elusive. Here, we introduce a structural order parameter derived from the mean-field caging potential experienced by the particles due to their neighbors, which reliably predicts the occurrence of structural relaxations. The structural parameter, derived from density functional theory, provides a measure of susceptibility to particle rearrangements that can effectively identify weak or defect-like regions in disordered systems. Using experiments on dense colloidal suspensions, we demonstrate a strong correlation between this order parameter and the structural relaxations of the amorphous solid. In quiescent suspensions, this correlation increases with density, when particle rearrangements become rarer and more localized. In sheared suspensions, the order parameter reliably pinpoints shear transformations; the applied shear weakens the caging potential due to shear-induced structural distortions, causing the proliferation of plastic deformation at structurally weak regions. Our work paves the way to a structural understanding of the relaxation of a wide range of amorphous solids, from suspensions to metallic glasses.",

Several studies have shown that such scaling laws hold also for natural ecosystems, including individual trees and forests, riverine metabolism, and river network organization. However, the derivation of scaling laws for catchment-scale water and carbon fluxes has not been achieved so far. Here, we focus on scaling relations of catchment green metabolism, defined as the set of ecohydrological and biogeochemical processes through which vegetation assemblages in catchments maintain their structure and react to the surrounding environment. By revising existing plant size–density relationships and integrating them across large-scale domains, we show that the ecohydrological fluxes occurring at the catchment scale are invariant with respect to the above-ground vegetation biomass per unit area of the basin, while they scale linearly with catchment size. We thus demonstrate that the sublinear scaling of plant metabolism results in an isometric scaling at catchment and regional scales. Deviations from such predictions are further shown to collapse onto a common distribution, thus incorporating natural fluctuations due to resource limitations into a generalized scaling theory. Results from scaling arguments are supported by hyperresolution ecohydrological simulations and remote sensing observations.",

          "abstract": "Tumor-targeted therapies have often been inefficient due to the lack of concomitant control over the tumor microenvironment. Using an immunocompetent autologous breast cancer model, we investigated a MAtrix REgulating MOtif (MAREMO)-mimicking peptide, which inhibits the protumorigenic extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule tenascin-C that activates several cancer hallmarks. In cultured cells, targeting the MAREMO blocks tenascin-C signaling involved in cell adhesion and immune-suppression by inhibiting tenascin-C interactions with fibronectin, TGFβ, CXCL12, and others, thereby blocking downstream events. Using RNASequencing and various genetic, molecular, in situ, and in vivo assays, we demonstrate that the MAREMO peptide similarly blocks multiple tenascin-C functions in vivo. This includes releasing tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, including CD8+ T cells, from the stroma. The MAREMO peptide also triggers interferon signaling, restoring antitumor immunity, contributing to tumor growth inhibition and reduced dissemination. The MAREMO peptide targets tumor cells directly by promoting growth suppression and inhibiting phenotypic plasticity, subsequently enhancing responsiveness to the endogenous death inducer tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, as shown by a loss-of-function approach. Moreover, the MAREMO peptide largely subdues the tumor bed by depleting fibroblasts, repressing tenascin-C and other ECM molecules, and restoring the function of the few remaining blood vessels. In conclusion, targeting tenascin-C with a MAREMO peptide represents a powerful anticancer strategy with a broad inhibition of several cancer hallmarks.",

Here, we optimized a CHIKV nsP2 protease (nsP2pro) biochemical assay for the screening of a 6,120-compound cysteine-directed covalent fragment library. Using a 50% inhibition threshold, we identified 153 hits (2.5% hit rate).

LC-MS/MS analysis determined that RA-0002034 covalently modified the catalytic cysteine in a site-specific manner. Additionally, RA-0002034 showed no significant off-target reactivity in proteomic experiments or against a panel of cysteine proteases. In addition to the potent biochemical inhibition of CHIKV nsP2pro activity and exceptional selectivity, RA-0002034 was tested in cellular models of alphavirus infection and effectively inhibited viral replication of both CHIKV and related alphaviruses.

In addition, reallocating carbon to branch turnover in model simulations reduced stem wood biomass, a long-lasting carbon storage, by 7 to 17%.

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial function relies on the coordinated expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, exhibiting remarkable resilience despite high mitochondrial mutation rates. The nuclear compensation mechanism suggests deleterious mitochondrial alleles drive compensatory nuclear mutations to preserve mito-nuclear compatibility. However, prevalence and factors conditioning this phenomenon remain debated due to its conflicting evidence. Here, we investigate how mito-nuclear incompatibilities impact substitutions in a model for species radiation. Mating success depends on genetic compatibility (nuclear DNA) and spatial proximity. Populations evolve from partially compatible mito-nuclear states, simulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression. Mutations do not confer advantages nor disadvantages, but individual fecundity declines with increasing incompatibilities, selecting for mito-nuclear coordination. We find that selection for mito-nuclear compatibility affects each genome differently based on their initial state. In compatible gene pairs, selection reduces substitutions in both genomes, while in incompatible nuclear genes, it consistently promotes compensation, facilitated by more mismatches. Interestingly, high mitochondrial mutation rates can reduce nuclear compensation by increasing mtDNA rectification, while substitutions in initially compatible nuclear gene are boosted. Finally, the presence of incompatibilities accelerates species radiation, but equilibrium richness is not directly correlated to substitution rates, revealing the complex dynamics triggered by mitochondrial introgression and mito-nuclear coevolution. Our study provides a perspective on nuclear compensation and the role of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in speciation by exploring extreme scenarios and identifying trends that empirical data alone cannot reveal. We emphasize the challenges in detecting these dynamics and propose analyzing specific genomic signatures could shed light on this evolutionary process.",

To accurately assess homology between unalignable sequences, we developed an alignment-free sequence comparison algorithm, SHARK (Similarity/Homology Assessment by Relating K-mers). We trained SHARK-dive, a machine learning homology classifier, which achieved superior performance to standard alignment-based approaches in assessing evolutionary homology in unalignable sequences. Furthermore, it correctly identified dissimilar but functionally analogous IDRs in IDR-replacement experiments reported in the literature, whereas alignment-based tools were incapable of detecting such functional relationships. SHARK-dive not only predicts functionally similar IDRs at a proteome-wide scale but also identifies cryptic sequence properties and motifs that drive remote homology and analogy, thereby providing interpretable and experimentally verifiable hypotheses of the sequence determinants that underlie such relationships. SHARK-dive acts as an alternative to alignment to facilitate systematic analysis and functional annotation of the unalignable protein universe.",

          "abstract": "Phtheirospermum japonicum is a hemiparasitic plant of the Orobanchaceae, the largest family of parasitic plants. It extracts water and nutrients from other plants through haustoria along its roots. Haustoriogenesis, the formation of haustoria, is initiated by host-derived haustorium-inducing factors (HIFs). The first step in haustoriogenesis is the development of parasitically inactive protohaustoria. Here, we report that an endogenous peptide hormone, CLAVATA3/Embryo Surrounding Region 1 ( Pj CLE1), is sufficient to induce protohaustorium formation. Pj CLE1 hyperactivated HIF-responses and caused prolific protohaustoria formation. PjCLE1 expression and activation by the subtilisin-type protease Pj SBT1.2.3 occur in fully developed, mature haustoria, suggesting that Pj CLE1 acts as an internal signal produced by mature haustoria to stimulate additional protohaustorium formation for effective extraction of resources from hosts. Pj CLE1 is similar in sequence to CLEs regulating nodulation in legumes and part of a regulatory system for haustoria formation in parasitic plants.",

We employed cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to analyze filtered water samples collected from the Tsinghua Lotus Pond. Here, we report the structural determination and characterization of two highly similar helical fibrils, named TLP-1a and TLP-1b, each approximately 8 nm in diameter with a 15-Å wide tunnel. These fibrils are assembled from a similar protein protomer, whose structure was conveniently automodeled in CryoNet. The protomer structure does not match any available experimental structures, but shares the same fold as many predicted structures of unknown functions. The amino-terminal β strand of protomer n + 4 inserts into a cleft in protomer n to complete an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain. This packing mechanism, known as donor-strand exchange (DSE), has been observed in several bacterial pilus assemblies, wherein the donor is protomer n + 1. Despite distinct shape and thickness, this reminiscence suggests that TLP-1a/b fibrils may represent uncharacterized bacterial pili. Our study demonstrates an emerging paradigm in structural biology, where high-resolution structural determination precedes and drives the identification and characterization of completely unknown objects.",

To identify correctors of severe protein misfolding and trafficking obstruction manifested by the pathogenic L444P-variant of GCase, we developed a suite of quantitative, high-throughput, cell-based assays. First, we labeled GCase with a small proluminescent HiBiT peptide reporter tag, enabling quantitation of protein stabilization in cells while faithfully maintaining target biology. TALEN-based gene editing allowed for stable integration of a single HiBiT- GBA1 transgene into an intragenic safe-harbor locus in GBA1 -knockout H4 (neuroglioma) cells. This GD cell model was amenable to lead discovery via titration-based quantitative high-throughput screening and lead optimization via structure–activity relationships. A primary screen of 10,779 compounds from the NCATS bioactive collections identified 140 stabilizers of HiBiT-GCase-L444P, including both pharmacological chaperones (ambroxol and noninhibitory chaperone NCGC326) and proteostasis regulators (panobinostat, trans-ISRIB, and pladienolide B). Two complementary high-content imaging-based assays were deployed to triage hits: The fluorescence-quenched substrate LysoFix-GBA captured functional lysosomal GCase activity, while an immunofluorescence assay featuring antibody hGCase-1/23 directly visualized GCase lysosomal translocation. NCGC326 was active in both secondary assays and completely reversed pathological glucosylsphingosine accumulation. Finally, we tested the concept of combination therapy by demonstrating synergistic actions of NCGC326 with proteostasis regulators in enhancing GCase-L444P levels. Looking forward, these physiologically relevant assays can facilitate the identification, pharmacological validation, and medicinal chemistry optimization of small molecules targeting GCase, ultimately leading to a viable therapeutic for GD and PD.",

          "abstract": "Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutation is associated with malignant tumor transformation and drug resistance. However, the development of clinically effective targeted therapies for KRAS-mutant cancer has proven to be a formidable challenge. Here, we report that tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) functions as a target of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), contributing to regorafenib therapy resistance. Mechanistically, TRIM21 directly interacts with and ubiquitinates v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc) at lysine 148 (K148) via K63-linkage, enabling c-Myc to be targeted to the autophagy machinery for degradation, ultimately resulting in the downregulation of enolase 2 expression and inhibition of glycolysis. However, mutant KRAS (KRAS/MT)-driven mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling leads to the phosphorylation of TRIM21 (p-TRIM21) at Threonine 396 (T396) by ERK2, disrupting the interaction between TRIM21 and c-Myc and thereby preventing c-Myc from targeting autophagy for degradation. This enhances glycolysis and contributes to regorafenib resistance. Clinically, high p-TRIM21 (T396) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Targeting TRIM21 to disrupt KRAS/MT-driven phosphorylation using the antidepressant vilazodone shows potential for enhancing the efficacy of regorafenib in treating KRAS-mutant CRC in preclinical models. These findings are instrumental for KRAS-mutant CRC treatment aiming at activating TRIM21-mediated selective autophagic degradation of c-Myc.",

          "abstract": "The cotranslational misfolding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel (CFTR) plays a central role in the molecular basis of CF. The misfolding of the most common CF variant (ΔF508) remodels both the translational regulation and quality control of CFTR. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the misassembly of the nascent polypeptide may directly influence the activity of the translation machinery. In this work, we identify a structural motif within the CFTR transcript that stimulates efficient −1 ribosomal frameshifting and triggers the premature termination of translation. Though this motif does not appear to impact the interactome of wild-type CFTR, silent mutations that disrupt this RNA structure alter the association of nascent ΔF508 CFTR with numerous translation and quality control proteins. Moreover, disrupting this RNA structure enhances the functional gating of the ΔF508 CFTR channel at the plasma membrane and its pharmacological rescue by the CFTR modulators contained in the CF drug Trikafta. The effects of the RNA structure on ΔF508 CFTR appear to be attenuated in the absence of the ER membrane protein complex, which was previously found to modulate ribosome collisions during “preemptive quality control” of a misfolded CFTR homolog. Together, our results reveal that ribosomal frameshifting selectively modulates the assembly, function, and pharmacological rescue of a misfolded CFTR variant. These findings suggest that interactions between the nascent chain, quality control machinery, and ribosome may dynamically modulate ribosomal frameshifting in order to tune the processivity of translation in response to cotranslational misfolding.",

We develop a physical model of the ER as an active liquid network, governed by a balance of tension-driven shrinking and new tubule growth. This minimalist model gives rise to steady-state network structures with density and rearrangement timescales predicted from the junction mobility and tubule spawning rate. Several parameter-independent geometric features of the liquid network model are shown to be representative of ER architecture in live mammalian cells. The liquid network model connects the timescales of distinct dynamic features such as ring closure and new tubule growth in the ER. Furthermore, it demonstrates how the steady-state network morphology on a cellular scale arises from the balance of microscopic dynamic rearrangements.",

          "abstract": "Hibernation is a widespread and highly efficient mechanism to save energy in mammals. However, one major challenge of hibernation is maintaining blood circulation at low body temperatures, which strongly depends on the viscoelastic properties of red blood cells (RBCs). Here, we examined at physiologically relevant timescales the thermomechanical properties of hundreds of thousands of individual RBCs from the hibernating common noctule bat ( Nyctalus noctula ), the nonhibernating Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ), and humans ( Homo sapiens ). We exposed RBCs to temperatures encountered during normothermia and hibernation and found a significant increase in elasticity and viscosity with decreasing temperatures. Our data demonstrate that temperature adjustment of RBCs is mainly driven by membrane properties and not the cytosol while viscous dissipation in the membrane of both bat species exceeds the one in humans by a factor of 15. Finally, our results show that RBCs from both bat species reveal a transition to a more viscous-like state when temperature decreases. This process on a minute timescale has an effect size that is comparable with fluctuations in RBC viscoelasticity over the course of the year, implying that environmental factors, such as diets, have a lower impact on the capability of RBCs to respond to different temperatures than general physical properties of the cell membrane. In summary, our findings suggest membrane viscoelasticity as a promising target for identifying mechanisms that could be manipulated to ensure blood circulation at low body temperatures in humans, which may be one first step toward safe synthetic torpor in medicine and space flight.",

In addition, free radical generation is usually elevated in cells under stress as is the case for many different pathological conditions. In liver tissue, cells produce radicals when exposed to toxic substances but also, for instance, in cancer, alcoholic liver disease and liver cirrhosis. However, free radicals are small, short-lived, and occur in low abundance making them challenging to detect and especially to time resolve, leading to a lack of nanoscale information. Recently, our group has demonstrated that diamond-based quantum sensing offers a solution to measure free radical generation in single living cells. The method is based on defects in diamonds, the so-called nitrogen-vacancy centers, which change their optical properties based on their magnetic surrounding. As a result, this technique reveals magnetic resonance signals by optical means offering high sensitivity. However, compared to cells, there are several challenges that we resolved here: Tissues are more fragile, have a higher background fluorescence, have less particle uptake, and do not adhere to microscopy slides. Here, we overcame those challenges and adapted the method to perform measurements in living tissues. More specifically, we used precision-cut liver slices and were able to detect free radical generation during a stress response to ethanol, as well as the reduction in the radical load after adding an antioxidant.",

We propose, based on generalized specific uncoiling of mitotic chromosomes in telophase, large-scale reorganization of interphase chromosomes.

We assessed the impact of the treatment on the host microbiota community, on weight, and tested whether the treatment affected a previous result linking microbiota alpha diversity to weight in nestlings. The treatment dramatically increased L. kimchicus abundance in the gut microbiota and increased alpha diversity. This effect was strongest in the youngest birds, validating earlier findings pointing to a brief developmental window when the gut microbiota are most sensitive. In time-lagged models, nestling weight was higher in the treatment birds suggesting L. kimchicus may have probiotic potential. There was also a positive time-lagged relationship between diversity and weight in control birds but not in the treatment birds, suggesting L. kimchicus helped birds compensate for low alpha diversity.

Obesity and aging have been linked to cellular senescence in various tissues, resulting in increased local and systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction. We hypothesized that obesity and joint injury lead to cellular senescence that is typically associated with increased OA severity or with aging and that the ratio of omega-6 (ω-6) to omega-3 (ω-3) FAs regulates these pathologic effects. Mice were placed on an ω-6-rich high-fat diet or a lean control diet and underwent destabilization of the medial meniscus to induce OA. Obesity and joint injury significantly increased cellular senescence in subcutaneous and visceral fat as well as joint tissues such as synovium and cartilage. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for fat-1 , a fatty acid desaturase that converts ω-6 to ω-3 FAs, decreasing the serum ω-6:ω-3 FA ratio had a strong senomorphic and therapeutic effect, mitigating metabolic dysfunction, cellular senescence, and joint degeneration. In vitro coculture of bone marrow-derived macrophages and chondrocytes from control and AAV8- fat1- treated mice were used to examine the roles of various FA mediators in regulating chondrocyte senescence. Our results suggest that obesity and joint injury result in a premature “aging” of the joint as measured by senescence markers, and these changes can be ameliorated by altering FA composition using fat-1 gene therapy. These findings support the potential for fat-1 gene therapy to treat obesity- and/or injury-induced OA clinically.",

          "abstract": "Profound functional switch of key regulatory factors may play a major role in homeostasis and disease. Dysregulation of circadian rhythm (CR) is strongly implicated in cancer with mechanisms poorly understood. We report here that the function of REV-ERBα, a major CR regulator of the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily, is dramatically altered in tumors in both its genome binding and functional mode. Loss of CR is linked to a functional inversion of REV-ERBα from a repressor in control of CR and metabolic gene programs in normal tissues to a strong activator in different cancers. Through changing its association from NCoR/HDAC3 corepressor complex to BRD4/p300 coactivators, REV-ERBα directly activates thousands of genes including tumorigenic programs such as MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling. Functioning as a master transcriptional activator, REV-ERBα partners with pioneer factor FOXA1 and directly stimulates a large number of signaling genes, including multiple growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases, RASs, AKTs, and MAPKs. Moreover, elevated REV-ERBα reprograms FOXA1 to bind new targets through a BRD4-mediated increase in local chromatin accessibility. Pharmacological targeting with SR8278 diminishes the function of both REV-ERBα and FOXA1 and synergizes with BRD4 inhibitor in effective suppression of tumorigenic programs and tumor growth. Thus, our study revealed a functional inversion by a CR regulator in driving gene reprogramming as an unexpected paradigm of tumorigenesis mechanism and demonstrated a high effectiveness of therapeutic targeting such switch.",

Here, we report an innovative high-pressure preparation of martensitic pure Fe with involving nano-effect, which leads to the formation of ultrastrong bulk iron with exceptionally high yield strength, ultimate strength, and hardness of 2.9 GPa, 3.7 GPa, and 9.0 GPa, respectively, exceeding those of high-speed steels.

This principle is a powerful explanation of self-organization because energy is a local property of configurations. For nonequilibrium systems, there is no such property for which an analogous principle holds, hence no common explanation of the diverse forms of self-organization they exhibit. However, a flurry of recent empirical results has shown that a local property of configurations called “rattling” predicts the steady states of some nonequilibrium systems, leading to claims of a far-reaching principle of nonequilibrium self-organization. But for which nonequilibrium systems is rattling accurate, and why? We develop a theory of rattling in terms of Markov processes that gives simple and precise answers to these key questions. Our results show that rattling predicts a broader class of nonequilibrium steady states than has been claimed and for different reasons than have been suggested. Its predictions hold to an extent determined by the relative variance of, and correlation between, the local and global “parts” of a steady state. We show how these quantities characterize the local-global relationships of various random walks on random graphs, spin-glass dynamics, and models of animal collective behavior. Surprisingly, we find that the core idea of rattling is so general as to apply to equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems alike.",

          "abstract": "The poor prognosis of relatively undifferentiated cancers has long been recognized, suggesting that selection against differentiation and in favor of uncontrolled growth is one of the most powerful drivers of cancer progression. Goblet cells provide the mucous surface of the gut, and when present in colorectal cancers (CRC), the cancers are called mucinous. We have used the presence of MUC2, the main mucous product of goblet cells, and an associated gene product, TFF3, to classify a large panel of nearly 80 CRC-derived cell lines into five categories based on their levels of MUC2 and TFF3 expression. We have then shown that these five patterns of expression can be easily identified in the direct analysis of tumor specimens allowing a much finer characterization of CRCs with respect to the presence of goblet cell differentiation. In particular, about 30% of all CRCs fall into the category of expressing TFF3 but not MUC2, which has not previously been acknowledged. Using the cell line data, we suggest that there are up to 12 genes ( MUC2, TFF3, ATOH1, SPDEF, CDX1, CDX2, GATA6, HES1, ETS2, OLFM4, TOX3, and LGR5 ) that may be involved in selection against goblet cell differentiation in CRC by changes in methylation rather than mutations. Of these, LGR5 , which is particularly associated with lack of goblet cell features, may function in the control of differentiation rather than direct control of cell growth, as has so far mostly been assumed. These results emphasize the importance of methylation changes in driving cancer progression.",

          "abstract": "Constitutive models of fault friction form the basis of physics-based simulations of seismic activity. A generally accepted framework for the slip-rate and state dependence of friction involves a thermally activated process, whereby the probability of slip along microasperities adheres to an Arrhenius law. This model, which has become widely adopted among experimentalists and theoreticians, predicts a continuous increase of the direct effect with absolute temperature, but is it observed experimentally? Leveraging comprehensive laboratory data across diverse hydrothermal, barometric, and lithological conditions, we demonstrate that, contrary to the classical view, the direct effect for a given deformation mechanism remains largely temperature-independent. Instead, the incremental shifts in the direct effect often coincide with the brittle to semi-brittle transition, across which distinct deformation mechanisms operate. These considerations challenge the validity of the classical model. Realistic constitutive laws for rock failure within the lithosphere must incorporate the contributions of multiple deformation mechanisms within active fault zones.",

          "abstract": "Aging is the biggest risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD), suggesting that age-related changes in the brain promote dopamine neuron vulnerability. It is unclear, however, whether aging alone is sufficient to cause significant dopamine neuron loss, and if so, how this intersects with PD-related neurodegeneration. Here, through examining a large collection of naturally varying Drosophila strains, we find a strong relationship between life span and age-related dopamine neuron loss. Strains with naturally short-lived animals exhibit a loss of dopamine neurons without generalized neurodegeneration, while animals from long-lived strains retain dopamine neurons across age. Metabolomic profiling reveals lower glutathione levels in short-lived strains which is associated with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), sensitivity to oxidative stress, and vulnerability to silencing the familial PD gene parkin . Strikingly, boosting neuronal glutathione levels via glutamate-cysteine ligase (Gcl) overexpression is sufficient to normalize ROS levels, extend life span, and block dopamine neurons loss in short-lived backgrounds, demonstrating that glutathione deficiencies are central to neurodegenerative phenotypes associated with short longevity. These findings may be relevant to human PD pathogenesis, where glutathione depletion is reported to occur in the idiopathic PD patient brain through unknown mechanisms. Building on this, we find reduced expression of the Gcl catalytic subunit in both Drosophila strains vulnerable to age-related dopamine neuron loss and in the human brain from familial PD patients harboring the common LRRK2 G2019S mutation. Our study across Drosophila and human PD systems suggests that glutathione synthesis and levels play a conserved role in regulating age-related dopamine neuron health.",

          "abstract": "Droplets of one fluid in a second, immiscible fluid are typically spherical in shape due to the interfacial tension between the two fluids. Shear forces can lead to droplet deformation when they are subjected to flow, and these effects can be further modified when the droplet is stabilized by a surfactant due to a flow-induced gradients in the surfactant concentration. An alternative method of stabilizing droplets is through the use of colloidal particles, whose stabilization behavior is intrinsically different from molecular surfactants. Under the same flow condition, a gradient of particle concentration can result in the jamming of particles in regions with a high packing density, making the interface solid-like, albeit only under compression and not tension. However, how this asymmetry in the surfactant properties alters the droplet shape under shear is unknown. Here, we show that shear of particle-stabilized droplets can lead to a remarkable array of shape deformations as the droplets flow through a constrained microchannel. The shear-induced migration of particles on the surface results in the formation of an elastic shell at the back of the droplet, which can wrinkle and invaginate, ultimately leading to a unique core–shell structure. The shapes depend on the Peclet number of the flow, reflecting the balance of shear forces that drive the particles and diffusion that randomizes them. These findings highlight the consequences of the asymmetry in the forces between the particles and provide a unique method to controllably create droplets with a vast array of different shapes.",

In this study, we evidence the overlooked oxidation route that features the in situ formation of surface OH species on Cu catalysts and its selective addition to the reactant carbonyl group. We observed that glucose oxidation to gluconic acid in air (21% O 2 ) was favored on low-valence Cu sites according to X-ray spectroscopic analyses. Molecular O 2 was activated in situ on Cu 0 /Cu + forming localized, adsorbed hydroxyl radicals (*OH) which played the primary reactive oxygen species as confirmed by the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study in D 2 O and in situ Raman experiments. Combined with DFT calculations, we proposed a mechanism of O 2 -to-*OH activation through the *OOH intermediate. The localized *OH exhibited higher selectivity toward glucose oxidation at C1HO to form gluconic acid (up to 91% selectivity), in comparison with free radicals in bulk environment that emerged from thermal, noncatalytic hydrogen peroxide decomposition (40% selectivity). The KIE measurements revealed a lower glucose oxidation rate in D 2 O than in H 2 O, highlighting the role of water (H 2 O/D 2 O) or its derivatives (e.g., *OH/*OD) in the rate-determining step. After proving the C1-H activation step kinetically irrelevant, we proposed the oxidation mechanism that was characterized by the rate-limiting addition of *OH to C1=O in glucose. Our findings advocate that by maneuvering the coverage and activity of surface *OH, high-performance oxidation of carbonyl compounds beyond biomass molecules can be achieved in water and air using nonprecious metal catalysts.",

Ascr18/BR-StNILR1 signaling requires the coreceptor potato BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (StBAK1) and perception of either ligand strengthens StNILR1 interaction with StBAK1 in plant cells. Significantly, the parasitically successful potato cyst nematode ( Globodera pallida ) utilizes the effector RHA1B, which is a functional ubiquitin ligase, to target StNILR1 for ubiquitination-mediated proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby countering Ascr18/BR-StNILR1-mediated PTI in potato and facilitating nematode parasitism.

Although knot theory and related subjects are a focus of study in mathematics, their success in practical applications is quite limited due to the lack of localization and quantization. We address these challenges by introducing knot data analysis (KDA), a paradigm that incorporates curve segmentation and multiscale analysis into the Gauss link integral. The resulting multiscale Gauss link integral (mGLI) recovers the global topological properties of knots and links at an appropriate scale and offers a multiscale geometric topology approach to capture the local structures and connectivities in data. By integration with machine learning or deep learning, the proposed mGLI significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark problems in 13 intricately complex biological datasets, including protein flexibility analysis, protein–ligand interactions, human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene potassium channel blockade screening, and quantitative toxicity assessment.

          "authors": "Giulia Paiardi, Matheus Ferraz, Marco Rusnati, Rebecca C. Wade",
          "abstract": "Although it is well established that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds to the host cell ACE2 receptor to initiate infection, far less is known about the tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility to the virus. Differential expression across different cell types of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, with variably sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and their synergistic interactions with host and viral N-glycans may contribute to tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility. Nevertheless, their contribution remains unclear since HS and N-glycans evade experimental characterization. We, therefore, carried out microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, followed by random acceleration molecular dynamics simulations, of the fully glycosylated spike:ACE2 complex with and without highly sulfated GAG chains bound. By considering the model GAGs as surrogates for the highly sulfated HS expressed in lung cells, we identified key cell entry mechanisms of spike SARS-CoV-2. We find that HS promotes structural and energetic stabilization of the active conformation of the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and reorientation of ACE2 toward the N-terminal domain in the same spike subunit as the RBD. Spike and ACE2 N-glycans exert synergistic effects, promoting better packing, strengthening the protein:protein interaction, and prolonging the residence time of the complex. ACE2 and HS binding trigger rearrangement of the S2’ functional protease cleavage site through allosteric interdomain communication. These results thus show that HS has a multifaceted role in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they provide a mechanistic basis for the development of GAG derivatives with anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential.",

Here, we compared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of human and bat ( Rhinolophus ferrumequinum ) pluripotent cells and fibroblasts. Since bat cells do not express an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that allows virus infection, we transduced the human ACE2 (hA) receptor into the cells and found that transduced cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Compared to human embryonic stem cells-hA, infected bat induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-hA produced about a 100-fold lower level of infectious virus and displayed lower toxicity. In contrast, bat embryonic fibroblast-hA produced no infectious virus while being infectable and synthesizing viral RNA and proteins, suggesting abortive infection. Indeed, electron microscopy failed to detect virus-like particles in infected bat fibroblasts in contrast to bat iPSCs or human cells, consistent with the latter producing infectious viruses. This suggests that bat somatic but not pluripotent cells have an effective mechanism to control virus replication. Consistent with previous results by others, we find that bat cells have a constitutively activated innate immune system, which might limit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to human cells.",

Many studies focused on bisulfite treatment or immunoprecipitation protocols to assess the tissues of origin of cfDNA. DNA loss often occurs during such processes. Fragmentomics of cfDNA molecules has uncovered a wealth of information related to tissues of origin of cfDNA. There is still much room for the development of tools for assessing contributions from various tissues into plasma using fragmentomic features. Hence, we developed an approach to analyze the relative contributions of DNA from different tissues into plasma, by identifying characteristic fragmentation patterns associated with selected histone modifications. We named this technique as FRAGmentomics-based Histone modification Analysis (FRAGHA). Deduced placenta-specific histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac)-associated signal correlated well with the fetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma (Pearson’s r = 0.96). The deduced liver-specific H3K27ac-associated signal correlated with the donor-derived DNA fraction in liver transplantation recipients (Pearson’s r = 0.92) and was significantly increased in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ( P &lt; 0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Significant elevations of erythroblasts-specific and colon-specific H3K27ac-associated signals were observed in patients with β-thalassemia major and colorectal cancer, respectively. Furthermore, using the fragmentation patterns from tissue-specific H3K27ac regions, a machine learning algorithm was developed to enhance HCC detection, with an area under the curve (AUC) of up to 0.97. Finally, genomic regions with H3K27ac or histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) were found to exhibit different fragmentomic patterns of cfDNA. This study has shed light on the relationship between cfDNA fragmentomics and histone modifications, thus expanding the armamentarium of liquid biopsy.",

Here we use allograft and transgenic tumors to show that hosts display fluid retention associated with autonomously defective secretory capacity of fly renal tubules, which function analogous to those of the human kidney. Excretion from these organs is blocked by abnormal cells that originate from inappropriate activation of normally quiescent renal stem cells (RSCs). Blockage is initiated by IL-6-like oncokines that perturb renal water-transporting cells and trigger a damage response in RSCs that proceeds pathologically. Thus, a chronic inflammatory state produced by the tumor causes paraneoplastic fluid dysregulation by altering cellular homeostasis of host renal units.",

The importance of HDAC3 in Kras mutant lung tumors has recently been identified, but HDAC3 function in this context remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we identified HDAC3 as a lung tumor cell–intrinsic transcriptional regulator of the tumor immune microenvironment. In Kras mutant lung cancer cells, we found that HDAC3 is a direct transcriptional repressor of a cassette of secreted chemokines, including Cxcl10 . Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of HDAC3 robustly up-regulated this gene set in human and mouse Kras , LKB1 (KL) and Kras , p53 (KP) mutant lung cancer cells through an NF-κB/p65-dependent mechanism. Using genetically engineered mouse models, we found that HDAC3 inactivation in vivo induced expression of this gene set selectively in lung tumors and resulted in enhanced T cell recruitment at least in part via Cxcl10 . Furthermore, we found that inhibition of HDAC3 in the presence of Kras pathway inhibitors dissociated Cxcl10 expression from that of immunosuppressive chemokines and that combination treatment of entinostat with trametinib enhanced T cell recruitment into lung tumors in vivo. Finally, we showed that T cells contribute to in vivo tumor growth control in the presence of entinostat and trametinib combination treatment. Together, our findings reveal that HDAC3 is a druggable endogenous repressor of T cell recruitment into Kras mutant lung tumors.",

Using a fleet turnover model and future electricity generation mix scenarios, we compare ambitious vehicle electrification to fleet renewal relying on newer internal combustion engine vehicles, without electric vehicles. The model includes vehicle-level pollutant emission factors and a reduced complexity air quality and valuation model and covers direct (tailpipe, brake wear, and tire wear) and indirect (production of electricity and liquid fuels) emissions of NO x , SO 2 , PM 2.5 , NH 3 , and VOCs, with a breakdown at the county level to identify geographical disparities in the distribution of health impacts. Short-term health benefits are mostly generated by reductions in NO x emissions from newer gasoline vehicles, while fleet electrification generates further benefits in the long term. The electricity mix plays a crucial role in the success of electrification policies. With continued grid decarbonization, electrification would reduce harmful air quality–related health impacts cumulatively by 84 to 188 billion USD over the study period, compared with fleet renewal without electric vehicles. In contrast, artificially freezing the 2022 grid would make electrification responsible for 32 to 71 billion USD additional health disbenefits compared with fleet renewal.

When water was not limiting, all genotypes cooled leaves 2 to 5 °C below air temperatures. Homeothermic cooling was disrupted for weeks following a 72-h reduction in soil water, resulting in leaf temperatures rising 3 °C above air temperature and 1.3 °C above leaf thresholds for physiological damage, despite the water stress having little effect on leaf water potentials. Tradeoffs between leaf thermal safety and hydraulic safety emerged but, regardless of water use strategy, all genotypes experienced significant leaf mortality following water stress. Genotypes from warmer climates showed greater leaf cooling and less leaf mortality after water stress in comparison with genotypes from cooler climates.

          "abstract": "Asymmetric seasonal warming trends are evident across terrestrial ecosystems, with winter temperatures rising more than summer ones. Yet, the impact of such asymmetric seasonal warming on soil microbial carbon metabolism and growth remains poorly understood. Using 18 O isotope labeling, we examined the effects of a decade-long experimental seasonal warming on microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and growth in alpine grassland ecosystems. Moreover, the quantitative stable isotope probing with 18 O-H 2 O was employed to evaluate taxon-specific bacterial growth in these ecosystems. Results show that symmetric year-round warming decreased microbial growth rate by 31% and CUE by 22%. Asymmetric winter warming resulted in a further decrease in microbial growth rate of 27% and microbial CUE of 59% compared to symmetric year-round warming. Long-term warming increased microbial carbon limitations, especially under asymmetric winter warming. Long-term warming suppressed the growth rates of most bacterial genera, with asymmetric winter warming having a stronger inhibition on the growth rates of specific genera (e.g., Gp10 , Actinomarinicola , Bosea , Acidibacter , and Gemmata ) compared to symmetric year-round warming. Bacterial growth was phylogenetically conserved, but this conservation diminished under warming conditions, primarily due to shifts in bacterial physiological states rather than the number of bacterial species and community composition. Overall, long-term warming escalated microbial carbon limitations, decreased microbial growth and CUE, with asymmetric winter warming having a more pronounced effect. Understanding these impacts is crucial for predicting soil carbon cycling as global warming progresses.",

The socioeconomic implications of declining ice include diminished access to ice-based cultural activities, safety concerns in traversing ice, changes in fisheries, increases in shoreline erosion, and declines in water storage. Longer ice-free seasons allow more time and capacity for water to warm, threatening water quality and biodiversity. Food webs likely will reorganize, with constrained availability of ice-associated and cold-water niches, and ice loss will affect the nature, magnitude, and timing of greenhouse gas emissions. Examining these rapidly emerging changes will generate more-complete models of lake dynamics, and transdisciplinary collaborations will facilitate translation to effective management and sustainability.",

Yet, other environmental changes may affect the geographical distribution of species in unexpected ways. Here, we quantify multidecadal shifts in the distribution of European forest plants and link these shifts to key drivers of forest biodiversity change: climate change, atmospheric deposition (nitrogen and sulfur), and forest canopy dynamics. Surprisingly, westward distribution shifts were 2.6 times more likely than northward ones. Not climate change, but nitrogen-mediated colonization events, possibly facilitated by the recovery from past acidifying deposition, best explain westward movements. Biodiversity redistribution patterns appear complex and are more likely driven by the interplay among several environmental changes than due to the exclusive effects of climate change alone.",

The transformation is prenyl conjugate addition to cyclic β-ketoesters promoted by a readily accessible chiral copper catalyst and involving an easy-to-prepare and isolable organoborate reagent. Reactions reach completion in just a few minutes at room temperature. The importance of this advance is highlighted by the enantioselective preparation of intermediates previously used to generate racemic PPAPs.

However, catalytic stereocontrol over such reactions has not previously been accomplished. We show here that strong and confined acids catalyze highly enantioselective fragmentations of a variety of cyclopropanes into the corresponding alkenes, expanding the boundaries of catalytic selective alkane activation.

Striking a blow against this precedent, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts indicated that Chevron was “fundamentally misguided” and that only the nation’s courts have the prerogative to interpret the laws they administer. Judges across the United States now anticipate an onslaught of litigation seeking to overturn federal regulatory actions, and many of these lawsuits will turn on scientific evidence that guided those actions. Instead of deferring to the scientific and technical expertise of federal agencies, courts must now independently review the scientific record behind a challenged regulation for its persuasiveness, along with scientific findings produced by the litigating parties. It’s too early to fully unpack the impact of overturning Chevron , but the scientific community must step forward to support the crafting of clear and evidence-informed legislation, and the use of scientific evidence in the courts.",

Using topological analysis and genetic perturbations, we found that embryos progressively changed their cellular connectivity to a preferred topology, which could be predicted by a physical model in which actomyosin contractility and noise facilitate topological transitions, lowering surface energy. This mechanism favored regular embryo packing and promoted a higher number of inner cells in the 16-cell embryo. Synchronized division reduced embryo packing and generated substantially more misallocated cells and fewer inner-cell–mass cells.

Despite many studies of specific host-pathogen systems, a unifying framework for predicting the outcomes of interactions among pathogens has remained elusive. We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains.",

Our findings highlight that twisting 2D bilayers is a versatile strategy for tailoring local electric polar vortices.",

          "abstract": "Variables related to socioeconomic status (SES), including income, ethnicity, and education, shape contact structures and affect the spread of infectious diseases. However, these factors are often overlooked in epidemic models, which typically stratify social contacts by age and interaction contexts. Here, we introduce and study generalized contact matrices that stratify contacts across multiple dimensions. We demonstrate a lower-bound theorem proving that disregarding additional dimensions, besides age and context, might lead to an underestimation of the basic reproductive number. By using SES variables in both synthetic and empirical data, we illustrate how generalized contact matrices enhance epidemic models, capturing variations in behaviors such as heterogeneous levels of adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions among demographic groups. Moreover, we highlight the importance of integrating SES traits into epidemic models, as neglecting them might lead to substantial misrepresentation of epidemic outcomes and dynamics. Our research contributes to the efforts aiming at incorporating socioeconomic and other dimensions into epidemic modeling.",

Federal assistance programs exist, but allocations across states have been nearly static since 1984, while the distribution of energy poverty is dynamic in location and time. We implement a LASSO-based machine learning approach using sociodemographic and geographical information to estimate energy burden in each US census tract for 2015 and 2020. We then compare the allocation to states from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to an optimized allocation. We allocate funds to the most burdened households, providing them with enough assistance to reduce their energy expenditures so that their household energy burden is equal to a new maximum allowable energy burden. This markedly shifts funds from the northern cold-weather states to the southern warm-weather states.",

          "abstract": "A central barrier to effective governance and accountability in fisheries is the limited transparency of corporate ownership. Transshipment—the transfer of catches, fuel, parts, or crew between fishing and cargo vessels known as reefers—is often criticized for its opacity and poor governance. Better insight into the beneficial ownership of vessels involved in transshipment and their operational patterns could lead to more effective management. Our study presents a publicly accessible database of reefers’ owners, operators, and flags. We identified 569 individual reefers and found that Russian and Chinese owners control 26 and 20% of the global reefer fleet, respectively. Results also show that 65% of all reefer vessels fly the flags of Russia, Panama, or China. This high level of consolidation suggests considerable leverage for enhancing transparency and governance. Our findings highlight the potential for reforming existing transshipment practices through collaboration among owners, flag states, fishery regulators, and scientists.",

In permafrost zones, this could be a positive feedback on climate change if it increases with warming, yet sulfide oxidation rates and their temperature response remain unknown over large spatial and temporal scales. We analyze a 60-year sulfate concentration dataset from catchments across the Mackenzie River Basin. Sulfate fluxes increased by 45% in the mainstem with 2.3°C of warming, and the temperature sensitivity suggests that continental-scale CO 2 fluxes could double by 2100. The largest increases occur in catchments with geomorphic settings which act to rapidly expose rocks through physical weathering and thermokarst processes. Comparisons with a weathering model suggest that warming can increase reaction rates, and changes in the exposure of minerals with warming are also required. Future warming across vast Arctic landscapes could further increase sulfide oxidation rates and affect regional carbon cycle budgets.",

This innovative textile is primarily composed of textile fibers that are functionalized with thermochromic microcapsules encapsulated in graphene and barium sulfate coatings, which exhibit approximately 80% visible light optical modulation when integrated into the fabric. We demonstrate that garment and tent (3.5 m × 2.9 m × 1.3 m) fabricated from these textiles can achieve temperature-adaptive, all-weather thermal management, expanding the thermal comfort range by 8.5°C.

          "abstract": "El Niño typically induces cooling in the Southwest Pacific Ocean during austral summers, usually leading to decreased marine heatwave frequency and severity. However, the 2016 extreme El Niño unexpectedly coincided with the longest and most extensive marine heatwave ever recorded in the region. This heatwave, spanning over 1.7 million square kilometers, persisting for 24 days with a peak intensity of 1.5°C, resulted in massive coral bleaching and fish mortality. This exceptional warming resulted from anomalously strong shortwave radiation and reduced heat loss via latent heat fluxes, owing to low wind speed and increased air humidity. These anomalies are attributed to a rare combined event “Madden-Julian Oscillation and extreme El Niño.” Following 10 February, the rapid dissipation of this marine heatwave results from the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the South Pacific. The hazardous ecological impacts of this extreme event highlight the needs for improving our understanding of marine heatwave–driving mechanisms that may result in better seasonal predictions.",

          "abstract": "Calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling is fundamental to cellular processes in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. While the mechanisms underlying eukaryotic Ca 2+ transport are well documented, an understanding of prokaryotic transport remains nascent. LMCA1, a Ca 2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) from Listeria monocytogenes , has emerged as a prototype for elucidating structure and dynamics in prokaryotic Ca 2+ transport. Here, we used a multidisciplinary approach integrating kinetics, structure, and dynamics to unravel the intricacies of LMCA1 function. A cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a Ca 2+ -bound E1 state showed ion coordination by Asp 720 , Asn 716 , and Glu 292 . Time-resolved x-ray solution scattering experiments identified phosphorylation as the rate-determining step. A cryo-EM E2P state structure exhibited remarkable similarities to a SERCA1a E2-P* state, which highlights the essential role of the unique P-A domain interface in enhancing dephosphorylation rates and reconciles earlier proposed mechanisms. Our study underscores the distinctiveness between eukaryotic and prokaryotic Ca 2+ ATPase transport systems and positions LMCA1 as a promising drug target for developing antimicrobial strategies.",

          "abstract": "Efficient behavior requires the rapid attentional selection of task-relevant objects. Preparatory activity of target-selective neurons in visual cortex is thought to support attentional selection, guiding spatial attention and favoring processing of target-matching input. However, naturalistic searches are often guided by nontargets, including target-associated “anchor” objects. For instance, when looking for a pen, we may direct our attention to the office desk on which we expect to find it. Here, using fMRI and eye tracking in a context-guided search task, we tested whether preparatory activity in visual cortex reflected the target, the guiding anchor object, or both. Participants learned associations between targets and anchors, reversing across two scene contexts, before searching for these targets. Participants’ first fixations were reliably guided by the associated anchor. Preparatory activity in lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) represented the target-associated anchor rather than the target. These results shed light on the neural basis of context-guided search in structured environments.",

The analysis identified distinct gradient patterns in AD, aging, and other neurodegenerative conditions. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that inorganic ion transmembrane transport was the most significant term in normal aging, while chemical synaptic transmission is a common enrichment term across various neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the findings show that each disorder exhibits unique dysfunctional neurophysiological characteristics. These insights are pivotal for elucidating the distinct biological mechanisms underlying AD, thereby enhancing our understanding of its unique clinical phenotypes in contrast to normal aging and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

In untreated cells, miR-23b and miR-218 were up-regulated, which correlated with CTG repeat size, supporting that active MBNL1 protein repression synergizes with the sequestration by CUG expansions in DMPK . AntimiR treatment improved RNA toxicity readouts and corrected regulated exon inclusions and myoblast defects such as fusion index and myotube area across CTG expansions. Unexpectedly, the treatment also reduced DMPK transcripts and ribonuclear foci. A leading antimiR reversed 68% of dysregulated genes. This study highlights the potential of antimiRs to treat various DM1 forms across a range of repeat sizes and genetic backgrounds by mitigating MBNL1 sequestration and enhancing protein synthesis.",

Adeno-associated virus (AAV)–mediated delivery of a floxed nanobody-TRPV1 into the striatum of adenosine-2a receptor–Cre drivers resulted in motor freezing when placed in a magnetic resonance imaging machine or adjacent to a transcranial magnetic stimulation device. Functional imaging and fiber photometry confirmed activation in response to magnetic fields. Expression of the same construct in the striatum of wild-type mice along with a second injection of an AAVretro expressing Cre into the globus pallidus led to similar circuit specificity and motor responses. Last, a mutation was generated to gate chloride and inhibit neuronal activity. Expression of this variant in the subthalamic nucleus in PitX2-Cre parkinsonian mice resulted in reduced c-fos expression and motor rotational behavior. These data demonstrate that magnetogenetic constructs can bidirectionally regulate activity of specific neuronal circuits noninvasively in vivo using clinically available devices.",

Deciphering the complexity of the membrane-binding behavior of α-syn is crucial to understand its functions and the pathology of PD. Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that α-syn forms multimers on lipid membranes with huge intermultimer distances. The multimers are characterized by self-limiting growth, manifesting in concentration-dependent exchanges of monomers, which are fast at micromolar concentrations and almost stop at nanomolar concentrations. We further uncovered movement patterns of α-syn’s occasional trapping on membranes, which may be attributed to sparse lipid packing defects. Mutations such as E46K and E35K may disrupt the limit on the growth, resulting in larger multimers and accelerated amyloid fibril formation. This work emphasizes sophisticated regulation of α-syn multimerization on membranes as a critical underlying factor in the PD pathology.",

However, it is virtually unknown how multiple biotic and abiotic drivers, such as climate, grazing, and fire, interact to determine woody dominance across global drylands. We conducted a standardized field survey in 304 plots across 25 countries to assess how climatic features, soil properties, grazing, and fire affect woody dominance in dryland rangelands. Precipitation, temperature, and grazing were key determinants of tree and shrub dominance. The effects of grazing were determined not solely by grazing pressure but also by the dominant livestock species. Interactions between soil, climate, and grazing and differences in responses to these factors between trees and shrubs were key to understanding changes in woody dominance. Our findings suggest that projected changes in climate and grazing pressure may increase woody dominance in drylands, altering their structure and functioning.",

Here, we report that VGLL3 plays an important role in DNA damage response (DDR). VGLL3 can be recruited to damage sites in a PARylation-dependent manner. VGLL3 depletion impairs the accumulation of RNF8 and RAD51 at sites of DNA damage, leading to reduced homologous recombination efficiency and increased cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, VGLL3 can prevent CtIP from KLHL15-mediated ubiquitination and degradation through competitive binding with KLHL15 and, meanwhile, stabilize MDC1 by limiting TRIP12-MDC1 but promoting USP7-MDC1 associations for optimal RNF8 signaling initiation. Consistently, VGLL3 depletion delays tumor development and sensitizes the xenografts to etoposide treatment. Overall, our results reveal an unexpected role of VGLL3 in DDR, which is distinct from its transcriptional cofactor function and not conserved among VGLL family members.",

Here, we present high-resolution structures of native monomeric and dimeric RC-LH1 supercomplexes from Rhodobacter ( Rba. ) blasticus using cryo–electron microscopy. The RC-LH1 monomer is composed of an RC encircled by an open LH1 ring comprising 15 αβ heterodimers and a PufX transmembrane polypeptide. In the RC-LH1 dimer, two crossing PufX polypeptides mediate dimerization. Unlike Rhodabacter sphaeroides counterpart, Rba. blasticus RC-LH1 dimer has a less bent conformation, lacks the PufY subunit near the LH1 opening, and includes two extra LH1 αβ subunits, forming a more enclosed S-shaped LH1 ring. Spectroscopic assays reveal that these unique structural features are accompanied by changes in the kinetics of quinone/quinol trafficking between RC-LH1 and cytochrome bc 1 . Our findings reveal the assembly principles and structural variability of photosynthetic RC-LH1 supercomplexes, highlighting diverse strategies used by phototrophic bacteria to optimize light-harvesting and electron transfer in competitive environments.",

The resulting readout can be high fidelity and QND, but readout times are currently limited to the order of 50 nanoseconds due to the dispersive cross-Kerr of magnitude 10 megahertz. Here, we present a readout scheme that uses the quarton coupler to facilitate a large (greater than 200 megahertz) cross-Kerr between a transmon qubit and its readout resonator. Full master equation simulations of the coupled system show a 5-nanosecond readout time with greater than 99% readout fidelity and greater than 99.9% QND fidelity. The quartonic readout circuit is experimentally feasible and preserves the coherence properties of the qubit. Our work reveals a path for order of magnitude improvements of superconducting qubit readout by engineering nonlinear light-matter couplings in parameter regimes unreachable by existing designs.",

On the basis of spatial patterns, we predicted transitions in shell size and morphology, allele frequencies at positions throughout the genome, and chromosomal rearrangement frequencies.

Biological and transcriptomic approaches indicated that VRI-driven PD-L1 + neutrophils are endowed with potent regulatory functions and reduced classical antimicrobial properties, as compared to their PD-L1 − counterpart. VRI-induced regulatory PD-L1 + neutrophils were generated remotely in the bone marrow in an IFN-γ–dependent manner and were quickly mobilized into the inflamed lungs where they fulfilled their maturation. Neutrophil depletion and PD-L1 blockade during experimental VRI resulted in higher mortality, increased local inflammation, and reduced expression of resolving factors.

We find a gradual increase in human habitat preferences toward rough terrains until about 1.1 million years ago (Ma), followed by a 300 thousand-year-long contraction of the ecological niche. This period coincided with the Mid-Pleistocene Transition and previously hypothesized ancestral population bottlenecks. Our statistical analysis further reveals that from 0.8 Ma onward, the human niche expanded again, with human species (e.g., H. heidelbergensis , H. neanderthalensis , and H. sapiens ) adapting to rougher terrain, colder and drier conditions, and toward regions of higher ecological diversity.",

The role of volatiles in the mobilization of Au in the mantle is unclear because of the absence of direct geochemical evidence relating the mantle source of Au to Au mineralization in the overlying crust. This study uses lithium isotopes from a large suite of lamprophyres to characterize the mantle beneath the eastern North China Craton, which hosts giant Mesozoic gold deposits. Our results indicate a strong genetic link between carbonate metasomatism in the mantle and Au mineralization in the overlying crust.

          "abstract": "In practical sensing tasks, noise is usually regarded as an obstacle that degrades the sensitivity. Fortunately, stochastic resonance can counterintuitively harness noise to notably enhance the output signal-to-noise ratio in a nonlinear system. Although stochastic resonance has been extensively studied in various disciplines, its potential in realistic sensing tasks remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose and demonstrate a noise-enhanced microwave sensor using a thermal ensemble of interacting Rydberg atoms. Using the strong nonlinearity present in the Rydberg ensembles and leveraging stochastic noises in the system, we demonstrate the stochastic resonance driven by a weak microwave signal (from several microvolts per centimeter to millivolts per centimeter). A substantial enhancement in the detection is achieved, with a sensitivity surpassing that of a heterodyne atomic sensor by 6.6 decibels. Our results offer a promising platform for investigating stochastic resonance in practical sensing scenarios.",

          "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms responsible for the heightened reactivity of quiescent T cells in human early life remain largely elusive. Our previous research identified that quiescent adult naïve CD4 + T cells express LINE1 (long interspersed nuclear elements 1) spliced in previously unknown isoforms, and their down-regulation marks the transition to activation. Here, we unveil that neonatal naïve T cell quiescence is characterized by enhanced energy production and protein synthesis. This phenotype is associated with the absence of LINE1 expression attributed to tonic T cell receptor/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1)–mediated LINE1 splicing suppression. The absence of LINE1 expression primes these cells for rapid execution of the activation program by directly regulating protein synthesis. LINE1 expression progressively increases in childhood and adults, peaking in elderly individuals, and, by decreasing protein synthesis, contributes to immune senescence in aging. Our study proposes LINE1 as a critical player of human T cell function across the human life span.",

We present development and applicability of implantable/wearable strain gauges that integrate multiple ultrathin monocrystalline silicon–based sensors aligned with different directions, in stretchable formats for dynamically monitoring direction angle–sensitive strain. We experimentally and computationally establish operational principles, with theoretical systems that enable determination of intensities and direction of applied strains at an omnidirectional scale. Wearable evaluations range from cardiac pulse to intraocular pressure monitoring of eyeballs. The device can evaluate cardiac disorders of myocardial infarction and hypoxia of living rats and locate the pathological orientation associated with infarction, in designs with possibilities as biodegradable implants for stable operation.

PSDU, an intrinsically triboelectric negative material with alternating hard-soft segments and supramolecular bonds, imparts excellent compressibility, adhesion, and self-healing properties to the composite. Simultaneously, the incorporation of (DF-CBA) 2 CuCl 4 as functional fillers leverages the formation of a hydrogen bonding network to enhance charge transfer processes. These fillers facilitate charge accumulation through an electric poling process, resulting in a power output improvement that surpasses 1400 times higher than that of a dense PSDU-based GS-TENG. Tapping onto the versatile properties of porous poly(siloxane-diphenylglyoxime-urethane)-perovskite (PSDU-PK) GS-TENGs, applications such as hand gesture/food recognition and dual-mode sensing system have been demonstrated, suggesting their promising potential in wearable electronics and smart agriculture.",

Heat capacity data show that the spins in both compounds are dominantly Ising-like, even after being manipulated by high magnetic fields. On cooling below the Néel temperatures, a sharp field–induced transition in magnetization is observed for CaCoGe 2 O 6 , while multiple magnetization plateaus beneath the full saturation moment are spotted for CaCoSi 2 O 6 . Our analysis shows that these contrasting behaviors potentially arise from the different electron configurations of germanium and silicon, in which the 3d orbitals are filled in the former but empty in the latter, enabling electron hopping. Thus, silicate tetrahedra can aid the interchain superexchange pathway between cobalt(II) ion centers, while germanate ones tend to block it during magnetization.",

Here, we showed that chloride intracellular channel 5 (CLIC5) exerts a critical role in mediating myogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration. Deletion of CLIC5 in skeletal muscle leads to reduced muscle weight and decreases the number and differentiation potential of satellite cells. In vitro, CLIC5 consistently inhibits myoblast proliferation while promoting myotube formation. CLIC5 promotes myogenic differentiation by activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in a biglycan (BGN)–dependent manner. CLIC5 deletion impairs muscle regeneration. Paired box gene 7 (Pax7) expression and the activity of BGN-mediated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling are reduced in CLIC5-deficient mice. Conversely, increasing CLIC5 levels in skeletal muscles enhances muscle regeneration capacity. In conclusion, our findings underscore CLIC5 as a pivotal regulator of myogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration, functioning through interaction with BGN to activate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are key agents in distributing extratropical precipitation and transporting moisture poleward. Climate models forced by historical anthropogenic forcing suggest an increase in AR activity in the extratropics over the past four decades. However, reanalyses indicate a ~6° to 10° poleward shift of ARs during boreal winter in both hemispheres, featuring a rise along 50°N and 50°S and a decrease along 30°N and 30°S. Our analysis demonstrates that low-frequency sea surface temperature variability in the tropical eastern Pacific exhibits a cooling tendency since 2000 that plays a key role in driving this global AR shift, mostly over extratropical oceans, through a tropical-driven eddy-mean flow feedback. This mechanism also operates on interannual timescales, controlled by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and is less pronounced over the Southern Ocean due to weaker eddy activity during austral summer. These highlight the sensitivity of ARs to large-scale circulation changes driven by both internal variability and external forcing in current and upcoming decades.",

Deletion of p63 results in extensive neuroendocrine differentiation in the developing mouse esophagus and esophageal progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells.

We show that CED-9 or CED-4 mutations located in their CED-9–CED-4 binding regions reduce apoptosis without affecting the CED-9 anti-apoptotic function. These mutant CED-9 and CED-4 proteins are defective in a CED-9–CED-4 interaction in vitro and in vivo, revealing that the known CED-9–CED-4 interaction is required for the pro-apoptotic but not for the anti-apoptotic function of CED-9. The pro-apoptotic CED-9–CED-4 interaction occurs at mitochondria. In mammals, BCL-2 family members can activate APAF-1 via cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The conserved role of mitochondria in CED-9/BCL-2–dependent CED-4/APAF-1 activation is notable and suggests that understanding how CED-9 promotes apoptosis in C. elegans could inform the understanding of mammalian apoptosis and how disruptions of apoptosis promote certain human disorders.",

We showed that, in the endolymphatic sac, where fluid reabsorption occurs, SLC26A4 is localized along the apical microvilli of mitochondria-rich cells, in contact with the endolymph, and associated with clathrin-coated pits where μ2 and AP-2 are present. Based on SLC26A4 structure, the elements involved in SLC26A4-μ2 interaction were identified and validated experimentally, allowing modeling of this interaction at the atomic level. Pharmacological inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis led to an increased plasma membrane abundance of hemagglutinin-tagged SLC26A4 virally or endogenously expressed in mitochondria-rich cells.

Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is further associated with altered mitochondrial function and impaired endurance running capacity. ANP/GCA-deficient mice exhibit increased proton leak and reduced content of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins.

Here, we characterize the mass-independent Zn isotope compositions of meteorites from such planetesimals. We incorporate these results in mixing models that aim to reproduce Earth’s abundance and isotope compositions of Zn and other elements. Our results suggest that, while differentiated planetesimals supplied ~70% of Earth’s mass, they provided only ~10% of its Zn. The remaining Zn was supplied by primitive materials that did not experience melting and associated volatile loss. Combined with other findings, our results imply that an unmelted primitive material is likely required to establish the volatile budgets of the terrestrial planets.",

          "abstract": "mRNA neoantigen cancer vaccine inducing neoantigen-specific T cell responses holds great promise for cancer immunotherapy; however, its clinical translation remains challenging because of suboptimal neoantigen prediction accuracy and low delivery efficiency, which compromise the in vivo therapeutic efficacy. We present a lipopolyplex (LPP)–formulated mRNA cancer vaccine encoding tandem neoantigens as a cancer therapeutic regimen. The LPP-formulated mRNA vaccines elicited robust neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses in three syngeneic murine tumor models (CT26, MC38, and B16F10) to suppress tumor growth. Prophylactic cancer vaccine treatment completely prevented tumor development, and long-lasting memory T cells protected mice from tumor cell rechallenge. Combining the vaccine with immune checkpoint inhibitor further boosted the antitumor activity. Of note, LPP-based personalized cancer vaccine was administered in two cancer patients and induced meaningful neoantigen-specific T cell and clinical responses. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the LPP-based mRNA vaccine can elicit strong antitumor immune responses, and the results support further clinical evaluation of the therapeutic mRNA cancer vaccine.",
