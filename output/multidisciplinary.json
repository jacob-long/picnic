          "abstract": "Global warming intensifies wildfires and exacerbates greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions1. However, global projections remain incomplete, hindering effective policy interventions amid uncertain warming futures2. Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning framework to project global burned areas and wildfire emissions. This framework accounts for the impacts of future climate change on fire activity and quantifies associated premature deaths and radiative forcing from fire-induced particulate matter (PM2.5). Here we show that from 2010–2014 to 2095–2099, fire carbon emissions are projected to increase by 23% under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5. Increased fire-related aerosols reduce the 0.06 W m⁻² cooling effect north of 60°N. Projections show a surge in premature deaths from wildfire smoke, reaching 1.40 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.66–2.25) million annually during 2095–2099, roughly 6 times higher than current levels. Africa is projected to experience the greatest rise in fire-related deaths (11-fold), driven by emission changes and an aging population. Europe and the U.S. would experience a 1–2-fold increase under SSP2-4.5, linked to rising fire occurrences in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere. Overall, the health burden would become more evenly distributed across nations of differing development levels than present patterns, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts.",

          "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence enables productivity gains from delegating tasks to machines 1 , it may facilitate the delegation of unethical behaviour 2 . This risk is highly relevant amid the rapid rise of ‘agentic’ artificial intelligence systems 3,4 . Here we demonstrate this risk by having human principals instruct machine agents to perform tasks with incentives to cheat. Requests for cheating increased when principals could induce machine dishonesty without telling the machine precisely what to do, through supervised learning or high-level goal setting. These effects held whether delegation was voluntary or mandatory. We also examined delegation via natural language to large language models 5 . Although the cheating requests by principals were not always higher for machine agents than for human agents, compliance diverged sharply: machines were far more likely than human agents to carry out fully unethical instructions. This compliance could be curbed, but usually not eliminated, with the injection of prohibitive, task-specific guardrails. Our results highlight ethical risks in the context of increasingly accessible and powerful machine delegation, and suggest design and policy strategies to mitigate them.",

          "abstract": "Owing to increasing demand for low-cost energy storage with secure material supply chains, the battery community is approaching a pivotal shift beyond conventional lithium-ion (Li-ion) towards next-generation cells. Technologies that include alkali-metal anodes, solid electrolytes and earth-abundant materials such as sodium (Na) and sulfur (S) are reaching commercialization in cells. The abuse tolerance and thermal runaway hazards of such technologies diverge from conventional Li-ion cells. Consequently, designing safe batteries with next-generation materials requires a holistic approach to characterize cells and to understand their responses to abuse conditions from the beginning to the end of life. Here we provide a Perspective on how the safety and abuse tolerance of cells are likely to change for up-and-coming technologies; challenges and opportunities for reimagining safe cell and battery designs; gaps in our knowledge; capabilities for understanding the hazards of thermal runaway and how to address them; how standard abuse tests may need to adapt to new challenges; and how research needs to support affected professionals, from pack designers to first responders, to manage hazards and ensure safe roll-out of next-generation cells into applications like electric vehicles (EVs). Finally, given the large number of next-generation technologies being explored, we encourage giving priority to safety-focused research in proportion to the rate of manufacturing scale-up of each specific technology.",

          "abstract": "Autonomic dysreflexia is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by episodes of uncontrolled hypertension that occur in response to sensory stimuli after spinal cord injury (SCI)1. The fragmented understanding of the mechanisms underlying autonomic dysreflexia hampers the development of therapeutic strategies to manage this condition, leaving people with SCI at daily risk of heart attack and stroke2,3,4,5. Here we expose the neuronal architecture that develops after SCI and causes autonomic dysreflexia. In parallel, we uncover a competing, yet overlapping neuronal architecture activated by epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord that safely regulates blood pressure after SCI. The discovery that these adversarial neuronal architectures converge onto a single neuronal subpopulation provided a blueprint for the design of a mechanism-based intervention that reversed autonomic dysreflexia in mice, rats and humans with SCI. These results establish a path towards essential pivotal device clinical trials that will establish the safety and efficacy of epidural electrical stimulation for the effective treatment of autonomic dysreflexia in people with SCI.",

          "abstract": "Most neurodevelopmental disorders with single gene diagnoses act via haploinsufficiency, in which only one of the two gene copies is functional1. SCN2A haploinsufficiency is one of the most frequent causes of neurodevelopmental disorder, often presenting with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability and, in a subset of children, refractory epilepsy2. Here, using SCN2A haploinsufficiency as a proof-of-concept, we show that upregulation of the existing functional gene copy through CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can rescue neurological-associated phenotypes in Scn2a haploinsufficient mice. We first show that restoring Scn2a expression in adolescent heterozygous Scn2a conditional knock-in mice rescues electrophysiological deficits associated with Scn2a haploinsufficiency (Scn2a+/−). Next, using an adeno-associated virus CRISPRa-based treatment in adolescent mice, we show that we can correct intrinsic and synaptic deficits in neocortical pyramidal cells, a major cell type that contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders and seizure aetiology in SCN2A haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, we find that systemic delivery of CRISPRa protects Scn2a+/− mice against chemoconvulsant-induced seizures. Finally, we also show that adeno-associated virus CRISPRa treatment rescues excitability in SCN2A haploinsufficient human stem-cell-derived neurons. Our results showcase the potential of this therapeutic approach to rescue SCN2A haploinsufficiency and demonstrates that rescue even at adolescent stages can ameliorate neurodevelopmental phenotypes.",

          "abstract": "Accretion disks in strong gravity ubiquitously produce winds, seen as blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray binaries (black holes and neutron stars) 1–4 and supermassive black holes 5 . Some of the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from systems in which radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the inner disk ( L ≳ L Edd ). These winds should be extremely fast and carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies 6 . Here we show the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint, although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual ( L ≳ L Edd ). However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disk than with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner disk. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for the ultrafast ( v ~ 0.3 c ) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a supermassive black hole at a similarly high Eddington ratio 7 .",

          "abstract": "Coral reefs form complex physical structures that can help to mitigate coastal flooding risk 1,2 . This function will be reduced by sea-level rise (SLR) and impaired reef growth caused by climate change and local anthropogenic stressors 3 . Water depths above reef surfaces are projected to increase as a result, but the magnitudes and timescales of this increase are poorly constrained, which limits modelling of coastal vulnerability 4,5 . Here we analyse fossil reef deposits to constrain links between reef ecology and growth potential across more than 400 tropical western Atlantic sites, and assess the magnitudes of resultant above-reef increases in water depth through to 2100 under various shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) emission scenarios. Our analysis predicts that more than 70% of tropical western Atlantic reefs will transition into net erosional states by 2040, but that if warming exceeds 2 °C (SSP2–4.5 and higher), nearly all reefs (at least 99%) will be eroding by 2100. The divergent trajectories of reef growth and SLR will thus magnify the effects of SLR; increases in water depth of around 0.3–0.5 m above the present are projected under all warming scenarios by 2060, but depth increases of 0.7–1.2 m are predicted by 2100 under scenarios in which warming surpasses 2 °C. This would increase the risk of flooding along vulnerable reef-fronted coasts and modify nearshore hydrodynamics and ecosystems. Reef restoration offers one pathway back to higher reef growth 6,7 , but would dampen the effects of SLR in 2100 only by around 0.3–0.4 m, and only when combined with aggressive climate mitigation.",

          "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates growth factor (GF) and nutrient signals to stimulate anabolic processes connected to cell growth and inhibit catabolic processes such as autophagy 1,2 . GF signalling through the tuberous sclerosis complex regulates the lysosomally localized small GTPase RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) 3 . Direct binding of RHEB–GTP to the mTOR kinase subunit of mTORC1 allosterically activates the kinase by inducing a large-scale conformational change 4 . Here we reconstituted mTORC1 activation on membranes by RHEB, RAGs and Ragulator. Cryo-electron microscopy showed that RAPTOR and mTOR interact directly with the membrane. Full engagement of the membrane anchors is required for optimal alignment of the catalytic residues in the mTOR kinase active site. Converging signals from GFs and nutrients drive mTORC1 recruitment to and activation on lysosomal membrane in a four-step process, consisting of (1) RAG–Ragulator-driven recruitment to within ~100 Å of the lysosomal membrane; (2) RHEB-driven recruitment to within ~40 Å; (3) RAPTOR–membrane engagement and intermediate enzyme activation; and (4) mTOR–membrane engagement and full enzyme activation. RHEB and membrane engagement combined leads to full catalytic activation and structurally explains GF and nutrient signal integration at the lysosome.",

          "abstract": "General reasoning represents a long-standing and formidable challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Recent breakthroughs, exemplified by large language models (LLMs) 1,2 and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting 3 , have achieved considerable success on foundational reasoning tasks. However, this success is heavily contingent on extensive human-annotated demonstrations and the capabilities of models are still insufficient for more complex problems. Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labelled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained through conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations. Moreover, the emergent reasoning patterns exhibited by these large-scale models can be systematically used to guide and enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.",

          "abstract": "Directly visualizing vibrational anisotropy in individual phonon modes is essential for understanding a wide range of intriguing optical, thermal and elastic phenomena in materials1,2,3,4,5. Although conventional optical and diffraction techniques have been used to estimate vibrational anisotropies, they fall short in achieving the spatial and energy resolution necessary to provide detailed information4,5,6,7. Here, we introduce a new form of momentum-selective electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which enables the element-resolved imaging of frequency- and symmetry-dependent vibrational anisotropies with atomic resolution. Vibrational anisotropies manifest in different norms of orthogonal atomic displacements, known as thermal ellipsoids. Using the centrosymmetric strontium titanate as a model system, we observed two distinct types of oxygen vibrations with contrasting anisotropies: oblate thermal ellipsoids below 60 meV and prolate ones above 60 meV. In non-centrosymmetric barium titanate, our approach can detect subtle distortions of the oxygen octahedra by observing the unexpected modulation of q-selective signals between apical and equatorial oxygen sites near 55 meV, which originates from reduced crystal symmetry and may also be linked to ferroelectric polarization. These observations are quantitatively supported by theoretical modelling, which demonstrates the reliability of our approach. The measured frequency-dependent vibrational anisotropies shed new light on the dielectric and thermal behaviours governed by acoustic and optical phonons. The ability to visualize phonon eigenvectors at specific crystallographic sites with unprecedented spatial and energy resolution opens new avenues for exploring dielectric, optical, thermal and superconducting properties.",

          "abstract": "Wildfire activity has increased in the US and is projected to accelerate under future climate change 1–3. However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire activity, smoke, and health outcomes remains highly uncertain, due to the difficulty of modeling the causal chain from climate to wildfire to air pollution and health. Here we quantify the mortality burden in the US due to wildfire smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5) under climate change. We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link climate to wildfire smoke PM2.5, and empirically estimate smoke PM2.5-mortality relationships using data on all recorded deaths in the US. We project that smoke PM2.5 could result in 71,420 excess deaths (95% CI: 34,930 - 98,430) per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) – a 73% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 average annual excess deaths from smoke. Cumulative excess deaths from smoke PM2.5 could reach 1.9 million between 2026-2055. We find evidence for mortality impacts of smoke PM2.5 that last up to three years after exposure. When monetized, climate-driven smoke deaths result in economic damages that exceed existing estimates of climate-driven damages from all other causes combined in the US 4,5. Our research suggests that the health impacts of climate-driven wildfire smoke could be among the most important and costly consequences of a warming climate in the US.",

          "abstract": "Neutrophils, the most abundant and biotoxic immune cells, extrude nuclear DNA into the extracellular space to maintain homeostasis. Termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), these protein-modified and decondensed extracellular DNA scaffolds control infection and are involved in coagulation, autoimmunity and cancer 1,2 . Here we show how myeloperoxidase (MPO), a highly expressed neutrophil protein, disassembles nucleosomes, thereby facilitating NET formation, yet also binds stably to NETs extracellularly. We describe how the oligomeric status of MPO governs both outcomes. MPO dimers interact with nucleosomal DNA using one protomer and concurrently dock into the nucleosome acidic patch with the other protomer. As a consequence, dimeric MPO displaces DNA from the core complex, culminating in nucleosome disassembly. On the other hand, MPO monomers stably interact with the nucleosome acidic patch without making concomitant DNA contacts, explaining how monomeric MPO binds to and licences NETs to confer hypohalous acid production in the extracellular space 3 . Our data demonstrate that the binding of MPO to chromatin is governed by specific molecular interactions that transform chromatin into a non-replicative, non-encoding state that offers new biological functions in a cell-free manner. We propose that MPO is, to our knowledge, the first member of a class of proteins that convert chromatin into an immune effector.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual decision-making is thought to be mediated by neuronal networks with attractor dynamics 1,2 . However, the dynamics underlying the complex neuronal responses during decision-making remain unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons, combined with an unsupervised, deep-learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in the rat frontal cortex and striatum as animals accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes: an initial phase dominated by sensory inputs, followed by a phase dominated by autonomous dynamics, with the flow direction (that is, neural mode) largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that this transition marks the moment of decision commitment, that is, the time when the animal makes up its mind. To test this, we developed a simplified model of the dynamics to estimate a putative neurally inferred time of commitment (nTc) for each trial. This model captures diverse single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping 3,4 . The estimated nTc values were not time locked to stimulus or response timing but instead varied broadly across trials. If nTc marks commitment, evidence before this point should affect the decision, whereas evidence afterwards should not. Behavioural analysis aligned to nTc confirmed this prediction. Our findings show that decision commitment involves a rapid, coordinated transition in dynamical regime and neural mode and suggest that nTc offers a useful neural marker for studying rapid changes in internal brain state.",

Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than two hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits.

          "abstract": "Delta-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), or GluDs, are members of the iGluR ligand-gated ion channel family, yet their function remains enigmatic1. Although GluDs are widely expressed in the brain, play key roles in synaptic organization, and harbor disease-linked mutations, whether they retain iGluR-like channel function is debated as currents have not been directly observed2,3. Here, we define GluDs as ligand-gated ion channels that are tightly regulated in cellular contexts by purifying human GluD2 (hGluD2) and directly characterizing its structure and function using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bilayer recordings. We show that hGluD2 is activated by D-serine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), with augmented activation at physiological temperatures. We reveal that hGluD2 contains an ion channel directly coupled to clamshell-like ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which are coordinated by the amino terminal domain (ATD) above the ion channel. Ligand binding triggers channel opening via an asymmetric mechanism, and a cerebellar ataxia point mutation in the LBD rearranges the receptor architecture and induces leak currents. Our findings demonstrate that GluDs possess the intrinsic biophysical properties of ligand-gated ion channels, reconciling prior conflicting observations to establish a framework for understanding their cellular regulation and for developing therapies targeting GluD2.",

          "abstract": "Neuroendocrine and tuft cells are rare chemosensory epithelial lineages defined by the expression of ASCL1 and POU2F3 transcription factors, respectively. Neuroendocrine cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC), frequently display tuft-like subsets, a feature linked to poor patient outcomes1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The mechanisms driving neuroendocrine–tuft tumour heterogeneity and the origins of tuft-like cancers are unknown. Using multiple genetically engineered animal models of SCLC, we demonstrate that a basal cell of origin (but not the accepted neuroendocrine origin) generates neuroendocrine–tuft-like tumours that highly recapitulate human SCLC. Single-cell clonal analyses of basal-derived SCLC further uncovered unexpected transcriptional states, including an Atoh1+ state, and lineage trajectories underlying neuroendocrine–tuft plasticity. Uniquely in basal cells, the introduction of genetic alterations enriched in human tuft-like SCLC, including high MYC, PTEN loss and ASCL1 suppression, cooperates to promote tuft-like tumours. Transcriptomics of 944 human SCLCs revealed a basal-like subset and a tuft–ionocyte-like state that altogether demonstrate notable conservation between cancer states and normal basal cell injury response mechanisms10,11,12,13. Together, these data indicate that the basal cell is a probable origin for SCLC and other neuroendocrine–tuft cancers that can explain neuroendocrine–tuft heterogeneity, offering new insights for targeting lineage plasticity.",

NeuroWorm effectively records high-quality spatio-temporal signals in situ while steerably advancing within the brain or on the muscle as needed.

Implanted in muscle through a tiny incision, NeuroWorm provides stable bioelectrical monitoring in rats for more than 43 weeks. Even after 54 weeks of implantation in muscle, fibroblast encapsulation around the fibre remains negligible.

          "abstract": "The fin-to-limb transition in vertebrate evolution has been central to the study of how development underlies evolutionary change. In this context, the functional analysis of Hox gene regulation to infer evolutionary trajectories has been critical to explain the origin of new features. In tetrapods, the transcription of Hoxd genes in developing digits depends on a set of enhancers forming a large regulatory landscape1,2. The presence of a syntenic counterpart in zebrafish, which lacks digits, suggests deep homology3 or shared developmental foundations underlying distal fin and limbs. However, how this regulatory program evolved has remained unresolved. We genetically evaluated the function of the zebrafish Hoxd regulatory landscapes by comparatively assessing the effects of their full deletions. We show that, unlike in mice, deletion of these regions in fish does not disrupt hoxd gene transcription during distal fin development. By contrast, we found that this deficiency leads to the loss of expression within the cloaca, a structure related by ancestry to the mammalian urogenital sinus, and that distal hox13 genes are essential for correct cloacal formation. Because Hoxd gene regulation in the mouse urogenital sinus relies on enhancers located in this same chromatin domain that controls digit development, we propose that the current regulatory landscape active in distal limbs was co-opted as a whole in tetrapods from a pre-existing cloacal regulatory machinery.",

However, UCP1−/− mice are not obese1,2,3,4,5, consistent with the existence of alternative mechanisms of thermogenesis6,7,8. Here we describe a UCP1-independent mechanism of thermogenesis involving ATP-consuming metabolism of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFA) in peroxisomes. These fatty acids are synthesized by fatty acid synthase using precursors derived from catabolism of branched-chain amino acids9 and our results indicate that β-oxidation of mmBCFAs is mediated by the peroxisomal protein acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). Notably, cold exposure upregulated proteins involved in both biosynthesis and β-oxidation of mmBCFA in thermogenic fat. Acute thermogenic stimuli promoted translocation of fatty acid synthase to peroxisomes. Brown-adipose-tissue-specific fatty acid synthase knockout decreased cold tolerance. Adipose-specific ACOX2 knockout also impaired cold tolerance and promoted diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Conversely, ACOX2 overexpression in adipose tissue enhanced thermogenesis independently of UCP1 and improved metabolic homeostasis. Using a peroxisome-localized temperature sensor named Pexo-TEMP, we found that ACOX2-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation raised intracellular temperature in brown adipocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized role for peroxisomes in adipose tissue thermogenesis characterized by an mmBCFA synthesis and catabolism cycle.",

Z. rinpoche exhibits a well-developed frontoparietal dome and preserves the clade’s first record of manual elements and gastroliths. Phylogenetic analysis recovered Z. rinpoche as one of the earliest diverging pachycephalosaurians, pushing back fossil evidence of the frontoparietal dome by at least 14 Myr and clarifying macroevolutionary trends in its assembly. We found that the earliest stage of dome evolution occurred by means of a frontal-first developmental pattern with retention of open supratemporal fenestra, mirroring proposed ontogenetic trajectories in some Late Cretaceous taxa. Finally, intraskeletal osteohistology of the frontoparietal dome and hindlimb demonstrate decoupling of sociosexual and somatic maturity in early pachycephalosaurians, with advanced dome development preceding terminal body size.",

However, modern-day processors often cannot meet the restrained power and time budgets of edge systems because of intrinsic limitations imposed by their architecture (von Neumann bottleneck) or domain conversions (analogue to digital and time to frequency).

Second, an analogue in-memory computing chip5, consisting of memristive crossbar arrays, implements a compact neural network trained on the extracted features for classification. With submillisecond latency, reconfigurable-nonlinear-processing-unit-based feature extraction consuming roughly 300 nJ per inference, and the analogue in-memory computing-based classifier using around 78 µJ (with potential for roughly 10 µJ)6, our findings offer a promising avenue for advancing the compactness, efficiency and performance of heterogeneous smart edge processors through in materia computing hardware.",

Here, using calcium imaging in behaving Drosophila, we find that the axons of position-encoding leg proprioceptors are active across a range of behaviours, whereas the axons of movement-encoding leg proprioceptors are suppressed during walking and grooming. Using connectomics7,8,9, we identify a specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic presynaptic inhibition to the axons of movement-encoding proprioceptors. These interneurons receive input from parallel excitatory and inhibitory descending pathways that are positioned to drive the interneurons in a context-specific and leg-specific manner. Calcium imaging from both the interneurons and their descending inputs confirms that their activity is correlated with self-generated but not passive leg movements. Taken together, our findings reveal a neural circuit that suppresses specific proprioceptive feedback signals during self-generated movements.",

This effectively minimizes substrate surface exposure caused by wiggling of loose SAMs under thermal stress, preventing perovskite decomposition. This enables a certified PCE of 26.92% to be achieved for the best-performing cell, which also possesses excellent thermal stability with negligible decay under maximum-power-point tracking at 85 °C for 1,000 h. It also retains >98% of initial PCE after 700 repetitive thermal cycles between −40 °C and 85 °C, representing the state of the art of the field. This work offers an in-depth understanding of SAM degradation mechanisms to guide the design of a more robust buried interface for SAM-based devices adopting high-roughness substrates to realize highly efficient and durable perovskite solar cells.",

          "abstract": "The regulation of metabolic processes by proteins is fundamental to biology and yet is incompletely understood. Here we develop a mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach that leverages genetic diversity to nominate functional relationships between 285 metabolites and 11,868 proteins in living tissues. This method recapitulates protein–metabolite functional relationships mediated by direct physical interactions and local metabolic pathway regulation while nominating 3,542 previously undescribed relationships. With this foundation, we identify a mechanism of regulation over liver cysteine utilization and cholesterol handling, regulated by the poorly characterized protein LRRC58. We show that LRRC58 is the substrate adaptor of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates proteasomal degradation of CDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme of the catabolic shunt of cysteine to taurine1. Cysteine abundance regulates LRRC58-mediated CDO1 degradation, and depletion of LRRC58 is sufficient to stabilize CDO1 to drive consumption of cysteine to produce taurine. Taurine has a central role in cholesterol handling, promoting its excretion from the liver2, and we show that depletion of LRRC58 in hepatocytes increases cysteine flux to taurine and lowers hepatic cholesterol in mice. Uncovering the mechanism of LRRC58 control over cysteine catabolism exemplifies the utility of covariation MS to identify modes of protein regulation of metabolic processes.",

These edited 3′ new strands must displace competing 5′ strands to install edits, yet a bias towards retaining the competing 5′ strands hinders efficiency and can cause indel errors2. Here we discover that nicked end degradation, consistent with competing 5′ strand destabilization, can be promoted by Cas9-nickase mutations that relax nick positioning. We exploit this mechanism to engineer efficient prime editors with strikingly low indel errors. Combining this error-suppressing strategy with the latest efficiency-boosting architecture, we design a next-generation prime editor (vPE). Compared with previous editors, vPE features comparable efficiency yet up to 60-fold lower indel errors, enabling edit:indel ratios as high as 543:1.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records 4,5 . However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify the GPT 6 (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual’s past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models. Delphi-2M’s generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods 7 provide insights into Delphi-2M’s predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.",

Furthermore, the symptoms endorsed by young individuals are not fully explained by the extent of p-tau deposition 2 , severely hampering therapeutic interventions. Here we observed a multicellular response prior to the onset of CTE p-tau pathology that correlates with number of years of RHI exposure in young people (less than 51 years of age) with RHI exposure, the majority of whom played American football. Leveraging single-nucleus RNA sequencing of tissue from 8 control individuals, 9 RHI-exposed individuals and 11 individuals with low-stage CTE, we identify SPP1-expressing inflammatory microglia, angiogenic and inflamed endothelial cells, astrocytosis and altered synaptic gene expression in those exposed to RHI. We also observe a significant loss of cortical sulcus layer 2/3 neurons independent of p-tau pathology. Finally, we identify TGFβ1 as a potential signal that mediates microglia–endothelial cell cross talk. These results provide robust evidence that multiple years of RHI is sufficient to induce lasting cellular alterations that may underlie p-tau deposition and help explain the early pathogenesis in young former contact sport athletes. Furthermore, these data identify specific cellular responses to RHI that may direct future identification of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CTE.",

          "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for multimodal sensing and stimulation bioelectronic fibres for both research and clinical applications1,2. However, existing fibres suffer from high rigidity, low component layout precision, limited functionality and low density of active components. These limitations arise from the challenge of integrating many components into one-dimensional fibre devices, especially owing to the incompatibility of conventional microfabrication methods (for example, photolithography) with curved, thin and long fibre structures2. As a result, limited applications have been demonstrated so far. Here we use ‘spiral transformation’ to convert two-dimensional thin films containing microfabricated devices into one-dimensional soft fibres. This approach allows for the fabrication of high-density multimodal soft bioelectronic fibres, termed Spiral-NeuroString (S-NeuroString), while enabling precise control on the longitudinal, angular and radial positioning and distribution of the functional components. Taking advantage of the biocompatibility of our soft fibres with the dynamic and soft gastrointestinal system, we proceed to show the feasibility of our S-NeuroString for post-operative multimodal continuous motility mapping and tissue stimulation in awake pigs. We further demonstrate multi-channel single-unit electrical recording in mouse brain for up to 4 months, and a fabrication capability to produce 1,280 channels within a 230-μm-diameter soft fibre. Our soft bioelectronic fibres offer a powerful platform for minimally invasive implantable electronics, where diverse sensing and stimulation functionalities can be effectively integrated.",

          "title": "Equity in science is a beautiful lie — and I’m done pretending",
          "authors": "Dolors Armenteras",
          "abstract": "For years, I thought equity in science was possible. I believed it in meeting rooms to which I had been invited to speak, until I realized that I had not been invited to shape the discussion. I believed it in working groups that applauded diversity, until I noticed that my ideas only landed when echoed by someone else. And international organizations regularly sought me out, but it was hardly ever for a leadership role.\n\nAcademia needs a more honest, scientific approach to DEI\n\nIn 2021, I proposed ways to build healthier collaborations between countries with unequal resources: currently they benefit mainly the wealthier partner (D. Armenteras Nature Ecol. Evol. 5, 1193–1194; 2021). The article resonated with scientists across Latin America, Africa and Asia, who thanked me for exposing these skewed partnerships. But what also stood out to me was that none of the committees and organizations that had so often solicited my input got in touch.\n\nMany scholars from historically overexploited countries (often referred to as the global south) expected that exposing the problem would trigger change. Four years on, I see it clearly: the scientific system was never designed for equity. For people whose privilege stems from geography, institutional reputation and inherited networks, the system works perfectly the way it is. That’s why institutions focus only on improved access and optics. They look like they are changing, but the same people retain control.\n\nI still believe in science and in justice. But I no longer think that power can be shared equitably in the current system. In 2023, I was invited to contribute to a global map charting the use of controlled fire in ecosystem management. This meant condensing 25 years of research into a 40-minute questionnaire for a chance to win an artwork made by an Indigenous artisan and, perhaps, be invited to a workshop. It was written in Spanish and framed as inclusive. But it exposed how the system works: extract specialist knowledge at low cost and mostly without giving credit, repackage it into global claims and call it collaboration. I declined.\n\nDecolonize scientific institutions, don’t just diversify them\n\nIn 2025, I was invited to contribute to a project developing a global standard for gathering fire data. It used all the right words: co-production, inclusion and diversity. It cited my work. But I wasn’t being invited to co-design or co-lead the project, or even as a peer — only to “contribute regional input”. Time commitment: less than 20 hours. Visibility: none. Influence: symbolic. When I declined, explaining my reasons, I received two replies. One was defensive: “You know I’d never reach out with a symbolic request,” sidestepping my actual concerns. The other was polite, affirming the project’s importance but failing to address its asymmetry. Neither academic offered co-authorship or fresh terms. Nothing changed. These weren’t bad people. That’s the hardest part. They were playing by the rules of a system that rewards extractive collaboration — especially when it’s wrapped in the language of equity.\n\nThe system doesn’t thrive just because of the people at the top. It holds strong because many scientists in less-privileged positions want to be included. Sometimes we are chosen — not for our ideas or our leadership, but because we tick the right box. A woman from Latin America, visible and qualified. But we don’t become a peer. Our work is not cited as often. Our students become local guides instead of co-authors. Grants continue to be written without us.",

          "authors": "Esme Hedley",
          "abstract": "Working scientist profiles\n\nThis article is part of an occasional series in which Nature profiles scientists with unusual career histories or outside interests.\n\nIn 2019, Jenna Keindel came across a research paper that would change her life. The Canadian, then aged 37, found it through a Facebook group of people affected by limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness. Keindel was diagnosed with it when she was 16.\n\nThe paper suggested that another condition, called anti-HMGCR myopathy, a rare autoimmune disease that causes severe muscle weakness, shared some symptoms with specific subtypes of LGMD and was sometimes misdiagnosed as LGMD.\n\nKeindel was struck by the similarity with her own symptoms. And because the paper was open access, and so free to view, she could read and digest the findings before sharing them with her clinical team at the Ottawa Hospital. They agreed it was worth testing her for the condition.\n\n“Doctors and specialists can’t possibly read every article that’s being published,” she says. “So, as a patient with a rare disease, you kind of have to also be a catalyst and a helper for finding those resources.”\n\nSix weeks later, her physician confirmed that Keindel did, in fact, have anti-HMGCR myopathy, not LGMD. Since receiving treatment to fit the new diagnosis, Keindel’s muscle deterioration has slowed considerably. She married in 2023 and now lives and works in Shawville, a small rural community in the northwest of Canada.\n\nKelly Cobey, who directs the Metaresearch and Open Science Program at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, celebrates Keindel’s story as evidence of the benefits of making research data accessible to everyone. Cobey’s work focuses on implementing open-science practices, promoting responsible research assessment and monitoring the quality of research reporting.\n\nJenna Keindel’s clinical experiences demonstrated to Cobey the life-changing benefits of sharing research with people receiving care.Credit: Jenna Keindel\n\nLast year, Cobey’s work in this area, and her focus on advancing awareness of predatory journals, earned her the John Maddox Prize in the early-career category.\n\nA joint initiative between Nature and Sense about Science, a London-based charity, the award celebrates scientists who speak up for sound science in the face of challenges, and who inspire others to do the same.\n\n“We just cannot underestimate how empowering people with information can literally change the course of their life,” says Cobey of Keindel’s story. “Patients need to be active in decision-making and how they’re cared for.\"\n\nCobey had first heard Keindel’s story in 2019, when she worked as an investigator and publications officer at the Ottawa Hospital’s Centre for Journalology. There, she spent half her time researching open science, research integrity, transparent research reporting and predatory journals, and the other half providing training and outreach on these topics.\n\nThe leader of the hospital’s patient–partner network, a link person between individuals interested in taking part in research and researchers looking to engage such people, suggested that Keindel’s story would be a good fit for a series of webinars and blogs that Cobey was developing. The aim of these was to demonstrate the benefits, some of them life-changing, of making information available to people receiving care.\n\nCobey dates her interest in open science and research assessment back to 2011, when she was studying for her PhD in social psychology at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. That year Diederik Stapel, an acclaimed social psychologist at nearby Tilburg University, was suspended on suspicion of widespread data fabrication. In November of the following year, a report concluded that he had fabricated and manipulated data across 55 publications over 15 years, including in chapters of his PhD dissertation at the University of Amsterdam in 1997. “When this happened, some of my early-career colleagues, postdocs or assistant professors retracted major chunks of their CVs as a consequence,” Cobey recalls.\n\nThe experience made her question how something like this could persist for so long. “I’m not saying open science will get at every sort of bad actor, but it was like, how was there no record, how was there no openness?”\n\nWorking Scientist career profiles\n\nCobey decided to look for roles that would allow her to question how research is carried out, incentivized and rewarded. When, in 2015, she came across the role of investigator and publications officer at the journalology centre in Ottawa, she had never heard of meta-research, the practice of applying rigorous methods and analysis to the methods and procedures of research itself.\n\nThe idea that the role would provide evidence to improve the research ecosystem appealed to her. She was also excited by the chance to teach about how to do and report research — topics that, typically, are not formally taught.\n\nClinical epidemiologist David Moher, who leads the journalology centre, remembers being struck by Cobey’s focus on the importance of evidence when he interviewed her for the role. Six years later, she was appointed to her current position, in which a typical day involves offering informal support to institutions. This includes guiding them on providing feedback on proposed federal-policy consultations on open science.\n\nIn her research programme, Cobey conducts a lot of audits on science policy. “In Canada, we have some really excellent science policies around open science, but if they’re not audited or monitored in any way, then what gets measured gets done and what doesn’t get measured doesn’t get done,” she says. For example, a 2023 paper1 that she co-authored found that only 3% of clinical trials in Canada met all three of the federally mandated criteria: prospective registration, reporting in the registry and publishing findings.\n\nCobey also produces tools for researchers wanting to implement open-science practices, such as creating data-management-plan templates for study designs commonly used in biomedicine.\n\nA predatory problem\n\nCobey’s interest in publishing practices led her to investigate the phenomenon of predatory journals: those that accept articles for publication without performing promised quality checks, such as peer review, and often solicit articles aggressively and indiscriminately.\n\nIn 2019, she co-authored a Comment article2 for Nature revealing that elite institutions, including Ivy League universities in the United States, were knowingly publishing in predatory journals. It called for researchers to be trained in how to select appropriate journals when submitting their work, and for a declaration on CVs that the individuals’ publication lists are free of predatory publications.\n\nCobey thinks that the discussion around predatory journals has opened the door to making the practices of all journals more transparent. Partnering with the Public Knowledge Project at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, Cobey has developed a tool called the Publication Facts Label (PFL). Inspired by food products’ nutrition labels, it lists information about the journal in which an article is published, including its acceptance rate; and about the article itself, such as the number of reviewers, details of the research funders and whether the data are available. The aim is to show whether journals or articles published using Open Journal Systems, a publication software platform used by more than 50,000 journals worldwide, adhere to scholarly standards..\n\nResearch assessment toolkit\n\nKarim Khan, a physician and medical researcher based in Vancouver, leads the Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the country’s federal medical research funder. Khan says that Cobey makes organizations take a hard look at their clinical-practice guidelines and their consensus statements.\n\nSupporting her Maddox Prize entry, he commended her for “seeing what needs to be done before others do”, highlighting her efforts to define predatory journals and predatory conferences and provide ways for people to avoid them. The two worked together in 2019 with 41 other leading scholars and publishers who met in Ottawa to establish an agreed definition of predatory publishing. Khan says it was impressive to watch Kelly create a mutually supportive group culture and praises her remarkable knowledge of the literature. “It’s like having studied all of Shakespeare versus someone who knows that one of the stories had something to do with star-crossed lovers,” he says.\n\nCobey’s Maddox Prize win also acknowledged her work with the Declaration On Research Assessment (DORA), a global initiative that aims to change the evaluation of scientific research outputs. It began in 2012, when a group of editors and publishers met to develop a set of recommendations to improve scholarly-research assessment. The idea was to encourage funders and institutions to move away from using publication in highly cited journals as the ultimate deciding factor of research merit. Now known as the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment, DORA covers all scholarly disciplines and has been signed by more than 26,000 individuals and organizations across 166 countries.\n\nCobey joined the DORA advisory board in 2020, becoming co-chair three years later. In this role, she speaks regularly with policymakers at all levels to change how research is assessed. One of her outputs as co-chair is a guide to responsible research. It outlines steps for individuals to design and execute a responsible research-assessment strategy at their institutions.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Material deep inside Earth — thousands of kilometres down, near the planet’s core — has undergone a mysterious shift.\n\nIs Earth’s core leaking? Volcanic rocks provide strongest evidence yet\n\nAlthough the change occurred nearly two decades ago, between 2006 and 2008, scientists discovered it only recently, while analysing data from a pair of satellites that once measured variations in Earth’s gravity. The team thinks it might have happened when the structure of some of the rocks near the boundary between Earth’s core and mantle transformed, becoming denser.\n\nThe discovery — which was possible because the geological shift altered the planet’s gravitational field — is an astonishing testament to Earth-orbiting satellites. “It’s a really new observation,” says Isabelle Panet, a geophysicist at Paris City University. Panet, lead author Charlotte Gaugne Gouranton — also at that university — and their colleagues reported the findings last month in Geophysical Research Letters1.\n\nThe work will help scientists to better understand the connections between Earth’s various layers, from its brittle crust to its solid mantle to its partially liquid core, Panet says. Connections between these layers affect where large earthquakes originate, how the planet maintains a magnetic field that protects it from solar storms and more.\n\nFollow the leader\n\nPanet’s team made the discovery using data from a pair of US–German satellites known as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which orbited Earth between 2002 and 2017. The satellites flew one in front of the other, separated by a set distance.\n\nStrange blobs in Earth’s mantle are relics of a massive collision\n\nWhen they encountered a gravitational tug from, for example, the hulking mass of a mountain range, the lead satellite would pull temporarily away from the trailing satellite — a change that could be measured and correlated with the gravitational shift. Researchers have most often used changes in the distance between the GRACE satellites to measure the displacement of masses of water on Earth, such as when groundwater disappears beneath croplands or when glaciers melt.\n\nBut, as it turns out, GRACE was also able to spot much deeper changes in Earth’s mass. Panet had already used it to look for mass changes happening hundreds of kilometres below the surface ahead of large earthquakes2,3. Then she realized she could probe even farther down, to a depth of nearly 2,900 kilometres, to the complex boundary between the core and mantle.\n\nPanet and her colleagues spotted a strange signal in the GRACE data that peaked around 2007 and was centred off Africa’s Atlantic coast. They were unable to attribute it to water shifting around on Earth’s surface, however. “So at least partially, there has to be an origin within the solid Earth,” Panet says. “It has to come from very deep.”\n\nIn the deep",

Scientists at all career levels will be eligible, and projects will ideally span at least two disciplines. “We want to support cross-fertilization of science based on intellectual curiosity, rather than chasing the latest use for artificial intelligence,” she explains.\n\nFriesen and her colleagues are betting that the public will step up to support scientists’ blue-sky endeavours. “In our first request for proposals, we plan to ask: why are you excited about this work?” says Venkatesh Srinivas, deputy project director and a Google software engineer in Seattle, Washington. The non-profit organization has so far raised $20,000, says Srinivas, and secured a pledge to match the next $20,000 in donations, which can be made at science-foundation.org.\n\nSolicitations will focus on five disciplines: maths, physics, chemistry, biology and Earth sciences. “We’re not considering biomedical, engineering or computer science, because we feel those already have plenty of investment,” says Friesen. Once Friesen and her team have proposals in hand, they will assemble a review panel of specialists and at least one member of the public. The foundation aims to release its first request for proposals this year. “We need to give young scientists hope that people continue to believe in the value of science,” she adds.\n\nA lost generation?\n\nSince US President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has blocked or cancelled billions of dollars of funding through the US National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and other sources.\n\nYet even before that, public funding for basic science in the United States had stagnated over the past decade. The federal government’s share of basic-research funding decreased from 52% to 41% between 2012 and 2023, according to a July report by the National Science Board.\n\n“We’re not just doing this in response to the Trump-administration cuts or to replace the National Science Foundation,” says Friesen. “We are trying to build something that that we think will have value in addition to government-funded science.”\n\nSuch support could help to ameliorate one growing concern — a lost generation of scientists. “We are facing a workforce time bomb,” warns David Stern, Science Foundation board member and former president of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “If we don’t have science practitioners, we don’t have science,” he says.\n\nExploratory research is particularly imperilled now, Stern and others argue. “We need alternative models to support basic science,” says Jonathan Eisen, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Davis. “I favour this [the Science Foundation] serving as a model for people to experiment with.”\n\nBut, Stern acknowledges, “Let’s not kid ourselves that this is a solution; it won’t replace federal funding. But it is a need that was already there, and more important now.”\n\nPublic support is strong",

          "abstract": "Some researchers are developing biological systems that create mirror-image versions of DNA and other molecules crucial to life.Credit: Ting Zhu Lab\n\nThis week in Manchester, UK, scientists will be deliberating whether to restrict research that could eventually enable ‘mirror life’ — synthetic cells built from molecules that are mirror images of those found in the natural world.\n\nMirror-image molecules separated using workhorse of chemistry\n\nOver the past year, many scientists have voiced concerns over experiments that might lead to the creation of such cells, suggesting that they would pose an enormous risk to human health and the environment. “Pretty much everybody agrees” that mirror-image cells would be “a bad thing”, says John Glass, a synthetic biologist at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, California.\n\nBut there are disagreements about where to draw lines to limit research on mirror-image biology, given the potential benefits of such studies.\n\nMany of the molecules in our bodies are ‘chiral’ — that is, they take one of two mirror-image forms, like right-handed and left-handed gloves. Proteins are built from left-handed amino acids, and DNA twists like a right-handed screw, for example.\n\nStudying mirror-image versions of such molecules could help to unpick how this handedness emerged, some researchers say. And because the body’s enzymes and immune system might not as readily recognize right-handed amino acids or left-handed DNA, such molecules could resist degradation — making them useful as therapeutic drugs. This approach has already shown clinical success: in 2017, for example, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a small peptide containing mirror-image amino acids, called etelcalcetide, to treat people with chronic kidney disease.\n\nRare ‘ambidextrous’ protein breaks rules of handedness\n\nBut this ability to evade degradation could be a double-edged sword. If an entire mirror-image cell were ever made, it might proliferate uncontrollably in the body or spread unchecked through the environment, some researchers say.\n\nThis is why scientists are meeting in Manchester this week.\n\nBiochemist Sven Klussmann, founder and chief executive of Aptarion Biotech in Berlin, which is developing short strands of therapeutic mirror-image RNA, agrees that it’s reasonable to consider the potential risks of mirror life. “But we should not panic yet, and we should not restrict research too early,” he says.\n\nYet Kate Adamala, a synthetic biologist at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, cautions that the risks of research that could enable mirror life would outweigh any potential benefits. “There is no benefit of mirror biology that couldn’t be achieved other ways with normal biology,” she says. “That’s not a risk I think we should be taking.”\n\nRed lines\n\nGlass says that several teams, including his own, are close to, for the first time, creating a synthetic cell from molecules with the chirality seen in nature. But nobody is currently building a mirror-image cell, and it could take decades to do so, if it’s even possible at all. Still, researchers are making progress on technologies that could underpin that work; and in 2019, before the potential risks were realized, the US National Science Foundation awarded research grants to ‘boot up’ a mirror cell. Adamala, one of the grant recipients, says her growing concerns convinced her and her colleagues to drop the work.\n\nMirror-image enzyme copies looking-glass DNA\n\nGlass and Adamala were among 38 scientists who laid out their worries in Science in December 20241. Since then, the non-profit Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund has sponsored a series of meetings to develop recommendations to avert the threat mirror life could pose. In June, researchers who gathered in Paris called on funders not to support work on a mirror-image cell, and suggested restricting areas of research that could facilitate mirror life. In Manchester this week — and at a US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine meeting at the end of this month — researchers will pick up the conversation and deliberate over where to draw those red lines.",

The company says that the system has more than 50 million registered users, and more than 200,000 physicians using the platform.\n\nWhich diseases will you have in 20 years? This AI accurately predicts your risks\n\nFangzhou, based in Guangdong, is a pioneer in AI in health care, says Marina Zhang, a science-policy researcher at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia, who focuses on innovation in China.\n\nChina, like many nations, has a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory disorders and diabetes1. Estimates suggest that some 180 million older adults in the country live with chronic diseases2, and that number is likely to increase as the population ages. There’s hope that AI could help to reduce the strain that managing large populations of people with chronic diseases puts on health-care systems.\n\nGovernment support\n\nIn 2017, the Chinese government announced its intention to become the world leader in AI by 2030. Since then, hundreds of the country’s universities have begun offering undergraduate degrees in AI. Government investment, in the form of scholarships and research grants, has encouraged the forging of partnerships between industry and academia. Last month, the Chinese government announced an ‘AI Plus’ initiative, which is intended to promote the integration of AI in a range of fields. Support for AI technology has also included tax cuts and subsidies.\n\nZhang says Fangzhou has also tapped into an under-explored market. “One critical problem driving China’s mounting economic pressures is lack of consumption. Many reasons can explain why this is the case, but fundamentally, people who have money actually do not want to spend,” she says. Older, wealthier populations are particularly unwilling to spend, she says. Combining health care, the care of older people and AI could encourage this demographic to spend on health management and lifestyle interventions.\n\nAI in health care",

          "abstract": "A time crystal as seen under a microscope.Credit: Ref. 1\n\nA time crystal is a form of matter that shows continuous, repeating patterns over time, much like how atoms in a normal crystal repeat in space. Examples once existed in only complex, quantum matter, but now physicists have found a way to make a time crystal that can be seen, under certain conditions, with the naked eye.\n\nThe feat, accomplished by physicists at the University of Colorado Boulder, and published in Nature Materials on 4 September1, involved liquid crystals — bar-shaped molecules with properties between those of a liquid and those of a solid. Simply by shining a light on the liquid crystals, the team created ripples of twisting molecules through them. The ripples kept moving for hours, undulating with a distinct beat, even when the researchers changed the conditions. The rhythm was also out of sync with any incoming force — fulfilling the two defining criteria for a time crystal.\n\nAlthough some of this behaviour of liquid crystals was already known, no one had previously considered whether it could be harnessed to make a time crystal, says Young-Ki Kim, a materials scientist at the Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea.\n\nThe macroscopic scale of the time crystal — at millimetres to centimetres across — creates opportunities “to provide deeper understanding” of the phenomena, he says. The distinctive patterns in the crystals could also allow them to be used in anti-counterfeit devices, say the authors.\n\nImpossible machines\n\nNobel-prizewinning physicist Frank Wilczek first proposed the idea of a time crystal in 2012. Wilczek’s version was almost like a perpetual-motion machine; something that cycled endlessly while in its natural resting state. A team later published a paper that mathematically proved this concept was impossible2, but researchers soon found that other kinds of time crystal were possible. Ordered time crystals could exist, for example, in bizarre systems that were perpetually in flux, rather than at rest.\n\nTime crystals have since been made in a variety of ways, using interacting nanoscale defects in diamonds, trapped ions and simulated on Google’s Sycamore quantum computer. But most examples have been at the microscopic scale.\n\nThe latest system involves shining a light, even that from a normal light bulb, on a liquid-crystal film trapped between two glass plates. When the light hits photosensitive dye molecules on the glass plates, they switch their orientation, which triggers molecules in the liquid crystal to begin twisting.\n\nIntermolecular forces between rod-like liquid crystal molecules mean that they usually all point in the same direction. If some begin twisting, this sets off a domino effect: the molecules reorient themselves in a complex interaction that moves across the sample like a Mexican wave.\n\nFrom this soup of molecules arise stable twisted formations that behave like particles. These particles interact with each other to create observable ripples. “We were surprised and excited to see that such time-crystalline order can be readily observed in soft matter systems,” says Ivan Smalyukh, a physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who led the work.\n\nTo observe the molecular dance in detail, the authors looked at the time-crystal system using a kind of microscope that transmits only polarized light. The amount of light that passes through depends on a molecule’s alignment, revealing the time crystal’s ripples as a series of dark and bright stripes.",

          "abstract": "A Noble Madness: The Dark Side of Collecting from Antiquity to Now James Delbourgo Riverrun (2025)\n\nThe Galileo Museum, a science museum in Florence, Italy, has astronomer Galileo Galilei’s preserved middle finger on display. Encased in a gilded glass egg, the digit is exhibited “as if it were the relic of a Christian saint”, remarks historian of science James Delbourgo in his illuminating and entertaining history of the ‘dark side’ of humanity’s obsession with collecting things. The finger was severed from Galileo’s corpse in 1737 — long after his death in 1642 — along with an index finger also displayed at the museum and a vertebra held at the University of Padua, Italy. According to a witness to the dismemberment, the Italian nobleman who took the fingers desired them “because Galileo wrote so many beautiful things with them”.\n\nHow a self-taught biologist transformed nature writing — and inspired Darwin\n\nIt is an unusual story, but perhaps not entirely atypical. As Delbourgo shows in A Noble Madness, a large driver of the desire to collect artefacts is curiosity — whether scientific, historical, religious or otherwise. But perhaps even more often, it is obsession. Delbourgo focuses on this compulsive aspect, and the varying ways in which society has regarded people who are driven to amass stuff. He offers “a grand portrait gallery that charts the changing image of the collector from the ancient looter and medieval idolater to the decadent of the fin de siècle and the modern-day hoarder”.\n\nDark desires\n\nA compelling example of such obsession is Henry Wellcome. He is known today through the biomedical research-funding organization Wellcome, and the Wellcome Collection museum and library in London. Born in 1853 to an itinerant missionary father in a log cabin in Wisconsin, by his death in 1936, Wellcome had become a highly successful pharmaceutical entrepreneur in the United Kingdom. He also owned a grotesquely overwhelming collection of objects, the variety and sheer number of which the world had never seen — mainly because few were on display.\n\n‘Natural history museums can save the world’: anti-colonialism, conservation and climate change\n\nWellcome obtained many of these objects through highly dubious means, notes Frances Larson in her disturbing 2009 history of his collection, An Infinity of Things. In 1912, for example, Wellcome’s right-hand man wrote to an agent in India, a doctor, that the country must be “completely ransacked as far as we possibly can for literature and other objects of interest connected with ancient medicine”. The agent duly did his best — but there is little evidence that Wellcome ever studied or ‘enjoyed’ what had been collected. He was always too busy acquiring new things, right up to his death. His obsession was rooted in possession.\n\nThe Wellcome Museum deliberately avoids displaying information about its founder, notes Delbourgo. He regards this stance as “myopic: the Wellcome’s abdication of its duty to educate visitors about its origins denies the public the chance to make up its own mind about its past”.\n\nThe British Museum, just down the road in London, is less coy about the man who provided its founding collection in 1753. Physician and naturalist Hans Sloane — the subject of Delbourgo’s 2017 book Collecting the World — was an avid collector of curiosities and animal and plant specimens. His motivations were multifarious. He collected manuscripts from astrologers and alchemists to document their ascientific convictions as “disorders of the mind”, delusions that he felt might be cured by bloodletting, his specialism. But when it came to collecting from the natural world, he was explicit about a financial incentive: to “figure out what species were good for, what they cost, and how to make money off them”, in Delbourgo’s words. To his critics, Sloane was an “ignorant arriviste”. Today, his financial links to the slave plantations in Jamaica that part-funded his collecting are openly acknowledged in an exhibit showing a bust of Sloane.\n\nGalileo’s elegantly preserved middle finger.Credit: Eric Vandeville/Gamma-Rapho/Getty",

Acutis was known for his use of digital media to promote Catholic devotion.Credit: Vatican Pool/Getty\n\nThe canonization of Carlo Acutis by Pope Leo XIV on 7 September was a sign of how the Catholic Church is increasingly embracing the digital world.\n\nAcutis, who died of leukaemia in 2006 at the age of 15, was known for using the Internet to further his faith, maintaining a website documenting Eucharistic miracles recognized by the church. It earned him the moniker God’s influencer.\n\nBut the work of a saintly teenage tech-wizard is just one way that new technologies are finding their way into religious practice: artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and ritual-performing robots are already taking on spiritual roles that are conventionally filled by humans. Worshippers have mixed feelings about them.\n\nAI Jesus\n\nThe rise of generative AI chatbots has led to the creation of tools that purport to offer people the opportunity to speak directly with religious figures, such as Jesus Christ. Anné Verhoef, a philosopher at North-West University in Potchefstroom, South Africa, analysed five popular Jesus chatbots by asking them questions about themselves and basic theology, and found some worrying trends.\n\nNone of the chatbots he studied were developed or endorsed by any church, and it is not clear what religious texts they were trained on. Four of the five were created and managed by private companies — with names such as Catloaf Software, a mobile-development company in Los Angeles, California — whereas the fifth is run by a Christian group in South Korea with no official connection to any church. All are free but supported by advertisements, with one offering an ad-free premium subscription.\n\n“It’s difficult to know if they are really about religion, or just milking money from the faithful,” says Verhoef.\n\nAnother concern is that most religious AI bots claim to be Jesus rather than an AI impersonation developed by humans. “If this is really about Christianity and being sincere about faith, they should not be pretending to be God,” he says. “The possibility for abuse is huge” — if people believe a chatbot is actually divine, they might be convinced to follow its instructions for nefarious purposes, Verhoef says.\n\nJesus chatbots are growing in popularity and have hundreds of thousands of users, Verhoef estimates. The AI technology is also being used in more official capacities. Last year, as part of an experiment with a local university, a Catholic church in Lucerne, Switzerland, installed a Jesus chatbot in its confessional booth that could answer theological questions and offer spiritual guidance. In 2023, hundreds of Lutherans in Nuremberg, Germany, attended a church service generated and delivered by chatbot ChatGPT. Both were reasonably well-received, says Verhoef. Many of the functions of a priest could be replaced by AI chatbots in the future, but he sees a problem with it.\n\n“If a sermon is prepared by an AI not a person, how seriously can we take that as a spiritually inspired sermon or thought?” asks Verhoef.\n\nReligious acceptance\n\nChristianity isn’t the only religion using generative AI tools. There are also Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish and Islamic chatbots, but some religions are more open to adopting new technologies than are others, and for different uses. Hinduism and Buddhism, for example, already incorporate some simple forms of automation in their rituals. Some temples in India have begun using robotic arms to perform the Hindu aarti ritual, in which a devotee offers an oil lamp to the deity to symbolize the removal of darkness, and one temple in Kerala has an AI-driven animatronic elephant.",

          "abstract": "Merck and AstraZeneca have paused research and development investments in the United Kingdom.Credit: Matthew Horwood/Getty\n\nA series of statements and funding cuts suggest that the UK pharmaceutical industry and research sector is losing its competitive edge.\n\nFirst, Merck said on 10 September that it was scrapping a plan to develop a £1-billion (US$1.4-billion) research facility in London and cancelling ongoing projects at the nearby Francis Crick Institute. Two days later, it emerged that AstraZeneca was rethinking a £200-million expansion of its research site in Cambridge — a decision that follows a similar U-turn from the company earlier this year on a promised £450-million expansion to its vaccine manufacturing facility in Liverpool. And statements from the US firm Lilly and French company Sanofi have raised doubts about their continued investment in the United Kingdom, too.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giants have blamed a reduction in government investment in the sector on their decisions to de-invest in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). At an emergency parliamentary committee in the Houses of Parliament on 16 September, Ben Lucas, managing director of MSD (Merck) UK and Ireland said that “the UK commercial operating environment does need to be addressed”, adding that the UK government should “reflect on how we can avoid these things moving forward”.\n\nBut the real “crunch issue” is the amount of money the country’s National Health Service (NHS) spends on medicines, according to the UK minister for science, research and innovation, Patrick Vallance, who has also been head of R&D at the drug company GlaxoSmithKline and is a former government chief scientific adviser.\n\nVallance told the committee that Britain would need to spend billions of pounds more on new drugs to convince the pharmaceutical industry to invest in its life-science sector. Britain’s spending on pharmaceuticals has declined from 15% a decade ago to 9% today — a decline that would cost about £12 billion more each year to reverse.\n\n“I think industry has been clear that the ongoing investment in the UK is dependent on having a commercial environment which is conducive to them doing business,” said Vallance.\n\nUK pharma exodus?\n\nThe recent announcements come as talks between the UK government and the pharmaceutical industry remain deadlocked over drug-price reform. Under the current scheme, pharma companies agree to repay a proportion of their revenues from drug sales to the NHS. But the industry was unhappy when the government increased the rebate last year from 15% to 24%.\n\nAlthough many attending the committee meeting drew explicit links between the negotiations and the reversal of planned industry investment by pharmaceutical companies, independent specialists are more sceptical, saying it’s really about underlying weaknesses in the global pharmaceutical sector.\n\nRichard Sullivan, a cancer-policy researcher at King’s College London, says that the companies are using arguments over drug pricing as an excuse for cuts they needed to make anyway. “This is nothing to do with domestic policy towards our pharmaceutical industry,” he says. “This is smoke and mirrors.”\n\nThe ‘most favoured nation’ policy of US President Donald Trump, which aims to reduce the high prices the United States pays for medicines relative to other countries, combined with the rise in high-quality cheaper drugs from China and a reduction in health financing in emerging markets have left Merck and other pharmaceutical companies struggling with an obsolete business model and looking to save money, he says.\n\n“They don’t want to say they are withdrawing because the competition in China’s too fierce and because they made an upfront strategic mistake of putting it here in the first place,” he adds.\n\nWhat does it mean for other countries?\n\nAlexander Schuhmacher, a pharma R&D researcher at Technical University Ingolstadt in Germany says it’s not clear yet how the situation in the United Kingdom might influence or apply to other countries.\n\n“Pharma companies operate under long research and production life cycles,” he points out. That means their strategic decisions are typically the result of long-term planning, not short-term reactions to political changes or even to major geopolitical shifts, he says.",

Can artificial intelligence (AI) help to forecast hurricanes and other extreme weather events? And has the world already blown past the most ambitious target of the Paris climate agreement — to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels?\n\nThe need to address these and other questions is spurring researchers to tap into vast, unused repositories of handwritten weather records that span more than two centuries. These troves of valuable — but in some cases unreadable — data are now becoming easier to access with new, more sophisticated machine-learning tools.\n\n“All meteorological services around the world have some basement where they store data from the 1800s that has not been digitized,” says Marlies van der Schee, a climate scientist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt. “For many institutes, they don’t even know what is in their archives.”\n\nSearching for data\n\nIn the quest to gather missing climate data, climate scientist Derrick Muheki has travelled farther than most. To access the meteorological archives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) — which contain records from when the DRC became independent in 1960, collected from 37 weather stations across the country — Muheki had to fly from Kinshasa to Kisangani in the country’s north, travel along the Congo River by boat and then take an unpaved road on a motorcycle to reach the Yangambi branch of the DRC’s National Institute for Agronomic Research (INERA). There, he spent two months earlier this year scanning thousands of pages of weather logs.\n\nMuheki had to bring enough batteries to power his digital camera for the duration of the trip, as the remote branch of INERA is not hooked up to the DRC’s national grid. He learnt some of the Bantu language Lingala so that he could communicate with other INERA staff members. He says it helped that many of the words were similar to the language he grew up speaking in his native Uganda.\n\nWeather reports from old ships’ logs — such as this eighteenth century document from British vessel HMS Dolphin — contain data that can be fed into climate models. Credit: The History Collection via Alamy\n\nAfter returning to his research group at the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels, Muheki began to extract data from the more than 9,000 scanned images using a machine-learning tool he designed for reading the weather logs, called MeteoSaver1.\n\nIn initial tests, MeteoSaver could transcribe the data with only 75% accuracy, but further refinements and training of its neural network — on the basis of an open-source package for recognition of handwritten text, called Tesseract — have pushed that to 90%, he says.\n\nThe resulting data will provide crucial information about how conditions have changed over time in the world’s second largest rainforest. Climate scientist Wim Thiery, Muheki’s adviser at the Vrije Universiteit, says that because of a lack of information about past temperatures, the forested heart of the African continent had a major data gap in the 2021 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assessed the severity and speed of global warming in various parts of the world. He hopes that efforts such as Muheki’s will help to rectify this.\n\nForgotten figures\n\nMuheki’s logistical hurdles were unusual, but the DRC is not the only country that is yet to fully digitize its weather records.\n\n“There are paper records still languishing in archives all over the world,” says Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, UK. These include millions of unused rainfall observations in the UK’s National Meteorological Archive.\n\nIs it too late to keep global warming below 1.5 °C? The challenge in 7 charts\n\nHawkins has managed several projects that relied on citizen scientists to manually transcribe climate records. Ten years ago or so, machine-learning tools just weren’t up to the task, he says. The hardest part for AI tools is not reading handwritten text, but recognizing the tabular structure in the documents. “When I and colleagues started trying [AI] tools out, they just would not work on tabulated numbers,” says Hawkins. “It wasn’t in their training.” Much of Muheki’s work consisted of developing custom algorithms for doing just that. Now, the tools are finally becoming good enough to match human performance, says Hawkins, who is a co-author on the research paper that describes MeteoSaver.\n\nSimilar efforts by other teams are showing that machine learning could drastically speed up the rate of recovery of historic records. “It’s really a revolution in our ability to rescue data,” says Thiery.",

          "authors": "Chris Simms",
          "abstract": "Arnav Kapur, chief executive of AlterEgo, demonstrates the wearable device.Credit: AlterEgo\n\nA wearable device could make saying ‘Alexa, what time is it?’ aloud a thing of the past. An artificial intelligence (AI) neural interface called AlterEgo promises to allow users to silently communicate just by internally articulating words. Sitting over the ear, the device facilitates daily life through live communication with the Internet. “It gives you the power of telepathy but only for the thoughts you want to share,” says AlterEgo’s chief executive Arnav Kapur, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Kapur unveiled the device on 8 September.\n\nThe device does not read brain activity, but predicts what a wearer wants to say from signals in muscles used to speak, then sends audio information back into their ear. The researchers say that their non-invasive technology could help people with motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) who have trouble speaking, but also want to make the devices commercially available for general use.\n\nIn a promotional video on the AlterEgo website, Kapur says that “it’s a revolutionary breakthrough with the potential to change the way we interact with our technology, with one another and with the world around us”.\n\n“The big question about this is ‘how likely is that potential to be realized?,” says Howard Chizeck, an electrical and computer engineer at the University of Washington in Seattle. Chizeck says that the technology seems workable and is less of a privacy risk than listening devices such as Amazon’s Alexa are, but isn’t convinced that the device will catch on for commercial use.\n\nSilent speech\n\nBrain–computer interfaces, like those from Elon Musk’s firm Neuralink, typically require electrodes to be surgically implanted in the brain to record and send signals between neurons. AlterEgo works differently. “It’s using neuromuscular signals that would be used in speech, so it’s like you’re silently talking,” says Chizeck. “The clear advantage is that it’s not invasive. You don’t have to put chips in the brain with risks of infection and surgery.”\n\nThe device works by measuring speech patterns in the face. When you speak aloud, silently mouth words or internally articulate words, the information is sent from the brain to the cranial nerves and articulatory muscles, even if the face doesn’t move. AlterEgo detects electrical signals in the articulatory muscles, then sends the data to AI models that predict what the wearer wants to say. The device then communicates audio back to the wearer through bone-conduction headphones.\n\nThe AlterEgo project was born in the MIT Media Lab in 2018. The original headset was large and ungainly, says Kapur, and its detection of speech was held back by the capabilities of artificial intelligence at the time. It had limited functionality but could search the web and “order pizzas”. Since then, the engineers have incorporated newer AI capabilities of speech recognition, and the project was spun off as a for-profit company earlier this year.\n\nClinical applications\n\nThe technology is aimed at people with conditions that make speech difficult, such as dysarthria or dysphonia. AlterEgo is currently being trialled in people with ALS or MS.\n\n“A totally locked-in patient wouldn’t be able to use the system, but a lot of the time there is a sparse signal that exists in the speech system and that sparse signal is enough,” says Kapur. “We started with early-stage ALS patients, but we also were able to use the system with late-stage ALS patients.” The trials are ongoing, and results are yet to be published.\n\nChizeck thinks that it might be usable for people with early-stage ALS, but because the disease is progressive, gradually reducing people’s ability to move the muscles required for speech, it might be less useful in later stages of the condition. “The device is only as good as the person’s control of speech,” he says.",

          "abstract": "From his spot in the long, orderly queue, Balch could just see the clinic’s large double doors. One intermittently swung open as nurses and national guardsmen ushered the next person inside. The queue then inched forwards like a great lazy caterpillar to fill the vacated space.\n\nBalch kneaded his pockets. His turn would be a while yet.\n\nIdentical clinics had opened worldwide following the parasite’s discovery — a biological oddity colloquially dubbed ‘the Slug’, despite news broadcasts highlighting the microscopic creature’s dendritic shape. How they’d spotted the Slug, Balch couldn’t explain. But he understood why it mattered.\n\nApparently, the Slug had been randomly infecting half the population for centuries. It wasn’t deadly, supposedly. Yet it dulled its host’s every faculty, hampering their ability to do most things — including reasoning cogently, retaining information and even playing sports. How the Slug spread, the World Health Organization couldn’t say. Yet that hadn’t prevented scientists from developing a cure packaged in bubblegum-flavoured oral lozenges. The world’s governments immediately enacted mass screenings among their populations, dosing Slug carriers on detection.\n\nWatching nurses shepherd another person through the clinic’s doors, Balch wondered whether he had the Slug. He couldn’t imagine finding himself smarter and more athletic overnight. The thought made his brain itch. He sighed, wishing the affair was over.\n\n“Boring wait, huh?”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nBalch turned. Behind him stood a youngish, bespectacled man in a tweed suit and bow tie meant for someone four times older.\n\n“If you need entertaining,” he said, “how about a riddle?”\n\n“Why not,” said Balch.\n\n“Picture a game show,” said the man, “involving three doors. One conceals a million dollars. The others, nothing. You’ll win whatever’s behind the door you choose. With me so far?”\n\n“Yup,” said Balch. “Guess correctly, make a bundle.”\n\n“Perfect. Suppose you select Door number 1. Before you turn the knob, the host opens Door number 2, revealing empty space. He then invites you to ditch your initial pick for Door number 3. The question is: should you switch?”\n\nAfter a moment, Balch said, “Weirdly enough, you should.”\n\n“Interesting. Why?”\n\n“Because the original set-up’s a one-in-three chance for the right door, but the second offers a two-in-three chance for Door 2. Much better odds.”\n\n“That’s right,” said the man, grinning.\n\nBalch smiled back. He’d heard the solution before, but kept that to himself. All of a sudden, the man took Balch’s arm, yanking him out of the queue.\n\n“What the …?” Balch sputtered.\n\n“Quiet,” whispered the man. “Nobody must overhear. It’s a matter of vital importance. Most would dismiss me as a crank for what I’m about to say. You, though! You’ve got the right mindset. Because you understand the door puzzle, and how changing circumstances counter-intuitively redefine rational choice.”\n\nBalch remained quiet. Interrupting seemed unwise.\n\n“You see,” said the man, “I’m an economist. Yes, yes, funny occupation. Correctly predicted seven of the last four recessions, et cetera. Whatever. My friend, the reality is, we’re facing probabilistic questions with existential stakes.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Think carefully about the following question: as you await screening … do you hope you have the parasite?”\n\n“Of course not!” said Balch. “Isn’t that the whole point? To be clean, because it’s better not to have a Slug infection?”\n\nThe economist’s expression hardened.\n\n“You’re mistaken. You should pray you’re infected.”\n\n“Nonsense!”\n\n“It’s paradoxical,” said the economist, eyes widening. “You’re unaware whether you’re free of the parasite. But you do know what you’re capable of at this moment. You have a handle on your own abilities — your cleverness and strength relative to others, and what that enables you to achieve. If you’re clean, your abilities will remain unchanged after your screening. Yet, if you’re infected, the calculus changes. You’ll become better at everything you’ve ever tried. As will half the world. You should therefore want to number among them.”\n\nBalch’s damp hands clenched.\n\n“There’s the rub,” the economist continued. “This screening represents a point of no return. You’ll soon learn whether what you are now is all you will be; whether your own mediocrity is mere inconvenience or inescapable fate. Could you live with the results of a clean diagnosis? Could anyone?”",

Although Delphi-2M was trained only on one data set from the United Kingdom, its multi-disease modelling could one day help clinicians to identify high-risk people, allowing for the early roll-out of preventive measures. The model is described in a study published today in Nature.\n\nThe tool’s ability to model multiple diseases in one go is “astonishing”, says Stefan Feuerriegel, a computer scientist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, who has developed AI models for medical applications. “It can generate entire future health trajectories,” he says.\n\nOracle of health\n\nResearchers have already developed AI-based tools to predict a person’s risk of developing certain conditions, including some cancers and cardiovascular disease. But most of these tools estimate the risk of only one disease, says study co-author Moritz Gerstung, a data scientist at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. “A health-care professional would have to run dozens of them to deliver a comprehensive answer,” he says.\n\nTo address this, Gerstung and his colleagues modified a type of large language model (LLM) called a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), that forms the underpinning of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. When asked a question, GPTs provide outputs that, according to their training on vast volumes of data, are statistically probable.\n\nAn AI revolution is brewing in medicine.

The model also incorporates the person’s age, sex, body mass index and health-related habits, such as tobacco use and alcohol consumption. The researchers trained Delphi-2M on data from 400,000 participants of the UK Biobank, a long-term biomedical monitoring study.\n\nFor most diseases, Delphi-2M’s predictions matched or exceeded the accuracy of those of current models that estimate the risk of developing a single illness. The tool also performed better than a machine-learning algorithm that uses biomarkers — levels of specific molecules or compounds in the body — to predict the risk of several diseases. “It worked astonishingly well,” says Gerstung.",

Hotez PublicAffairs (2025)\n\nMonths into President Trump’s second term, science and scientists are under attack as never before in the United States. The administration is forcing devastating cuts to previously stable US research investments, dismantling federal science agencies and programmes, ousting independent scientific officials and blatantly disregarding evidence on issues that affect us all, including vaccines, air pollution and fossil fuels.\n\n‘Now is not the time for despair’ — how scientists can take a stand against political interference\n\nThe scientific community needs to recognize these trends and fight back in every way possible. The timely release of Science under Siege by paediatrician and vaccine specialist Peter Hotez and climate scientist Michael Mann is a welcome addition to the scientific community’s arsenal. Both authors work to dispel misinformation in the public and political arenas, and both have experienced personal attacks because of it.\n\nMann, known for his ‘hockey stick’ visual representation of soaring global average temperatures owing to climate change, has faced years of public disparagement and threats to his physical safety. Hotez found himself in the crosshairs of the politicization of public-health guidance, on vaccines in particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic — and had to hire private security. Together, they explore the forces that undermine science in the United States and beyond.\n\nFive forces to contend with\n\nThe duo skilfully establishes parallels in the attacks on climate scientists and on public-health professionals. The two fields might seem disparate, but specialists in both share a responsibility to inform the public about the “one-two punch of climate change and pandemics” — the effects of which are mutually reinforcing to “threaten massive loss in human life” — and find solutions.\n\nWho is on RFK Jr’s new vaccine panel — and what will they do?\n\nIn some cases, Mann and Hotez note, the same tactics are used in attempts to discredit their work in both fields — sometimes even by the same people. For example, climate-disinformation messaging morphed over several years from ‘it’s not real’ to ‘it’s actually good for us’. These same tactics were adopted by peddlers of COVID-19 misinformation, who claimed that widespread infection could lead to herd immunity, and caught on much faster, mere months after the virus began spreading.\n\nBut who’s behind the lies, propaganda and attacks? Mann and Hotez identify five forces — the ‘five Ps’ — that drive threats to science and scientists: plutocrats, petrostates, pros (that is, academics and specialists who use their credentials to promote disingenuous, and lucrative, contrarian views), propagandists and the press. Mann and Hotez detail how bad actors continue to propagate misinformation, persecute scientists, undermine science-based decisions from policymakers and the public and threaten global health and safety.\n\nFighting back\n\nAs the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists — a science-advocacy non-profit organization that spends its time fighting these known enemies — I found this thorough naming and shaming resonant and indeed cathartic. I imagine that this exploration of just how pervasive and well-funded these forces are might also bring relief to scientists wondering why their commitment to truth-telling isn’t enough.",

Then there are the other awards — the Ig Nobel prizes, which were devised to highlight research that makes people laugh, then think.\n\nHighlights of this year’s Ig Nobel recipients include a nutrition prize for studying the preferred pizza toppings of rainbow lizards at a seaside resort in Togo1 (their favourite is four cheese), and a physics award for figuring out how to prepare the perfect cacio e pepe2 — a pasta dish made with grated pecorino romano cheese and black pepper that is surprisingly hard to get right (see ‘The 2025 Ig Nobel prizewinners in full’).\n\n“For us, this represents the greatest award to creativity in science,” says Giacomo Bartolucci, a physicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, who was a co-author on the cacio e pepe study. His team investigated the phase transitions that can cause the sauce to clump up and uncovered a recipe with consistently delicious results. “The goal was both to satisfy our curiosity and to frame the problem in physical terms, showing that even everyday frustrations like a failed pasta dish can be linked to interesting scientific problems,” says Bartolucci.\n\nCelebrating silliness\n\nThe Ig Nobels were founded in 1991 by Marc Abrahams, editor of satirical magazine Annals of Improbable Research. Previous winners have included the discovery that orgasm can be an effective nasal decongestant3, the levitation of live frogs using magnets4 and research on necrophilia in ducks5.\n\nThe 2025 Ig Nobel prizewinners in full\n\nLITERATURE\n\nThe late physician William Bean, for persistently recording and analysing the rate of growth of one of his fingernails over a period of 35 years.\n\nPSYCHOLOGY\n\nMarcin Zajenkowski and Gilles Gignac, for investigating what happens when you tell a narcissist — or anyone else — that they are intelligent.\n\nNUTRITION\n\nDaniele Dendi, Gabriel Segniagbeto, Roger Meek and Luca Luiselli for studying the extent to which a certain kind of lizard chooses to eat certain kinds of pizza.\n\nPEDIATRICS\n\nJulie Mennella and Gary Beauchamp for studying what a nursing baby experiences when their mother eats garlic.\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nTomoki Kojima, Kazato Oishi, Yasushi Matsubara, Yuki Uchiyama, Yoshihiko Fukushima, Naoto Aoki, Say Sato, Tatsuaki Masuda, Junichi Ueda, Hiroyuki Hirooka and Katsutoshi Kino, for their experiments to learn whether cows painted with zebra-like stripes can avoid fly bites.\n\nCHEMISTRY\n\nRotem Naftalovich, Daniel Naftalovich and Frank Greenway, for experiments to test whether eating Teflon [a form of plastic more formally called ’polytetrafluoroethylene’] is a good way to increase food volume, and hence satiety, without increasing calorie content.\n\nPEACE\n\nFritz Renner, Inge Kersbergen, Matt Field and Jessica Werthmann, for showing that drinking alcohol sometimes improves a person’s ability to speak in a foreign language.\n\nENGINEERING DESIGN\n\nVikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, for analysing, from an engineering design perspective, “how foul-smelling shoes affects the good experience of using a shoe-rack”’.\n\nAVIATION\n\nFrancisco Sánchez, Mariana Melcón, Carmi Korine and Berry Pinshow, for studying whether ingesting alcohol can impair bats’ ability to fly and echolocate.\n\nPHYSICS\n\nGiacomo Bartolucci, Daniel Maria Busiello, Matteo Ciarchi, Alberto Corticelli, Ivan Di Terlizzi, Fabrizio Olmeda, Davide Revignas and Vincenzo Maria Schimmenti, for discoveries about the physics of pasta sauce, especially the phase transition that can lead to clumping, which can yield an unappetizing dish.\n\nIn the prize’s early days, receiving one was deemed silly or even insulting by some people. Abrahams says that Robert May, the chief scientific adviser to the UK Government from 1995 to 2000, once wrote him an angry letter demanding that they stopped giving Ig Nobel prizes to British scientists.\n\nBut many have come to see the Ig Nobels as career-changing in their own right.\n\n“When we first got the phone call about winning an Ig Nobel, we honestly thought it was a prank. Once we realized it was real, we were thrilled and genuinely honored,” says Fritz Renner, a psychologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany and a winner of this year’s peace prize for work showing that drinking alcohol can improve your ability to speak in a foreign language6.\n\nHow a silly science prize changed my career\n\n“It all started out at an international conference in Vienna,” he says of the research. “We had some drinks with colleagues at a bar at the end of a long conference day. Someone was joking that their English — to them a foreign language — was getting better with a drink.”\n\nThe discussion ultimately led to a study showing that people are more impressed by your ability to speak another language after you’ve had a small amount of booze. However, Renner stresses that “we do not encourage anybody to use alcohol as a learning tool or to ditch language classes in favour of a drink”.\n\nContinuing the theme of tipsiness, there was an aviation prize for a study on how alcohol can impair bats’ ability to fly and echolocate7, which explains why the animals tend to avoid eating fermented fruit.",

My colleagues and I use this 1,500-tree orchard in Valsayn, a town in the north of the island of Trinidad, to better understand cocoa production.\n\nMy research focuses on the fermentation of cacao beans, a process that is carried out mainly at a small scale on local farms. Cacao trees produce fruit pods, which are harvested and broken open to release the pulp-covered beans. I’m holding one here. The acidity, sweetness and floral flavour vary from pod to pod. It’s the pulp that acts as the fuel for the microorganisms that drive the beans’ fermentation.\n\nThe chemical changes that occur over about a week remove the beans’ bitterness and turn them red-brown, but only after roasting do they gain their chocolate flavour. The success of the fermentation process is dependent on climate. And with weather patterns becoming less predictable, the quality of the beans has started to decline. We have started to experiment with manipulating sucrose and water levels at the start of fermentation, and we are also using other techniques to tweak the process.",

          "title": "How billions of hacked mosquitoes and a vaccine could beat the deadly dengue virus",
          "authors": "Lucila Pinto",
          "abstract": "Support for this article was provided by the Pulitzer Center.\n\nLast month, a parade of vehicles wound its way through three cities in Brazil, releasing clouds of mosquitoes into the air. The insects all carry a secret weapon — a bacterium called Wolbachia that lowers the odds that the mosquitoes can transmit the dreaded dengue virus to humans.\n\nThis is the world’s largest ‘mosquito factory’: its goal is to stop dengue\n\nThese infected mosquitoes are the latest weapon in Brazil’s fight against dengue, which infects millions of people in the country each year and can be fatal. A biofactory that opened in the town of Curitiba in July can produce 100 million mosquito eggs per week — making it the largest such facility in the world. The company that runs it, Wolbito do Brasil, aims to protect about 14 million Brazilians per year through its Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.\n\nThat will come as welcome news for the Brazilian health officials battling the rapidly growing threat of dengue. In 2024, the country experienced its worst outbreak yet: with 6.6 million probable cases and more than 6,300 related deaths. This year’s outbreak, although less severe, is also one of the highest on record, with 1.6 million probable cases so far (see ‘Dangerous outbreaks’). And the problem is spreading. Argentina, Colombia and Peru also experienced record-breaking outbreaks in 2024 and have seen a sustained increase in cases in recent years. Across Latin America and the Caribbean, deaths from dengue last year totalled more than 8,400 and the global figure reached more than 12,000 — the highest ever recorded for this disease.\n\nSOURCE: Brazilian Ministry of Health\n\nAs outbreaks grow larger and the crisis becomes more urgent, the Wolbachia method isn’t Brazil’s only bet. A locally produced dengue vaccine is now awaiting approval by the country’s drug-regulatory agency, and its health ministry expects to start administering tens of millions of doses by next year.\n\nThese twin advances offer some hope to other countries — in the region and beyond. Driven by forces such as climate change, mosquito adaptation, globalized trade and movements of people, dengue is becoming a crisis worldwide, with an estimated 3.9 billion people at risk of infection. As Brazil rolls out its armies of infected mosquitoes and a vaccine in the coming year, the rest of the world will be watching closely.\n\nThe local approach\n\nCurrently, there is one main dengue vaccine in use around the world: Qdenga, licensed by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda. The vaccine has been approved in many countries, including Brazil, which was the first nation to include it in its public-health system.\n\nHowever, Qdenga’s roll-out in Brazil is limited. The country bought nine million doses of the two-dose vaccine this year: enough to vaccinate 4.5 million of its population of more than 210 million. So far, Qdenga has been administered to children between the ages of 10 and 14, one of the groups most likely to end up in hospital after contracting dengue, together with older people. Its safety and efficacy have not yet been tested in adults aged over 60.\n\nThe main reasons for such a limited roll-out in Brazil are availability and cost. Even though Brazil secured Qdenga from Takeda at one of the cheapest prices in the world —around US$19 per dose — the cost is still high compared with other vaccines. And even in the most optimistic scenario, the maximum number of doses Takeda could provide by 2028 is 50 million — enough to vaccinate 25 million people. What’s more, for people who have not had dengue before, clinical trials did not show Qdenga to be effective against all four variants — or serotypes — of the dengue virus.\n\nWhen will dengue strike? Outbreaks sync with heat and rain\n\nBrazil is trying to address all of those limitations with its one-dose vaccine candidate, developed at the Butantan Institute, a public biomedical research centre in São Paulo. “Having local production capacity gives us independence on decisions — how many doses we need, and at what speed to vaccinate,” says Esper Kallás, Butantan’s director. “You can practise prices that are more suitable and absorbable by a public-health system such as Brazil’s.”\n\nButantan is also optimistic that its vaccine will be effective against all four forms of dengue. Severe disease usually occurs when a person is infected by a different serotype to their first infection. That means that a successful vaccine needs to generate antibodies for all four serotypes without triggering severe reactions, which makes it a difficult vaccine to develop. “It was indeed a challenge, as each serotype behaves differently,” says Neuza Frazatti Gallina, manager of the viral vaccine development laboratory at Butantan.\n\nThe vaccine’s development began at the US National Institutes of Health in the late 1990s, where scientists transformed dengue viruses they had isolated from patients into weakened vaccine strains that could trigger the production of protective antibodies without causing disease. In 2009, Butantan extended that research by working to solve the challenges of combining the four strains into a vaccine.\n\nEggs of mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria. After hatching, the mosquitoes will be released to prevent the spread of dengue.Credit: Xinhua/Shutterstock\n\nAfter testing 30 formulations, Butantan arrived at one that proved highly effective in preventing infections, according to the preliminary results of a phase III trial involving more than 16,000 volunteers in Brazil. The study reported that two years after vaccinations, the formulation was 89% effective in preventing infections in people who had previously been infected with dengue, and 74% effective in those with no previous exposure1.\n\n“It was a well-designed trial,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, who is team lead for vaccine development at the World Health Organization (WHO). But she says one limitation of the trial is that it was conducted in a single country, and therefore runs a risk that all four serotypes were not circulating at the time.\n\nIn fact, serotypes 3 and 4 were not prevalent during the data-collection period of the clinical trial, although they are now circulating in Brazil. Butantan researchers suggest that the vaccine will be effective against serotypes 3 and 4, pointing to data from a phase II trial2 in 300 adults that showed participants produced neutralizing antibodies to each of the serotypes. That study evaluated safety and immunological response in the short term, rather than looking at the vaccine’s long-term efficacy in preventing infections. The full results of the Brazilian phase III trial — which will provide data on long-term effectiveness — are not yet public and are undergoing peer review.\n\nThe vaccine is already moving through the country’s regulatory process. And although there’s still no certainty about when Anvisa, Brazil’s regulatory agency, will approve the vaccine, the government is counting on it. In February, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced that, starting in 2026, the Ministry of Health would be buying 60 million doses annually.\n\nTo meet that demand, Butantan is now producing the vaccine at its São Paulo facility. On its lush campus, an entire building is dedicated to churning out doses.\n\nRegarding the vaccine’s approval, “We are very confident,” says Kallás. “We also anticipate that there is a very prominent need to have this product in the arms of people. So we hit the road running and started producing vaccines late last year.”\n\nAlthough Butantan’s production efforts will focus initially on meeting Brazil’s need for millions of doses, Kallás expects that the vaccine could reach other countries. Butantan has been discussing with its development partner — the pharmaceutical giant Merck — and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) how to make the vaccine accessible to other countries. The logical first step, he says, would be to roll it out through PAHO to Latin America and the Caribbean, and then to other regions.\n\nIn the meantime, Merck is developing a potential vaccine for Asia with an almost identical formulation, which builds on the knowledge that Butantan has developed. In a statement, the drug firm said that Butantan is “sharing clinical data and other learnings”. In June, Merck started enrolling participants for its own phase III trial. “All the data, experiences and insights they have collected with the Butantan vaccine will be helpful,” says Wilder-Smith.\n\nInfecting mosquitoes\n\nWhile Butantan awaits news about the vaccine’s approval, the Wolbachia method to control dengue is gaining momentum. The World Mosquito Program (WMP) — a non-profit group of companies owned by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, where the strategy was developed — has operations in 14 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico and Colombia, but Brazil leads the way in terms of the scale of its expansion.\n\nThe method’s arrival in the Americas is tied to Brazilian researcher Luciano Moreira, now the chief executive of Wolbito do Brazil. Wolbachia is naturally present in around 50% of insects, but not in the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, which is the main transmitter of dengue and many other viruses.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Chatbots give positive, human-like responses to prompts from users.Credit: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nAccounts of people developing psychosis — which renders them unable to distinguish between what is and is not reality — after interacting with generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have increased in the past few months.\n\nSupportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health\n\nAt least 17 people have been reported to have developed psychosis, according to a preprint posted online last month1. After engaging with chatbots such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, some of these people experienced spiritual awakenings or uncovered what they thought were conspiracies.\n\nSo far, there has been little research into this rare phenomenon, called AI psychosis, and most of what we know comes from individual instances. Nature explores the emerging theories and evidence, and what AI companies are doing about the problem.\n\nCan AI trigger psychosis?\n\nPsychosis is characterized by disruptions to how a person thinks and perceives reality, including hallucinations, delusions and false beliefs. It can be triggered by brain disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, severe stress and drug use.\n\nThat AI can trigger psychosis is still a hypothesis, says Søren Østergaard, a psychiatrist at Aarhus University in Denmark. But theories are emerging about how this could happen, he adds. For instance, chatbots are designed to craft positive, human-like responses to prompts from users, which could increase the risk of psychosis among people already having trouble distinguishing between what is and is not real, says Østergaard.\n\nUK researchers have proposed that conversations with chatbots can fall into a feedback loop, in which the AI reinforces paranoid or delusional beliefs mentioned by users, which condition the chatbot’s responses as the conversation continues. In a preprint published in July2, which has not been peer reviewed, the scientists simulated user–chatbot conversations using prompts with varying levels of paranoia, finding that the user and chatbot reinforced each other’s paranoid beliefs.\n\nStudies involving people without mental-health conditions or tendencies towards paranoid thinking are needed to establish whether there is a connection between psychosis and chatbot use, Østergaard says.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nPeople who have already experienced some kind of mental-health issue are at the greatest risk of developing psychosis, Østergaard says. It seems that some people can experience their first psychotic break from interacting with chatbots, he adds, but most of them will already be susceptible to developing delusions or paranoia owing to genetics, stress or misuse of drugs or alcohol. Østergaard also theorizes that chatbots could worsen or trigger mania, a period of extremely elevated energy and mood associated with bipolar disorder, because they reinforce symptoms such as elated mood.\n\nPeople who are isolated and do not interact with friends, family or other people are also at risk, says Kiley Seymour, a neuroscientist at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia. Interacting with other people protects against psychosis, she adds, because “they can offer those counterfactual pieces of evidence to help you think about how you’re thinking”.\n\nBut the risk of developing psychosis for people without a predisposition is the same whether they do or don’t interact with chatbots, adds Seymour.\n\nHow might AI reinforce delusional beliefs?\n\nChatbots can remember information from conversations that occurred months earlier, which can trigger users to think that they are “being watched or that their thoughts are being extracted, because they can’t remember ever sharing that information”, says Seymour. Grandiose delusions, in which users think they are speaking to a god through the chatbot or have discovered a truth about the world, can also be reinforced, she adds. In an analysis of chats posted online, The Wall Street Journal reported finding dozens of instances in which chatbots validated mystical or delusional beliefs or made claims that they were in contact with extraterrestrial beings.",

Simon/Science Photo Library\n\nScientists have created the first ever viruses designed by artificial intelligence (AI), and they’re capable of hunting down and killing strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli).\n\n“This is the first time AI systems are able to write coherent genome-scale sequences,” says Brian Hie, a computational biologist at Stanford University, California. “The next step is AI-generated life,” says Hie, but his colleague Samuel King adds that “a lot of experimental advances need to occur in order to design an entire living organism”.\n\nThe study, by Hie, King and colleagues, was posted on the preprint server bioRxiv on 17 September1 and is not yet peer reviewed, but the authors say that it shows the potential of AI to design biotechnological tools and therapies for treating bacterial infections. “Hopefully, a strategy like this can complement existing phage-therapy strategies and someday augment the therapeutics [to] target pathogens of concern,” says Hie.\n\nGenomes from the computer\n\nAI models have already been used to generate DNA sequences, single proteins and multi-component complexes2. But designing a whole genome is much more challenging owing to complex interactions between genes and gene replication and regulation processes. These AI systems are now capable of helping scientists to manipulate highly intricate biological systems, such as whole genomes, says Hie. “There are many important biological functions that you can only access if you’re able to design complete genomes.”\n\nTo design the viral genomes, the researchers used Evo 1 and Evo 2, AI models that analyse and generate DNA, RNA and protein sequences. First, they needed a design template, which is a starting sequence that guides the AI model to generate a genome with desired characteristics. They chose ΦX174, a simple single-stranded DNA virus that contains 5,386 nucleotides in 11 genes, and all the genetic elements required to infect hosts and replicate inside them.\n\nThe Evo models had already been trained on more than 2 million phage genomes, but the researchers further trained the models — using a method called supervised learning — to generate ΦX174-like viral genomes with the specific function of infecting E.coli strains, especially those resistant to antibiotics.\n\nFive ways science is tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis\n\nThe researchers evaluated thousands of AI-generated sequences and narrowed their search down to 302 viable bacteriophages. Most candidates shared more than 40% nucleotide identity with ΦX174, but some had completely different coding sequences. The researchers synthesized DNA from the AI-designed genomes and inserted them into host bacteria to grow phages. These phages were then experimentally tested to see whether they could infect and kill E.coli.\n\nSome 16 of the 302 AI-designed bacteriophage showed host specificity for E. coli and could infect the bacteria. The researchers found that combinations of AI-designed phages could infect and kill three different E. coli strains, which the wild-type ΦX174 was unable to do.\n\n“It was quite a surprising result that was really exciting for us because it shows that this method might potentially be very useful for therapeutics,” says King.\n\nBiosafety concerns",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Update: Soon after Nature posted this story, some US$11 million from the US National Science Foundation began flowing back to Harvard. The Harvard Crimson also reported that $46 million in funds from the US National Institutes of Health are now going to the university. This afternoon, in a joint status update before a judge, both Harvard and the US government asked for more time to “work through implementation issues” of complying fully with the court order.\n\nHarvard University scored a victory in court two weeks ago, when a US judge ruled that its research grants should be reinstated and its funding unfrozen. But the administration of Republican President Donald Trump does not yet seem to be fully complying with the court order.\n\nHarvard vs Trump: what this epic battle means for science\n\nIn May, Trump’s team terminated roughly 1,000 grants awarded to Harvard worth more than US$2.8 billion, citing the institution’s alleged failure to protect its students from antisemitism. An internal e-mail sent on 12 September to staff members at Harvard, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, noted that the university had “received indications” that most of its grants from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — a massive funder of biomedical research — had been restored. But researchers have told Nature that they still aren’t receiving the money.\n\nA Harvard spokesperson confirms that “payments have not been restored”, meaning that although the NIH is reactivating grants, the payment system — which operates separately — is still blocked. When asked about the freeze on funding, the NIH declined to comment on the record.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will appeal the Harvard court decision. The case is likely to end up before the US Supreme Court, says David Super, a specialist in administrative law at Georgetown University in Washington DC.\n\nHong Kong universities woo Harvard international students targeted by Trump\n\nBut in the meantime, legal scholars have told Nature that the government should, by this point, have unfrozen Harvard’s money. “You should comply with a court order as rapidly as you reasonably could,” Super says.\n\nAt least one US funding agency seems to be restoring funding, however. On Wednesday, the US National Science Foundation (NSF), which financially supports about 25% of basic US academic research, sent an e-mail informing Harvard that its grants have been reinstated and its funding unfrozen. “You may begin drawing funds,” the e-mail states. (The NSF uses a different payment system from the NIH’s.)\n\nOne affected researcher is Julia Mundy, a condensed-matter physicist at Harvard who lost a prestigious NSF award for early-career scientists. “This is a positive step,” she says. “But we also still feel a lot of uncertainty, because it doesn’t feel that everything is resolved yet.”\n\nHarvard vs Trump\n\nHarvard has been central to the Trump administration’s campaign to reshape US higher education, which it has said is too left-leaning. In April, government officials froze federal funds to the institution — the wealthiest in the world — and demanded, among other things, that it eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programmes and achieve “viewpoint diversity” in student admissions and the hiring of faculty members.\n\nTwo students work in the laboratory of Julia Mundy, a condensed-matter physicist at Harvard who studies atomically-thin materials.Credit: Charles Brooks\n\nWhen Harvard refused to fully comply, the Trump team terminated the institution’s federal grants across 19 US agencies, alleging that the university allowed “pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment”. The school sued, and on 3 September, Massachusetts district court judge Allison Burroughs ruled that the grant terminations were illegal because they violated Harvard’s constitutional right to free speech.\n\n“There is, in reality, little connection between the research affected by the grant terminations and antisemitism,” Burroughs, who was appointed by former Democratic president Barack Obama, wrote in her decision. She called the claim of antisemitism a “smokescreen” and cited Trump’s social-media posts, including one saying that Harvard is “hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and ‘birdbrains’ who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students”.\n\nCourt conundrum\n\nThe bottleneck in which Harvard’s NIH grants are now held up is a system called Payment Management Services (PMS), which processes requests for withdrawing money from grants and is run by the NIH’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). When asked why grant payments aren’t flowing, PMS directed Nature to submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the HHS.\n\nHarvard researchers devastated as Trump team cuts nearly 1,000 grants\n\nAlthough it can take time to resume payments, it should not take two weeks, Super says. It seems that the government could be violating the court’s order by only partially complying, he adds.",

          "title": "GPS timekeeping is increasingly vulnerable: here’s how to deliver future-proofed time",
          "authors": "Leon Lobo, Douglas Paul, Chander Velu",
          "abstract": "It might not be apparent, but almost everything people do in this digitally connected world, from sending a text or e-mail to doing an Internet search or paying for something online, depends on accurate, resilient timing. Most electronic communications rely on digital infrastructure that is synchronized to a common time reference, enabling information to flow at a known rate. Accurate timing is also crucial for synchronizing and stabilizing infrastructure such as electricity grids, for helping to ensure the integrity of financial transactions, for steering machinery for precision agriculture, and for managing transport, logistics and postal delivery systems, among a host of other essential functions.\n\nToday, the necessary timing signals come overwhelmingly from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). These deliver signals from space, with only a radio receiver needed to receive and interpret them. Chief among them is the US-developed Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS is free to use, and the technology is mature: miniature GPS receivers are now embedded in every smartphone, at a cost of a few dollars per unit. This is an easy, low-cost way to reliably synchronize time, certainly compared with the old method of physically calibrating your clock to a reference clock at a national standards agency.\n\nBest ever clocks: breakthrough paves way for ultra-precise ‘nuclear’ timekeepers\n\nBut this success has bred complacency — and led to underappreciated risk. GNSS are far from fail-safe. In many parts of the world, organized-crime syndicates and military authorities are among those increasingly jamming GNSS signals (blocking them entirely) or spoofing them (transmitting false signals to provide misleading time and position coordinates). Disruptions to the signal due to extreme weather events are also on the rise. In some sectors, such as aviation, a multitude of systems would potentially be affected in the event of more-widespread outages. But there is low awareness of the risks — and protections are hugely variable between sectors.\n\nThe increasing vulnerability of time signals from space necessitates the development of alternative ways of accessing accurate, resilient and secure time. We (the authors) have been involved in varying capacities in technology and economic measures to deliver a nationwide, resilient terrestrial timing solution that is independent of GNSS in the United Kingdom. Here we set out three key steps that we think would help to facilitate the development of alternative time sources worldwide: increasing buy-in from business; linking up existing, heterogeneous local timing systems; and creating entirely new uses for time.\n\nGetting buy-in from business\n\nConstellations of GNSS satellites disseminate time from the national-standards laboratories that contribute to the formulation of the global time scale, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The GPS system was developed by the US Department of Defense during the cold war, initially for the exclusive use of the US military. Each GPS satellite carries multiple atomic clocks, which are ultimately synchronized with a representation of the UTC, known as UTC(USNO), generated by an ensemble of atomic clocks at the US Naval Observatory in Washington DC. The signals these satellites beam down to Earth enable users to determine the time to within an accuracy of 10–7 seconds, or 100 billionths of a second.\n\nRecognition in the 1980s of the wider potential societal benefits of GNSS led the United States to make an intentionally degraded, ‘selectively available’ version of the GPS signal accessible to everyone globally, free of charge. The full version was made public in 2000, since when its use has ballooned in a plethora of civilian applications. Other GNSS systems exist, such as GLONASS (operated by Russia), Galileo (the European Union) and BeiDou (China). But GPS remains dominant owing to widespread public confidence in a US-provided infrastructure and to the system’s earlier availability for general use, which means a large number of older receivers are only GPS-compliant. Some 5.6 billion end-user GNSS receiver units were in use in 2023, a number predicted to increase to almost 9 billion units in 2033 (see ‘Sky-high demand’). The economic benefits of using GNSS have been estimated to be around US$300 billion annually for the United States, $81 billion across Europe and from $9 billion to about $18 billion for the United Kingdom (see ‘Productivity plus’).\n\nSource: EU Agency for the Space Programme (https://go.nature.com/42AQKJL)\n\nThe potential costs of disruption to GNSS are similarly considerable: across all sectors, a report for the UK government in 2023 estimated these costs, per day, to be almost $1.9 billion for the United Kingdom alone. But whereas the economic benefits of using GNSS often accrue to individual firms, the economic cost of disturbances to the GPS signal — for example, the failure of the electricity grid due to a GPS outage that might affect transport, financial and communication systems — tends to be borne by all of society.\n\nMore onus needs to be put on firms and utilities that provide services through GNSS to invest in timing resilience. Regulation to increase the liability of individual firms, and personal accountability of senior managers for ensuring resilience of time, is one way to make this happen. There is also a need to support the development of alternative assured ‘holdover time’ capabilities: accurate, locally based clocks that can continue to provide time for a while if the main GNSS signals are lost.\n\nSource: London Economics (https://go.nature.com/4G5NDYM)\n\nThe cumulative investment costs across every organization in every sector to provide such a holdover system are likely to be significant. Developing national public infrastructures for delivering resilient timekeeping directly from national representations of UTC — in effect, recreating timekeeping as a national public utility — is a way to reduce direct costs for businesses. Such a public utility could instil trust and confidence in users, and cover its costs by offering tiered, paid-for levels of assurance of time. In the United Kingdom, a supporting terrestrial clock system is being designed and developed as a nationwide time infrastructure through the National Timing Centre research and development programme (of which one of us, L.L., is head) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at Teddington. This system is linked to UTC(NPL), the United Kingdom’s real-time realization of UTC.\n\nBut limited understanding of the need for alternative assured-time capabilities is a barrier to achieving business and political buy-in. A programme of public awareness about the use and importance of GNSS should be rolled out globally, emphasizing both the risks inherent in the current systems and the benefits of alternative timing systems for increased resilience and enhanced performance.\n\nLinking up time systems\n\nCrucial infrastructures, from financial services to transport and energy systems, are often interdependent. Yet they tend to operate as independent ecosystems, subject to their own legislation and with their own regulatory standards, policies, supply chains and digital ecosystems.\n\nLittle thought tends to be given to the security of timekeeping in the design and maintenance of the digital systems underpinning this infrastructure. Time’s intangible nature means that it often falls in the gap between cybersecurity and physical-security measures designed to protect digital and physical assets, respectively. When mitigating GNSS loss or disruption is considered at all, it tends to be by individual firms on an ad hoc basis. For example, telecommunications network providers often have atomic clocks distributed across their fibre exchanges to enable synchronization to be maintained for the Internet backbone even if GNSS signals are disrupted. Such mitigation measures are rarely tested robustly for the possibility of GNSS outages across all interconnected sectors.\n\nAtomic clock keeps ultra-precise time aboard a rocking naval ship\n\nThe increasingly interlinked nature of timing infrastructure implies that terrestrial clocks need to be integrated and able to coordinate time in the case of disruption to GNSS. This underlines the desirability of government intervention to provide a base capability that is accessible to all users wherever and whenever they need it. This might take the form of new legislation or regulation and standards to allow interoperability between essential infrastructures. It is part of the rationale behind the UK National Timing Centre’s research programme.\n\nA further consideration is that the global supply chain for timing systems — from atomic clocks, time distribution and monitoring systems to user equipment — is currently sparse and lacks diversity. The ubiquity and utility of GNSS for time has resulted in industry investing in and developing receivers that are low in size, weight, power and cost, proliferating dependency on this single solution. (One of us, D.P., is head of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position, Navigation and Timing, led by the University of Glasgow, UK, which runs a programme developing cheaper timing technologies.) A more diverse supply chain needs to be built to provide the enabling technologies to support a national timing infrastructure that can enhance the resilience of time. This needs to be complemented by an upgrade of the skills pipeline.\n\nPrivate-sector investments in building such a resilient supply chain to provide reliable timing will depend on effective, long-term commitment from governments1. Policy initiatives such as direct public investment, or incentives such as tax credits, interest deferrals and loans, must be immune to political winds of change to truly de-risk such investments. This could be achieved by regulating the minimum holdover time — the length of time any backup system can provide accurate timekeeping — across industries to ensure commitment to build and develop such time-based resilience. Such regulation needs to define the requirements for specific clocks with the accuracy needed to enable each national infrastructure to operate effectively.\n\nCreating new uses for time\n\nThe extra revenue-generating opportunity of new timing systems is, on the face of it, limited when compared with the extra costs. A focus solely on managing risk and enhancing the resilience of time systems might not, therefore, be enough to convince firms of the need to invest in supporting the development of terrestrial holdover timing systems.\n\nFinancial markets require precise, trustable time for transactions to be recorded accurately.Caption: Michael M.

          "abstract": "Former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Susan Monarez testified before the Senate on 17 September about her firing.Credit: Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nTwo former top scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — including one who was fired as director — told a US Senate committee today that they were dismissed because they refused to approve decisions handed down by political appointees without grounding in scientific evidence.\n\nTrump order gives political appointees vast powers over research grants\n\nSusan Monarez, who served as CDC director for just 29 days under Republican President Donald Trump, told the committee that US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr demanded she take actions that would not improve the health of people in the United States.\n\n“I was fired for holding the line on scientific integrity,” she said. “The stakes are not theoretical — we have already seen the largest [US] measles outbreak in more than 30 years, which claimed the lives of two children.”\n\nDuring the nearly three-hour hearing, Monarez and Debra Houry, who resigned as the agency’s chief medical officer when Monarez was fired in late August, were praised by Democratic senators for speaking out. Some Republican senators, meanwhile, portrayed Monarez as untrustworthy and out-of-step with Trump’s and Kennedy’s priorities.\n\nHere, Nature outlines three key ways that the former public-health officials said science is being set aside at the CDC in favour of politics.\n\nPre-approving vaccine changes\n\nA panel of advisers will meet starting tomorrow to review how and when children should be given already-established vaccines for COVID-19, hepatitis B and more. Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate, fired all 17 members of the panel in June and replaced them with a new, handpicked slate that included some who have questioned the safety of immunization publicly.\n\nMonarez testified that Kennedy told her there would be changes coming in September to the ‘schedule’ of vaccines recommended for children, and that if she wanted to keep her job, she was expected to accept the forthcoming votes from the panel. (The CDC director has the ultimate say over any recommendations made by the panel.) Monarez said she would want to see the data justifying their recommendations rather than blindly approving them.\n\nDebra Houry resigned as chief medical officer at the CDC on the same day that Monarez was fired.Credit: Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nHer concerns with Kennedy’s ultimatum were so grave that she contacted the chairman of the Senate committee charged with overseeing the CDC: Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. Kennedy felt betrayed that she had taken her concerns to the US Congress, telling her never to do it again and calling Monarez untrustworthy, she testified. According to her testimony, she told him that if he felt he could not trust her, he should fire her.\n\nKennedy gave an alternative version of events at a hearing on 4 September, saying he fired her because she responded “no” when he asked whether she was a “trustworthy person”. Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for Kennedy’s agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), says Monarez “acted maliciously to undermine the President’s agenda and was fired as a result” — a claim that Monarez disputed at today’s hearing.\n\nSidelining agency scientists and data\n\nKennedy announced on 27 May that COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women in a video on the social-media platform X. The health secretary, who has said many times that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous without providing evidence, never consulted Houry or other top agency officials before making the announcement, she testified.\n\nRFK Jr slings accusations and defends public-health upheaval at fiery hearing\n\nPatty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington state, said she was shocked by this testimony. “It’s unthinkable that the chief medical officer at the CDC was left in the dark about such a consequential public-health decision that affected real people,” she said.\n\nMonarez also testified that in August, Kennedy directed her to speak only with the agency’s political appointees — not career scientists, who are government employees hired for their expertise. She added that any policy decisions had to first be vetted by political appointees in Kennedy’s office, mirroring a 7 August order by Trump that strips power from career staff members in favour of employees chosen by the administration.\n\nAfter the hearing, Houry told Nature about her discomfort with the situation: “The CDC director should be given autonomy on how to lead the agency.”\n\nMeanwhile, career scientists such as Houry tried repeatedly to brief Kennedy on public-health matters and to correct false statements he’d been making in public, she testified, but his office never replied to these communications.",

          "title": "‘Lipstick on a pig’: how to fight back against a peer-review bully",
          "authors": "Katarina Zimmer",
          "abstract": "Nyssa Silbiger still recalls the rude remark that reviewer three made in 2014 about her first paper describing her PhD research. “The phrases I have so far avoided using in this review are, ‘lipstick on a pig’, and ‘bullshit baffles brains’,” they wrote.\n\nTo Silbiger, a marine biologist at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, the words cut deep. The critique not only made it difficult to work out how she should revise her manuscript on the bioerosion of coral reefs, but also led her to question her abilities and whether she belonged in science at all. “As a twenty-something student, that can have a really big impact on your ability not only to conduct science, but your whole future career,” says Silbiger, who now leads her own marine-ecology group at the university.\n\nCan Germany rein in its academic bullying problem?\n\nPeer review is supposed to be critical. But too often, Silbiger says, reviewer feedback crosses the line into an unprofessional realm. Such unacceptable behaviours range from outright bullying of other scientists and personal comments about the authors to mean-spirited or unhelpful remarks without constructive, evidence-based criticism. In 2019, Silbiger and Amber Stubler, a marine ecologist at Occidental College in Los Angeles, California, conducted a survey of roughly 1,100 scientists. Some 58% of respondents reported that they had encountered unprofessional peer-review comments1. In particular, women, non-binary scientists and people of colour said that the experience had harmed their confidence and productivity and delayed their career advancement.\n\nAttention to the issue has grown ever since and, fortunately, so have ways to address it. Journals, editors and scientific organizations have begun to explore a range of solutions to prevent bullying during the peer-review process and to hold mean-spirited reviewers accountable. Many scientists are also taking matters into their own hands by pushing back on unprofessional reviews.\n\n“There is progress being made, just in small increments and in different flavours,” says Emma Dunne, a palaeobiologist at the Friedrich Alexander University of Erlangen–Nuremberg in Germany, and the ethics editor of the journal Historical Biology. “I would like to think that things can only get better.”\n\nWhy do nasty peer reviews happen?\n\nHowever negatively a referee views a study, there’s always a polite, evidence-based way to express criticism, says Sally Thomas, the Palaeontological Association’s publications officer. During the organization’s peer-review workshop for early-career researchers, she stresses the importance of being careful with language (see ‘Don’t do it’). “Always put yourself in the shoes of the author,” says Thomas, who is based in Cambridge, UK. Start by writing something positive, she says, “and then lay out what is not so good about the work in a totally unemotional and logical way”.\n\nDon’t do it\n\nAs a peer reviewer, avoid harmful and unhelpful comments such as these real examples.\n\n• “The writing of this paper was atrocious.”4\n\n• “The result of attending university in a developing country.”4\n\n• “You should look closely at a career outside of science.”1\n\n• “This young lady is lucky to have been mentored by the leading men in the field.”4\n\n• “Utterly disappointed in this submission, it achieves nothing, and was a waste of funding.”4\n\n• “The author’s last name sounds Spanish. I didn’t read the manuscript because I’m sure it’s full of bad English.”1\n\n• “This manuscript was not worth my time so I did not read it and recommend rejection.”4\n\n• “I have rewritten so much of this troubled paper that I should be included as an author.”4\n\n• “The first author is a woman. She should be in the kitchen, not writing papers.”1\n\n• “This paper is, simply, manure.”1\n\n• “What the authors have done is an insult to science.”1\n\n• “The author’s status as a trans person has distorted his view of sex beyond the biological reality.”1\n\n• “The English is not good enough; please have it reviewed by a native speaker.”\n\n• “The authors provide us with a nice example [of] what they can, and cannot do, and how they (wrongly) understand nature and ecology.”4\n\n• “This person works for an NGO [non-governmental organization], you shouldn’t believe anything they say.”1\n\nYet research indicates that some scientists worry that being too nice will allow poor-quality studies to be published or think that authors deserve harsh comments for submitting substandard work2. Other times, overly harsh reviews might be intended to hinder or delay the publication of papers by competing laboratory groups. Personal snipes at study authors are also widespread, including ones targeting early-career scientists, women and people of colour, notes palaeontologist Farid Saleh at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. He recalls how a reviewer once singled him and a female co-author out on a paper with 12 other authors, “calling us disingenuous, not real scientists, and making other personal attacks”. Remarks that disparage the authors’ English-language skills without constructive feedback are unprofessional and can exacerbate the existing challenges that individuals whose primary language is not English face in scientific publishing, adds Valeria Ramírez Castañeda, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied such challenges3.\n\nNot all rude-seeming reviews are intentional, because cultural attitudes to directness vary. A blunt comment from one scientist might be perceived as rude by researchers who are used to more diplomatic language, Ramírez Castañeda says. Reviews by scientists who lack the skills or experience to give nuanced feedback, senior researchers accustomed to the more-adversarial academic cultures of the past and scientists who don’t have the time to thoughtfully consider a paper might seem harsher than intended.\n\nWhat authors can do\n\nAvoiding problematic peer reviews starts by considering which journal to submit to and what its peer-review practices are. Specialists agree that the most common form of peer review — single-anonymous, in which referee identities are concealed from the authors but not vice versa — can promote unprofessional comments by giving reviewers anonymity.\n\nValeria Ramírez Castañeda says peer reviewers shouldn’t penalize a lack of English fluency.Credit: Valeria Ramírez Castañeda\n\nFortunately, many journals have begun to offer other kinds of peer review — such as double-anonymous review, in which both author and reviewer identities are concealed. This can help to prevent problematic comments and review-related rejections when reviewers are biased against authors from some demographics or nations. IOP Publishing (IOPP), a publisher of physical-science journals in Bristol, UK, has found few differences in overall rejection rates for papers with double-anonymous reviews compared with single-anonymous ones. However, an internal analysis of 2024 data covering around 28,000 papers suggests that some groups might benefit from double-anonymous reviews. Scientists in Africa were 4% more likely to have their paper accepted when the authors chose to be anonymous during the peer-review stage. But there is no clear trend for women and non-binary authors, says Laura Feetham-Walker, IOPP’s reviewer-engagement manager. And, in some scientific fields, “it’s not that challenging [for a reviewer] to identify who the senior authors are on any paper”, even if they are anonymized, notes Simon Harold, chief editor of Nature Ecology & Evolution in London. (Nature’s Careers team is independent of the journal’s publisher, Springer Nature, which also publishes Nature Ecology & Evolution and other Nature Portfolio journals.)\n\nMany journals, including the BMJ, Nature and some of the other Nature Portfolio journals (see go.nature.com/4nvd9zs), also offer open, or transparent, peer review. In this case, the reviews — and sometimes the referees’ identities — are published with the paper. Although this practice can encourage more-considerate behaviour, early-career scientists often worry about retaliation when critically reviewing papers from more-senior or influential authors. The sense of being able to speak freely with anonymity “is why I think the anonymous peer-review system is the default”, Harold adds.\n\nShould I tell anyone that I suspect misconduct in a paper I’m reviewing?\n\nWhen biologist Mayank Chugh was pursuing a master’s degree, members of his lab group in India received harsh feedback and demoralizing comments about their written English in some of their papers. So, they decided to submit his first paper to the journal eLife. The journal has both a consultative review process — in which editors and reviewers discuss the manuscript together and share consolidated feedback with the authors — and a policy to publish reviews and encourage reviewers to disclose their names. “We trusted that process over what we had experienced before,” says Chugh, who is now at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a member of eLife’s early-career advisory group. Morteza Mahmoudi, a nanoscientist and anti-bullying researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing, takes further steps when he anticipates an unproductive peer-review process — something he has often experienced with papers that challenge commercially important assumptions in his field. He now asks editors to exclude certain researchers from reviewing — an option that many journals provide. In these cases, “I don’t get those unnecessary delays in the process or harsh comments”, says Mahmoudi.\n\nAfter receiving a reviewer’s report, if authors aren’t sure whether the language is problematic, Feetham-Walker recommends that the authors ask themselves: “Has this comment helped me to improve my paper, or has it just undermined my confidence?” Importantly, peer review should critique only the science, she adds. “The main defining factor of unprofessional comments is that they are personal.” If still in doubt, Mahmoudi advises authors to consult their colleagues.\n\nIt’s important to remember that harsh reviews can help authors to improve their paper, notes Mirvat Alasnag, an interventional cardiologist at King Fahad Armed Forces Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. “If it’s not what you wanted to hear, leave the noise behind, but try as hard as you can to look at the comments and see if they’re valuable,” she says.\n\nHowever, in the case of especially egregious comments, she and others recommend flagging the problematic behaviour to the manuscript-handling editor (see ‘How to avoid — and push back on — peer review bullying’). Silbiger suggests that authors write an e-mail thanking the editor and reviewer for the critical appraisal and noting that they will take the suggestions into consideration. Then, they should detail the comments they felt were unethical and unprofessional and ask that those comments be removed from the review process — and possibly flagged to the reviewer as being unhelpful.\n\nHow to avoid — and push back on — peer-review bullying\n\nResearchers advise on how to avoid and address problematic comments from reviewers.\n\nChoose the right journal. Consider journals that have transparent, open review processes in which reviews are made public, for instance, or that give authors the option to veto certain reviewers.\n\nFocus on the science. Try to isolate the scientific critiques in problematic reviews, and if they’re valuable, focus on addressing them. If in doubt, get a second opinion from colleagues on whether a comment is worth addressing.\n\nWrite to the editor. Thank the editor for their time and politely point out the specific comments you found discriminatory or rude.\n\nConsider appealing. If you think that a problematic review has unduly influenced the review process and led to a rejection, consider appealing the editor’s decision.\n\nAfter Silbiger revised her manuscript in 2014 — and reviewer three responded with further unprofessional comments — her PhD supervisor wrote to the journal’s chief editor. After explaining how the team had addressed the valid criticisms and pointing out the unprofessional remarks that couldn’t be addressed, she asked the chief editor to decide whether to accept or reject the paper. The paper was ultimately published and has been cited 88 times. “If you’re junior, sometimes it helps to have your senior author be the one to write the letter,” Silbiger says.",

One of the topics that will be discussed is how research might be restricted to prevent the creation of organisms made of components that are the mirror image of those that make up life on Earth. Days after the Manchester meeting, the issue will be examined at a workshop organized by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. And other meetings are planned.\n\nHow should ‘mirror life’ research be restricted? Debate heats up\n\nMost of the biological molecules known to make up life on Earth have a specific handedness, or chirality. Amino acids have left-handed chirality, for example, whereas DNA is right-handed. Because mirror-image bacteria or other synthetic life forms would be made of molecules of opposite handedness (so with right-handed amino acids and left-handed DNA), the concern is that such organisms might represent a hazard to known life1–3 (see also go.nature.com/3hshyst and go.nature.com/3vwuytw). For example, some of them might be capable of evading immune systems, confounding medicines, resisting predation and causing harms to humans, non-human animals, plants and ecosystems2,3.\n\nProhibiting the creation of molecules or biological entities of either chirality that could endanger human health or environmental stability should be uncontroversial. And discussions early in the development of a field — as well as efforts to engage the public — can be constructive when it comes to ensuring that research is conducted responsibly and ethically.\n\nBut in the face of vast unknowns, the noble path of pre-emptively protecting humanity from potential risks in the distant future can be slippery. And we should tread cautiously.\n\nThe concept of a mirror-image biological world is not new. It was first proposed in 1860 by French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur4. And the potential benefits and risks of mirror-image organisms have been discussed by the research community for more than 30 years1–3 (see also go.nature.com/3hshyst and go.nature.com/3vwuytw). However, in the past few months, the conversation has abruptly shifted to calls for hard limits on basic research and funding2.\n\nAt this point, there are divergent views (see go.nature.com/46tgjvf and eLetters by R. Derda et al. and D. Perrin in ref. 2) on how soon it might be possible to create mirror-image organisms; the potential benefits and risks of generating mirror-image life and of developing precursor technologies; whether moratoria on research should be imposed; and, if so, what areas of study should be restricted.\n\nGiven the countless unanswered questions, careful consideration of the scientific facts learnt so far — regarding what it would take to create a mirror-image life form, and the pros and cons of research on mirror-image molecular biology more broadly — is crucial for bridging divergent views and fostering rational and informed debate.\n\nOn the distant horizon\n\nIn December 2024, nearly 40 experts, including in synthetic biology, ecology and immunology, co-authored a Policy Forum article in Science2 and released a separate 299-page technical report3. In both, the authors argued that were mirror-image life created, it would be very likely to present unprecedented risks to humans, animals, plants and ecosystems.\n\nMultiple meetings have followed the Science publication, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, France and the Netherlands.\n\nBut how close are scientists to being able to create a mirror-image life form?\n\nScientists have been pondering the idea of a mirror-image world of biology for more than a century.Credit: Jorg Greuel/Getty\n\nDozens of research groups, including those at pharmaceutical companies, have been synthesizing and investigating mirror-image proteins, DNA and RNA for the past three decades to understand fundamental biology and develop therapeutics5–14. My colleagues and I have been exploring various mirror-image molecular processes, too. These include the replication of mirror-image DNA, the transcription of mirror-image DNA into mirror-image RNA and the translation of mirror-image RNA into mirror-image proteins — in other words, a mirror-image version of the central dogma of molecular biology7–11.\n\nResearch in mirror-image molecular biology is still in its infancy. But scientists working in this field have been humbled by the tremendous challenges of exploring this unknown world5–14. The creation of mirror-image organisms, if it ever became feasible, would face monumental conceptual and technical barriers.\n\nHundreds to thousands of cellular components — including proteins, nucleic acids, membranes, metabolites and complex carbohydrates called glycans — would need to be synthesized chemically or enzymatically in their chirally inverted forms. Some of these are encoded directly by DNA. But many are synthesized or modified by other complex biological machinery, meaning their compositions and structures cannot simply be derived from DNA sequences. And many have not yet been characterized.\n\nIt took our group nearly four years to chemically synthesize a mirror-image protein fragment of up to around 470 amino acids9 — the longest single-chain mirror-image polypeptide reported so far. Synthesizing longer polypeptides and membrane proteins that are rich in water-repelling (hydrophobic) domains would be even harder.\n\nAsilomar conference took courage and foresight — today, inclusivity would also be crucial\n\nLikewise, we have been trying to chemically synthesize a highly simplified version of a mirror-image ribosome since 2016, and are still years away from achieving it. Should we succeed, this ribosome will lack protein and RNA modifications and will not have aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (the enzymes responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding transfer RNAs during protein biosynthesis)8,11. This means it will be able to produce only short peptides and small proteins (say, of about 300 amino acids)8.\n\nEven if all the constituent molecules of the simplest bacterium could be synthesized in their mirror-image forms, these would need to be folded correctly and assembled with spatio-temporal precision to create a mirror-image bacterium that functions as a complex, autonomously replicating cell.\n\nMany laboratories have built non-living membrane-bound compartments, in which copies of DNA and RNA molecules can be made or in which RNA molecules can be translated into proteins. Although researchers have been able to isolate biologically derived ribosomes and other cellular machinery with natural chirality for decades, no lab has been able to use this machinery to produce all the essential cellular components in vitro.\n\nResearchers don’t yet know how to assemble a natural-chirality self-replicating cell from biologically derived building blocks — let alone how to chemically synthesize a mirror-image one from the ground up. And although other strategies for the creation of mirror-image life have been proposed (such as the stepwise conversion of a natural-chirality cell into a mirror-image cell2,3), there is insufficient evidence to support their feasibility.\n\nIn short, it is crucial to distinguish mirror-image molecular biology from the creation of mirror-image organisms. A self-replicating cell has molecular diversity, metabolic complexity and structural intricacy that are orders of magnitude greater than what’s found in any currently synthesizable biomolecular system. And the creation of a mirror-image organism lies well beyond the reach of present-day science.\n\nEndless possibilities\n\nBecause all biological structures, functions and even organisms could be recreated in their mirror image, the possibilities — good and bad — in a looking-glass world are endless. As well as considering the risks of hypothetical scenarios, such as the creation of mirror-image life, it is important to keep in mind the realized and potential benefits of the mirror-image molecular biology research that is already under way5–14.\n\nWhen given to animals or humans, mirror-image peptides and nucleic-acid drugs can trigger a much milder immune response compared with their natural-chirality counterparts13. They are also more resistant to biodegradation, which means a dose can stay in the body for much longer. The implications for drug discovery are profound.\n\nMirror-image enzyme copies looking-glass DNA\n\nDozens of mirror-image peptides, DNA and RNA molecules are already being developed as drug candidates for cancer, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases and inflammatory disorders10,13. Indeed, a synthesized mirror-image ribosome would probably drastically accelerate pharmaceutical discovery by enabling the high-throughput production of mirror-image peptides8,11.\n\nAll sorts of other possible applications of mirror-image molecules or biological entities can be imagined, particularly in medicine and sustainability.\n\nMirror-image glucose tastes as sweet as its natural-chirality counterpart, but does not provide calories because it is not metabolized by the enzymes found in natural-chirality organisms15. This means that mirror-image glucose and other mirror-image sugars could serve as non-caloric sweeteners or other food additives.\n\nMirror-image DNA molecules have the same capacity to hold information as their natural-chirality counterparts do, but they are more resistant to biodegradation and easier to distinguish from contaminant (natural-chirality) DNA. As such, mirror-image DNA molecules can serve as robust information repositories9.\n\nNanoparticles or nanocapsules, built using mirror-image proteins, could enable the safe delivery of drugs by shielding them from the immune system. Mirror-image DNA or RNA molecules designed to detect the presence of certain human proteins and metabolites, such as thrombin10 and guanine11, could be used as diagnostic biosensors in clinical settings.\n\nMeanwhile, mirror-image versions of enzymes that are capable of degrading plastics that have no chirality could offer a solution to plastic pollution12. Like their natural-chirality counterparts, such enzymes can break down plastics but are more resistant to biodegradation themselves. In principle, mirror-image versions of enzymes that can capture carbon might similarly be used to help address climate change.\n\nPlastic-consuming bacteria, shown in this artist’s impression, contain enzymes that degrade plastics. Biostable mirror-image versions of these proteins could offer a solution to plastic pollution.Credit: Thomas Parsons/Science Photo Library\n\nAs well as providing solutions for all sorts of practical problems, basic research on biology through the looking glass could offer insights into the structures and functions of biomolecules. It could shed light on the origin of homochirality (the dominance of one set of chiral molecules in known forms of life), and even on the origin of life11. It could guide searches for new life forms, for instance, on Earth as well as on other planets.\n\nOf course, the very properties that promise to make mirror-image proteins and nucleic acids so useful in so many contexts — their biostability and tendency to induce only a mild immune response in humans and other organisms — could also make certain mirror-image organisms harmful1–3 (see also go.nature.com/3hshyst and go.nature.com/3vwuytw).",

They are often “parasitic relationships” in which members of one species decline and those of another survive by exploiting their bond.

          "abstract": "Madeleine Cheung in front of a model of the Voyager spacecraft during one of her visits to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Credit: Madeleine Cheung\n\nM.C.: In October 2023, two months into an America and World Relations course at my secondary school in Los Angeles, California, our teacher told us to find a mentor working in a field in which we were interested in pursuing a career.\n\nI wanted mine to be a scientist who could tell me about their day-to-day role and how they use their work to further humanity’s knowledge.\n\nBut I wasn’t sure how to find one. My teacher suggested using my existing network, such as friends’ parents. But a friend encouraged me to approach C.M., a carbon-cycle and ecosystems researcher, when he spoke to our class about his work at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), based at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. This was my first interaction with someone in environmental science, a field I hope to work in. He agreed to be my mentor.\n\nOur first virtual meeting was in May 2024, and was followed by a couple more over the summer break. We talked about how a scientist finds and publishes knowledge, which introduced me to various types of journal. We also made a plan for the upcoming school year (during which we met virtually for 30 minutes each week), focusing on the research areas I was interested in learning more about and, hopefully, contributing to.\n\nGetting started\n\nDuring our weekly meetings, we talked about C.M.’s research on Arctic tipping points (an abrupt or irreversible change into a qualitatively different state), and I gradually started to play a more active part in the sessions by finding papers and summarizing their findings. This February, I visited C.M. at JPL, where I met his colleagues, who shared their career journeys with me.\n\nAt the end of my two-year America and World Relations course, I gave a presentation reflecting on my experience with C.M., including how we met, what we did and what I learnt. His mentorship provided invaluable exposure to careers in science and gave me a real understanding of research. Tasks I completed, such as literature reviews, could form part of C.M.’s research paper on Arctic tipping points, and that has given me confidence in my ability to contribute to scientific work.\n\nThe mentorship also challenged some of my misconceptions. I had assumed that, to go into environmental science, I would need to focus on this for my bachelor’s degree. However, C.M.’s degree is in chemistry and history. This taught me that you can take various routes into science, and that your undergraduate years should be a time of exploration.\n\nI learnt that science is, first and foremost, one big group project (often a global collaboration, in fact), rather than a lonely pursuit full of technical jargon and rigid methods, which is how some of my peers perceive it.\n\nThe mentorship also introduced me to resources such as Google Scholar and the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, showing me how open science can provide free, accessible knowledge. I realized that C.M. uses some of the same tools that I used at school, such as group to-do lists and presentations to summarize work for others. As a result, science feels more attainable, and less like a far-off fantasy restricted to the most brilliant minds.\n\nMixing it up\n\nMy mentoring experience with C.M. wasn’t my only exposure to careers in science during my time at school; I also took part in the Summer High School Intensive Next-Generation Engineering program at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. As part of environmental engineer Burçin Becerik-Gerber’s research group, I worked on a project that aimed to understand how energy dashboards in residential homes can motivate people to reduce their energy usage.\n\nThe other two school students in that group were male, as were the two PhD students we worked with. Meanwhile, at school, in my combined physics and chemistry class, I was one of only two female students in a class of seven, with a male teacher.\n\nThese experiences reminded me that being a young woman in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) can seem daunting, despite the strides society has made to embrace gender equality in the STEM fields.\n\nOverall, I now feel more comfortable about stepping into a male-dominated field. I hope to use my experience to relate to and motivate girls and young women to pursue STEM-related careers.\n\nHere are three tips I would give to any secondary-school student looking to get immersed in the world of science and research.\n\nFirst, keeping an open mind allows you to step into situations and experiences that you might not have thought possible. Throughout the mentorship, I carried out tasks despite having doubts about my ability. Although it is important to have some goals in mind, having too many expectations while still at school can prevent you from reaching your potential and truly getting the most out of the journey.\n\nMentoring resources\n\nSecond, asking about the possibility of a mentorship in person, rather than digitally, such as over e-mail, makes the relationship more personable from the beginning and gives you a higher chance of receiving a follow-up. Before meeting C.M., I had reached out to three people online, but found that cold e-mailing was ineffective.\n\nLast, I found that having the support of your school, and specifically that of a teacher who can vouch for you, is indispensable in ensuring that the process goes as smoothly as possible. If other adults are already aware of your goal, it can open the door to more connections, and reassure the person you reach out to.\n\nMoving on\n\nThe world I was born into has changed from simply questioning climate change and the reasons for it to joining together to mitigate its effects. I have grown into a young woman confident in following a path of environmental advocacy through STEM. By 2030, I will have finished the undergraduate degree that I started last month, and hope to have been witness to a crucial climatic milestone: the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 45% to keep the global temperature increase under 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nBut immersing myself in professional science while still at school has convinced me that I need not be just a witness; with the right tools, I feel ready to use my voice to be a positive contributor to a more sustainable world.\n\nSecondary-school student Madeleine Cheung visited environmental scientist David Miller at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.Credit: Madeleine Cheung\n\nC.M.: My daughter attends the International School of Los Angeles, and once or twice a year I go there to talk to the science classes.

          "title": "AI is helping to decode animals’ speech. Will it also let us talk with them?",
          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Deep in the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mélissa Berthet found bonobos doing something thought to be uniquely human.\n\nHow to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI\n\nDuring the six months that Berthet observed the primates, they combined calls in several ways to make complex phrases1. In one example, bonobos (Pan paniscus) that were building nests together added a yelp, meaning ‘let’s do this’, to a grunt that says ‘look at me’. “It’s really a way to say: ‘Look at what I’m doing, and let’s do this all together’,” says Berthet, who studies primates and linguistics at the University of Rennes, France.\n\nIn another case, a peep that means ‘I would like to do this’ was followed by a whistle signalling ‘let’s stay together’. The bonobos combine the two calls in sensitive social contexts, says Berthet. “I think it’s to bring peace.”\n\nThe study, reported in April, is one of several examples from the past few years that highlight just how sophisticated vocal communication in non-human animals can be. In some species of primate, whale2and bird, researchers have identified features and patterns of vocalization that have long been considered defining characteristics of human language. These results challenge ideas about what makes human language special — and even how ‘language’ should be defined.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, many scientists turn to artificial intelligence (AI) tools to speed up the detection and interpretation of animal sounds, and to probe aspects of communication that human listeners might miss. “It’s doing something that just wasn’t possible through traditional means,” says David Robinson, an AI researcher at the Earth Species Project, a non-profit organization based in Berkeley, California, that is developing AI systems to decode communication across the animal kingdom.\n\nAs the research advances, there is increasing interest in using AI tools not only to listen in on animal speech, but also to potentially talk back.\n\nCombining calls\n\nResearchers studying animal communication ask some of the same types of question that linguists do. How are speech sounds physically produced (phonetics)? How are sounds combined to make meaningful units (morphology)? What rules determine how phrases and sentences are structured (syntax)?\n\nUntil about a decade ago, researchers thought that only humans used a feature known in linguistics as compositionality. This is the combining of meaningful words, calls or other noises into expressions that have a meaning derived from those of their parts.\n\nA human gene makes mice squeak differently — did it contribute to language?\n\nBut in 2016, a study of Japanese tits (Parus minor) changed how scientists thought about compositionality. The birds looked for predators when they heard an ‘alert’ call and approached a sound’s source after hearing a ‘recruitment’ call. When they heard the calls in that order, they performed both behaviours3. But they didn’t do so when the order was reversed, suggesting compositionality: the combination of calls had its own meaning.\n\nA study in 2023 extended that work. By presenting chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with fake snakes in the wild, scientists showed that the primates similarly combine ‘alarm’ and ‘recruitment’ vocalizations into a message that prompts others to gather around the caller to respond to a threat4.\n\nHowever, humans remained the only species known to use compositionality in more than one way. For instance, by ordering words differently to change the meaning of the phrase, adding endings to words to modify meaning and creating metaphors and idioms to produce a figurative expression.\n\nBonobos in the Democratic Republic of the Congo combine calls into phrases in several ways.Credit: Christian Ziegler/Nature Picture Library\n\nBut the study by Berthet and her colleagues softened that distinction between humans and other animals. They recorded 700 calls by 30 adult bonobos and found that the animals combined a finite number of calls in four ways1. One — a yelp–grunt combination — the authors considered to have ‘trivial’ compositionality, because the meaning of the individual calls had merely been combined. (For instance, ‘the red car’ describes an object that is both red and a car.) In the three other cases, one call modified the other, resulting in ‘non-trivial’ compositionality. (‘A terrible actor’ describes a person who is bad at acting, not someone who is terrible and an actor.)\n\nEvolutionary biologist Cédric Girard-Buttoz at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, France, and his colleagues reported in May that chimpanzees also combine a finite number of calls in several ways5. For some vocalizations, the meaning of the combined phrase can’t be determined from the meaning of the individual calls, as is the case for some idioms in human languages. For example, a hoot, used when resting on the ground, followed by a pant, which signifies playing and affiliation, prompted the chimpanzees to climb a tree, make a nest and rest together, even though neither call is typically associated with tree climbing, says Girard-Buttoz. Generating meaning in several ways is a building block of language, he adds.\n\nWhales, too, have some notable features of human language. Researchers at Project CETI, a non-profit organization in New York City, have been tracking and recording sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) off the coast of the Caribbean island of Dominica to compile a large data set of movements and sounds. By finding patterns that link whale sounds and behaviours, the scientists hope to translate ‘whale speak’.\n\nCETI linguist Gašper Beguš has been training generative-AI models to produce sounds and sequences of sounds that mimic those made by sperm whales. Whereas humans create distinct sounds by sending air through vocal folds in the throat, which vibrate at different frequencies, these whales send air through a lip-like structure in their nasal passage, which vibrates and creates clicks. The clicks are grouped into units called codas.\n\nScientists attach sensors that can gather bioacoustic and other data to sperm whales using drones.Credit: Jaime Rojo\n\nCETI scientists reported last year that sperm whales have their own ‘phonetic alphabet’, with codas varying in characteristics such as tempo and rhythm6. Beguš and his colleagues have since found that whale codas can differ in ways analogous to vowels and diphthongs in human language. Vowels in human speech differ on the basis of the tongue’s position and the shape of the lips, such as for the ‘ee’ in cheese versus the ‘o’ in hot. Diphthongs, or gliding vowels, are created by combining two vowels in a single syllable, such as in ‘pout’, resulting in a frequency change as the lips and tongue move.\n\nBeguš’s team identified two codas with distinct sound patterns that the researchers called an a-vowel and i-vowel. They also found that these vowels changed frequency in four ways: they can rise, they can fall, they can fall then rise or they can rise then fall7. The frequency changes could be indicative of diphthongs.\n\nWhat’s in a language\n\nWhether the sophistication of animal communication is enough to qualify it as language depends on how a person defines the term and what they think about how animals think. There are two prevailing views, Beguš says. “One world view says that language and complex thought are intrinsically connected.” According to this view, complex thought came first and language is a way to externalize thoughts. If so, animals can’t have a language unless they are capable of complex thought.\n\nThe other view holds that language is just one kind of communication, like gestures or facial expressions, and complex thought isn’t required. In this case, animals could have a language with or without complex thought. Experiments that train animals to communicate with humans, such as those with the bonobo Kanzi, who died earlier this year, have hinted that animals might be capable of having a language. But that’s a different question from whether they use language on their own in the wild.\n\n“The word is still out on whether we’ll find a full-on language,” says Robinson.\n\nFor one, some aspects of human language haven’t been found in other species yet. Three of the 16 features — displacement, productivity and duality — on a language checklist created by linguist Charles Hockett haven’t been identified in non-human animals.\n\nWhat do dolphins talk about? One biologist is trying to listen in\n\nDisplacement is the ability to talk about abstract concepts, such as the past, the future or things that are distant. This feature hasn’t been seen convincingly in animal communication, although there is anecdotal evidence in some instances, such as dolphins calling the names of other dolphins that had disappeared years ago, and orangutans (Pongo spp.) telling others about a predator that was previously in an area, Berthet says.\n\nProductivity is the ability to say things that have never been said or heard before, and be understood by another individual.\n\nAnd duality describes meaningful messages made up of smaller meaningful units, which consist of even smaller, meaningless sounds. Although whales use clicks to create longer codas, scientists haven’t yet shown that clicks are meaningless and codas are meaningful.\n\nRecursion is another feature that might be unique to human language. This is when sentences or phrases are embedded in each other to create deeper levels of meaning. By training crows (Corvus corone) to peck at open and closed brackets in the appropriate sequence on a touch screen, Diana Liao, who studies vocal communication and cognition at the University of Tübingen in Germany, and her colleagues found evidence that the animals are mentally capable of recursion8. “They do this even better than macaque monkeys and on par with human toddlers”, Liao says. However, it’s not clear whether crows use it in their communication.\n\nIt’s also unclear whether animals have grammatical rules that define how vocal communication is structured. And, although primates have been shown to mix and match calls to generate meaning, the number of meanings that they can produce is “really far from what humans can do”, says Girard-Buttoz.\n\nAI decodes the calls of the wild",

          "abstract": "Seasonal changes in time policy, such as switching between Standard Time (SDT) and Daylight Saving Time (DST), have been adopted by many countries, including the United States. While transitioning between SDT and DST has notable acute negative population health impacts, the chronic impact of these time policies on health has not been well evaluated. To estimate the impact of permanent SDT or DST on health, we modeled the circadian impact of SDT, DST, and Biannual Shifting (BAS) across a year in the contiguous, continental United States. We find that BAS produces a greater burden on the circadian system as compared to either permanent SDT or DST. Chronotype as well as location (latitude and location within time zones) impact this burden. Analyzing these data relative to county-level health data (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Places dataset), we find that, under idealized light exposure conditions and after controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, there would be a decrease in the prevalence of both obesity [ − 0.78% ( − 0.06% to − 1.49%)] and stroke [ − 0.09% ( − 0.04% to − 0.14%)] under SDT compared with the current policy. The prevalence of both obesity [ − 0.51% ( − 0.09% to − 0.93%)] and stroke [ − 0.07% ( − 0.04% to − 0.09%)] would also decrease under permanent DST, though to a lesser degree. Our data, reflecting the impact of time policy on circadian burden and subsequent health benefits, support the cessation of BAS.",

However, to date, the literature on environmental policy has considered only the incentives for individual parties (e.g., firms, landowners, or individuals) to take steps (i.e., exert “effort”) to reduce pollution or meet resource management goals where those steps impact that party’s own environmental footprint or performance. Missing from the literature is any consideration of the ability of one party to undertake activities that instead help another improve the latter’s performance. Such help could be either a substitute for or a complement to one’s own effort. This paper presents an analysis showing that traditional policy approaches based on individual performance cannot generally efficiently incentivize both effort and help, but a (properly designed) collective approach where rewards or punishments are based on group performance can. This suggests an additional rationale for the use of collective approaches as a potentially important tool for promoting sustainability that has not been recognized in the literature.",

          "abstract": "Social networks scaffold the diffusion of information on social media. Much attention has been given to the spread of true vs. false content on online social platforms, including the structural differences between their diffusion patterns. However, much less is known about how platform interventions on false content alter the engagement with and diffusion of such content. In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,078 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 46.1% in reposts, 44.1% in likes, 21.9% in replies, and 13.5% in views after being attached. Over the posts’ entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.6% fewer reposts, 13.3% fewer likes, 6.9% fewer replies, and 5.5% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep and less “viral,” but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach. This structural difference contrasts notably with differences between false vs. true content diffusion itself, where false information diffuses farther, but with structural patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable from those of true information, conditional on reach.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms have become vital channels for businesses to reach consumers through advertising. But in the United States, the digital advertising market in which these platforms operate is dominated by a few major players, raising concerns for antitrust regulators. In such a concentrated market, the entry or exit of a single platform can reallocate billions in ad spending, affecting businesses and users. TikTok’s temporary suspension in the United States in January 2025 provides a unique natural experiment to examine how the removal of a major player would shift advertising demand and supply on competitors, specifically Facebook and Instagram, revealing the degree of substitutability across platforms and the intensity of competition. Using a difference-in-differences approach comparing advertising activity in the United States to other countries, we find that Meta ad volume and spend rose by 6.3% and 22.4%, as a result of the outage, without a corresponding increase in ad impressions. Consequently, Meta ad prices, as measured by cost per thousand impressions, jumped by 12.1%. Shifts in demand were three times greater for larger advertisers relative to smaller ones, suggesting that Meta platforms and TikTok are closer substitutes for larger firms and that a TikTok ban would therefore impose greater challenges on smaller businesses.",

We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g., upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% (SE = 4%) and 14% (SE = 3%) of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56 (SE = 0.17). Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset.

          "abstract": "Scientific explanation is one of the most sophisticated forms of human reasoning. Nevertheless, here we hypothesize that scientific explanation is susceptible to some of the same biases that influence everyday thinking—particularly during the initial stages of theory building, when scientists are first grappling with complex phenomena and are thus more likely to rely on explanatory “guesses.” Specifically, we investigated whether scientific explanation exhibits an inherence bias—a tendency to explain phenomena through inherent or intrinsic features rather than extrinsic factors such as context or relations. Consistent with this hypothesis, a comprehensive analysis of major explanatory transitions across the history of Western science revealed that initial scientific explanations systematically favored inherent properties, while subsequent explanations incorporated extrinsic factors more consistently. Seven experiments with lay participants (both adults and children; N = 1,673) and two experiments with practicing scientists from top departments worldwide ( N = 275) provided converging evidence for this bias and identified the psychological mechanisms involved. When explaining unfamiliar phenomena, even leading scientists showed a robust tendency to overweight inherent properties and underweight extrinsic factors relative to established scientific understanding. This bias appears rooted in basic cognitive constraints on attention and memory that excessively narrow the space of hypotheses initially considered. These findings advance our understanding of both the psychology of explanation and the development of scientific knowledge, while suggesting specific ways to improve scientific training and education.",

          "abstract": "The optimal control of finite-time processes on the microscale is of significant theoretical and practical interest, particularly for the energy-efficient operation of nanomachines. While previous studies have primarily focused on transitions between equilibrium states, many biologically and technologically relevant processes occur far from equilibrium. In such nonequilibrium settings, memory, a ubiquitous feature in realistic systems, plays an intricate role, as any driving necessarily excites internal memory modes. This motivates a deeper exploration of optimal control strategies in nonequilibrium regimes. Here, we combine experiments, theory, and computational methods to investigate the transition of a colloidal particle confined in an optical trap between two nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). We identify optimal control protocols that minimize the thermodynamic work during the finite-time transition between two NESS. We compare optimal protocols in viscous and viscoelastic fluid environments, which are common in realistic technical and biological processes and introduce memory due to a delayed response. Regardless of the presence of memory effects, optimal protocols consistently balance energy extraction with dissipation minimization. In the presence of memory, optimal control is achieved if the protocol matches the time response of the environment. These findings offer key insights for designing optimal control strategies for finite-time, nonequilibrium processes in complex environments.",

Since necroptosis leads to the release of intracellular content, the fate of RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils after necroptotic cell death has not been investigated. Here, we tracked RIPK1 and RIPK3 coassemblies and found that these fibrillar aggregates could be released into the culture medium after the membrane rupture in necroptotic cells. Interestingly, these RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils were capable of infiltrating recipient cells and acting as seeds for the nucleation and formation of the endogenous necrosome. Cryo electron microscopy structural analysis unveiled a distinctive S-shaped conformation common to RHIM fibrils of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which can facilitate the cross-seeding of RIPK3 by RIPK1 or RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils. Our findings suggest the ability of functional RIPK1/RIPK3 amyloid fibrils in intercellular spreading to induce protein conformation change in recipient cells and provide structural insights into the mechanism of RIPK1 and RIPK3 cross-templating to drive necroptosis.",

          "abstract": "Crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have revolutionized pest management, but their benefits have been reduced by evolution of practical resistance in at least 31 cases. To delay evolution of resistance, farmers have shifted from crops producing one Bt protein to crops called pyramids that produce two or more Bt proteins or other traits targeting each pest. Here, we focus on resistance to transgenic corn pyramids in the western corn rootworm ( Diabrotica virgifera virgifera ) and northern corn rootworm ( Diabrotica barberi ), which cost farmers in the United States $2 billion yearly in yield losses. We analyzed 998 relevant data values for 2005 to 2023 from 12 published field studies. The results support the hypothesis that rootworm resistance to Bt proteins Cry3Bb and Gpp34/Tpp35Ab reduces the efficacy of pyramids that produce one or both of these proteins and an RNA interference trait (DvSnf7) targeting rootworms, despite no apparent strong cross-resistance between the Bt proteins and DvSnf7. The reduced efficacy of pyramids producing Bt proteins and DvSnf7 entails increased root injury and emergence of adult beetles. Efficacy of DvSnf7 was substantially lower for reducing root injury than emergence. Because root injury decreases yield, the increased root injury has immediate practical consequences. More sustainable control may be achieved by deploying pyramids with traits that are each highly effective against rootworms, increasing the abundance of host plants that do not target rootworms, and combining transgenic corn with crop rotation and other control tactics in integrated pest management programs.",

          "abstract": "To survive in highly competitive environments, bacteria use specialized secretion systems to deliver antibacterial toxins into neighboring cells, thereby inhibiting their growth. In many Gram-positive bacteria, the export of such toxins requires a membrane-bound molecular apparatus known as the type VIIb secretion system (T7SSb). Recently, it was shown that toxin recruitment to the T7SSb requires a physical interaction between a toxin and two or more so-called targeting factors, which harbor key residues required for T7SS-dependent protein export. However, in addition to these targeting factors, some toxins additionally require a protein belonging to the DUF4176 protein family. Here, by examining two toxin–DUF4176 protein pairs, we demonstrate that DUF4176 constitutes a family of toxin-specific molecular chaperones. In addition to being required for toxin stability in producing cells, we find that DUF4176 proteins facilitate toxin export by specifically interacting with a previously uncharacterized intrinsically disordered region found in many T7SS toxins. Using X-ray crystallography, we determine structures of several DUF4176 chaperones in their unbound state, and of a DUF4176 chaperone in complex with the binding site of its cognate toxin. These structures reveal that this binding site consists of a disordered amphipathic α-helix that requires interaction with its cognate chaperone for proper folding. Overall, we have identified a family of secretion system associated molecular chaperones found throughout T7SSb-containing Gram-positive bacteria.",

Protein-coding circular RNA (circRNA) is an emerging class of RNA cargo that offers increased stability compared to mRNA with potentially reduced immunogenicity, but delivery technologies for intracellular delivery of circRNA remain underexplored. Here, we develop an optimized lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform for circRNA delivery to immune cells, observing strong and durable transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. We employ a design-of-experiments (DoE) methodology to identify key formulation parameters for enhanced circRNA delivery and, upon intramuscular administration of our optimized circRNA LNPs to mice, observe substantial accumulation within draining lymph nodes and strong dendritic cell (DC) maturation at short time points. Applying this optimized circRNA LNP platform to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate robust antibody production and enhanced immune responses in mice compared to vaccination with mRNA LNPs, including strong T h 1-biased cellular responses and a 3.8-fold increase in antigen-specific reciprocal endpoint IgG titers. These results provide insights into design criteria for circRNA LNP formulations and support the use of circRNA LNPs for vaccination against infectious diseases.",

These large modular enzymes typically possess three substrate-binding domains, two binding either the methyl donor or methyl acceptor, as well as a cobalamin-binding domain. Here, by challenging the current paradigm of glycine betaine (GBT) catabolism, we have identified a unique methyltransferase in aerobic environmental bacteria that has a dual function both as a methionine synthase and a GBT methyltransferase. Using the marine bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 as a model, we demonstrate that a core cobalamin-binding domain (MtgC) and a bidirectional methyltransferase (MtgD) are essential for both methionine synthesis and GBT demethylation. MtgC is phylogenetically distinct from the cobalamin-binding domains of either the classical methionine synthase (MetH) or the GBT methyltransferases found in anaerobic bacteria and archaea. Across the global ocean, mtgC expression is frequently greater than previously known GBT catabolic pathways due to its occurrence in abundant cosmopolitan marine bacteria. Thus, we uncover a unique relationship between GBT catabolism and methionine synthesis in nature and identify a major route for N-osmolyte demethylation in the global ocean.",

          "abstract": "In an ever-changing environment, animals make optimal decisions to ensure their well-being. Faced with limited food sources, they often seek foods that provide the nutrients they require to maintain homeostasis. Under extreme circumstances (e.g., infection), they may exhibit ingestive behaviors, such as seeking out substances (e.g., toxins) that suggest self-medication. Few studies, however, have investigated the mechanisms that ensue self-medication. Here, we report the selective intake of antioxidants by Drosophila melanogaster during a period of heat stress or sleep deprivation. This preference was alleviated by prefeeding them vitamin C or dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) before exposure to stress. Heat stress led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the gut, which was alleviated by the intake of vitamin C. Heat stress reduced vitamin C in hemolymph, whereas the consumption of vitamin C or DHA increased it. Furthermore, the intake of vitamin C ameliorated the intestinal barrier dysfunction and extended the survival of flies that had been exposed to chronic heat stress. The heat-induced preference for vitamin C appears to develop independently of the known peripheral chemosensory receptors for this micronutrient. We propose that fruit flies possess an interoceptive mechanism that mediates the detection of vitamin C to overcome environmental challenges.",

          "abstract": "The use of AI, or more generally data-driven algorithms, has become ubiquitous in today’s society. Yet, in many cases and especially when stakes are high, humans still make final decisions. The critical question, therefore, is whether AI helps humans make better decisions compared to a human-alone or AI-alone system. We introduce a methodological framework to answer this question empirically with minimal assumptions. We measure a decision maker’s ability to make correct decisions using standard classification metrics based on the baseline potential outcome. We consider a single-blinded and unconfounded treatment assignment, in which the provision of AI-generated recommendations is assumed to be randomized across cases, conditional on observed covariates, with final decisions made by humans. Under this study design, we show how to compare the performance of three alternative decision-making systems—human-alone, human-with-AI, and AI-alone. Importantly, the AI-alone system encompasses any individualized treatment assignment, including those not used in the original study. We also show when AI recommendations should be provided to a human-decision maker, and when one should follow such recommendations. We apply the proposed methodology to our own randomized controlled trial evaluating a pretrial risk assessment instrument. We find that the risk assessment recommendations do not improve the classification accuracy of a judge’s decision to impose cash bail. Furthermore, replacing a human judge with algorithms—the risk assessment score and a large language model in particular—yields worse classification performance.",

          "abstract": "Tissue deformations during morphogenesis can be active, driven by internal processes, or passive, resulting from stresses applied at their boundaries. Here, we introduce the Drosophila hindgut primordium as a model for studying boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis. We characterize its deformations and show that its complex shape changes can be a passive consequence of the deformations of the active regions of the embryo that surround it. First, we find an intermediate characteristic “triangular keyhole” shape in the 3D deformations of the hindgut. We construct a minimal model of the hindgut primordium as an elastic ring deformed by active midgut invagination and germ band extension on an ellipsoidal surface, which robustly captures the symmetry-breaking into this triangular keyhole shape. We then quantify the 3D kinematics of the tissue by a set of contours and find that the hindgut deforms in two stages: An initial translation on the curved embryo surface followed by a rapid breaking of shape symmetry. We extend our model to show that the contour kinematics in both stages are consistent with our passive picture. Our results suggest that the role of in-plane deformations during hindgut morphogenesis is to translate the tissue to a region with anisotropic embryonic curvature and show that uniform boundary conditions are sufficient to generate the observed nonuniform shape change. Our work thus provides a possible explanation for the various characteristic shapes of blastopore-equivalents in different organisms and a framework for the mechanical emergence of global morphologies in complex developmental systems.",

Integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with Life Cycle Costing (LCC), we quantified the environmental impacts alongside capital and operational costs, net present costs, and break-even prices of each route. The results reveal significant variation across the schemes, with Schemes #1 and #2 exhibiting the highest impacts and costs due to intensive use of chloroform and diethyl ether, while Scheme #8 demonstrated the lowest impacts and costs, benefitting from higher batch output, greener solvents, and process intensification. Scenario analyses showed that solvent recovery improves sustainability only when high recovery rates are combined with clean electricity; otherwise, the additional energy demand may offset benefits. Scale-up analysis confirmed that higher production scales substantially reduce per-gram impacts and costs, supporting economies of scale. These findings highlight the critical role of solvent management, energy sourcing, the use of sustainability assessment at the earliest stages of innovation, and process design in aligning green chemistry with economic viability. The proposed integrated LCA-LCC framework provides transferable insights to guide sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing and supports the development of evidence-based policy for greener antiviral drug production.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies with limited therapeutic options. Among the alternative targets explored for pancreatic cancer, the glycolipid stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA4) has been extensively studied. We have previously demonstrated that the chimeric anti-SSEA4 antibody with alpha-2,6-sialylated complex type biantennary glycan (SCT) or its 3-fluorosialyl derivative (FSCT) attached to the Fc-Asn297 residue exhibited enhanced binding to the Fc-receptors FcγRIIIA and FcγRIIA which are responsible for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis as well as vaccinal effect. Here, we found that high-SSEA4 expression correlates with increasing tumor proliferation and sensitivity to the glyco-optimized antibodies (anti-SSEA4-SCT and anti-SSEA4-FSCT) which preferentially recruit NKG2D-expressing natural killer cells and FcγRIIA-bearing macrophages with enhanced target killing activity. We also uncovered an immune evasion mechanism involving the interaction of sialoglycans on the cancer cell with Siglec-9 on NK cells or Siglec-10 on macrophages to block the antibody-mediated effector functions, and this immune checkpoint inhibition can be suppressed with the removal of sialic acid on cancer cells or blockade of Siglec recognition. In xenograft models, the glyco-optimized antibodies exhibited superior inhibition of tumor growth with high-SSEA4 expression compared to the wild-type antibody and persistent antitumor activity without additional antibody administration. These findings support anti-SSEA4 antibodies with enhanced effector functions and blockade of Siglec-mediated immune checkpoint as a promising therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.",

          "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) entry into host cells begins with interactions between the viral envelope proteins hemagglutinin (HA)/neuraminidase (NA) and sialic acid moieties on the cell plasma membrane. These interactions drive IAV’s lateral diffusion along the cell membrane and trigger membrane morphological changes required for endocytosis. However, directly visualizing these dynamic processes, which are crucial for IAV entry, has been challenging using conventional microscopy techniques. In this study, we enabled live-cell observation of nanoscale morphological dynamics of IAV and the cell membrane by reducing the mechanical invasiveness of atomic force microscopy (AFM). A customised cantilever with less than half the spring constant of conventional cantilevers enabled virus-view AFM imaging that preserved IAV–membrane interactions. By combining virus-view AFM with confocal microscopy, we performed correlative morphological and fluorescence observations of IAV lateral diffusion and endocytosis in living cells. Variations in diffusion coefficients of single virions suggested heterogeneity in sialic acid density on the cell membrane. NA inhibition decreased diffusion coefficients, while reduced sialic acid density increased them. The timing of clathrin accumulation at virion binding sites coincided with a decrease in diffusion coefficients, a relationship that was maintained independent of NA activity or sialic acid density. As clathrin assembly progressed, ~100-nm-high membrane bulges emerged adjacent to the virus, culminating in the complete membrane envelopment of the virus at peak clathrin accumulation. Our virus-view AFM will deepen our understanding of various virus–cell interactions, facilitate the evaluation of drug effects and promote future translational research.",

          "abstract": "R-loops are an important class of non-B DNA structures that form co-transcriptionally. Using in vitro transcription and unbiased quantitative sequencing readouts, we show that the addition of single-strand DNA binding proteins co-transcriptionally can drive a 3- to 5-fold increase of R-loop frequency without significant changes to R-loop distribution. We propose that this is caused by stabilizing and preventing the collapse of short nascent R-loops. This suggests that R-loop formation is highly dynamic and highlights single strand binding proteins as players in cellular R-loop regulation. We further show that nontemplate strand DNA nicks are powerful initiators of R-loop formation, increasing R-loop frequencies by up to two orders of magnitude. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the nontemplate strand in nick-initiated structures is often flayed away from the RNA:DNA hybrid and engaged in self-pairing, creating unique forked R-loop features. DNA nicks, one of the most frequent DNA lesions in cells, are therefore potential hotspots for opportunistic R-loop initiation and may cause the formation of a distinct class of R-loops. Overall, this work highlights the importance of the displaced single-strand on R-loop initiation and dynamics.",

          "authors": "Saini Samim, Hayden Dalton, David Phillips, Janet Hergt",
          "abstract": "The Turkana Basin is a renowned paleoanthropological region in Kenya and Ethiopia and is famous for discoveries of numerous hominin fossils and their associated cultural technologies. The Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary sequences hosting these important remains are interbedded with volcanic ash (tuff) beds that provide crucial bracketing age constraints. The Nariokotome Tuff Complex, comprising the Upper, Middle, and Lower Nariokotome Tuffs, preserves deposits that cover an important time interval during the late Early Pleistocene that saw milestone events for Homo erectus and associated technological development. Unfortunately, characterization of these tuffs has been hampered by a) overlapping published eruption ages and b) indistinguishable major element compositions. In addition, fluvial reworking of feldspar-bearing pumice clasts (the target rock for age determinations) from older volcanic deposits into younger tuff layers complicates correct age assignments. Here, we use multiple tephrochronological correlation tools, including high-resolution 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology and grain-specific major- and trace-element geochemistry, to establish a well-characterized geochemical and geochronological framework for the Nariokotome tuffs. Utilizing a modern-generation mass-spectrometer, we report distinct ages for the Upper Nariokotome Tuff at 1,233.1 ± 1.3 ka (± 1.9 ka, 2σ; including external uncertainties), the Middle Nariokotome Tuff at 1,263.4 ± 1.2 ka (± 1.9 ka) and the Lower Nariokotome Tuff at 1,285.8 ± 1.0 ka (± 2.1 ka). In addition, high-spatial resolution Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry trace element compositions provide distinct characterization of each tuff, aiding intrabasin correlation of these units. This combined methodology demonstrates the potential to resolve the stratigraphic complexities associated with assigning ages to key paleoanthropological sites.",

          "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a clinically important herpesvirus that has coevolved for millions of years with its human host, and establishes lifelong persistent infection. A substantial proportion of its 235 kb genome is dedicated to manipulating host immunity through targeting antiviral host proteins for degradation or relocalization. Quantitative proteomics of the infected cell has extensively characterized these processes, but the cell-free virion has been less well studied. We therefore carried out proteomic analysis of a clinical HCMV strain (Merlin) virion. This revealed 18 novel components, including the viral protein gpUL141, which is recognized as an NK immune-evasin that targets several host proteins (CD155, CD112, and TRAILR) when expressed within the cell. Coimmunoprecipitation of gpUL141 from virions identified interactions with viral entry glycoproteins from the trimer (gH/gL/gO), pentamer (gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A), and gH/gpUL116 complexes, as well as gB. Only interactions with gH/gB occurred in the absence of other viral proteins. Analysis supported a model in which gpUL141 homodimers independently interacted with separate gB/gH-containing complexes. gpUL141 encodes an ER retention domain that restricts trafficking through the ER/Golgi, and limited the transport of glycoprotein complexes bound by gpUL141. As a result, gpUL141 reduced levels of multiple glycoprotein complexes on the infected cell surface as well as in the virion. This reduced syncytium formation, inhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. Thus, gpUL141 represents an immune-evasin that not only targets host proteins to limit NK-cell attack, but also alters the trafficking of multiple viral glycoprotein complexes in order to evade humoral immunity.",

          "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases and biological invasions pose increasing threats to public and ecosystems health. Proactive measures—such as prevention and surveillance taken before initial detection of the pathogen or species—are essential to ensure minimal spread prior to first detection. We developed an optimization model to determine where, when, and how much effort should be allocated to prevention versus surveillance. The model accounts for imperfect detection, system dynamics, spatial heterogeneity in risk and costs and is scalable to large landscapes. We found that the most cost-effective strategy is to maintain the prevention and surveillance efforts at stable equilibrium for the majority of the time, with deviations occurring only initially to steer the system toward the equilibrium. The equilibrium effort is jointly determined by the introduction risk, management costs, and total budget. Application of this model to chronic wasting disease in New York State suggests that the optimal strategy could reduce the cumulative disease cases before initial detection by an average of 22% compared to current practice. The optimal surveillance strategy could detect the disease on average over 8 mo earlier than the current strategy.",

          "abstract": "Differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is driven by the activation of a set of genes controlled by serum response factor (SRF), a ubiquitous transcription factor with limited intrinsic transcriptional activity. Myocardin (MYOCD) is a strong transcriptional coactivator that orchestrates smooth muscle differentiation through its association with SRF. MYOCD forms nuclear condensates via its intrinsically disordered transcription activation domain (TAD), whereas SRF is diffusely distributed in the nucleus. MYOCD recruits SRF into these condensates, thereby activating the smooth muscle gene program. We engineered a “superactivator” of smooth muscle genes by replacing SRF’s weak TAD with that of MYOCD, thereby enabling SRF to form nuclear condensates and reprogram fibroblasts into SMCs. Using protein proximity labeling, quantitative proteomics and superresolution confocal microscopy, we show that condensates formed by the MYOCD TAD aggregate chromatin remodelers, RNA polymerases, and mRNA processing factors to drive smooth muscle gene expression. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms whereby nuclear condensates facilitate tissue-specific gene expression and highlight a strategy for engineering cell fate determinants by coupling condensate-forming domains to heterologous DNA-binding proteins.",

          "abstract": "Number 1A, 1948 by Jackson Pollock is a quintessential example of his action painting technique where ropes of color, drips of black, and pools of white coalesce into the layered dynamism that defines his style. While past work has identified the red and yellow pigments that form part of his core palette, the vibrant blue in the painting has remained unassigned. In this study resonance Raman spectroscopy is used to assign the blue in the painting as manganese blue. This assignment offers critical context for the conservation of his works. Importantly, assignment of this pigment enables spectroscopic investigation of the electronic structure origin of the pure hue of manganese blue and the chemical phenomena that produce its color. To probe these phenomena, resonance Raman data are coupled to magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to assign and analyze the two electronic transitions that create the blue color. This study reveals these bands are split by excited-state exchange interactions; the gap between them contains the reflected light that gives manganese blue its appearance. This sheds light on distinct advantages of molecular inorganic pigments: their ability to leverage ligand field effects in charge transfer states to create multiple intense visible absorption features and the ability to fine-tune pigment color through host lattice electrostatics.",

To enhance our understanding of dietary niche breadth, we used DNA metabarcoding to examine how diets of a widespread, model herbivore (woodrats, genus Neotoma ) respond to changing resources and the extent to which dietary specialization is conserved across space and time. We used diet data from 13 species, 57 populations, and over 500 individuals to examine predictors of niche breadth and interindividual diet variation at a landscape scale. Then, to test whether these patterns are conserved across scales, we explored the same questions using a single population sampled over 5 y and mark-recapture data from individuals sampled at least three times. We found that woodrats exhibited a continuum of dietary specialization that included species-level dietary generalists and specialists. Specialist species maintained narrow population-level niche breadths with little evidence of interindividual diet variation. In contrast, generalist species consisted of populations with varying degrees of dietary specialization and interindividual diet variation. Across sampling scales, increased population-level niche breadth was explained by both increased interindividual diet variation and increased diet richness. These results are consistent with the Niche Variation Hypothesis and suggest that diet breadth is constrained by costs of both specialization and generalization.",

To address this gap, we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate fracture propagation in LCEs. We stretch edge-cracked monodomain LCE samples, recording their stress-stretch responses and crack paths under varying initial directors and stretching rates. Our findings reveal that cracks can change direction during propagation, which are highly dependent on both the initial director and the stretching rate. To further understand LCE fracture behavior, we develop a rate-dependent phase-field fracture model, which is validated through experiments, and demonstrates the ability to predict complex fracture paths. Our study paves the way for designing LCEs with enhanced fracture properties, imperative for their future applications.",

Humanized mice, generated by transplanting human hematopoietic stem, progenitor cells into genetically modified mice, are invaluable to study human immune development and function in vivo. However, a major limitation of current models is suboptimal myelopoiesis, particularly lack of functional human neutrophils, hampering the modeling of human immune responses and chronic diseases. Here, we describe a humanized mouse model, named MaGIC for genes replaced, in the C57Bl/6 N strain, which improves human myelopoiesis and enables development of functional human neutrophils. In MaGIC mice, human cytokines M-CSF/CSF1(M), GM-CSF/CSF2(G) and IL-6(I) are knocked-in replacing mouse genes and murine IL2rg and Rag1 (a) are deleted. Human THPO in these mice supports human hematopoiesis. More importantly, insertion of human CD47 (C) under the control of endogenous mouse CD47 promoter enables xenotransplantation and human neutrophil development. MaGIC mice support all human neutrophil subsets found in human bone marrow and blood, a major improvement. This is achieved by creating a niche postirradiation for human granulocyte–macrophage progenitors via reduced murine CD47 and physiological levels of human CD47. These mice also have mature human monocytes, tissue macrophages, alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells, enabled by humanized M-CSF and GM-CSF. Human neutrophils in MaGIC mice are fully functional in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation in response to inflammation.

Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identify ddbABCDEF , a six-gene locus encoding secreted nucleases and an outer membrane transporter, essential for exogenous DNA metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron . Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with ddbABCDEF mutants reveals that this pathway significantly alters nucleobase pools in a gnotobiotic mouse model. Comparative genomic analyses demonstrate that ddbABCDEF is evolutionarily related to a natural transformation system present in Bacteroidota and has diversified into four distinct subtypes, each linked to unique DNA-processing activities in closely related gut Bacteroidales strains.

The tripartite β-lactamase assay (TPBLA), in which a protein of interest is inserted between two domains of β-lactamase, has previously been reported as capable of detecting and quantitating the aggregation of proteins and biologics in the oxidizing periplasm of Escherichia coli and used as a platform for identifying small molecule inhibitors of aggregation. Here, we repurpose the TPBLA into a high-throughput DMS platform. We validate this format using a single-site saturation library of the intrinsically disordered peptide Aβ 42 , linked to Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating strong agreement between observed variant fitness scores and variant behavior using our previously reported low-throughput TPBLA. The results of DMS revealed variant fitness scores that correlate with known amyloid-promoting regions. An in silico approach using FoldX-derived per-residue thermodynamic stability confirmed that the TPBLA reports on amyloid fibril stability. In vitro experiments support this finding, showing a strong correlation between variant fitness scores and the critical concentration of amyloid formation.

The derived model is also able to predict thermodynamically stabilizing regions in other amyloid systems, underscoring its generalizability.

The human Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor type B2 (LilrB2)/murine Paired immunoglobulin receptor B (PirB) receptors expressed in neurons and complement protein C4 have been separately implicated in pruning. Here, we report that C4d, a C4 cleavage product with unknown function, binds LilrB2/PirB with nanomolar affinity. C4d and LilrB2 colocalize at excitatory synapses in the human cerebral cortex as well as with beta amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). C4d, as well as C4, increase with age and more so in AD. To examine whether C4d-PirB interactions can drive pruning, dendritic spines—the postsynaptic structure of excitatory synapses—were monitored on L5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex: A significant decrease in dendritic spine density occurred in WT with C4d exposure, but KO of PirB completely prevented this loss. Together, our findings reveal an unexpected physiological role for C4d in pruning and imply that different complement cascade components may collaborate to engage both neuronal and glial-specific effectors of synaptic pruning.",

Tumor-associated macrophages promote mammary tumorigenesis, whereas the role of mammary tissue macrophages (MTMs) remains incompletely understood. High-dimensional immunostaining of murine mammary tumor progression revealed that MTMs were localized in the peritumoral stroma and associated with eosinophils, which were previously shown to facilitate antitumor T cell responses. The depletion of MTMs accelerated tumorigenesis in both spontaneous and orthotopically transplanted mammary tumor models. Upon induction of a productive antitumor response via the depletion of regulatory T cells, MTMs assumed an alternatively activated state and expressed eotaxins, thereby attracting eosinophils to peritumoral regions. MTMs expressed the receptor for the alarmin IL-33, which induced both MTM activation and eosinophil recruitment. These results suggest that MTMs can sense IL-33 and recruit eosinophils to facilitate antitumor immunity, a mechanism that may operate during tumor progression and be further enhanced during productive antitumor responses.",

          "abstract": "G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large class of membrane proteins that mediate cellular responses to a wide range of external signals and as such constitute major drug targets. While oligomerization has been shown to play a well-established role in modulating signaling for class C GPCRs (e.g., the glutamate and GABA receptors), the functional relevance of oligomerization for class A receptors, such as the β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR), remains unclear. Here, we have examined the influence of the membrane mimetic environment on the dimerization propensity of β 1 AR using a combination of pulsed Q-band double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and single-molecule fluorescence brightness measurements in an Anti-Brownian Elektrokinetic trap. While β 1 AR is predominantly monomeric in docecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) micelles, reconstitution of β 1 AR in lipid nanodiscs preferentially favors symmetric parallel dimers. Using nanodiscs of different diameters we observed a clear size-dependent increase in the dimer fraction, reaching over 50% of the β 1 AR molecules in large (~12.5 nm diameter) nanodiscs. Addition of cholesteryl hemisuccinate, an analog of cholesterol, suppresses β 1 AR dimerization in lipid nanodiscs, recapitulating the behavior in DDM micelles. This work provides quantitative evidence that β 1 AR possesses an intrinsic, membrane sensitive predisposition for dimerization, and highlights the importance of spatial membrane constraints in the modulation of class A GPCR dimerization.",

We demonstrate that a missense risk variant, NRIP1 R448G, promotes activated CD4 + T cell gut homing and inflammatory cytokine production, ultimately leading to exacerbated intestinal inflammation. Mechanistically, NRIP1 acts as a corepressor in retinoic acid signaling by expression of a gut-homing transcriptional program.

The balance and regulation of 26S and 30S proteasomes are not yet known. Here, we show that among the proteasome base assembly chaperones, only S5b/PSMD5 determines the levels of proteasome holoenzymes, especially the 30S proteasome, in mammals. In a variety of cell lines and mouse tissues, we found that apart from its role in yeast 19S proteasome assembly, loss of S5b/PSMD5 increased assembly toward the 26S and 30S proteasomes. During the process, we identified proteasome complexes that may represent alternative assembly intermediates, including the 19S base complex and 20S complexes harboring 19S subunits, eventually leading to a shift in the overall steady-state level of the 26S and 30S proteasomes. Intriguingly, the addition of the S5b/PSMD5 protein in vitro and its increase in cells efficiently disassembled the 30S proteasome into the 20S and 19S complexes. Increase in the 26S and 30S proteasomes over the 20S proteasome enhances the degradation of the aggregation-prone proteins and ubiquitinated proteins in cells and ameliorates cognitive impairment through the reduction of tau pathology in PS19 mice. These results suggest that 26S and 30S proteasomes are manipulated by S5b/PSMD5 and are beneficial for mitigating proteinopathy in mammals.",

Using two-dimensional numerical models of mantle convection with sharp and broad mineral phase transitions for pyrolite, we show that both scales of upwellings can be generated in a stagnant lid planet with an interior temperature 250 to 400 K warmer than Earth’s. The smaller plumes originate from a ~600 km deep internal layer that exists as a consequence of the different sequence of mineral phase transitions that occur in warmer mantles less processed and differentiated by partial melting and volcanism.

          "abstract": "Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First, we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced λ -jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the λ -jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become “soft” under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked “kineo-elastic” term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree–Fock calculations.",

Notably, mutations that alter BRAF function are prominent drivers of human cancer and certain RASopathy disorders, making BRAF an important target for therapeutic intervention. Despite extensive research, several aspects of BRAF regulation remain unclear. In this study, we developed an in vitro BRAF activation assay using purified autoinhibited BRAF:14-3-3 2 :MEK complexes. Our results show that fully processed, active-state KRAS alone can promote dimer-dependent BRAF activation. Moreover, we found that phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing liposomes synergized with KRAS to promote BRAF activation, achieving activity levels comparable to those observed with BRAF proteins that constitutively dimerize. In contrast, the SMP phosphatase complex had only a minimal effect on BRAF catalytic activity in this system but mediated the dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory pS365 14-3-3 binding site in a manner that was accelerated by the presence of KRAS alone or KRAS and 30% PS liposomes. Finally, we show that inhibitors blocking the BRAF RBD:KRAS interaction were able to suppress the in vitro activation of BRAF, underscoring the critical role of RAS binding in initiating the disassembly of the BRAF autoinhibited state. Thus, this assay provides valuable insights into the steps required for BRAF activation and can serve as an effective screening tool for identifying compounds that may inhibit this process and have therapeutic potential.",

          "abstract": "The noncoding small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) associate with a large set of proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). While the function of snRNAs is well characterized, the regulation of their transcription remains poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that SUMO conjugation regulates snRNA3′ end processing. To further study the connection between SUMOylation and snRNA biogenesis, we generated a CRISPR/dCas9 tool comprising a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the catalytic domain of the SUMO protease SENP1 (dCas9-SENP1). Here, we show that snRNA transcription decreases when dCas9-SENP1 is delivered to their promoter-proximal sequence elements (PSE), indicating that SUMO conjugation to proteins associated with snRNA promoters is necessary for proper transcriptional activity. Focusing on SNAPC1, a subunit of the snRNA-specific transcription complex SNAPc, we identified lysine residues 245 and 333 as SUMO acceptor sites and generated a SUMOylation-deficient mutant of this protein (SNAPC1 2KR). To explore the relevance of SNAPC1 SUMOylation on snRNA transcription, we generated a cell line carrying an inducible degron system for depletion of the endogenous SNAPC1 protein. This system led us to demonstrate that SNAPC1 2KR is unable to sustain basal levels of snRNA transcription. By tagging endogenous SNAPC3 and SNAPC4, two other subunits of SNAPc, we show that while SNAPC1 SUMOylation-deficient mutant is able to interact with SNAPC3, its interaction with SNAPC4 is affected, despite the fact it is still recruited to the PSE. Altogether, these results indicate that SNAPC1 SUMOylation is required for proper snRNA transcription and SNAPc complex assembly.",

          "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases present one of the most significant global health challenges. These disorders are defined by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates that impair synaptic function and cause progressive neuronal degeneration. Therefore, stimulating protein clearance mechanisms may be neuro-protective. Variants in FBXO7/PARK15 cause Parkinsonian Pyramidal Syndrome, an early-onset parkinsonian neurodegenerative disorder in humans, and inactivation of this gene in mice recapitulates many phenotypes seen in patients. The proteasome regulator PI31 is a direct binding partner of Fbxo7 and promotes local protein degradation at synapses by mediating fast proteasome transport in neurites. PI31 protein levels are reduced when the function of Fbxo7 is impaired. Here we show that restoring PI31 levels in Fbxo7 mutant fly and mouse strains prevents neuronal degeneration and significantly improves neuronal function, health, and lifespan. Notably, Fbxo7 inactivation in mouse neurons causes hyperphosphorylation of tau, and this was suppressed by transgenic expression of PI31. Our results demonstrate that PI31 is a crucial biological target through which Fbxo7 deficiency drives pathology. Therefore, targeting the PI31-pathway may represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",

          "abstract": "Palytoxin (PTX), a potent marine toxin, has long been known to transform Na + ,K + -ATPase (NKA), an indispensable ion pump, into a nonselective cation channel. It has been postulated that PTX takes control of the two gates on either side of a channel-like pore. These gates normally open and close alternately, synchronized with chemical events, never opening simultaneously. A critical question is whether palytoxin takes over the control of the two gates or creates a new pathway. Here, we present structures of NKA with bound palytoxin in three different states. PTX binds to NKA in E2P, occupying the physiological Na + exit pathway, similar to istaroxime, a new-generation cardiotonic steroid. Adding Na + and ATP/ADP to the NKA·PTX complex induces an open channel traversing the entire membrane alongside the physiological ion pathway. As AlF x , a stable transition state analog of phosphate replaces phosphate in the NKA·PTX complex preformed in E2P, the complex appears to undergo the normal reaction cycle from E2P to E1· n Na + . PTX occupies the space between the transmembrane helices M4 and M6, thereby preventing the closure of the extracellular half of the ion pathway. These structures demonstrate that the architecture of NKA is fundamentally different from “a pore with two gates.” Each half of the ion pathway comprises three segments, including a movable component that plays a pivotal role in translocating the bound cations by connecting the constant part to an appropriate inlet. The ion pathway of NKA transforms dynamically, ensuring that the two halves never exist simultaneously.",

          "abstract": "Insulin potently decreases blood glucose; thus, tight control is required to prevent excessive insulin release and hypoglycemia. Central to this inhibition is somatostatin released from delta cells that are clustered with beta cells in pancreatic islets. This communication is of interest because the loss of functional beta cells in diabetes leads to uncontrolled delta cell activity that disrupts islet paracrine crosstalk. While it is established that insulin and somatostatin secretion are coordinated, the specific mechanism is unsettled. We have previously demonstrated that beta cells release the hormone Urocortin 3 to stimulate delta cells at high glucose, demonstrating a paracrine negative feedback loop. Others have proposed direct coordination via gap junctions. To resolve this conundrum, we used the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca 2+ reporter GCaMP6s to simultaneously record the activity of hundreds of beta and delta cells in low (2.8 mM) (LG) and high (16.8 mM) glucose (HG). Surprisingly, while many delta cells exhibit Ca 2+ oscillations in HG that are coordinated with beta cells, the activation of these delta cells precedes beta cells and is more variable than beta cell responses. The selective delta cell knockout of connexin 36 confirmed the involvement of gap junctions. However, blockade of vesicle release with the Rho-GTPase inhibitor ML-141 completely removed coupling between beta and most delta cells in HG. Our data reveal considerable functional heterogeneity among delta cells, where most delta cells are entrained by oscillatory Ca 2+ behaviors of beta cells that are mediated by a combination of paracrine signaling and low-density gap junction coupling.",

Chronic inflammation in DMD exacerbates the complications associated with disease progression. Since the lymphatic system plays a crucial role in regulating and resolving inflammation, our primary goal was to investigate whether lymphatics were dysregulated in skeletal muscle of DMD animals. We used the D2.mdx murine and golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) canine models, as well as mouse and rat lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) to determine the role of dystrophin in lymphatic structure and function in skeletal muscles. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from control LMCs showed dystrophin expression, and protein results demonstrated that the 427-, 140-, and 71-kDa dystrophin isoforms were detectable in the LMCs from control mice, whereas the 427 kDa isoform was undetectable in LMCs derived from D2.mdx mice. Microlymphangiography and magnetic resonance lymphangiogram results showed a significant decrease in lymph transport in D2. mdx mice and GRMD dogs, respectively. Isolated flank lymphatic vessels from D2. mdx mice exhibited an increase in tonic contraction and a significant decrease in the phasic contractile frequency and amplitude, supporting lymphatic vessel dysfunction. The gene expression profile and immunofluorescence analyses of dystrophic muscle revealed inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in dystrophic muscle. Skeletal muscle tissues that showed improvement in function after adeno-associated virus-microdystrophin treatment also showed significant improvement in inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in GRMD dogs. Thus, these results show a linkage between lymphatic function and DMD pathogenesis that merits further investigation in DMD patients.",

          "abstract": "Multireference methods such as multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory accurately capture electronic correlation in systems with strong multiconfigurational character, but their cost precludes direct use in molecular dynamics. Combining these methods with machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can extend their reach. However, the sensitivity of multireference calculations to the choice of the active space complicates the consistent evaluation of energies and gradients across structurally diverse nuclear configurations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the weighted active space protocol (WASP), a systematic approach to assign a consistent active space for a given system across uncorrelated configurations. By integrating WASP with MLPs and enhanced sampling techniques, we propose a data-efficient active learning cycle that enables the training of an MLP on multireference data. We demonstrated the approach on the TiC + -catalyzed C–H activation of methane, a reaction that poses challenges for Kohn–Sham density functional theory due to its significant multireference character. This framework enables accurate and efficient modeling of catalytic dynamics, establishing a paradigm for simulating complex reactive processes beyond the limits of conventional electronic-structure methods.",

Of the five known viral TAP inhibitors, only the herpes simplex virus (HSV) protein ICP47 has been structurally resolved. We now report cryoelectron microscopy structures of TAP in complex with the remaining four: BNLF2a (Epstein–Barr virus), hUS6 (human cytomegalovirus), bUL49.5 (bovine herpesvirus 1), and CPXV012 (cowpox virus), assembling a structural atlas of viral TAP evasion. Despite employing divergent sequences, folds, and conformational targets, these viral inhibitors converge on a common strategy: they stall TAP from the alternating access cycle, precluding peptide entry into the ER and shielding infected cells from cytotoxic T cell surveillance. These findings reveal striking functional convergence and provide a structural framework for rational antiviral design.",

          "abstract": "Cyclic dimeric-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that regulates a variety of cellular processes, including motility, biofilm formation, secretion, cell cycle progression, and development, and also contributes to the virulence of many bacterial pathogens. While the genes encoding c-di-GMP cyclases and hydrolases are readily identifiable in microbial genomes, known c-di-GMP receptor domains are quite few, with only PilZ and MshEN broadly distributed across bacterial phyla. Recently, a new c-di-GMP receptor, named CdgR or ComFB, has been identified in cyanobacteria and shown to regulate cell size and natural competence. We demonstrated that CdgR proteins exhibit sequence and structural similarity to the Bacillus subtilis late competence development protein ComFB, a conserved protein of unknown function associated with bacterial competence. This prompted us to hypothesize that ComFB and ComFB-like proteins could also serve as c-di-GMP receptors. Here, we comprehensively investigated the ComFB protein family and demonstrated that ComFB proteins are evolutionarily widespread among bacteria and function as a novel family of c-di-GMP receptors. We showed that ComFB proteins from Gram-positive bacteria ( B. subtilis , Thermoanaerobacter brockii ) and Gram-negative pathogens ( Vibrio cholerae , Treponema denticola ) bind c-di-GMP with high affinity. Several ComFB proteins also bind cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), suggesting that ComFB represents a widely distributed bacterial protein family with dual specificity for c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP. Our physiological studies further showed that ComFB plays vital roles in controlling motility in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner in two phylogenetically distant bacteria, B. subtilis and the gram-negative Shewanella oneidensis , attesting to the biological relevance of ComFB as a c-di-GMP binding protein.",

          "abstract": "Tropical cyclones are expected to intensify more rapidly with warming, but relatively little work has examined whether they could expand more rapidly with warming, too. Recent theory predicts that peak expansion rate should increase with sea surface temperature (SST), and physical arguments suggest this dependence should be specifically on the relative SST, i.e. the SST difference from the tropical mean. We test this hypothesis with historical observational data, in which SST variations are primarily variations in relative SST. Both average and peak expansion rates are found to systematically increase with relative SST globally across the Northern Hemisphere (27.2 and 37.5 km/d/K) and within each individual basin. Results are robust across both reanalysis and Best Track observational datasets. Uniform-SST aquaplanet simulations show a much weaker dependence of maximum expansion rate on absolute SST, suggesting that the dominant dependence is on relative SST. Hence, mean global warming is not expected to strongly change storm size dynamics, but patterns of sea surface warming may play an important role in determining how storm size, and hence coastal risk, may change in the future. This work can also help improve forecasting of the wind field and its hazards and impacts at landfall.",

          "abstract": "γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA A R) is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in inhibition in the adult brain. Structural and electrophysiological studies have provided numerous insights into the receptor’s functioning but the complete molecular mechanism of GABA A R action remains elusive. Herein, we used high-resolution single-channel recording to analyze point-mutated α 1 β 2 γ 2 receptors and applied so called Φ value (REFER, rate-equilibrium free energy relationship) analysis which allows to infer the order of domains engagement during activation, offering a complementary “dynamic” insight into the receptor’s function. As anticipated, point mutations at the orthosteric binding sites reduced GABA binding affinity, with the magnitude of this effect diminishing progressively with increasing distance from the binding site. On the contrary, mutations located all over the macromolecule’s structure, e.g., in “peripheral top position,” extracellular/transmembrane interface, and channel pore, affected the receptor with a clear tendency to influence entire gating including opening/closing, preactivation, and desensitization with no clear correlation with the distance to the channel gate. Interestingly, the calculated Φ values for the GABA A R showed a relatively narrow range (0.42 to 0.81), suggesting that the conformational transitions are highly synchronized and coordinated by a global network of interactions. This prediction is also in agreement with observation that, typically, single GABA A R residue mutation alters the kinetics of not just one but many (often all) conformational transitions. We thus propose a dictum reflecting modus operandi of the GABA A R: Binding is local and gating is global. In conclusion, our analysis indicates that GABA A R shows particularly strong functional compactness manifested as global gating mechanisms and high allostery.",

          "abstract": "Bubble-mediated gas exchange associated with wave breaking is a critical pathway for ocean–atmosphere exchange of low solubility gases such as oxygen. Yet, ocean and climate models, as well as observation-based products, usually rely on wind-only air–sea flux formulations derived from carbon constraints that ignore the asymmetric nature of the bubble flux, contributing to discrepancies between estimates of oxygen inventories and their response to climate change. Without bubbles, gas exchange is controlled by a symmetric wind-driven exchange, with the ocean–atmosphere gas partial pressure difference controlling whether outgassing or uptake occurs. Bubbles entrained by wave breaking can enhance this symmetric turbulent exchange, and contribute an additional asymmetric flux, always leading to an uptake, as they get squeezed by hydrostatic pressure (large bubbles) or collapse and fully dissolve (small bubbles). We present an observation-constrained theoretical framework of the air–sea flux accounting for air entrainment due to wave breaking and symmetric and asymmetric bubble exchange. The combined evidence from theory, laboratory, and field measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes, oxygen concentration, and noble gas supersaturation yields a universal formulation of gas exchange which we implement into a global ocean biogeochemical model. We discuss the resulting oxygen fluxes and demonstrate that our wind–wave–bubble formulation better reproduces observed in situ oxygen concentrations in water mass formation regions, where air–sea exchange is high, than a commonly used wind-only formulation. We show that the asymmetric bubble flux is essential for evaluating air–sea oxygen fluxes and estimating the magnitude of the ocean oxygen loss associated with global warming.",

          "abstract": "In biological membranes, proteins face a fundamentally different environment than in water. To avoid untenable lipid contacts with polar backbone atoms, they use the continuous hydrogen bonding achieved by α-helices or β-barrels to traverse membranes. Here, we show that integrin αX, and by homology αM, undermine this paradigm by partially unfolding the N-terminal third of their transmembrane (TM) helix. Unfolding results in a dynamic, frayed helix that weakens the association with its partnering β2 subunit to lower the activation threshold of integrin αXβ2-mediated cell adhesion. The extent of unfolding depends on membrane geometry, thereby establishing a mechanism for sensing membrane properties. The combination of adhesive control with sensory capacity in integrin αXβ2 and αMβ2 may achieve membrane localization-dependent receptor activation in leukocyte phagocytosis. The unfolding of the αX TM helix arises from a high number of α-helix-destabilizing residues that TM helices in general approach but do not exceed. Accordingly, backbone dynamics of TM helices may disrupt hydrogen bonds, modulate protein function, and optimize TM helix rigidity.",

          "abstract": "Francis Crick’s global parameterization of coiled coil geometry has been widely useful for guiding design of new protein structures and functions. However, design guided by similar global parameterization of beta barrel structures has been less successful, likely due to the deviations from ideal barrel geometry required to maintain interstrand hydrogen bonding without introducing backbone strain. Instead, beta barrels have been designed using two-dimensional structural blueprints; while this approach has successfully generated new fluorescent proteins, transmembrane nanopores, and other structures, it requires expert knowledge and provides only indirect control over the global shape. Here, we show that the simplicity and control over shape and structure provided by parametric representations can be generalized beyond coiled coils by taking advantage of the rich sequence–structure relationships implicit in RoseTTAFold-based design methods. Starting from parametrically generated barrel backbones, both RFjoint inpainting and RFdiffusion readily incorporate backbone irregularities necessary for proper folding with minimal deviation from the idealized barrel geometries. We show that for beta barrels across a broad range of beta sheet parameterizations, these methods achieve high in silico and experimental success rates, with atomic accuracy confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure of a rare barrel topology, and de novo designed transmembrane nanopores with conductances ranging from 200 to 500 pS. By combining the simplicity and control of parametric generation with the high success rates of deep learning–based protein design methods, our approach makes the design of proteins where global shape confers function, such as beta barrel nanopores, more precisely specifiable and accessible.",

Specifically, multistability is harnessed to sequence the motion of different degrees of freedom in a programmed order. A key aspect of this approach is that this order can be passively reprogrammed through mechanical stimuli arising from interactions with the environment. To showcase our approach, we construct a mechanism that passively sorts objects based on their mass and a four-degree-of-freedom robot capable of autonomously moving away from obstacles.

          "abstract": "The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is critical for maintaining cerebral homeostasis, and its deterioration with age is an important pathogenic factor in the etiology of vascular dementia. Extracellular matrix–integrin interactions play a central role in regulating vascular stability. The αvβ3 integrin is not expressed by brain endothelial cells under stable conditions but is strongly induced by hypoxia. However, it is currently unclear whether αvβ3 integrin exerts a destructive or protective influence on BBB integrity. In young (8 to 10 wk) and aged (20 mo) mice, we examined the impact of a function-blocking β3 integrin antibody as well as the inhibitory peptide cilengitide on BBB disruption during exposure to CMH (8% O 2 ). Hypoxic induction of brain endothelial β3 integrin was much stronger in aged mice. In both young and aged mice, β3 integrin inhibition greatly amplified hypoxia-induced BBB disruption, correlating with loss of tight junction proteins and induction of the leaky BBB marker mouse endothelial cell antigen (MECA)-32. Consistent with this, β3 integrin null mice showed increased levels of hypoxia-induced BBB disruption and MECA-32 expression. Cilengitide also reduced the integrity of a brain endothelial monolayer in vitro, prevented β3 integrin localization to focal adhesions, and reduced expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and tight junction proteins. These observations suggest that hypoxic induction of endothelial αvβ3 integrin enhances BBB integrity by stabilizing endothelial adhesion. This raises the interesting possibility that pharmacological upregulation of endothelial αvβ3 integrin in the aged brain might hold therapeutic promise for vascular dementia.",

However, the role of pseudouridylation in infection is poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate that Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) manipulates the pseudouridylation pathway to enhance replication.

We present a comprehensive analysis of KSHV RNA pseudouridylation, revealing hundreds of modified RNAs at single-nucleotide resolution. Notably, we demonstrate that pseudouridylation of the KSHV-encoded polyadenylated nuclear RNA (PAN) plays a significant role in the expression of PAN RNA.

Enhanced susceptibility can be driven directly by mutations in genes essential for control of the virus or indirectly via the production of autoantibodies against components of host defense. While the impact of viruses on individuals carrying these genotypes permitted their identification and has been amply studied, little is known about the impact of these human genotypes on the natural history of viruses, including not only persisting but also emerging viruses. We envisage several scenarios, including the possibility that genetically susceptible individuals serve as patient zeros, superspreaders, or mutation incubators, or that genetically resistant individuals even permit the selection of new viral mutants. Viruses are continually shared between individuals and even host species, where they can benefit from adaption to new environments. Current human viruses, as well as novel viruses from animal reservoirs, will continue to threaten the human population. Improvements in the scale of human genomic sequencing and analysis will permit testing hypotheses about the impact of human genetics on the origin and trajectory of viral infections, including future pandemics, which may ultimately help to prevent or curtail impending outbreaks.",

We analyzed mitochondrial genetic data from individuals interred at sites that date to earlier (A.D. 700–1200) and later (A.D. 1200–1450) time periods, which allowed us to examine changes in gene pools over time and to test these migration hypotheses. Comparing the full mitogenomes from 114 individuals, we show that low levels of migration occurred diachronically, although they still may have contributed to hybridized cultural practices. These data counter the long-standing assumption that widescale population replacement was the cause for the rise of Paquimé, the center of the Casas Grandes world in the thirteenth-century A.D.",

We further show that a mutant E. coli σ 70 derivative lacking σ region 1.1 (σ R1.1) is not released and is retained on RNAP core throughout transcription elongation. We also observe that B. subtilis σ A and the mutant E. coli σ 70 derivative lacking σ R1.1 interact much more stably with RNAP than full-length E. coli σ 70 . Our results indicate that the σ cycle is not a universal phenomenon in bacteria.",

          "abstract": "Our spontaneous thoughts encompass various dimensions, such as task-relatedness (off vs. on task), and thought orientation (internal vs. external). However, their distinction remains unclear. Our study addresses this issue by focusing on their timescales at both the behavioral level (using fast and slow finger tapping) and the neural level (using EEG) using two independent datasets (N = 84 and 35). Behavioral results revealed a double dissociation: Task-relatedness was linked to fast tapping only, whereas thought orientation was associated with slow tapping only. At the neural level, we assessed topographic similarity in EEG to quantify the temporal influence of past neural activity on current ones. Task-relatedness modulated topographic similarity only during fast tapping, while thought orientation did so only during slow tapping. Critically, topographic similarity was phase-based, as shown by its correlation with phase-locking value and the loss of associations with thought after phase-shuffling. This indicates that the neural signatures of both thought dimensions are strongly phase-dependent. Finally, we demonstrate that nonlinearity plays a distinct role mediating the impact of different timescales (slow and fast finger tapping) on spontaneous thoughts at both behavioral (precision error) and neural levels (topographic similarity). Overall, these results demonstrate that task-relatedness is associated with short timescales, whereas thought orientation is associated with long timescales. This highlights how distinct temporal dynamics shape different spontaneous thought dimensions on both their behavioral and neural features.",

Acyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase medium-chain family member 3 (ACSM3), a key enzyme of medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) metabolism, has been implicated in metabolic syndrome, but its function in fibrotic kidney remains unexplored. Here, we found that tubular epithelial ACSM3 expression was downregulated in kidney fibrotic mice and patients and inversely correlated with disease severity. Systemic and tubular-specific knockout of ACSM3 both exacerbated renal fibrosis, whereas adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated ACSM3 overexpression alleviated fibrotic kidneys in mice. Mechanistically, ACSM3 deficiency disrupted MCFA metabolism and resulted in abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis. Notably, we identified that dodecanoic acid (C12:0) could improve kidney fibrosis, which was primarily utilized via ACSM3 in kidneys. Furthermore, C12:0 oxidation impairment caused by tubular ACSM3 deficiency aggravated fibrotic kidney. Together, ACSM3-regulated MCFA metabolism played a pivotal role in kidney fibrosis, highlighting a potent drug target of ACSM3 and a potential supplementary therapy of MCFA against chronic kidney disease.",

          "abstract": "Inferring accurate and precise material models necessary for high-fidelity predictions has been a central challenge in constitutive modeling. Both traditional regression methods and modern machine-learning approaches require specialized data labels, which often cannot be sufficiently obtained from experiments. This data demand makes many sophisticated models impractical for real-world problems. Improvements in digital image correlation techniques have enabled accurate measurements of displacement data, providing an alternative kinematics-based approach for model identification. However, for materials undergoing plastic deformation, fracture, and damage, the corresponding inverse problem could be inherently challenging due to the dependence on loading history. We overcome this by formulating an inverse problem to discover interpretable plasticity models parameterized by neural networks (NN) from kinematic observations, leveraging a differentiable simulator with a smooth constitutive update that enables backpropagation for the NN training. The ability to use kinematic observations to infer complex material models may pave the way for a massive generation of material models that can be game-changing for emerging applications such as the design of metamaterials, response surface analyses, and the design of experiments.",

Robust methylation requires rapid hydrolysis of the methylation by-product S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by S -adenosylhomocysteinase (Ahcy). Ahcy is essential for maintaining methylation potential; however, the mechanisms governing its enzymatic activity, particularly in response to cellular stress, remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show Ahcy is a redox-sensitive enzyme that is inhibited by oxidation of a conserved cysteine, C195, in vitro resulting in elevated SAH levels upon oxidative stress in vivo. We leveraged High-Throughput Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry to directly quantify Ahcy enzymatic activity and observed that H 2 O 2 -induced oxidation significantly reduced its catalytic efficiency. Notably, while C195 is essential for enzymatic activity in Drosophila melanogaster and humans, this residue is not conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans Ahcy that is also insensitive to H 2 O 2 . Structural analysis revealed that C195 is positioned near NAD + in the active site, close to a second cysteine residue that is also lacking in C. elegans Ahcy. Ahcy oxidation is neuroprotective in a Drosophila light stress model that increases oxidative stress. Moreover, Ahcy knockdown suppresses light stress–induced gene expression changes in photoreceptors, although this response is uncoupled from changes in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels, which were previously reported to alter in response to Ahcy knockdown in cultured cells. Thus, the one-carbon metabolism enzyme Ahcy senses changes in cellular redox homeostasis through a conserved cysteine residue that alters its activity, enabling rapid changes in gene expression that enable a neuroprotective response.",

To identify tumor-intrinsic regulators of immunotherapy resistance and explore therapeutic strategies to restore T cell–mediated tumor control, we employed three functional genomics approaches using in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screening. Cancer USP14 was identified as the critical immune evasion driver. USP14-high HCC patients exhibited poorer anti-PD1 antibody therapy responses and reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration. Inhibition of USP14 suppressed HCC cell growth in coculture with activated CD8+ T cells and restored cocultured CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In vivo USP14 targeting synergized with anti-PD1 antibody therapy. Mechanistically, USP14 deubiquitinated and stabilized GLUT1 through the removal of Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains at Lys-245, which enabled HCC cells to outcompete CD8+ T cells for glucose, generating a glucose-deprived tumor microenvironment that suppressed CD8+ T cell function. Our findings show USP14 in cancer has a proimmunoevasive role in CD8+ T cell–based tumor immunity through GLUT1-mediated glucose competition. These findings position USP14 inhibitors as promising adjuvants to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC, providing actionable insights for overcoming resistance.",

This study uses multiple techniques, including X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, to investigate 54 pre-Neolithic burials from 11 archaeological sites located across Southeastern Asia. The findings confirm that many of these pre-Neolithic flexed and squatting burials were treated by an extended period of smoke-drying over fire, a process of mummification similar to that recorded ethnographically in some Australian and Highland New Guinea societies.

Functional characterization using Slc39a8 A391T knock-in mice and kidney-specific Slc39a8 knockout mice reveals that loss of SLC39A8 function reduces renal zinc accumulation, thereby mitigating susceptibility to kidney injury and disease progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that perturbed zinc homeostasis drives renal damage, and limiting zinc levels—whether via impaired SLC39A8 activity or direct chelation—activates the zinc–AKT–FOXO1–G6PC axis to confer protection. Critically, zinc chelation with EDTA recapitulates this benefit, significantly preventing and ameliorating experimental acute and chronic kidney disease.

Here, we report the identification of a glucosyltransferase, UGT76G4 that efficiently catalyzes the conversion of Reb D to Reb M with a strong preference for C19 glycosylation. Structural and functional analyses, including X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and mutagenesis, revealed key residues in UGT76G4 that dictate its regioselectivity, with residue 200 playing a pivotal role. Engineered UGT76G4 variants, including Q199I/G200Y and H155S/Q199I/G200Y, enhanced Reb E and Reb D conversion efficiency by 1.46-fold and 23-fold, respectively, compared to UGT76G1.

          "abstract": "Wnt signaling plays a crucial role for many developmental processes. It is also pivotal in the generation and limited treatment outcomes of glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we identified Wnt7b, which is markedly upregulated in GBM patients, as a determinant of resistance to immune checkpoint blockers (αPD1; anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1) in a clinically relevant, αPD1-resistant GBM murine model with abundant stem cells. We observed that increased levels of Wnt7b and β-catenin correlated with the resistance to αPD1. Treatment combining a porcupine inhibitor WNT974 with αPD1 reprogrammed the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) to bolster antitumor immune responses and extended the survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM, with 25% long-term survivors. Our causal studies revealed that WNT974 potentiated αPD1 therapy by the expansion of antigen presenting DC3-like dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, WNT974 combination with αPD1 was associated with a reduction in immune suppressive granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), an increase in the Ki67+CD8/Ki67+regulatory T cells (Treg) ratio, tilting the CD8:Treg balance in the TME toward antitumor immune response, and more pronounced GrzB+CD8+ effector T cells. Conversely, an increase in monocytic MDSCs and phosphorylation of pro-oncogenic proteins was associated with resistance to the combination therapy. Collectively, our preclinical findings provide a strong rationale to test Wnt7b/β-catenin inhibition with αPD1 therapy in GBM patients with elevated Wnt7b/β-catenin signaling.",

Whether these two states are connected or entirely decoupled remains controversial. We here resolve this controversy by providing experimental evidence of a continuous transition between ET and EIT in Taylor-Couette flow. Through experimentally quantifying the roles of elasticity and inertia in flow stability, we find that elasticity is the primary driving mechanism for both elastic and elastoinertial instabilities, and inertia plays a secondary role in the latter. Remarkably, the critical condition for these instabilities can be described by a unified function derived from stability analysis, revealing that the transition between elastic instability to elastoinertial instability is continuous. Moreover, we show that the flow structures and the energy spectrum evolve seamlessly from ET to elasticity-dominated EIT, transitional EIT, and inertia-modulated EIT, with inertia playing an increasingly important role in the last three regimes. Our results offer insights into the fundamental nature of turbulence in viscoelastic flows and would have implications for applications involving drag reduction and polymer processing.",

We demonstrate the power of this boundary method in the case of the swimming microalgae Euglena gracilis trapped in light-defined billiard geometries. Quite surprisingly, we found that Euglena scatters with a nearly Lambertian cosine law, resembling the behavior of blackbody radiation and consequently resulting in nearly uniform distributions inside simple cavity geometries. Nevertheless, leveraging our boundary method, we were able to design a stacked multistage billiard geometry, with a connection scheme between subunits that breaks spatial symmetry and achieves an exponential amplification of cell concentration between its two ends. Our method can be applied to confined active matter in contexts ranging from spatial control and sorting of microorganisms to the design of efficient navigation strategies for microscopic and macroscopic robots.",

Herein, we establish a multimodal coherent X-ray diffraction imaging framework for spatiotemporal mapping of mesoscale structural dynamics in precipitation-strengthened alloys. As a demonstrative application, we visualized the structural evolution in Mg 97 Zn 1 Gd 2 during isothermal annealing at 700 K, revealing real-time dynamics of nucleation, growth, and coarsening. Ptychographic reconstruction enabled imaging of microstructural transformations across a wide field of view (~100 μm 2 ) with temporal resolution spanning several hours. We observed decomposition of (Mg, Zn) 3 Gd and concurrent precipitation and coarsening of long-period stacking ordered phases. To resolve local dynamics at finer spatiotemporal scales, we combined dynamic coherent diffraction imaging with X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, targeting selected regions (~10 μm 2 ) with time resolution down to tens of seconds. This approach revealed the rapid formation of nanoscale precipitates within 10 s after heating, followed by coarsening over several hundred seconds. Additionally, we applied optical flow analysis—a computational method to track motion patterns—to visualize and quantify the nucleation, growth, and coarsening kinetics. The abovementioned findings demonstrate the capability of in situ coherent X-ray techniques to acquire the real-time evolutions of mesoscale structures in complex materials.

Our earlier report demonstrated that platelet GPIbα is required for hepatocellular TPO generation, which is the major resource of TPO in the blood circulation. However, how hepatocytes physically contact circulating sinusoidal platelets across the liver endothelium for this process is unknown. Kupffer cells reside in contact with both sinusoidal blood and underlying hepatocytes, and mediate senescent platelet clearance, but their role in TPO regulation has never been explored. Here, we found Kupffer cell depletion via either clodronate liposomes or specific transgenic models abrogated circulating TPO. Kupffer cell depletion also prevented TPO level increase in GPIbα-deficient mice following wild-type (GPIbα + ) platelet transfusion, signifying an interdependent mechanism for TPO regulation. Mice treated with arsenite had significantly decreased liver endothelial fenestrations and hepatocyte sinusoidal protrusions as well as TPO levels. This effect was exacerbated by Kupffer cell depletion, and Kupffer cells were identified to enhance liver endothelial fenestrations. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis of the liver revealed platelets arrested on Kupffer cell surface were in contact with hepatocyte protrusions. Thus, we elucidated that Kupffer cells promote endothelial fenestrae and hepatocyte protrusions, accumulate circulating platelets, and facilitate cellular interactions between hepatocytes and platelets, which drive TPO generation. This connection between platelet clearance and thrombopoiesis should have broad implications for hematology and pathologies such as Bernard–Soulier syndrome, thrombocytopenias, as well as liver diseases.",

Although photobleachers have been developed to quench endogenous pigments, the lack of customizability limits their utility for a broad range of applications. Here, we present a high luminous-intensity photobleacher that is based on rigorous simulations of illumination patterns, along with the framework to maximize bleaching efficiency. This open-source project is designed to help scientists customize and scale the device according to their research goals. The photobleacher is applicable to both thin tissue slices and large-volume cleared tissue samples to enable serial three-dimensional imaging of postmortem human brain using multiplexed antibody or oligonucleotide probes.",

          "authors": "Danielle R. Johnson, Adam Bocanski, Emily M. Diorio, James Chen, Hui Meng",
          "abstract": "Recent discovery of “extreme clustering” of inertial particles in isotropic turbulent flow suggests a hidden mechanism of particle–particle interaction at sub-Kolmogorov separations unexplained by hydrodynamic interaction. The near-contact radial distribution function (RDF) reaches O ( 10 4 ) , resulting in a collision kernel four orders larger than direct numerical simulation predictions. Statistical stationarity is lost in the particle-laden turbulence, suggesting the particles experience a nonequilibrium process. We hypothesize dielectric particles in isotropic turbulence experience contact electrification through interparticle collisions, creating inhomogeneous mosaic surface charge. These mosaic charges lead to attractive forces and thereby extreme clustering and collision amplification, forming a positive feedback loop. To explore this potential mechanism, we investigated hollow glass spheres dispersed in a high-Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic air turbulence chamber using high-resolution 3D particle tracking velocimetry and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). We measured RDF, particle-pair mean-inward radial relative velocity, and mean radial relative acceleration (RA) with time up to 10 min. We sampled particles from the flow chamber through time and evaluated their nanoscopic charge distribution using KPFM. We found that both RDF and mosaic surface charge increase with time; RA at close separations is attractive, intensifies as particles approach, and grows in time; and the turbulence-exposed RA curves collapse when nondimensionalized by the dipole–dipole acceleration calculated from mosaic charge distributions. These results support the proposed mechanism—Inhomogeneous Mosaic Potential Amplified Collisions in Turbulence (IMPACT). Better understanding and modeling of these effects could improve predictions for air pollution, weather patterns, and drug manufacturing—where particle interactions have big impacts.",

          "abstract": "Winds generate waves over the oceans with a wide range of properties. The largest wave heights and periods are important parameters in the design of marine structures. Extreme waves also play an outsize role in air–sea fluxes and coastal dynamics, and leave imprints on seismic and sediment records. Rare events have so far escaped measurements, with few wave heights from satellite altimeters exceeding 16 m, and no associated measurement of wave periods. Here, we use swells radiated from storms to reveal long wave periods within the storms, and their generation mechanism. Swells are resolved in the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite sea level measurements. Patterns of increasing swell wavelength and decreasing swell height away from storms are consistent with a nonlinear transfer of energy from short to long period waves. We propose an updated parametric shape for wave spectra in storms that aligns with SWOT swell measurements. It reduces energy levels by a factor of 20 at 1.2 to 1.4 times the peak period compared to commonly used spectral shapes and allows estimation of storm wave periods from swell heights. Consistent with less extreme conditions, the peak period generally increases with wave height. This was particularly verified for the largest storm peak period of 20.2 ± 0.6 s, obtained for the event with the largest significant wave height 19.7 ± 0.3 m measured by altimeters. These observations of long period swells should have a wide range of applications from coastal dynamics to seismology.",

          "abstract": "Arsenic contamination in rice poses a global challenge to food safety and agricultural productivity, as toxic methylated arsenic species—dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and its highly toxic derivative, methylated monothioarsenate (DMMTA)—accumulate in rice grains. These arsenic species endanger human health and trigger rice straighthead disease, a crop disorder that drastically reduces yields. However, the microbial ecological processes driving arsenic speciation in paddy soils, and their link to striking geographic disparities in rice arsenic speciation profiles and disease prevalence, remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate soil chronosequences spanning 1 to 2,000 y of rice cultivation, a global metagenomic survey of 801 paddy soils, controlled incubations, and field surveys to demonstrate that the balance between arsenic-methylating and arsenic-demethylating microbes is the key determinant of rice grain arsenic speciation and straighthead disease susceptibility. We show that young and moderate-age paddy soils (&lt;700 y), common in regions such as the Americas and Europe, are enriched in arsenic-methylating bacteria, leading to elevated DMA and DMMTA in soils and rice grains. In contrast, ancient paddies in Southeast Asia harbor robust populations of DMA-demethylating methanogenic archaea that effectively mitigate the buildup of these toxic arsenic species. We identify core microbial taxa whose abundances serve as predictive biomarkers and construct a global risk map linking a high methylator-to-demethylator ratio in soils with increased straighthead disease incidence. These findings advance our understanding of arsenic biogeochemistry in agroecosystems and establish a predictive framework for identifying regions at elevated risk of arsenic-induced crop disorders and food contamination.",

By relocating promoter-reporter constructs into thousands of alternative positions within a single locus, we dissected the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. The confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its ~1-kilobase coding region. Our local relocation approach provides high-resolution functional maps of a genomic locus and reveals that a gene can strongly constrain the realm of influence of its enhancer.",

Herein, we describe the transformation of alkenes into transient 1,2- bis -sulfonium intermediates found to undergo Z -selective elimination, overturning a textbook E2 stereoselectivity rule through stabilizing interactions. We identify paired electrolysis as an enabling strategy to both selectively generate the requisite bis -sulfonium intermediate and drive its rapid elimination in situ.

Seismic wavespeeds track crustal deformation and stress changes, but typical monitoring methods are most sensitive to shallow depths. Using receiver functions, we tracked rupture-zone wavespeed and anisotropy changes throughout the crust during the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Shallow coseismic wavespeed reductions recovered within months, whereas a deeper postseismic wavespeed drop persisted without measurable recovery over several years. The deep, persistent wavespeed drop likely reflects accumulating damage driven by postseismic deformation, suggesting two possible scenarios: (i) a slow interseismic recovery where wavespeed and anisotropy track long-term stress evolution; or (ii) permanent deformation of an immature fault zone. Both scenarios affect the dynamics and energy budget of the seismic cycle.",

At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate.

Vector control has resulted in strong signals of selection, with some resistance alleles shared across populations through gene flow and others arising independently. Fortunately, we found that a promising gene drive target in Anopheles gambiae is highly conserved in An. funestus . These insights will enable more strategic insecticide usage and gene drive deployment, supporting malaria elimination.",

We sequenced 1206 genomes from 73 globally distributed locations. After evolving a preference for humans in Sahelian West Africa, the invasive subspecies Ae. aegypti aegypti ( Aaa ) emerged in the Americas after the Atlantic slave trade era and expanded globally. Recent back-to-Africa Aaa migration introduced insecticide resistance and anthropophily into regions with recent dengue outbreaks, raising concern that Aaa movement could increase arbovirus risk in urban Africa. These data underscore developing complexity in the fight against dengue, Zika, and chikungunya and provide a platform to further study this important mosquito vector.",

Here we introduce an approach to tile mammalian chromosomes with self-mapping fluorescent labels and track them at ultraresolution. We find that sequences separated by submegabase distances transition to proximity in tens of seconds. This rapid search is dependent on cohesin and is exhibited only within domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, rather than structural boundaries. The genomic separation–dependent scaling of the search time for cis interactions violated predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor-driven folding. We also uncover cohesin-dependent processive motion at 2.7 kilobases per second. Together, these multiscale dynamics reveal the organization of the genome into kinetically associated domains.",

To plan for a sustainable future, we need to forecast the distributions of cumulative effects from multiple pressures. Here, we mapped (at 10-kilometer resolution) the future cumulative impacts of 10 climate, land-based, fishing, and other pressures on 20 marine habitats under two climate scenarios at mid-century (around 2050). We found that cumulative impacts are projected to increase 2.2 to 2.6 times globally, with coastal habitats facing higher impacts but offshore regions facing faster increases, especially in equatorial regions. Furthermore, many countries dependent on marine resources will have large increases in impacts. Incorporating these results into strategic policy and management will support more sustainable use and protection of marine ecosystems and the services they provide.",

While structural distortion from symmetry breaking occurs in femtoseconds, the timescale to lift electronic state degeneracy has remained elusive. We use the vibrationally resolved attosecond chronoscope to capture the electronic symmetry breaking induced by the Renner-Teller effect in bent CO 2 molecules after photoionization by an extreme ultraviolet photon by measuring attosecond ionization delays. Relative photoionization delays between the four cation states are observed, with vibrational state–dependent delays, we analyze the evolution of the degenerate A 2 Π u state to the nondegenerate A ′ and A ″ states due to molecular bending. With the help of theoretical analysis, we show that the relative photoionization delays of up to 72 as between the vibrational levels originate from the symmetry breaking–induced shape resonance.

Current treatments, including repeated intraocular anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections, are invasive and often lead to discomfort and complicated hemorrhages. Here, we developed a noninvasive nanozyme eye drop capable of penetrating the fundus to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby inhibit neovascularization. The nanozyme eye drops consist of liposomes formed by fluorinated and arginine–glycine–aspartic acid–modified phospholipids, which enhance the penetration of ocular barriers. The encapsulated superoxide dismutase–catalase cascade nanozyme within these liposomes allows for efficient ROS scavenging. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that these nanozyme eye drops achieve deep retinal tissue penetration, alleviate oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, and suppress aberrant insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 signaling, thereby inhibiting pathological neovascularization. Enhanced ocular bioavailability and minimal toxicity further underscore its promise as a safe and effective noninvasive treatment for retinal neovascularization diseases.",

Integrated analyses across species identified diverse subtypes of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that are highly conserved across primates. Compositional analyses revealed that subdivisions of the primate basolateral complex contain distinct classes of glutamatergic neurons and divergent gene expression profiles for parvalbumin and somatostatin GABAergic neurons. Referencing primate neuron types to transcriptomic atlases of the murine amygdala highlighted primate-specific specializations for glutamatergic neurons and identified which neuron types are conserved across mammals and amygdalar subdivisions. Understanding the molecular heterogeneity of anatomically resolved amygdalar neuron types provides a cellular framework for improving models of how amygdalar circuits contribute to cognition and mental health.",

Here, we show that frequency-domain measurements of relative intensity ratios outperform absolute methods, achieving 0.003% accuracy using dual-wavelength cavity mode dispersion spectroscopy. Enabled by high-precision frequency metrology, this approach reveals systematic discrepancies with state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, exposing subtle electron correlation effects in the dipole moment curve. Applied to line-intensity ratio thermometry (LRT), our technique determines gas temperatures with 0.5 millikelvin statistical uncertainty, exceeding previous LRT precision by two orders of magnitude. These results redefine the limits of optical gas metrology and enable International System of Units–traceable measurements for applications from combustion diagnostics to isotopic analysis. Discrepancies of up to 0.02% in transition probability ratios challenge theorists to refine models, establishing intensity ratios as a paradigm in precision molecular physics.",

However, their long-term effects on metabolic health remain understudied. Here, we show that, in male and female mice, a KD protects against weight gain and induces weight loss but over time leads to the development of hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and severe glucose intolerance. Unlike mice on conventional high-fat diet, KD-fed mice remain insulin sensitive and display low-insulin levels. Hyperglycemic clamp and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays revealed systemic and cell-intrinsic impairments in insulin secretion. Transcriptomic profiling of islets from KD-fed mice indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi stress and disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking, which were confirmed by electron microscopy showing a dilated Golgi network consistent with defective insulin granule trafficking and secretion. Together, these results suggest that long-term KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution their systematic use as a health-promoting dietary intervention.",

          "abstract": "Endosomes and lysosomes (collectively termed “endolysosomes”) traverse the cytoplasm in a stop-and-go manner, but the mechanisms underlying this motion remain poorly understood. Using deep learning–based image analyses, including particle tracking, spatial distribution, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology analysis, we found that ER junctions facilitate stop-and-go motion switching and serve as platforms for endolysosome interactions. Within the ER network, endolysosomes exhibit three dynamic states: fast movement, local slow movement, and pausing. Pauses occur mainly at ER junctions, where transient endosome-lysosome interactions often coincide with organelle fission and are followed by departure. Disruption of ER junctions impairs lysosomal motility and maturation. We further show that actin condensation around endolysosomes mediates motion switching, involving VAP-STARD3 interaction and the actin regulator YWHAH. Other organelles, such as lipid droplets and peroxisomes, also pause near ER junctions. These findings highlight ER junctions as regulatory hubs that orchestrate organelle dynamics, contributing to the spatial coordination of organelle distribution and interactions within the cytoplasm.",

          "abstract": "High-mass stars, born in massive dense cores (MDCs), profoundly affect the cosmic ecosystem through feedback processes and metal enrichment, yet little is known about how MDCs assemble and transfer mass across scales to form high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs). Using multiscale [40 to 2500 astronomical units (au)] observations of an MDC hosting an HMYSO, we identify a coherent dynamical structure analogous to barred spiral galaxies: three ~20,000 au spiral arms feed a ~7500 au central bar, which channels gas to a ~2000 au pseudodisk. Further accretion proceeds through the inner structures, including a Keplerian disk and an inner disk (~100 au), which are thought to be driving a collimated bipolar outflow. These multiscale structures (spiral arms, bar, streamers, envelope, disk, and outflow) have been simultaneously observed as a physically coherent structure within an MDC. Our discovery suggests that well-organized hierarchical structures play a crucial role during the gas accretion and angular momentum buildup of a massive disk.",

In the heterotaxy syndrome, abnormal left-right patterning leads to a spectrum of severe congenital heart defects, including ventricle malposition. A postulate anchored in the clinical nomenclature assumes that the looping direction of the embryonic heart tube determines ventricle position at birth. However, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we performed a unique longitudinal analysis of heterotaxy with right isomerism, using multimodality imaging of Nodal mouse mutants. Using direct correlations and advanced statistics, we dissected the contribution of heart looping variations to specific structural heart malformations, and uncovered unexpected plasticity of ventricle position after looping in 30% of revertant samples. Genetic tracing and topological associations show that plasticity involves a further step of heart remodeling at E13.5, rather than molecular reprogramming. Human patient scans are consistent with ventricle plasticity and suggest association with poorer prognosis. Our work reveals distinct asymmetric events shaping organs.",

Using exogenous molecular chaperone systems has the potential to stabilize native conformations and inhibit the aberrant aggregation of α-syn, yet inefficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and insufficient accumulation at PD sites limit their application. Herein, we developed chemotactic chaperone nanomotors (CNMs) that exploit the unique pathological microenvironment of PD lesions, characterized by elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels. The CNMs consist of a chemotactic-targeting module capable of sensing an iNOS concentration gradient, an α-syn–specific recognition module with conformation-sensitive binding domains, and a protein regulatory module with a hydrophobic microdomain that can stabilize α-syn and prevent misfolding. Results demonstrate that CNMs can achieve active chemotactic navigation across BBB and dual modulation of α-syn proteostasis through aggregate dissolution and prevention of misfolding. CNMs not only supplement exogenous chaperone activity but also restore endogenous protein stabilization mechanisms, concurrently reducing neuroinflammatory markers, promoting the application of nanochaperones for PD treatment.",

First, we found that energetically subminimal amounts of glucose can support ongoing segmentation clock activity, providing evidence that glycolysis exerts a signaling function. Using a dynamical systems approach based on entrainment, we identified fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as the potential signaling metabolite. Functionally, we demonstrated that glycolytic flux/FBP control the segmentation clock period and Wnt signaling in an anticorrelated manner. Critically, we showed that the slow segmentation clock phenotype caused by elevated glycolysis is mediated by Wnt signaling rather than cellular bioenergetic and biosynthetic state. Combined, our results demonstrate a modular organization of metabolic functions, revealing a signaling module of glycolysis that can be decoupled from its canonical metabolic functions.",

The mass-independent fractionation of even mercury isotopes (even-MIF, denoted as Δ 200 Hg) is widely used to trace atmospheric Hg sources and fluxes. However, the chemical processes inducing even-MIF remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a three-dimensional atmospheric Hg isotope model linking Hg redox processes with even-MIF. The results show that the previous hypothesis of even-MIF occurring exclusively at the tropopause may not fully explain the global Δ 200 Hg patterns. We speculate OH-initiated reactions and photoreduction of Hg II (p) as likely dominant drivers. Simulations show that even-MIF primarily originates in the free troposphere and propagates downward to surface air. Our results reveal distinct spatial Δ 200 Hg variations that were previously unaccounted for in tracing Hg sources. This study provides critical insights into even-MIF drivers and serves as a reference for using Δ 200 Hg to trace atmospheric Hg sources.",

The accelerated eastward mode frequency is expected to rise by 15%, intensifying subseasonal precipitation whiplash worldwide and shortening disaster preparedness time. This acceleration results from an asymmetric pattern of boundary layer moisture convergence anomalies, driven by weakened Rossby wave westerlies and enhanced Kelvin wave response linked to warming-induced atmospheric stabilization and El Niño–like ocean surface warming pattern. Conversely, a projected weakening of easterly vertical shear over the northern Indian Ocean attenuates the Rossby wave response and favors more eastward expansion events.",

Warming weakened the GHG sink of alpine permafrost, thereby increasing (13%) its global warming potential, but strengthened the GHG sink of Arctic permafrost and decreased (−10%) its global warming potential. When warming caused drying of alpine permafrost soils, the CO 2 sink weakened but the CH 4 sink increased. In contrast, warming of relatively wet Arctic permafrost increased the CO 2 sink and CH 4 source. Warming led to much stronger increases of the N 2 O source in alpine than Arctic permafrost. Although keeping additional warming below 2°C in permafrost regions can avoid the positive permafrost-climate feedback, measures are needed to maintain fragile carbon sink of alpine permafrost ecosystems.",

Combining frequency tagging and machine learning, we achieved high-precision separation of neural responses to mixed melodies, classifying them by selective attention toward specific melodies. Across two magnetoencephalography datasets, individual musicality and task performance heavily influenced the attentional recruitment of cortical regions, correlating positively with top-down attention in the left parietal cortex but negatively with bottom-up attention in the right. In prefrontal areas, neural responses indicating higher sustained selective attention reflected better performance and musicality. These results suggest that musical training enhances neural mechanisms in the frontoparietal regions, boosting performance via improving top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and maintaining selective attention over time.

To address this, we compared how cell identity and diversity unfolds in different conditions during neocortical development. Conditions were modified in vivo using genetically modified mouse models in which position or innervation is altered and in vitro using two-dimensional cultures. This approach revealed a molecular hierarchy in which cell class–distinguishing features emerge first, followed by subclass- and type-related characteristics. Acquisition of cellular identity and diversity remained stable across in vivo models.

However, conventional hydrogel electrodes suffer from mechanical fragility, rapid dehydration, freezing, and poor comfort because of thickness-induced interfacial gaps. We report a 2.7-micrometer-thick robust, permeable, and antifreezing hydrogel electrode for high-quality 8-day electrophysiological monitoring under everyday scenarios. The ultrathin electrode is fabricated using gelatin hydrogels with temperature-controlled phase change properties reinforced by nanomesh while incorporating lithium chloride, and a binary solvent achieves antifreezing and antidehydration characteristics. The design minimizes flexural rigidity, resulting in high interfacial adhesion energy with human skin, and enhances gas (air, oxygen, and carbon dioxide) permeance and water vapor transmission rate. Consequently, the ultrathin hydrogel electrode exhibits high biocompatibility, superior wear comfort, and minimized motion and sweat artifacts, enabling reliable, uninterrupted, wireless health monitoring over eight consecutive days across various real-life activities and adaptation to cold environments.",

While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here, we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency η reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field B ‖ is applied. The sign and the magnitude of η are tunable not only by B ‖ but also by the back-gate voltage. This diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano–superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and B ‖ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect marks the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI nanowire–based Josephson junction.",

We recorded VPC neuronal activity in two monkeys performing a tactile or acoustic bimodal detection task (BDT). Single-cell analyses revealed purely tactile, purely acoustic, bimodal, and decision-mnemonic responses. Population analyses of the VPC network and a recurrent neural network trained on the BDT uncovered notably similar latent dynamics. In both networks, neural trajectories diverged sharply from rest along modality-specific directions during stimulus presentation, while remained at rest during stimulus-absent trials. Subsequently, trajectories rotated toward a mnemonic subspace, where perceptual decisions (acoustic, tactile, and absent) were maintained in three distinctly different stable attractors. Using low-dimensional modeling, we propose a universal mechanism for the transition from sensory processing to memory retention explaining both biological and artificial latent neural dynamics in a simple dynamical motif. These results show that VPC neurons encode bimodal information, can integrate competing sensory inputs, and maintain multimodal perceptual decisions.",

Postfire snow cover loss is more extreme in relatively low-elevation, warm environments compared to that in high-elevation, cold regions. Under +2°C of warming, 73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions. Regions with the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt timing under average climate conditions also have the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt under +2°C warming. The spatial variability in postfire snowmelt timing and exacerbated impact in projected warmer winters affect ecosystem water availability, snow albedo feedbacks, and snowmelt runoff forecasting essential to water resource management.",

However, the uncontrolled crystallization dynamics of Br-rich species lead to reduced grain sizes and high defect densities in WBG perovskite films. Herein, a multifunctional additive 3,4,5-trifluorobenzamide (TFBZ) was introduced to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects of the methylammonium (MA)–free WBG perovskite films. The TFBZ demonstrates superior passivation capability compared to benzamide, effectively mitigating both iodine vacancies and undercoordinated Pb 2+ defects via fluorine-enhanced interactions. In addition, the fluorine substituents in TFBZ could form N–H···F hydrogen bonds with formamidinium iodide to retard the crystallization rate of the perovskite. This proposed method is effective in defect passivation and crystal growth modulation for both 1.67– and 1.79–electron volt MA-free WBG perovskites, enabling the fabrication of MA-free all-perovskite TSCs with an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 29.01% (certified at 28.52%).",

Fermentative yeasts are widespread in the terrestrial biosphere, and simple carbohydrates underpinning ethanol production are commonplace within fruits. We determined ethanol concentrations within fruits representing a substantial portion of the diet of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Ripe fruit pulp from 20 angiosperm species in Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda contained an average value of 0.31 (± 0.21 SD) and 0.32% (± 0.20) ethanol (weight/weight), respectively, as scaled by annual chimpanzee feeding time per species at each site. Chimpanzees typically eat ~4.5 kilograms of fruit per day, corresponding to an estimated ethanol ingestion of 14 grams (±9), or the equivalent of 1.4 (±0.9) standard drinks by international standards. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol is widespread within tropical fruits and that modern predisposition to alcohol consumption derives from ancestral exposure to this psychoactive substance among frugivorous primates.",

Although the mechanisms of DDR activation have been extensively studied, how DDR is kept inactive is far less well understood, especially in plants. Here, we show that the plant-specific transcription factor SOG1, a master regulator of the plant DDR, interacts with PRL1, which functions as a substrate adaptor of the Cullin4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 PRL1 to polyubiquitinate SOG1, promoting SOG1 degradation through 26 S proteasome. When DNA damage occurs, PRL1 is degraded and SOG1 is phosphorylated, both of which impair the polyubiquitination and degradation of SOG1. This study demonstrated that plants dynamically control DDR by regulating the phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of SOG1.",

In contrast to a solid, on PaLS, a droplet can be in 10 different wetting states. This richness arises from the adaptation of the liquid lubricants and can be harnessed to control the apparent contact angle of the droplet over the full range of wettability while removing contact-line pinning effects induced by the solid surface. In the limit of thin liquid films, we derive surface-averaged laws for the apparent contact angle for each wetting state, which capture both experimental and simulation data.

While this feature is similar to that occurring in flavoprotein oxidases, the ensuing photocycle is more complex. Upon excitation at the lowest-energy transition, the ejected electron is initially captured as a hydrated electron ( e – H ) before transferring to a secondary acceptor in 2.5 picoseconds and returning to the flavin in 37 picoseconds. This implies that e – H can be generated within a protein environment, an unprecedented finding. This assessment is supported by molecular dynamics simulations showing an expansion of the flavin-binding pocket without substrate, allowing water molecules to fill the void.

Although the posttranslational regulation of PILS is important for acclimating growth responses, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. This study demonstrates that components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery regulate the proteasome-dependent degradation of functional PILS proteins under nonstressed conditions. We further reveal that both internal and external signals use the ERAD complex to differentially modulate the turnover rates of PILS proteins.

We used a combination of in vitro slice electrophysiology, optogenetics, and in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate layer 5 extratelencephalic (ET) and layer 6 corticothalamic (CT) neuronal plasticity in mice, following noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Thalamocortical input was initially balanced between CTs and ETs but shifted to CT-dominant 1 day post-NIHL and then normalized by day 7. This transient shift was accompanied by increased quantal size and suprathreshold excitability in CTs, with minimal changes in ETs. In vivo, CTs exhibited persistent elevation in sound intensity thresholds, while ETs showed a transient shift in frequency tuning and reduced high-frequency responsiveness that recovered within a week. These findings reveal distinct, cell type–specific plasticity mechanisms in deep-layer ACtx neurons following peripheral damage and highlight potential targets for treating hearing loss–related disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis.",

OROV efficiently replicated in pigtail macaques, rhesus macaques, and vervet African green monkeys. OROV also replicated in sabeus African green monkey, albeit at lower levels than other hosts. OROV RNA was detected in plasma and nasal swabs and infection-induced high levels of innate inflammation, type I interferon gene signatures, immunoglobulin M–positive B cell expansion, high titers of neutralizing antibodies, and detectable frequencies of OROV-specific T cells. Prior infection was protective against reinfection up to 524 days post–initial infection, demonstrating possible protective immunity induction against OROV infection.

Nipah virus (NiV), a deadly zoonotic paramyxovirus, uses its matrix protein (M) to drive virus assembly and budding through dimerization and PM interaction. We show that NiV-M–mediated virus-like particle (VLP) production depends on its interaction with host F-actin via its carboxyl-terminal domain. We demonstrate that F-actin retains NiV-M assembly sites at the PM by analyzing NiV-M assembly kinetics. Disrupting actin dynamics or NiV-M–actin interaction alters M nanoscale organization and reduces membrane retention, without affecting initial recruitment. We also show that the Arp2/3 complex, an actin-branching factor, promotes VLP production. Inhibiting Arp2/3 reduces NiV-M retention at the PM and impairs protrusion formation while leaving the assembly rate unchanged. These findings suggest that the host F-actin retains NiV assembly sites on the PM and promotes virus budding via Arp2/3-driven actin branching.",

Using single-cell metabarcoding on 243 diatom-bearing foraminifera specimens from Indonesia, we found one highly dominant diatom strain in each foraminiferal host species bearing at least 90% of the reads in a majority of host species, whereas the bacterial community was very flexible, with only 25% of the variation explained by water depth, substrate type, location, and host species.

We present a data-driven pathway to learn the XC functional by using the exact density, XC energy, and XC potential. While the exact densities are obtained from accurate configuration interaction (CI), the exact XC energies and XC potentials are obtained via inverse DFT calculations on the CI densities. We demonstrate how simple neural network (NN)–based local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), trained on just five atoms and two molecules, provide remarkable improvement in total energies and densities. Particularly, the NN-based GGA functional attains similar accuracy as the higher rung SCAN meta-GGA on various thermochemistry datasets. These results underscore the promise of using the XC potential in modeling XC functionals and can pave the way for systematic learning of increasingly accurate XC functionals.",

However, the role of adipocyte-specific inflammatory signaling in metabolic syndrome remains unclear. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC, is an E3-ligase that generates nondegradative linear ubiquitination (Lin-Ub). LUBAC regulates NF-κB/MAPK-driven inflammation and prevents cell death triggered by immune receptors like TNF receptor-1. Here, we show that mice lacking HOIP, the Lin-E3 ligase catalytic subunit of LUBAC, in adipocytes ( Hoip A-KO ) display lipodystrophy and heightened susceptibility to obesity-induced metabolic syndrome, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Mechanistically, loss of HOIP attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation and promotes cell death in human adipocytes. Inhibiting caspase-8–mediated cell death is sufficient to prevent lipodystrophy and MASLD in Hoip A-KO obese mice. HOIP expression in adipose tissue positively correlates with metabolic fitness in obese individuals. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental developmental role for Lin-Ub in adipocytes by mitigating cell death–driven adipose tissue inflammation and protecting against obesity-related metabolic syndrome.",

Currently available data assessing diatom responses focus on empirical comparisons between present-day and future conditions, rather than exploring the mechanisms driving these responses. Here, we conducted high-resolution growth experiments to map the fitness of diatoms across broad carbonate chemistry landscapes. Our results reveal species-specific carbonate chemistry niches, which can be used to predict ecological shifts between species under changing conditions driven by ocean acidification or ocean alkalinity enhancement. The results demonstrate that changes in diatom fitness are almost exclusively driven by carbon dioxide and proton concentrations, with bicarbonate exerting no discernible effect. Thus, current assumptions regarding the role of bicarbonate as a primary carbon source supporting diatom growth may be overestimated.

We address this by engineering defects, specifically nanopores, in monolayer WS 2 through controlled plasma treatments. These nanopores create dangling bonds to improve molecular adsorption for molecule enrichment and dynamically modulate the WS 2 bandgap to optimize band alignment with rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules. This leads to a shift in photoluminescence peaks from red to blue with increasing defect density. Furthermore, the Raman signal is amplified by localized electromagnetic fields around the nanopores and carefully chosen resonance laser wavelengths. This combination allows blue-shifted WS 2 to achieve single-molecule SERS detection, with a sensitivity limit reaching 1 × 10 −20 M for R6G. Using SERS mapping, we visualize adsorption sites, confirming the nanopores’ role as active sites.

Both the variation amplitude and the angular range over which the frictional strength varies are governed by roughness alignment. Universal statistical patterns emerge in micromechanical quantities, including the microcontact area, orientation, deformation, and their evolutions under shear, following generalized extreme value distributions. To quantify asperity interactions, we introduce the contact fabric tensor, whose anisotropy provides a unified measure of roughness matching and a predictor for frictional strength and sliding onset.

          "abstract": "Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are critical to fuel cell performance, where ion transport, catalyst activity, and mass transfer determine efficiency and durability. However, conventional membranes in PEM fuel cells often suffer from hydrogen crossover, limited conductivity, and poor interfacial stability. To address these challenges, this study develops a nanofiber membrane system with synergistic structural and interfacial enhancement. Through nanofiber architecture and surface engineering, the membrane balances proton conductivity, mechanical strength and electrochemical performance. The sandwich-structure nanofiber membrane (SSNFM) achieves a peak power density of 942 mW cm −2 after 100-hour accelerated stress testing, substantially outperforming conventional commercial membranes (520 mW cm −2 ). Electrochemical characterization confirms enhanced proton conductivity for SSNFM (40.4 mS cm −1 ) compared to commercial membranes (17.5 mS cm −1 ). Multiscale analyses, including x-ray computed tomography and multiphase simulations, reveal improved membrane properties, catalyst layer stability, and triple-phase boundary formation, facilitating efficient charge and mass transport. This work presents a membrane design strategy to enhance fuel cell performance in sustainable energy applications.",

          "abstract": "α cells secrete proglucagon peptides to regulate nutrient metabolism. Recent findings support an α cell–to–β cell axis that is mediated by paracrine signaling through the glucagon receptor and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor in β cells. To address which proglucagon peptides stimulate insulin secretion, we developed an assay to quantify levels of GLP-1(7–36)NH 2 . We also generated three transgenic mouse lines that allow α cell-specific, inducible deletion of the genes for the two prohormone convertase enzymes that process proglucagon . Our studies reveal that both mouse and human islets contain GLP-1(7–36)NH2, but glucagon mediates α cell–to–β cell communication in mice. However, in the absence of normal production of glucagon, α cells up-regulate prohormone convertase 1 (PC1/3) to generate GLP-1 and enhance glucose tolerance. Human islets have substantially higher levels of GLP-1 than mice, which positively correlate with rates of insulin secretion. These studies show plasticity in proglucagon processing to support α cell–to–β cell communication.",
