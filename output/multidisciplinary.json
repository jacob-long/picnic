          "abstract": "The exponential growth of scientific literature presents an increasingly acute challenge across disciplines. Hundreds of thousands of new chemical reactions are reported annually, yet translating them into actionable experiments becomes an obstacle1,2. Recent applications of large language models (LLMs) have shown promise3,4,5,6, but systems that reliably work for diverse transformations across de novo compounds have remained elusive. Here we introduce MOSAIC (Multiple Optimized Specialists for AI-assisted Chemical Prediction), a computational framework that enables chemists to harness the collective knowledge of millions of reaction protocols. MOSAIC is built upon the Llama-3.1-8B-instruct architecture7, training 2,498 specialized chemical experts within Voronoi-clustered spaces. This approach delivers reproducible and executable experimental protocols with confidence metrics for complex syntheses. With an overall 71% success rate, experimental validation demonstrates the realizations of over 35 novel compounds, spanning pharmaceuticals, materials, agrochemicals, and cosmetics. Notably, MOSAIC also enables the discovery of new reaction methodologies that are absent from the expert’s training, a cornerstone for advancing chemical synthesis. This scalable paradigm of partitioning vast domains into searchable expert regions enables a generalizable strategy for AI-assisted discovery wherever accelerating information growth outpaces efficient knowledge access and application.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that peripheral diseases serve as risk factors for dementia, but the population-level burden of dementia associated with various peripheral diseases has remained unknown. Here, by conducting a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analyses to estimate the relative risks of 26 peripheral diseases across 9 systems with dementia, including 202 articles searched from the PubMed until 6 September 2024, we identified 16 peripheral diseases as associated with increased risk of dementia. With the relative risks estimated from meta-analyses, prevalences extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study, and communalities among these 16 peripheral diseases derived from the UK Biobank, we analysed the population attributable fractions (PAFs) of these 16 peripheral diseases for dementia, stratified by sex, age, sociodemographic index level, world region and country, and trends from 1990 to 2021. Globally, these peripheral diseases collectively were related to a combined PAF of 33.18% (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.80–48.43) of dementia burden, corresponding to 18.8 million prevalent cases. The leading ten PAF contributors were periodontal diseases (6.10%, 95% CI 0.95–10.28), cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases (5.51%, 95% CI 1.77–8.86), age-related and other hearing loss (4.70%, 95% CI 3.51–6.06), blindness and vision loss (4.30%, 95% CI 3.43–5.05), type 2 diabetes mellitus (3.80%, 95% CI 3.06–4.53), chronic kidney disease (2.74%, 95% CI 1.53–4.02), osteoarthritis (2.26%, 95% CI 0.41–4.12), stroke (1.01%, 95% CI 0.86–1.17), ischaemic heart disease (0.97%, 95% CI 0.69–1.29) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.92%, 95% CI 0.34–1.54). This study revealed that a series of peripheral diseases were associated with increased risk of dementia and collectively were related to about one-third of the global dementia burden, highlighting the need for targeted public health strategies.",

In a crowd-sourced sample ( N = 5,237), we find that a reduced ΔES weighting drives indecisiveness along an obsessive–compulsive spectrum. We replicate this attenuated ΔES weighting in a second lab-based study ( N = 105) that includes a transdiagnostic obsessive–compulsive spectrum encompassing OCD and generalized anxiety patients. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we trace ΔES signals to a late neural signal peaking at ~920 ms. Critically, highly obsessive–compulsive participants, across diagnoses, show an attenuated neural ΔES signal in mediofrontal areas, while other decision-relevant processes remain intact. Our findings establish biased information weighting as a driver of information gathering, where attenuated ΔES is linked to indecisiveness across an obsessive–compulsive spectrum.",

We provide evidence from English for a more basic kind of linguistic representation involving smaller, linear chunks of structure akin to sequences of parts-of-speech elements—such as verb preposition determiner shared between the strings added to a and defined by the. Across four preregistered phrasal decision experiments (total N = 497), we show that it is possible to prime such linear structures, even in the absence of constituents. In two additional corpus analyses of eye-tracked reading (N = 68) and conversation (N = 358), we establish the external validity of the effect. These results provide evidence of multiword language structures that are not explainable in terms of constituents as traditionally construed.

          "abstract": "To reduce current and future coastal flood risk, it is critical to better understand how adaptation measures, including nature-based solutions, can reduce that risk. Globally, hybrid coastal defenses, including a combination of coastal vegetation, such as salt marshes and mangroves, with a dike or sea wall, have been highlighted as a promising adaptation measure. Here, we present a global-scale assessment of the potential risk reduction from mangrove restoration in combination with foreshore dike systems under scenarios of climate and socioeconomic change. We provide a quantitative assessment of the benefits in terms of reduced economic damage, exposed population, and poverty exposure. We evaluate mangrove restoration fronting dikes by accounting for wave–vegetation interaction. If mangrove foreshore dike systems were established along coastlines susceptible to flooding, restoration could potentially reduce expected annual damage by US$800 million and reduce expected affected population by 140,000 annually. These values increase under future projections. Our benefit–cost analysis finds mangrove restoration economically viable for about half of the subnational regions assessed (85 to 105 out of 208). At the global scale, the benefit–cost ratio under future conditions ranges from 3 to 6, with a net present value between US$44 billion and US$125 billion. Because absolute risk values and benefit–cost analysis do not differentiate between relative wealth impacts, we also estimated restoration impacts across different wealth levels. We show that restoring mangroves disproportionately benefits people with lower incomes, as they are often more exposed to coastal flooding and located in areas suitable for mangrove restoration. As such, mangrove restoration in low- and middle-income countries could contribute to the resilience of people in poverty.",

We find significant generalized disparities in media coverage and portrayal of incidents depending on whether they occur in neighborhoods that are majority white or majority people of color (POC), including increased media attention on police shootings if they occur in majority POC neighborhoods, greater focus on the people involved in incidents in majority white neighborhoods, and increased racialization and framing related to crime in majority POC neighborhoods.",

Given the essential role of mtDNA in energy production, metabolism, as well as cellular homeostasis, and the high density of confirmed pathogenic mutations that map to mtDNA, there is a pressing need for versatile methods to study and manipulate this genome. Although CRISPR technology has revolutionized the editing of nuclear genomes, it has not been successfully extended to mtDNA, primarily due to the challenge of delivering single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) across both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Here we develop a survival-based reporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to screen for potential RNA import motifs. We identify a 40-nucleotide aptamer (IM83) that facilitates sgRNA entry into the mitochondrial matrix, enabling CRISPR editing by a mitochondrially-localized adenine base editor. We show that mitochondrial import of IM83 is ATP-dependent and enhanced by the tRNA synthetase Msk1. Further investigations identify barriers to efficient CRISPR editing of mtDNA, including loss of membrane potential associated with mitochondrial targeting of the base editor. These insights lay the groundwork for future improvements in CRISPR-based editing of mtDNA in eukaryotes.",

Beyond clearly pathogenic mutations, germline sequencing often reveals variants of uncertain significance (VUS), predominantly single base-pair alterations in coding or noncoding regions. These uncertain variants obstruct LS diagnosis, hampering personalized surveillance. To address this challenge, we developed a highly accurate functional assay that interrogates VUS pathogenicity in human cells. Building on a mouse-based cellular assay, we adapted oligonucleotide-directed mutation screening (ODMS) for human cells and introduced a refined approach named “coselection ODMS.” To ensure physiological expression, the variant is introduced into the endogenous MMR gene by replication-coupled gene editing. Coselection ODMS demonstrated 100% accuracy in classifying 50 benign and 86 pathogenic variants spanning coding and noncoding regions in all four MMR genes. Among 109 patient-derived VUS, 51 were identified as deleterious for MMR function. Importantly, coselection ODMS delivered 100% concordant results in a clinical diagnostic laboratory. With &gt;93% sensitivity and &gt;92% specificity, coselection ODMS provides a highly reliable functional assay in the diagnosis of enigmatic LS variants, enabling risk assessment and personalized surveillance or treatment for affected families.",

          "abstract": "Lymph node (LN) metastasis (LNM) frequently occurs in various cancer types and is associated with high aggressiveness, poor prognosis, and low survival rates. However, effective clinical interventions remain limited primarily due to the distinctive immunosuppressive microenvironment found in metastatic LNs. Targeted delivery of immunomodulators and selective immunoengineering in metastatic LNs offers a promising avenue for repurposing these LNs as an effective antitumor system while mitigating the risk of unwanted immune activation elsewhere. Here, we develop a bioresponsive LN-targeted immunomodulator nanocomplex designed to selectively reprogram the immune microenvironment in metastatic LNs for LNM inhibition. The immunomodulator nanocomplex can target LNs due to specific chemokine receptor 7 modification and selectively release anti-PD-1 antibodies in response to glutathione that is found elevated in the extracellular matrix of metastatic LNs. In two mouse models, our data suggested that the immunomodulator nanocomplex can selectively activate T cell–mediated antitumor immune responses in metastatic LNs and thus effectively inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival of animals. Importantly, the modular design of this platform could enable facile incorporation of alternative immunotherapeutic agents that exhibit significant systemic toxicities in the clinic, allowing broader application to payloads that may particularly benefit from localized, LNM-selective activation. This approach holds significant promises for reducing the necessity for complete LN dissection, thereby presenting a valuable therapeutic option for a broad spectrum of cancer patients.",

Using mutational scanning in yeast, we identify thousands of such interactions in a clinically important enzyme, human argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). Restoration of protein function is not due to the biochemical properties of the substituted amino acids, but rather to a structural feature of the protein, the active site assembly. We develop a machine learning algorithm that uses protein language model embeddings to predict intragenic complementation in ASL with 99.6% accuracy. Additionally, the model trained on ASL generalizes to a structurally related but sequence-divergent enzyme, fumarase, with accuracy over 90%. Our findings reveal a structural basis for this form of epistasis and provide a predictive framework that could extend to at least 4% of human proteins.",

Using single-cell transcriptomics and a Nestin-CreERT2;NIHes1 fl/fl conditional knock-out mouse model, we have characterized the NIHes1 NSCs. Our analyses show that NIHes1 NSCs are the ancestral precursor NSCs that generate RGCs and intermediate progenitor cells during development. Loss of NIHes1 expression significantly alters the NSC niche, leading to increased gliogenesis and aberrant migration of projection neurons. NIHes1 NSCs are set aside at embryonic stages as adult neural stem cells and are maintained by NIHes1 expression even at adult stage.

Considering the spectrum of mutant phenotypes that can arise within a declining population, there exists the interesting case of mutations which improve fitness relative to the wild-type, but do not restore population growth. Here, we hypothesize that mutations within this phenotype space are functionally inaccessible to populations in decline and term it an “evolutionary excluded zone.” We experimentally demonstrate that this excluded zone disallows certain mutational paths from causing evolutionary rescue in declining populations of M13 bacteriophage. We then integrate this observation into Fisher’s Geometric Model to extrapolate it to other evolutionary rescue scenarios. Our findings indicate that the excluded zone significantly reduces the likelihood of evolutionary rescue by de novo mutation and that evolution is fundamentally different in declining populations than in ones that are constant or growing.",

However, it remains unclear which phase of memory oxytocin affects to enhance face memory. Our study explored oxytocin’s potential to selectively enhance the consolidation of social memories, specifically human faces, and whether this effect varies between genders. In three preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with heterosexual participants (total N = 445, comprising 227 males and 218 females), we explored how oxytocin affects memory consolidation. We administered oxytocin immediately after encoding (i.e., Study 1), before retrieval (i.e., Study 2), and before encoding (i.e., Study 3) in three parallel studies. This design allowed us to confirm that oxytocin’s effects were indeed due to consolidation rather than retrieval or encoding. We found that administering oxytocin post-encoding, but not before-retrieval or before-encoding, significantly improved female participants’ ability to recognize male faces 24 h later, with no similar enhancement observed in males recognizing opposite-gender faces. Together with our analyses of the social placebo effect—where the belief in receiving oxytocin produces effects similar to those of actual intranasal oxytocin administration—and the approachability ratings during encoding, we concluded that oxytocin specifically enhances the consolidation of long-term social memories in women recognizing male faces. These findings imply that oxytocin selectively enhances the consolidation of human social memory, potentially deepening our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social memory processes.",

          "abstract": "p62/SQSTM1 generates liquid–liquid phase-separated condensates that participate in diverse processes, including protein quality control (PQC) and autophagy. Nuclear p62 condensates were shown to act as ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated degradation hubs, whereas the involvement of cytoplasmic condensates in this pathway has remained unclear. Here, we show that cytoplasmic p62 condensates serve as a hub for proteasomal degradation that displays distinct substrate preferences compared with nuclear condensates. Specifically, cytoplasmic condensates mediate accelerated degradation of the tumor suppressor p53 through recruitment MDM2, its E3 ligase, while nuclear condensates are selectively enriched with USP7, a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that stabilizes p53. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tissues reveal that p62 in healthy tissues is largely localized to the nucleus, whereas in the corresponding malignant tissues, it is largely in the cytosol, which is correlated with reduced p53 abundance in tumors. Nuclear p62 condensates also promote the degradation of oncogenic c-Myc, underscoring compartment-specific differences in protein turnover. Experiments in cancer cells and xenografts demonstrate that cytoplasmic p62 condensates drive tumor growth, whereas nuclear p62 condensates suppress it. Moreover, condensate formation rather than p62 expression alone is required for both enhanced proteolytic activity and tumor growth modulation. Proteomic analysis reveals that nuclear p62, unlike its cytosolic counterpart, is linked to enrichment of proteins associated with apoptosis, p53 stabilization, DNA damage response, and cellular senescence—all related to tumor suppression. These findings establish that p62 condensates provide compartment-specific regulation of ubiquitin and proteasomal degradation and suggest that manipulating their localization or affecting their dynamics can offer different therapeutic opportunities.",

The RLK BARELY ANY MERISTEM1 (BAM1) promotes phloem formation and regulates other aspects of root development. However, the mechanisms governing BAM1 protein degradation remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that two closely related ubiquitin ligases, RING DOMAIN LIGASE 1 (RGLG1) and RGLG2, specifically interact with BAM1 and its closest homolog BAM2. RGLG1/2 ubiquitinate BAM1/2 and mediate their degradation, thereby dampening BAM1/2 signaling. Treatment with the peptide CLE13 (CLV3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED 13) enhances the BAM1/2-RGLG2 interaction and the ubiquitin ligase activity of RGLG2, resulting in increased ubiquitination and degradation of BAM1/2 by RGLG1/2. The rglg1 rglg2 double mutant exhibits increased sensitivity to CLE13 compared to the wild type. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that RGLG1/2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of BAM1/2 attenuate CLE13-mediated signaling in root meristem.",

          "abstract": "Juvenile hormone (JH) exerts pleiotropic effects in insects, regulating not only metamorphosis and reproduction but also caste differentiation, morphogenesis, and diapause. How such diverse functions evolved from the ancestral role of JH remains poorly understood. The water flea, Daphnia , provides a striking case in which JH governs environmental sex determination (ESD) by inducing male production. Nonetheless, the molecular pathway linking maternal JH signaling to sex determination has remained unknown. Here, we identify the circadian gene, vrille ( Dpvri ), as a direct transcriptional target of JH signaling. Reporter assays revealed that Dpvri is activated by the JH receptor complex (Methoprene-tolerant/steroid receptor coactivator) via newly acquired 9-bp JH response elements (9 bp-JHREs) in its regulatory region, whereas the beetle ( Tribolium ) vri gene lacks such elements and did not show JH-responsive expression. This demonstrates that the presence or absence of specific regulatory sequences underlies interspecific differences in JH responsiveness. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of a single JHRE substantially reduced JH-dependent Dpvri expression and elevated the threshold for male induction, demonstrating its causal role in vivo. Comparative sequence analyses showed that JHREs in vri are conserved in the Cladocera, but absent in the crustacean, Artemia , suggesting that their emergence coincided with the origin of ESD in this lineage. These findings reveal the evolutionary co-option of vri into the JH pathway via acquisition of a JHRE, providing a mechanistic explanation for diversification of JH functions in arthropods.",

          "authors": "Ming Qiu, Xiaohua Wei, Yiping Hou",
          "abstract": "The hydrological functions of forests are well recognized, but their influence on water storage and release dynamics remains poorly quantified. The fraction of young water ( F yw )—the proportion of streamflow younger than 2 to 3 mo—serves as an integrative indicator of a watershed’s capacity to retain and release precipitation. Here, by analyzing F yw across 657 watersheds worldwide, we found that forest cover exhibited a significant negative relationship with F yw . The causality was further corroborated through a meta-analysis of postdeforestation F yw trends, confirming that forest loss accelerates the conversion of recent precipitation into streamflow. This effect was most pronounced in watersheds with shallow groundwater, highlighting the role of forests in regulating rapid, near-surface flowpaths. Beyond total forest cover, we found that forest landscape patterns also exerted influences: A lower proportion of forest edge was associated with higher F yw , but only in sparsely forested watersheds ( ≤ ∼ 40% forest cover), where the edge-enhanced evapotranspiration was most pronounced. This global synthesis not only reinforces the hydrological value of forest conservation and restoration but also highlights that deliberate planning of forest landscape patterns can help mitigate the hydrological consequences of forest loss. Together, these findings demonstrate that integrating forest protection with forest landscape planning is essential for sustaining hydrological functions.",

Loss of TapA disrupts division, dysregulates pole formation, and sensitizes Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria to several first and second-line TB antibiotics, establishing TapA as a potential therapeutic target, and defining a link between cell cycle progression, envelope remodeling, and intrinsic antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria.",

Four distinct vortex patterns are identified, including a vortex crystal resembling Jupiter’s polar vortices and a single-vortex state akin to that of Saturn.

          "abstract": "The apicomedial actomyosin network is crucial for generating mechanical forces in cells. Oscillatory behavior of this contractile network is commonly observed before or during significant morphogenetic events. For instance, during the development of the Drosophila adult abdominal epidermis, larval epithelial cells (LECs) undergo pulsed contractions before being replaced by histoblasts. These contractions involve the formation of contracted regions of concentrated actin and myosin. The emergence and control of pulsed contractions are not fully understood. Here, we combined in vivo 4D microscopy with numerical simulations of an active elastomer model applied to realistic cell geometries and boundary conditions informed by cell polarity to study in vivo subcellular spatial patterns of LEC actomyosin dynamics. The active elastomer model quantitatively reproduced in vivo observations. When compared to rectangular domains, simulations on realistic cell geometries showed systematically better agreement with experiments. We found that cell shape, cell polarity, and organization of the cell’s actomyosin network codetermine spatiotemporal network dynamics both in vivo and in simulations. Furthermore, the model predicted changes to LEC contractile activity under genetic perturbation of the actomyosin network. Our results show that cell geometry, accompanied by boundary conditions which reflect the cells’ polarity, is important to understanding the dynamics of the apicomedial actomyosin network. Moreover, our findings support the notion that spatiotemporal oscillatory behavior of the actomyosin network is an emergent property of the actomyosin network, rather than driven by upstream signaling.",

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important info-chemicals in plant–plant interactions, but they have so far rarely been considered in this context. Here, we measured VOC emissions at the community scale and for one species ( Plantago lanceolata ) in experimental plant communities of varying diversity (The Jena Experiment) to understand the role of VOCs in driving biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. We show that plant diversity determines the release of plant VOCs at both scales. At the community level, plant species richness directly enhanced VOC emission and increased VOC richness both directly and indirectly by altering leaf area index. At the species level, plant diversity did not directly affect the VOC emissions of P. lanceolata but indirectly affected it by influencing the VOC emissions from the surrounding community. P. lanceolata individuals in communities with high concentrations of green leaf volatiles decreased their VOC emission, while those in communities with high concentrations of terpenoids increased their VOC diversity. Our results provide evidence that plant diversity shapes community-level plant VOC emission and thus influences focal plant VOC emission inside the community.",

Double-positive CD4 + CD8 + (DP) T cells have also been described in human cancers, but their role in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. By generating a multiomic single cell atlas of DP and SP T cells, we find that DP T cells possess phenotypic heterogeneity similar to SP T cells that includes multiple clonally expanded populations of cytotoxic DP T cells in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These intratumoral DP T cells can mediate both MHC class I- and class II-dependent killing of autologous tumor cells. In addition, transcriptional profiling of DP TCR-bearing T cells revealed a gene signature enriched for clinical responders to PD-1 blockade in advanced RCC. We confirm prior observations of SP T cells transitioning into DP T cells and more notably, demonstrate that intratumoral T cells are capable of bidirectional differentiation in which DP T cells serve as precursors to SP T cell sin vivo. In the latter scenario, intratumoral DP T cells are shown to express Rag2 , suggesting that the tumor may act as an extrathymic site of T cell development. These findings reveal the multiple roles that DP T cells can possess in antitumor immunity.",

          "abstract": "Plants trigger specific changes in gene transcription to acclimate to low-oxygen concentrations. Plastid-localized STEAROYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN ∆9-DESATURASE 6 (SAD6) converts C18:0- into C18:1-fatty acids and belongs to the core hypoxia-responsive genes. SAD6 expression under hypoxia is activated by RAP2.12, which is a group-VII ethylene-response factor (ERF-VII) transcription factor regulated by sequestering to ACYL-CoA BINDING PROTEIN (ACBP) at the plasma membrane or proteasomal degradation via the PLANT CYSTEINE-OXIDASE N-degron pathway in response to molecular oxygen. Besides its role as hypoxia-specific marker gene, the biological function of SAD6 remains unclear. Here, we show that SAD6 overexpression mostly phenocopies plants overexpressing an N-degron insensitive Δ13RAP2.12 protein, which fails to be targeted to proteasomal degradation, while silencing of SAD6 in Δ13RAP2.12 -overexpressor plants largely restores the wildtype phenotype, indicating SAD6 is crucial to shape the growth phenotype of plants with deregulated RAP2.12. However, silencing of SAD6 also attenuated the expression of other important hypoxia-responsive genes, both, in Δ13RAP2.12 -overexpressor and wildtype backgrounds in response to hypoxic treatment, indicating a signaling role of SAD6 in activating RAP2.12. By using green-fluorescent protein-reporter constructs we found that this is due to SAD6 promoting RAP2.12 relocation from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, most likely by its role to increase C18:1-acyl-CoA, which is bound by ACBP as ligand. These results indicate SAD6 to be crucial to trigger relocation of sequestered RAP2.12 protein to the nucleus, showing an involvement of plastid function in hypoxia signaling, which links plastid fatty-acid metabolism with plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling via ERF-VII factors to improve hypoxic-stress resistance.",

          "abstract": "Experimental tests of the effects of host heterogeneities on parasite transmission are rare; previous studies focus on a single host trait over one generation of transmission. Thus, the long-term epidemiological consequences of interacting host heterogeneities remain unclear. We used a laboratory-based experimental system comprising the red flour beetle ( Tribolium castaneum ) infected with the eugregarine parasite, Gregarina cloptoni , to show, firstly, that two colonies of the beetle are heterogeneous in their susceptibility and infectiousness to the eugregarine. We then constructed experimental populations that differed in population-level heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectiousness by varying proportions of the colonies in the populations and tracked parasite transmission over eight weeks. We found that differences in parasite transmission among populations were explained by population mean susceptibility and infectiousness, rather than heterogeneity. Finally, to test the effects of heterogeneity on equilibrium parasite transmission we developed an agent-based model (ABM) for our host–parasite system. Results from our model showed that populations with the highest level of heterogeneity had the highest between-simulation variability in epidemiological measures. This demonstrated that even with the same starting conditions, host heterogeneities can drive high levels of uncertainty in epidemiological predictability. Our work presents a rare experimental assessment of how heterogeneities in susceptibility and infectiousness affect parasite transmission, showing that while these heterogeneities may not affect transmission directly, they can still affect epidemic variability, and hence predictability. This variability has considerable consequences for outbreak management strategies yet remains understudied, so further tests of the effects of host heterogeneity on epidemic variability will be important.",

In disease such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading worldwide cause of blindness among the elderly, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell heterogeneity is a key change. Since smoking is a powerful risk factor for AMD, we hypothesized that smoke induces epigenetic-mediated degenerative RPE heterogeneity. We administered cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) to young and aged mice. Using snRNA-seq and single nuclear ATAC sequencing, we identified distinct healthy and dedifferentiated RPE clusters in both aged vehicle- and young CSC-treated mice. Dedifferentiated RPE had globally decreased chromatin accessibility and expression of genes linked to “hallmarks of aging.” Notably, young, dedifferentiated RPE also exhibited a compensatory upregulation of hallmarks of aging-related genes including mitochondrial function and proteostasis while aged dedifferentiated RPE did not, which decreased their survival following CSC treatment, as experimentally verified with TUNEL labeling. Similar populations of dedifferentiated and healthy RPE were identified both in mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 4 mo and in macular RPE from a donor who smoked and another with early AMD, but not from a nonsmoker donor. Degenerative cellular heterogeneity that includes an abnormal cluster can jeopardize cell survival and represents a hallmark of ocular aging.",

Using the photon momentum method to directly measure trapping forces, we show that swarming clusters generate persistent, dissipative flows indicative of nonequilibrium stationary motility within confined solenoidal mesostructures. These flagellar rotational dynamics break detailed balance in mesoscopic force space and exceed the limits of passive friction, as evidenced by force-velocity correlations and vortex-like circulations. By coarse-graining cluster trajectories into an active Brownian phase space, we quantify the work performed by bacterial swarms at cooperative coupling to thermal fluctuations, resulting in dissipative Ohmic-like currents overcoming conservative trapping.

However, the effects of spatial aggregation on the strength of species interactions are less well understood, especially in diverse ecological communities. In a field experiment with annual grassland plants in California, we manipulated the spatial arrangement—but not the number or identity—of two competitors and measured how they jointly affected a focal individual. We found that focal plants produced more seeds when their competitors were clustered than when they were mixed. These results suggest that mixed competitors generally had a more negative effect than clustered competitors. However, the effect of clustering varied across the pairs of competitor species. Competitor species that exhibited greater differences in size and/or functional traits across the spatial arrangements resulted in larger effects of clustering on focal plant seed production. Additionally, a competitive hierarchy among our study species predicted the effects of clustered versus mixed competitors on focal plant seed production. Altogether, our work suggests that the spatial arrangement of competitors changes the realized strength of competition in diverse plant communities. Given the extensive variation in spatial aggregation in plant communities, this mechanism is likely to be a powerful but underappreciated force shaping competition in nature.",

As a result, we identify increased conduction delays in nerve signal propagation, hindered interhemispheric synchronization, and impaired cognitive and motor performance associated with SL. By profiling oligodendrocyte transcriptome and lipidome, we observe SL-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid metabolism dysregulation, particularly affecting cholesterol homeostasis.

Preventing future outbreaks and developing efficient mitigation protocols can benefit from advanced computational modeling approaches. Here, we developed an agent-based modeling approach to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of an infection outbreak in a confined environment caused by a specific pathogen, and to determine effective containment protocols. The approach integrates the 3D geographic information system of a confined environment, behavior of the hosts, key biological parameters about the pathogen obtained from the experimental data, and the general mechanics of host–pathogen and pathogen–fomite interactions. To assess our approach, we applied it to the historical data of infectious outbreaks caused by norovirus, H1N1 influenza A, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Our AI-GIS Infection Dynamics (AGID) model accurately predicted daily infection numbers, correctly identified the day when the CDC vessel sanitation protocol would be triggered, singled out key biological parameters affecting the infection spread, and propose pathogen-specific changes to existing containment protocols. Our work advances the understanding of infection spread on cruise ships while offering insights applicable to other similar confined settings, such as nursing homes, schools, and hospitals. By providing a robust framework for real-time outbreak modeling, this study proposes more effective containment protocols and enhances our preparedness for managing infectious diseases and emerging pathogens in confined environments.",

However, conventional magnetic films, mostly obtained via vacuum deposition, remain constrained by rigidity, instantaneous response, and single-mode. Here, we report a giant magnetoimpedance ionogel (GelGMI) in which electrostatically self-assembled ferromagnetic (FM) domains are uniformly dispersed in a soft ionogel matrix. Under a magnetic field, domain moments realign to reconfigure ionic pathways, yielding pronounced magnetoimpedance while maintaining performance at &gt;1,000% strain and across orientations. The hysteretic relaxation of domain magnetization imparts retrospective neuron-like temporal summation, realizing sequence- and context-aware interaction. In addition, the self-healable matrix supports a complementary tactile mode whose impedance contrasts with contact-free magnetic proximity, enabling expandable and bimodal recognition. GelGMI delivers a record-high sensitivity while unifying stretchable, neuromorphic, and healable capabilities for contact-free HMI systems.",

          "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multipotent self-renewing cells that give rise to all types of blood cells. Past research has identified that long-term hematopoietic stem cells in young mice and humans produce a balanced output of lymphoid and myeloid cells, while in old age, they are largely replaced by myeloid-biased HSCs (My-HSC). It has not yet been determined whether this transition results from epigenetic changes in a single population of HSC or if two or more subsets of HSCs exist that gain or lose dominance with age via processes of selection. Whether epigenetic change or competition, several characteristics of each may exist to ensure that the appropriate subset is placed in niches that support them. HSC can be mobilized into the blood and home selectively to target tissues via expression of “homing receptors,” but these molecules do not determine their intraorgan migration to appropriate niches. Chemokines are the class of molecules that determine intraorgan migration of cells. Here, we show that the chemokine receptor CCR5 is mainly expressed on My-HSCs, and therefore, the frequency of CCR5 + HSCs increases with age. Aged HSCs negative for CCR5 expression generate lower frequency of myeloid cells than lymphoid cells upon transplantation into recipients. Additionally, disruption of the CCL5–CCR5 signaling axis changes frequency of lymphoid populations in peripheral blood of aged mice, supporting research that shows the depletion of My-HSCs can result in the rejuvenation of adaptive immunity.",

          "abstract": "Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are promising electrolyte candidates for next-generation Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, the reverse migration of free anions causes uneven distribution of space charges and Li + flux, ultimately accelerating dendrite growth. Additionally, strong ion–solvent interactions lead to high Li + desolvation barriers and sluggish Li + transfer kinetics. To address these issues, we design a zwitterionic GPE, where the synergistic effects of zwitterionic groups promote Li-salt dissociation through ion–dipole interactions and simultaneously restrict anion migration, effectively suppressing space charge-induced dendrite growth. Moreover, the competitive coordination of zwitterions with Li + weakens the Li + -solvent interaction, accelerating interfacial Li + desolvation. Zwitterions in the inner solvation shell of Li + are preferentially reduced before the solvents, forming a conductive N- and S-rich inorganic interphase that enhances cycling stability. As a result, the zwitterionic GPE enables the Li||SPAN cells to deliver a high discharge capacity of 528.3 mAh g −1 at −20 °C, and achieve 79.6% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles. Besides, the Li||SPAN pouch cell, with an active mass loading of 10.5 mg cm −2 , delivers a high discharge capacity of 1.63 Ah and an impressive areal capacity of 16.3 mAh cm −2 .

          "abstract": "Conservation actions often assume implicitly that heritabilities are zero and that threatened populations cannot adapt to changing environments. To illustrate, we evaluated the last 10 y of recovery plans for US threatened and endangered species and found that only 4% assessed within-population adaptability. This omission reflects the common assumption that population adaptation is too slow or inconsequential to affect conservation practice in the short term. Yet, the median heritability (h 2 ) and evolvability (I A ) across many studies are not zero as assumed, but 0.3 and 0.4, respectively, based on a compilation of estimated values. This moderate heritability could rescue some populations. By compiling literature on conservation assessments, we detail how considering adaptability can shift conservation priorities, alter management recommendations, and provide additional ways to rescue declining populations and species. Based on these findings, we advocate for including population adaptability into conservation plans and adopting the prior expectation of moderate adaptability (h 2 = 0.3, I A = 0.4) along with its uncertainty, as a starting point when better information is lacking. This moderate adaptability could allow some species to respond naturally to environmental change while directing limited resources toward the species that need it most.",

Irrespective of whether the data are clustered by region, taxonomic group, conservation status, or breeding program type, the proportion of old individuals has increased continuously, mirrored by a decrease in juveniles and actively reproducing adults.

Here, we show that recall of a positively valenced reward-associated cue (reward-conditioned stimulus, CS Rew +) can prevent or reverse fear generalization in mice. Modification of generalized fear by recall of a CS Rew + is dependent on the midbrain dopamine system and the regulation of discriminatory fear encoding by the central amygdala (CeA). Precisely timed, transient elevations in dopamine are necessary to reverse fear generalization and nondiscriminatory fear encoding in the CeA. Recall of a positive association is also effective at enhancing the extinction of a conditioned fear response in a dopamine-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that recall of a positive experience can be an effective means to suppress generalized fear and show that dopamine projections to the CeA are an important neural substrate for this phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "The stable reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) acts as a key signaling molecule for many vital intracellular pathways. In diverse cell types, surface receptors control intracellular H 2 O 2 levels by modulating the activity of NADPH oxidases (NOX), a family of enzymes responsible for ROS synthesis. Most NOX isoforms are regulated through the reversible assembly of protein subunits to form an active oligomeric complex. The NOX isoforms NOX2 and NOX4 are expressed in endothelial cells and generate H 2 O 2 in response to activation of cell surface receptors. The GPCR agonist histamine activates NOX2 independently of NOX4, but the H 2 O 2 response to activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase agonist vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) involves both NOX2 and NOX4 by unknown mechanisms [M. Waldeck-Weiermair et al. , Redox Biol. 58 , 102539 (2022); M. Waldeck-Weiermair et al. , Redox Biol. 73 , 103214 (2024)]. Here, we show that endothelial NOX4 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We define the redox states of various subcellular locales in the vascular endothelium and demonstrate that NOX2 is responsible for cytosolic H 2 O 2 signaling, whereas NOX4 contributes to H 2 O 2 generation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Using biochemical assays and structural modeling, we further identify a previously unrecognized regulatory interaction in which the NOX2 subunit p67 associates with NOX4. VEGF stimulation induces dynamic dissociation of p67 from NOX4, unveiling a “cross talk” between NOX isoforms that coordinates the activation of both NOX2 and NOX4 and thereby produces compartment-specific H 2 O 2 signals. This mechanism underscores the pivotal roles of NOX2 and NOX4 subunit interactions in endothelial redox homeostasis controlling cell survival, proliferation, and migration.",

Initial hit compounds were de novo discovered from GSDMD affinity selections using Random Nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery system, and were then optimized using mRNA display-based saturation mutagenesis. The resulting bCRPs bound to full-length GSDMD (best K D = 125 nM) and stabilized it against cleavage by caspase proteases. The bCRPs prevented the pore formation in liposome leakage assays and inhibited the secretion of IL-1β and lactate dehydrogenase from pyroptotic THP-1 cells. The potency, high metabolic stability, and synthetic accessibility of the discovered compounds make them promising leads for the development of GSDMD-targeting therapeutics.",

The slow response to membrane depolarization is a hallmark feature of this channel’s physiology, yet the mechanistic basis of how voltage promotes the open potassium conducting state is unknown. We focused on previously identified aromatic residues which might couple the pore and voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) by using a chemical tuning approach whereby aromatic residues are modified by serial fluorination. The data show that serial fluorination at one site (F232 on the S4 helix, within the VSD) resulted in a stepwise voltage-gating shift, where each added fluorine atom further biased channel opening to more negative voltages. Mutant-cycle analysis of proximal positively charged amino acids indicates that F232 likely forms a cation–π interaction with K285, a residue at the tip of the S5 segment in the pore domain. Using cryoelectron microscopy, a partial structure of the F232 penta-F-Phe K v 7.1 (KCNQ1) open channel was resolved to 6 Å. The data support a gating mechanism whereby the F232–K285 cation–π interaction represents an intermediate activated state that is broken prior to channel opening.",

The alternative archaeal system comprises Cdv proteins and is thought to bear some resemblance to ESCRT-III-based membrane remodeling in other domains of life, including eukaryotes, especially during abscission. Here, we present biochemical, crystallographic, and cryo-EM studies of the Sulfolobus Cdv machinery. CdvA, an early non-ESCRT component, adopts a PRC‐domain/coiled-coil fold and polymerizes into long double-stranded helical filaments, mainly via hydrophobic interfaces. Monomeric CdvB adopts the canonical ESCRT-III fold in both a closed and a distinct “semiopen” conformation. Soluble CdvB2 filaments are composed of subunits in the closed state, appearing to transition to the open, active state only when polymerized on membranes. Short N-terminal amphipathic helices in all CdvB paralogues, B, B1, and B2, mediate membrane binding and are required for liposome recruitment in vitro. We provide a molecular overview of archaeal ESCRT-III-based cytokinesis machinery, the definitive demonstration that CdvB proteins are bona fide ESCRT-III homologues, and reveal the molecular basis for membrane engagement. Thus, we illuminate conserved principles of ESCRT-mediated membrane remodeling and extend them to an anciently diverged archaeal lineage.",

Here, we demonstrate that large-scale ecological restoration is transforming this hyperarid environment into a carbon sink. By analyzing satellite and ground-based data, we find strong seasonal dynamics: During the wet season (Jul to Sep), precipitation increases to 16.3 mm/mo, enhancing vegetation coverage and photosynthetic activity and drawing down atmospheric CO 2 by approximately three parts per million (ppm) relative to the dry-season levels. Long-term trends reveal significant increases in vegetation cover (6.8 × 10 −4 /y) and photosynthetic activity (6.1 × 10 −3 W/m 2 /sr/µm/y), accompanied by a strengthening net CO 2 uptake (NEE trend: −5.2 × 10 −12 kg/m 2 /s/y). These changes are spatially concentrated along the desert margins and their timing aligns with implementation of China’s Three-North Shelterbelt Program. Our results provide the direct evidence that human-led intervention can effectively enhance carbon sequestration in even the most extreme arid landscapes, demonstrating the potential to transform a desert into a carbon sink and halt desertification. This underscores the critical role of dryland restoration in global carbon management strategies and highlights the Taklamakan Desert as a model for climate change mitigation through nature-based solutions and ecological engineering.",

          "abstract": "Brain vasculature is a multiscale network that actively regulates cerebral blood flow to maintain homeostasis. A systematic understanding of how this network enables robust and precise flow control has been hindered by the lack of understanding of flow in networks, as opposed to single vessels. To address this gap at the conceptual level, we theoretically studied nonperturbative, network-level flow responses to hydrodynamic conductance changes in individual vessels. We show vasodilation can either increase or decrease flow in the neighboring branches, yet selectively positioning the “controller” in the inflow branch of diverging nodes guarantees downstream increases in flow, regardless of surrounding network topology. Moreover, the effect of an individual vasodilation is small, so coordinated vasodilation is essential for effective regulation. To validate and refine our theoretical analysis, we developed a computational framework to analyze individual blood cell motion captured by confocal light field microscopy. This approach enabled tracking over one million cell detections across a network of more than 3,000 interconnected branches, with 2 µm spatial and 14 ms temporal resolution. Network-based analysis uncovered significant flow fluctuations, exhibiting long-range anticorrelation in spatially separated segments. The prevalence of diverging nodes within three branches of penetrating arterioles suggests that ensheathing pericytes are optimally positioned for fine-scale flow regulation. Finally, we quantified a phase separation of blood serum and cells at diverging nodes. This revealed a stochastic partition ratio with a nonlinear dependence on local hemodynamics. Collectively, our work highlights principles of organization for the control of blood flow among the seemingly random connectivity of brain microvessels.",

          "abstract": "Progressive lung fibrosis is linked to aging-related dysfunction in fibroblasts, which remains poorly understood. To investigate the alterations in fibroblasts, particularly the molecular programs driving this profibrotic evolution in the aging lung, we isolated senescent lung fibroblasts from aged mice. We observed aberrant vimentin aggregates, which correlate with accelerated fibroblast senescence. CRISPR-based screening identified calumenin as a chaperone protein essential for vimentin proteostasis. A fibroblast-specific knockout of calumenin promotes the accumulation of vimentin aggregates and profibrotic factors migracytosis, exacerbating fibroblast senescence and lung aging. Mechanistically, calumenin collaborates with the TRiC complex to facilitate proper vimentin folding and recruits the chaperonin subunit Chaperonin Containing TCP1 Subunit 2 (CCT2) to degrade misfolded vimentin aggregates. Pathologically, external profibrotic stimuli trigger calcium transients and induce calumenin degradation, resulting in fibroblast senescence and the initiation of fibrosis. The natural product 9-85, derived from high-content screening, specifically targets and disrupts vimentin aggregates upon stimulation, alleviating aging-related lung fibrosis. Our findings reveal that calumenin coordinates vimentin quality control to shape cell structure and suppress the secretome of senescent fibroblasts, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for aging-related organ fibrosis.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude f 0 and persistence time τ p in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles by simulating a model particle system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying f 0 , τ p , and the packing fraction ϕ . The morphology of the phase diagram accounts for a nonmonotonic evolution of the relaxation time with τ p , which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This analogy allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.",

From 2005 to 2022, the passive drivers (CO 2 , temperature, and precipitation) increased live tree carbon (C) by 66 teragrams (Tg) C y −1 with CO 2 fertilization contributing most of the change. Among the anthropogenic drivers, declining forest area reduced live tree C by 31 Tg C y −1 while tree planting increased it by 23 Tg C y −1 . Changes in age composition, driven by both passive traits and anthropogenic choices, increased live tree C by 89 Tg C y −1 .

Quantifying impactor mass and flux with the HSE can potentially be complicated by numerous secondary processes, however, including silicate–metal segregation and multiple impact heritage. In contrast, because oxygen has an invariant geochemical affinity, triple oxygen isotope compositions have the potential to offer a robust long-term record of impactor fluxes in complex mixtures such as regolith. Here, we use high-precision triple oxygen isotopes to deconvolve the influences of meteorite addition and silicate vaporization and identify a ubiquitous impactor contaminant comprised of partially evaporated CM or ureilite-like material representing at least 1 wt% of the lunar regolith. Water delivered to Earth by meteorite material over 4 billion years therefore is only a fraction of an ocean’s worth of water but is a significant contributor to the ice reservoir of the lunar cold traps.",

The equilibrium between the dormant and active states, the latter of which is responsible for producing mature oocytes, is therefore crucial for ensuring the sustained reproductive capability of females. We have previously reported that mechanical stress in the ovary plays a crucial role in oocyte dormancy. However, the mechanism underlying this relation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the mechanical stress is directly transduced into the oocytes, rather than to the surrounding granulosa cells. Culture experiments and live-imaging analysis revealed the nuclear localization of FOXO3, a hallmark of oocyte dormancy, within oocytes cultured alone in response to mechanical stress. Interestingly, we found that the cytological response to mechanical stress was accompanied by ligand-independent internalization of the c-kit receptor, which dampens intracellular signaling and prevents oocyte activation. These results shed light on the relation between mechanical stress and oocyte dormancy and provide clues toward a greater understanding of female reproductive capability.",

Although the cross talk between auxin and cytokinin in promoting both vascular cell proliferation and differentiation has been well studied in angiosperms such as Arabidopsis thaliana , little is known about this regulation in other vascular plant lineages. Here, we found that unlike the hormonal cross talk found in all other species under study, the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii shows clear task separation, with auxin driving vascular cell proliferation only and cytokinin specifically triggering cell differentiation. Using a cross-species transcriptomics approach, we found that members of the AUXIN / INDOLE-ACETIC ACID ( AUX / IAA ) and CYTOKININ OXIDASE ( CKX ) gene families exhibited divergent expression patterns in response to auxin and cytokinin treatments. Despite these regulatory differences, we show that AUX/IAA and CKX proteins are functionally conserved between Arabidopsis and Selaginella. Taken together, our findings suggest an evolutionary adaptation to the hormonal regulation of vascular tissue development in which core protein functions are conserved, but regulatory circuits diverged in lycophytes.",

          "abstract": "The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~56 Mya) interval was marked by massive 13 C-depleted carbon emissions into the ocean/atmosphere system, manifested as a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in sedimentary components, and ~5 °C global average warming. Episodes of hydrological perturbations and soil-erosion have been widely documented for the PETM but their link with vegetation- and carbon cycle changes remain poorly constrained. Here, we present organic microfossil evidence showing a strong increase in fern-dominated pioneer vegetation that replaced coniferous forests on the margin of the Norwegian Sea during the first millennia of the CIE. With the present stratigraphic constraints, the “fern spike” occurred simultaneously in terrestrial settings along the North Sea, Arctic Ocean, the US east coast and in southern Australia, indicating that pioneer vegetation persisted for several millennia following a partial collapse of previously stable terrestrial ecosystems. Both the ferns and influx of microcharcoal imply recurrent physical disturbance, including soil destabilization and erosion, potentially linked to droughts, wildfires, and strong hydrological forcing resulting from extreme climate change. Together with evidence for reworked clay minerals and ancient organic matter (kerogen), these findings show that highly disturbed terrestrial ecosystems were widespread across mid- and high-latitude regions globally. Carbon cycle model simulations suggest that a substantial loss of standing and buried biomass, along with oxidation of soil organic matter, acted as important positive feedbacks during the onset of the CIE. Additionally, enhanced kerogen weathering likely contributed as another major positive feedback throughout both the onset and main phase of the CIE.",

Traditional approaches relying on oxygen-utilizing genes need improvement for obligate anaerobes and fragmentary environmental genomes, where gene absence may reflect poor assembly rather than phenotype. We developed a machine learning model (GBDT40-LR) to predict microbial oxygen requirements using 40 broadly conserved genes, 35 without direct oxygen roles. This approach overcomes incompleteness biases in environmental genomes. Applied to 80,787 bacterial genomes [including metagenome-derived assemblies (MAGs)], the model classified 42,014 aerobes and 38,775 anaerobes, enabling large-scale ancestral reconstruction. Molecular clock dating indicates an emergence of aerobic bacterium prior to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE, 2.5 to 2.3 Ga), likely around ~2.7 Ga. Aerobic lineages subsequently diversified during the GOE and Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE, 0.8 to 0.55 Ga), with persistent anaerobe diversity across Earth’s oxygenation. This establishes that aerobic bacteria originated planetary oxygenation, potentially by 200 to 400 My, providing insights into phenotypic evolution and prolonged anaerobe–aerobe coexistence.",

Yet, the empirical evidence for the dynamic involvement of MSP and TSP in learning remains unresolved. We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging to estimate the endpoints of MSP- and TSP-related white matter structures (i.e., footprints) within hippocampal subfields and the entorhinal cortex. We then measured the activation of pathway-specific footprints with functional MRI while participants learned novel concepts defined by regularities and exceptions. The functional footprint method revealed links between MSP-related footprint activation and regularity encoding early in learning and TSP-related footprint activation and exception encoding late in learning. These findings provide empirical evidence that learning concept regularities and exceptions is preferentially supported by hippocampal pathways. The pathway footprint approach provides insights into the functional dynamics of the human hippocampus, translating theoretical and computational work into empirically testable questions in humans.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial lipoproteins are key structural components of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria and vital components of machineries required for its biosynthesis and maintenance. The Lol system, essential for viability, directs transport of lipoproteins from the site of biosynthesis on the inner membrane to the outer membrane and has been the target of extensive efforts to develop novel antimicrobial drugs. In the first stage of this transport process, newly synthesized lipoproteins are released from the inner membrane by the ABC transporter LolCDE and passed to the periplasmic chaperone, LolA. Here, we show cryo-EM structures of LolCDE in complex with three different lipoprotein substrates, Lpp, Pal, and LolB, with the latter two bearing a disordered peptide linker between the acyl chains and the globular domain. Our work reveals that when the mature lipoprotein lacks an unstructured linker, the N-terminal portion of the protein is in an unfolded state for transport. The lipoproteins make a sequence-independent but structurally conserved interaction with a cleft on the surface of the periplasmic domain of LolE that promotes efficient transport. We propose a model of lipoprotein export where this interaction acts as pivot point for the peptide portion of the lipoprotein allowing the acyl chains to rotate 180° from their initial position in LolCDE to their binding site in LolA. Our results demonstrate how LolCDE can extrude lipoproteins of diverse sequence and structure and reveal an important detail of a transport process fundamental to bacterial physiology.",

This caused aberrant accumulation of dNTPs, which can be transported into mitochondria, and initiated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) neosynthesis, which increased the presence of oxidized mtDNA and triggered NLRP3 hyperactivation. Deletion of SAMHD1 promoted NLRP3 hyperactivation in cells isolated from zebrafish, mice, and humans. SAMHD1-deficient mice showed elevated circulating IL-1β, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis. Blocking dNTP mitochondrial transport prevented NLRP3 hyperactivation in macrophages from obese patients and SAMHD1-deficient mice.

          "abstract": "Understanding the factors that have influenced the intensity and selectivity of extinction throughout Earth’s history is important for explaining past biodiversity change and forecasting biotic responses to environmental change. Here, we investigated the role of coastline geometry and paleogeographic boundary conditions in shaping extinction risk for shallow-marine taxa over the past 540 million years. We show that interactions between the geographic distributions of taxa and the geometric configurations of continental margins consistently predict relative extinction risk: Taxa with potential dispersal pathways that are long relative to the range of latitude traversed—such as those that occur along east-west–oriented coastlines, islands, or inland seaways—consistently exhibit higher extinction risk than taxa with potential dispersal pathways that provide more direct latitude-traversing paths. This dispersal distance selectivity is amplified during mass extinction events and hyperthermal intervals, suggesting that geographic constraints become more important during periods of rapid climate change. Our results provide another mechanism that potentially contributes to the generally elevated extinction rates during the Paleozoic, an interval characterized by complex inland seas and a preponderance of east-west coastlines. These insights underscore the importance of considering paleogeographic context when interpreting past extinction patterns and provide empirical support for assumptions that underlie extinction risk assessments of extant species.",

As stress changes associated with ice flow over bedrock obstacles produce ice surface topography, recently acquired, high-resolution satellite maps of the ice surface offer a transformative basis for mapping subglacial landforms. We present a continental-scale elevation map of Antarctica’s subglacial topography produced by applying the physics of ice flow to ice surface maps and incorporating geophysical ice thickness observations. Our results enrich understanding of mesoscale (2 to 30 kilometers) subglacial landforms and unmask the spatial distribution of subglacial roughness and geomorphology.",

          "abstract": "Efficient heat dissipation is fundamentally limited by intrinsic scattering mechanisms that cap the thermal conductivity of metallic materials such as copper to ~ 400 Watts per meter Kelvin. Here we report the experimental realization of single-crystalline θ-phase tantalum nitride (θ-TaN), a metastable transition metal nitride predicted to overcome this limitation. We measure a room-temperature thermal conductivity of ~1100 Watts per meter Kelvin, nearly three times that of copper. Synchrotron-based inelastic x-ray scattering reveals a distinctive phonon band structure with a large acoustic–optical gap and phonon bunching, which suppress phonon–phonon scattering. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy confirms exceptionally weak electron–phonon coupling and validates first-principles calculations. These findings redefine the thermal transport limits of metallic materials and open new opportunities for advancing thermal management in electronics and power systems.",

These limitations are most pronounced in colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs), given their soft ionic lattices and labile surfaces. We introduce a hierarchical shell (HS) structure comprising interbonded PbSO 4 -SiO 2 -polymer multilayers that simultaneously locks and stabilizes soft lattices and labile interfaces. HS-CsPbBr 3 PeNC films exhibit T 90 (10% PLQY loss) = 3211 hours under accelerated 60°C, 90% relative humidity (RH) and T 90 = 12,000 hours under blue-light exposure. HS strategy generalizes across PeNC compositions—including mixed-halide, mixed-cation, iodide, and hybrid PeNCs—and enables MAPbBr 3 with extended T 90 = 3900 hours (60°C, 90% RH) and T 90 = 27,234 hours (blue light). Moreover, HS-MAPbBr 3 films with 100.0% PLQY eliminate self-absorption losses and achieve an EQY of 91.4%, approaching the theoretical maximum. The HS barrier also prevents lead leakage for safety of large-area, high-resolution displays and bio-optoelectronics.",

At the center stage are bioderived furans, from which valuable platform chemicals can be obtained exclusively through oxidative or reductive processes. By contrast, the conceptually straightforward redox-neutral hydrolysis of furan to succinaldehyde and 2-substituted furans to 1,4-ketoaldehydes has been considered unfeasible owing to their endergonicity and polymerization side reactivity. In this work, we report the realization of this uphill furan hydrolysis through photocatalysis involving a highly strained, 10-membered 1,6-dioxecine intermediate. Succinaldehyde, as well as 1,4-ketoaldehydes, can be directly obtained from furans. Additionally, furfural derivatives undergo redox-enhanced Piancatelli rearrangements, accessing antimicrobial natural products (±)-Terrein and (±)- epi -Pentenomycins. The methodology was applied to the redox-neutral production of common industrial fine chemicals, avoiding wasteful redox detours typical in biomass-based synthesis.",

Field investigations showed that fish populations of lake skygazer ( Culter dabryi ) with chronic low-dose chlorpyrifos loads had shortened telomeres and truncated age structures. Laboratory experiments confirmed that chronic low-dose chlorpyrifos exposure induced telomere degradation and reduced survival in a dose- and physiological age–dependent manner, whereas acute high-dose exposure did not. Together, these studies provide evidence that chronic low-level chlorpyrifos exposure reduces life span and population viability in a wild fish by accelerating physiological aging. Given the pervasive presence of low pesticide concentrations in the environment and the conserved mechanisms of aging across vertebrates, these findings raise concerns that even low doses of pesticides may pose long-term risks to longevity.",

Conversations about the high seas were historically driven by commercial interests, including shipping, industrialized fishing, and increasingly mining and prospecting.

Analysis of tissues from HCM hearts revealed genotype-specific differences in cardiomyocyte volume, morphology, and extracellular volume, with pathogenic variants exhibiting greater concentric cellular hypertrophy and disarray and variant-negative cases showing predominant fibrosis. Longitudinal profiling of a pig HCM model revealed early-onset fibrosis preceding cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

However, the plate configuration at the complex Mendocino triple junction, where the San Andreas Fault and the Cascadia subduction zone meet, remains uncertain. We analyzed fault slip associated with a recently identified zone of tectonic tremor and low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) near the southern edge of the subducting Gorda slab. Based on tidal sensitivity and P-wave first motions, we show that the LFEs are generated by dipping, strike-slip motion. This suggests that a former Farallon slab fragment, now captured by the Pacific plate, is translating northward beneath westernmost North America. This geometry effectively extends the slab interface fault, challenging prevailing interpretations of slab window formation and creating a potential unaccounted earthquake hazard in this region.",

We demonstrate dissipationless transport, even in the presence of interactions and finite temperature, signifying ballistic propagation of conserved quantities corresponding to lowest-order hydrodynamics.

The ceratobranchial histology of the N. lancensis holotype indicates that it was nearing or had reached skeletal maturity, suggesting that it is taxonomically distinct from the coeval Tyrannosaurus rex and that Hell Creek (and equivalent) ecosystems supported a diverse assemblage of predatory dinosaurs approaching the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.",

We found that MR1 expression varied across tissues and cell types. Macrophages from the lung and peritoneal cavity expressed the highest levels of MR1 and were the most efficient at capturing and presenting VitBAg to MAIT cells. Expression of MR1 in macrophages was regulated transcriptionally and induced by the tissue environment and microbiota. Depletion of MR1 in macrophages, dendritic cells, and monocytes changed the composition of the microbiota and impaired MAIT cell responses against bacterial infection.

Mitigation efforts have emphasized “decoupling” that sustains production while lowering emissions per unit of output. However, the underlying decoupling mechanisms have not been fully characterized. We rely on a mathematical identity to decompose agricultural GHG emission growth ( Δ E ) into three parts: output ( Δ Y ), emissions per unit of input ( Δ E / X ), and output per unit of input ( Δ Y / X ) or total factor productivity (TFP). We then rely on official country-level data to quantify the historical contribution of these components. Over 1961 to 2021, we find that TFP growth—which captures the sector’s ability to produce more output per unit of measured input—has consistently remained one of the main sources of GHG emission reduction within farms. Further decomposition reveals a key role for rising land productivity in reducing emission intensity.",

It used MEA-electroporation (MEA-EP) for minimally invasive collection of intracellular signals transiently (~1 minute), as well as noninvasive recording of extracellular signals in long term. The recorded extracellular APs were converted into corresponding intracellular APs by a convolutional neural network–long short-term memory–based AI model enhanced by model self-calibration. The intracellular APs detected by the AI-MEA-EP exhibited high consistency with those physically obtained through MEA-EP. It was demonstrated to monitor cardiac intracellular AP under drug treatments and glucose challenging during &gt;5 consecutive days.

Here, we report modulation of the structure, photoluminescence, and lasing properties of PNCs in glass at temperatures well below the glass transition temperature with a short processing period. We generate tunable PNCs in glass via nanophase separation and ion exchange in the perovskite domains. PNCs-in-glass hierarchical structures are created by controlling nanophase separation and crystallization of PNCs. Substantially increased scattering in the hierarchical structures enables stable CW single-mode random lasing with an ultralow threshold of 52.6 milliwatts per square centimeter. We achieve flexible CW random lasers by incorporating hierarchical structures into the polydimethylsiloxane film.

However, in glycolysis-low malignancies such as prostate cancer, stroma-derived lactate may drive noncanonical signaling and functions that remain unclear. Here, we identified APCDD1 + cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a distinct stromal population that secretes lactate into the TME in response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Lactate uptake by prostate cancer cells induces androgen receptor variant 7 expression, thereby conferring resistance to ADT. Mechanistically, lactate-induced lactylation of the spliceosome component SNRPA at Lys 123 (K123) enhances its recognition of cis-acting elements, increases chromatin binding, and promotes androgen receptor splicing. Targeting lactate transport with monocarboxylate transporter inhibitors effectively restores ADT sensitivity. These findings reveal a metabolic-epigenetic axis linking lactate in the microenvironment to alternative splicing regulation and suggest a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome ADT resistance.",

Here, we investigate the spectral, temporal, and directional characteristics of room-temperature X D emission from a tungsten diselenide monolayer coupled to a dissipative plasmonic nanocavity. Under resonant plasmon-exciton coupling, the radiative decay rate of X D is accelerated by nearly four orders of magnitude, and correspondingly, the X D lifetime is shortened to a subnanosecond level, making it comparable to that of bright excitons. Fitting the measured lifetimes with a Purcell-formalism–based cavity quantum electrodynamics model allows estimating of the intrinsic room-temperature X D lifetime to be about 24 ± 2.3 microseconds. Furthermore, the measured radiation patterns of the dark excitons show that subtle variations in the nanocavity orientation can effectively tailor the X D emission directionality, important for quantum technologies and optoelectronics applications.",

Using transcriptomic data from human brain tissues, we performed splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) analyses of schizophrenia-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms and identified more than 17,000 sQTLs linked to previously unidentified splicing junctions. Functional prioritization and experimental validation highlighted the synonymous variant rs3935873 within the 16p11.2 GWAS locus strongly associated with an unannotated isoform DOC2A ∆ Val217-Pro218 . rs3935873 was significantly associated with hippocampal volume, and hippocampal overexpression of DOC2A ∆Val217-Pro218 in mice recapitulated schizophrenia-relevant behavioral deficits, phenotypes absent in DOC2A Full-Length -overexpressing mice. Overexpression of both isoforms altered excitatory synaptic transmission, structural modeling revealed divergent tertiary configurations between DOC2A ∆Val217-Pro218 and DOC2A Full-Length , and interactome profiling highlighted that DOC2A ∆Val217-Pro218 unique interactors are enriched in the myosin II complex and ankyrin binding, suggesting the acquisition of previously unknown structural and regulatory functions by DOC2A ∆Val217-Pro218 . Our study implicates dysregulated splicing in DOC2A as a functional mechanism for schizophrenia genetic risk and demonstrates how unannotated isoforms can reveal disease-relevant pathways.",

          "abstract": "Crotonate, a short-chain fatty acid, generates protein crotonylation. However, the role of crotonate in cancer progression is unknown. Here, we present a crotonate–crotonyl–coenzyme A (CoA)–enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) crotonylation cascade blocking breast cancer growth and metastasis. We demonstrated that crotonate promotes EZH2 degradation via crotonyl-CoA–mediated crotonylation at Lys 348 in EZH2 (EZH2-K348cr). EZH2-K348cr leads to reduced genome-wide H3K27me3 (trimethylation of lysine-27 on histone-3) occupancy. Crotonate metabolizes to crotonyl-CoA by ACSS2 (acyl-CoA synthetase 2), and then, acyltransferase p300 catalyzes crotonyl-CoA and generates EZH2-K348cr. Crotonylated EZH2 triggers EZH2 ubiquitination and degradation. Administration of crotonate markedly inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis via a crotonate-crotonyl-CoA-EZH2-K348cr cascade. In comparison, crotonate showed better blocking effect than EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in suppressing breast cancer metastasis. The combination of crotonate and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) antibody enhances responses of breast cancer cells to immunotherapy. Together, our findings indicate that crotonate is a promising anticancer drug candidate that suppresses breast cancer growth and metastasis by specifically inducing EZH2 degradation.",

Using just one to two slides, it enables both regional detection of biomarkers for diagnostic subtyping (≤16) and construction of multiplex tumor microenvironment (TME) maps. Joint analysis of multiregion diagnostic biomarkers in the TME map indicates that tumor cell subpopulations defined by specific diagnostic biomarkers can actively shape their in situ microenvironmental niche.

We explored this question in the frame of X-chromosome inactivation, a process under strong selective constraint, governed by the XIST lncRNA and its cis-regulators. Using functional approaches on closely related primate species, we show that XIST regulation has uniquely diverged over a short evolutionary timescale. In human and marmoset embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the JPX lncRNA gene is a major regulator of XIST expression. In contrast, JPX has a minor effect on XIST in macaque ESCs, where it acts together with a macaque-specific enhancer. This occurs within a reshuffled 3D organization of the XIST neighborhood triggered by the insertion of a HERVK transposon in the macaque lineage. Retrospective sequence comparisons revealed that many XIST regulators are not evolutionarily constrained, supporting the hypothesis that neutrally evolving noncoding elements harbor adaptive potential. These results illuminate how evolutionary recent elements are integrated into preexisting regulatory landscapes.",

Here, we design a Li-rich, hollow ionic-electronic conductor (HIEC) interlayer, which integrates metallic Li encapsulation and interfacial protection, thus guiding highly reversible thick Li deposition (5 milliampere-hours per square centimeter). In addition, the built-in electron-deficient domains in the HIEC facilitate the formation of the hierarchical SEI and further mitigate active Li corrosion. These synergistic effects of the interlayer enable stable cycling in batteries under both anode-less and anode-free configurations, attaining &gt;99% coulombic efficiency under industrial-level cathode loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This study highlights the significance of interlayers in integrating the SEI and host functions and provides a viable and scalable solution for energy-dense batteries.",

An X-Crossing actuator design of 4.5 grams can be passively stretched to 160% and contracts by 50% when heated, lifting 1 kg, outperforming knitted and knotted SMAs. We developed a variable-stiffness mechanics model to predict material-level stress-strain behavior across temperatures and thus the force-contraction relation of device level. This model informs actuator design and control, geometric scaling, peak points in the force-contraction relation, and the theoretical upper bound of contraction strain. The maximum measured contraction strain of our actuators is 55%, a large step toward the upper bound that we calculate for general SMA fabric actuators.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) offer promise for antifibrotic therapy via paracrine signaling, but their clinical efficacy is hindered by poor survival and limited functional activity after transplantation. Here, we present a cell surface engineering strategy that reprograms the antifibrotic function of MSCs by constructing a pseudofibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) on their surface. Through in situ self-assembly of peptide-modified hyaluronic acid, we generate a nanofiber-based matrix that mimics the dense, disordered architecture of fibrotic ECM. This matrix activates the Piezo1/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, inducing up-regulation of Mmp13—a key collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinase—in engineered MSCs. In a rat model of myocardial infarction–associated fibrosis, engineered MSCs exhibit robust antifibrotic activity compared to unmodified MSCs.

In situ biosensors offer a promising solution for real-time biomarker detection, yet their practical deployment in oral tissue is hindered by challenges in sensitivity, specificity, and stability due to low biomarker concentrations, molecular-level heterogeneity, and dynamic intraoral interactions. Here, we develop a tissue-adhesive hydrogel–MXene (TAHM) biosensor, integrating a graphene/MXene sensing probe, a tissue-adhesive patch, and a selective-permeable hydrogel membrane, for in situ detection of tumor necrosis factor–α, a proinflammatory cytokine. Our TAHM biosensor achieves high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 18.2 femtograms per milliliter, excellent selectivity with an interference coefficient below 7%, and mechanical stability with resistance variation under 0.5% under varying stretch ratio and loading rates. The sensor’s performance is further validated through in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo experiments. The work highlights the potential of in situ biosensor as a transformative tool for real-time oral diagnostics.",

Here, we have investigated the interplay between cooperativity, dimerization, and substrate cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 M pro through a combination of enzymatic assays, crystal structures, and protein characterization. To disentangle the contribution of each active site to the observed enzymatic activity, we developed a cleavage assay involving heterodimers of active and inactive (catalytic residue mutated or inhibitor-bound) monomers. Notably, we found that heterodimerization increased cleavage efficiency per active monomer. In addition, we mapped a network of critical residues bridging the two active sites and probed this network through engineered mutations. By dissecting the cooperativity and communication between the active sites, we provide insights into the M pro reaction cycle and functional significance of its dimeric architecture.",

Existing universal quantum algorithms typically rely on ideal and efficient query models (e.g., time evolution operator or block encoding of the Hamiltonian), which, however, become suboptimal for actual implementation at the quantum circuit level. Here, we present a full-stack design of quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenenergy and eigenstate properties, which can achieve high precision and good scaling with system size. The gate complexity per circuit for estimating generic Hamiltonians’ eigenstate properties is O ˜ ( log ε − 1 ) , which has a logarithmic dependence on the inverse precision ε. For lattice Hamiltonians, the circuit depth of our design achieves near-optimal system-size scaling, even with local qubit connectivity. Our full-stack algorithm has low overhead in circuit compilation, which thus results in a small actual gate count ( cnot and non-Clifford gates) for lattice and molecular problems compared to advanced eigenstate algorithms. The algorithm is implemented on IBM quantum devices using up to 2000 two-qubit gates and 20,000 single-qubit gates and achieves high-precision eigenenergy estimation for Heisenberg-type Hamiltonians, demonstrating its noise robustness.",

The biosensors (termed FLIPs) offer an extremely simple design, high sensitivity, multiplexing capability, ratiometric readout, and other advantages, without requiring modifications to their targets. We demonstrate the sensor performance by real-time imaging activity of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), G proteins, arrestins, and other membrane-associated proteins, as well as by identifying a previously undescribed, pronounced, endocytosis-associated conformational change in a GPCR–β-arrestin complex.

Across 578,000 kilometers of river length, 18% of the total length experienced a significant increase in C POC , which exceeds the 11% that exhibited declines, resulting in a net rise. Most increases occurred after 2005, contributing to a 12.6% (0.49 teragrams per year) increase in total F POC to the Arctic Ocean between 1985 to 2005 and 2006 to 2022. Regional contrasts highlight distinct possible drivers: increased precipitation in the North American Arctic and atmospheric warming in the Eurasian Arctic. Deepening of the permafrost active layer is also significantly correlated with C POC increases.

Traditionally, GABAergic input was considered as the gatekeeper; thus, receptors closest to the soma were ideally placed to veto excitation. However, recently modeling has advanced several counterintuitive hypotheses. Since laser uncaging can be directed at will to any position, we used photostimulation to show that inhibition near the sealed end of dendrites distal to excitation is more effective than inhibition near the soma in modulating excitation. Further, dendritic inhibition was found to be branch specific. Last, we demonstrate that inhibitory input from multiple thin basal dendrites can centripetally elevate to effectively tune distant excitation at the soma. These findings provide direct experimental evidence supporting theoretical predictions based on dendritic cable properties, revealing the critical role of dendritic geometry in shaping the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission.",

The denuder efficiently removed alkanes and weakly functionalized acids, aldehydes, and alcohols with fewer than 10 carbon atoms from the gas phase. Denuding organic compounds perturbed the CCN-derived hygroscopicity parameter by up to 50%. Denuding either rendered the particles more or less CCN active, and the direction of the effect depended on sample relative humidity and trace gas concentration. The effect was weakest in early spring and strongest in late spring and summer.

Serum was collected at 6 weeks postimmunization for single-particle cryo–electron microscopy of GluN1/GluN2A receptors complexed with purified polyclonal anti-NMDAR autoantibody fragments.

However, the regulatory role of PsAF5 in maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of the intracellular redox state has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we identify that specific cysteine residues in the FYVE domain of PsAF5 sense cellular redox states to form and resolve disulfide bonds in a redox-dependent manner. Under reducing conditions, PsAF5 undergoes redox-dependent phase separation to form cytoplasmic condensates that are functionally decoupled from mitophagy execution. Under oxidative conditions, PsAF5 exhibits increased cytosolic solubility and enhanced interaction with PsATG8, thereby promoting mitophagy. This mechanism enables P. sojae to toggle between “detoxification” (oxidizing stress) and “metabolic resilience” (reducing stress) states, ensuring survival across hostile host niches.",

PiggyBac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5) is an evolutionarily conserved vertebrate DNA transposase–derived gene with DNA remodeling activities in human cells. Here, we show that PGBD5 contributes to normal brain development in mice and humans, and its deficiency causes disorder of intellectual disability, movement disorders, and epilepsy. In mice, Pgbd5 is required for the developmental induction of postmitotic DNA breaks and recurrent somatic brain genome rearrangements. In the cerebral cortex, loss of Pgbd5 leads to aberrant neuronal gene expression, including of specific types of glutamatergic neurons, which partly explains the features of PGBD5 deficiency in humans.

          "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) and phospholipids (PLs) are key components of joint lubrication. In osteoarthritis (OA), the molecular weight (MW) of HA is reduced, which has been proposed to weaken the anchoring capacity of PL and impair lubrication. This study reveals a different mechanism by directly linking the MW to the structure of HA-PL (hybrid) assemblies and frictional properties. Using mixed-MW HA and PL to model this difference between healthy and OA synovial composition, we found interfacial lamellar structures form under healthy-like conditions, while hybrid vesicles predominate in OA-like conditions. At physiologically relevant shear rates, lamellar assemblies maintain ultralow friction, whereas vesicles are removed, causing a tenfold friction increase. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how HA-PL structural organization controls lubrication. While this simplified system does not capture the biochemical complexity of synovial fluid, this study advances understanding and offers a framework for designing structure-informed therapeutic strategies and biomimetic lubricants.",

Leveraging contact-free thermal penetration and natural piezo-thermic transduction of human skin, the sensor implements spatiotemporal mapping of vascular dynamics with high sensitivity, good-linearity, fast-response, low cross-talk, and excellent interfacial robustness. It enables real-time and in situ measurements of multimodal vascular characteristics including deep arterial pulsation, superficial capillary perfusion, relative blood flow velocity, skin temperature, and continuous blood pressure via data-efficient vascular feature extraction method.

Here, we performed a comprehensive super-resolution mapping of dendritic spines in layer 5 extratelencepharic-projecting (L5 ET) neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex in mice. In adults, the dendritic spines are highly enriched in the middle compartment of the apical dendrites (spine density “hotspot”), where dendritic calcium spikes are generated. In early development, dendritic spines are evenly distributed. During adolescence, however, the spine density increases specifically in the middle compartment of the apical dendrites in an experience-dependent manner, while other dendritic compartments show a slight reduction. Furthermore, spine accumulation at the hotspot was specifically impaired in mouse models of schizophrenia, demonstrating a link between adolescent spine formation and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our finding suggests that the dendritic compartment-specific spine formation during adolescence shapes nonlinear dendritic integration in L5 ET neurons and supports the maturation of cognitive functions.",

Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the full-length structure of the VACV EFC at near-atomic resolution, revealing a 15-protein asymmetric assembly organized into three layers. The central A16/G9/J5 heterotrimer forms the fusion core, stabilized by conserved PXXCW and Delta motifs, and anchors two A28/H2 adaptor dimers linked to peripheral G3/L5/A21/O3 scaffolds. Structural and evolutionary analyses identify a conserved N-terminal domain in A16 containing a myristoyl-binding pocket and a phenylalanine-rich region that stabilizes the trimer and may regulate lipid engagement. An additional component, F9, binds peripherally to J5, A21, and H2 through Delta-like motifs, reinforcing the prefusion architecture. Together, these results define the VACV EFC as a unique multiprotein fusion machinery and provide a structural framework for understanding the mechanism of poxvirus entry and membrane fusion.",

However, the mechanisms driving the performance decline of TFC membranes at high temperatures remain poorly understood. Herein, we combine controlled experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and micromechanical modeling to elucidate TFC failure mechanisms and to evaluate thermally resilient thin-film cross-linked (TFX) composite membrane. Upon exposure to elevated temperatures (&gt;60°C), salt rejection of TFC dropped from ~99 to &lt;90%, with irreversible structural damage in the polysulfone layer, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. In contrast, the TFX membrane maintained ~99% salt rejection and showed no signs of physical degradation up to 80°C. Our combined analyses revealed that TFC membrane failure arises from irreversible pore expansion in the thermoplastic polysulfone support, leading to polyamide film rupture and delamination. TFX membranes resist thermal deformation, enabling ultrahigh-temperature RO desalination and water reuse.",

Using chromosome-scale genomes from newly sequenced spiders and the whip scorpion, we integrate evidence from macrosynteny and phylogenetic analyses to provide further strong support for a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event that occurred during early Arachnopulmonata evolution. Following this event, the abdominal-A gene pair not only exhibits functional divergence but also jointly facilitates the emergence of spinnerets. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell transcriptomic analyses and functional validation to confirm that the dachshund-1 gene also regulates spinneret development. The network of duplicated gene pairs may form a cornerstone in the origin and evolution of key morphological traits, revealing that the long-term effects of ancient WGDs on innovation and diversification also occurred in arthropods.",

Introducing disulfide bonds maintains the ordered urea-based H-bond assembly in bulk polymers while simultaneously suppressing secondary crystallization of these H-bonded arrays and offering secondary H-bonding sites by forming S─S·H─N interactions. This two-atom structural change revitalizes semicrystalline homopoly(urea) materials by allowing chain mobility and reconfiguration below melting temperatures to enable thermoplastic-like (re)processability and thermoset-like robustness, including more than 2-gigapascal storage modulus, a broad creep-resistant temperature range (up to 150°C), ceramic-like hardness, and resistance to common solvents.

The Qiang genetic structure has been profoundly shaped by historical admixture with Han and Tibetans, giving rise to distinct subpopulations. Using ~450 ancient Asian genomes, we traced the most recent common ancestor of the Qiang to ancient Yellow River farmers ~5300 years ago, indicating shared ancestry with other Chinese populations. We identified several highly differentiated variants related to ethanol metabolism and pigmentation between Qiang subpopulations, which likely arose from joint effects of admixture and selection. Notably, a highly prevalent missense variant in a blood pressure regulation gene was detected, suggesting a potential role in altitude adaptation. Collectively, our findings illuminate the genetic history of the Qiang and highlight how admixture and selection shaped the diversity of Tibetan-Plateau fringe populations.",

To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate–photon flux, high-sensitivity, quantum noise–squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5-decibel improvement beyond the shot noise limit in distinguishing l - and d -amino acids in liquid phase.

As a critical step, the rearrangement of short-range ordered aluminosilicate networks enriched with five-membered rings, coupled with geometric matching to the cylindrical micelles of the bolaform organic structure-directing agent, synergistically drives the development and closure of curvature-induced interfaces, ultimately leading to the formation of single-walled zeolitic nanotubes.

Activation is achieved through the interaction of ToxR or TcpP with the α–C-terminal repeat domain of RNAP where a single residue of the activator, a phenylalanine, appears to be the most critical contact, as confirmed by mutagenesis. No interactions of the transcription factors were observed with other subunits of the RNAP, i.e., the σ subunit as it occurs in the structurally related PhoB family of two-component transcription factors.

This study reveals a post-2000 intensification of winter ENSO’s impact on subsequent autumn LESS ice, driven by accelerated ENSO phase transitions compared to the pre-2000 era. Rapid phase transitions of El Niño after 2000 generate persistent cold anomalies in the tropical central–eastern Pacific during the subsequent autumn, strengthening and displacing the Western North Pacific anticyclone (WNPAC) northward. This WNPAC triggers Rossby waves establishing an Arctic anticyclone, warming, and moistening the LESS atmosphere, thereby driving substantial ice loss. In contrast, pre-2000 slower El Niño decay exhibited weaker tropical-Arctic connectivity.

We synthesized 1094 paired observations of CUE ST and heterotrophic respiration rate ( R h ) across natural ecosystems and found a nonlinear relationship between them governed by ecosystem productivity. In low-productivity arid and cold regions, CUE ST declined with increasing R h , whereas in productive tropical and temperate regions, CUE ST stabilized at a low level (0.27 ± 0.11) as R h exceeded 340 ± 10.8 grams of C per square meter per year.

In contrast, natural bone’s load-bearing capability arises from the synergy between citrate, soft collagen, and ultrathin hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (~3 nanometers). Here, we show that elastic poly(octamethylene citrate) enables up to 60 wt % hydroxyapatite incorporation, mimicking the bone’s mineral content. Through a top-down “citrification” process and hot pressing, hydroxyapatite microparticles are partially dissolved and recrystallized into superthin (~5 nanometers) nanorods, enhancing organic-inorganic integration and replicating bone’s Ca/P ratios and architecture.
