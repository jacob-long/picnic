          "authors": "Olga Buzovetsky, Sebastian Klinge",
          "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosomal small subunit (SSU) assembly requires the SSU processome, a nucleolar precursor containing the RNA chaperone U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). The underlying molecular mechanisms of SSU processome maturation, remodelling, disassembly and RNA quality control, and the transitions between states remain unknown owing to a paucity of intermediates1,2,3. Here we report 16 native SSU processome structures alongside genetic data, revealing how two helicases, the Mtr4-exosome and Dhr1, are controlled for accurate and unidirectional ribosome biogenesis. Our data show how irreversible pre-ribosomal RNA degradation by the redundantly tethered RNA exosome couples the transformation of the SSU processome into a pre-40S particle, during which Utp14 can probe evolving surfaces, ultimately positioning and activating Dhr1 to unwind the U3 snoRNA and initiate nucleolar pre-40S release. This study highlights a paradigm for large dynamic RNA–protein complexes in which irreversible RNA degradation drives compositional changes and communicates these changes to govern enzyme activity while maintaining overall quality control.",

          "abstract": "Infection by yellow fever virus (YFV), the prototype Orthoflavivirus, induces a febrile syndrome in humans that can progress to liver failure, haemorrhage and death1. Despite decades of study, the entry receptors for YFV remain unclear. Here, using a surface protein-targeted CRISPR–Cas9 screen, we identified LRP4, a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family member, as a candidate entry receptor for YFV. Genetic ablation of LRP4 impaired YFV infection of cells and, reciprocally, complementation or ectopic expression of LRP4 increased infection. Related viruses in the YFV antigenic complex also showed LRP4-dependent infection. LRP4 promoted YFV entry into cells through LDLR type A (LA) domain binding to domain III of the YFV envelope protein. Soluble LRP4–Fc decoy receptors neutralized YFV infection in cell culture and reduced viral burden in vivo. As we observed residual YFV infection in LRP4-deficient cells, we evaluated whether other LDLR family members promote YFV entry. This approach identified LRP1 and VLDLR as additional receptors for YFV infection in cell culture. LRP1–Fc, LRP4–Fc and VLDLR–Fc decoys protected mice from YFV challenge, and LRP1–Fc decoys inhibited YFV infection and liver pathogenesis in mice engrafted with human hepatocytes. A genetic deficiency of LRP1 in primary human hepatocyte cultures also resulted in reduced YFV infection. Our findings establish a role for multiple LDLR family members in YFV entry, infection and pathogenesis, which has implications for receptor use and countermeasure development for multiple emerging orthoflaviviruses.",

          "abstract": "The generation and maintenance of immunity is a dynamic process that is dependent on age1,2,3. Here, to better understand its progression, we profiled peripheral immunity in more than 300 healthy adults (25 to 90 years of age) using single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics and flow cytometry, following 96 adults longitudinally across 2 years with seasonal influenza vaccination. The resulting resource generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of more than 16 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 71 immune cell subsets from our Human Immune Health Atlas and enabled us to interrogate how immune cell composition and states shift with age, chronic viral infection and vaccination. From these data, we demonstrate robust, non-linear transcriptional reprogramming in T cell subsets with age that is not driven by systemic inflammation or chronic cytomegalovirus infection. This age-related reprogramming led to a functional T helper 2 (TH2) cell bias in memory T cells that is linked to dysregulated B cell responses against highly boosted antigens in influenza vaccines. Collectively, this study reveals unique features of the immune ageing process that occur prior to advanced age and provides novel targets for age-related immune modulation.

          "abstract": "Potato late blight, which is caused by Phytophthora infestans and was responsible for the Irish potato famine, remains a major threat to global food security1. Most late-blight resistance (R) genes encode nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), but many have been overcome by the rapid evolution of P. infestans2. Deploying R genes through hybrid potato breeding3,4,5,6,7 offers a promising solution to manage late blight. Here we construct a section-wide NLRome comprising 39,211 NLR genes from 31 wild and 21 cultivated potato genomes, representing Solanum section Petota, the tuber-bearing clade. This includes newly sequenced genomes of seven wild species with strong resistance to late blight. Phylogenomic analyses reveal asymmetric patterns of evolution that distinguish sensor and helper NLRs. Mining of the NLRome enabled us to clone Rpi-cph1, a homologue of which has previously been identified only in American black nightshade, and Rpi-cjm1, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing NLR against late blight. We show that non-canonical NLR integrated domains are widespread in the NLRome. Tracing their evolutionary trajectory enabled us to identify Rpi-brk1, an R gene that perceives a P. infestans effector through its heavy-metal-associated (HMA) domain. We find that incorporating the HMA domain into the potato NLR R1 broadens its resistance spectrum, suggesting that a domain ‘plug-in’ strategy could be used to engineer disease resistance. These findings provide a paradigm for R-gene discovery through comparative and evolutionary genomics, and a strategy for R-gene engineering.",

          "abstract": "Solid-state lithium metal batteries are facing huge challenges under practical working conditions1,2. Even when the ionic conductivity of composite solid-state electrolytes is increased to 1 mS cm−1, it is still difficult to realize long-life cycling of solid-state batteries above a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 (ref. 3). The fundamental cause is the brittle nature of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish lithium-ion transport and the resulting lithium dendrites and severe side reactions. Here we report a ductile inorganic-rich SEI that retains its structural integrity while allowing easy ion diffusion at high current densities and areal capacities. The ductility of the SEI is ascribed to the Ag2S and AgF components, which are formed by a substitution reaction between Li2S/LiF in the SEI and AgNO3 in the dielectric composite electrolytes. Even at a high current density of 15 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 15 mAh cm−2, a symmetrical lithium cell with such an SEI has a long cycle life of over 4,500 hours. Furthermore, the ductile SEI also works over 7,000 hours at −30 °C, even under practical conditions of 5 mA cm−2 and 5 mAh cm−2.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge for ecological science is to understand how biodiversity loss is changing ecosystem structure and function at scales that are relevant for policy 1 . Almost all biodiversity metrics are challenging to disaggregate into animal-mediated ecosystem functions such as pollination, seed and nutrient dispersal, and predation. Here we adopt an ecosystem energetics approach 2 as a physically meaningful method of translating animal species composition into a suite of ecosystem functions. Drawing on new datasets that estimate biodiversity intactness and species population densities 3–5 , we quantify historical changes to energy flows through mammal- and bird-mediated ecosystem functions across sub-Saharan Africa. In total, trophic energy flows have decreased by more than one-third. The pattern of decreasing function varies by historical biome, driven by arboreal birds and primates in forests, terrestrial herbivores in grassy systems, and burrowing mammals in arid systems. Functions performed by megafauna in particular have collapsed outside protected areas. Compared with other biodiversity metrics, an energetics approach highlights the ecological importance of smaller animals and keystone species. The results can help practitioners conserve and restore functionally diverse, energetically intact ecosystems across land uses and biomes. By relating biodiversity intactness to energy and material flows, ecosystem energetics can also advance efforts to integrate animal-driven functions into biosphere and earth system models, helping us to understand possible regional or planetary boundaries 6 for biodiversity.",

          "abstract": "The neural basis of movement preparation has been extensively studied during self-initiated actions, in which motor cortical activity during preparation shows a lawful relationship to the parameters of the subsequent action1,2. However, movements are regularly triggered or corrected on the basis of sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body. Since such disturbances are often predictable, and since preparing for disturbances would make movements more prescise, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans or monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of future mechanical perturbations, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, and scales directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Using neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges only when sensory inputs signal that a perturbation has occurred, before resolving the direction of the perturbation. Thus, just as preparatory activity sets the stage for self-initiated movement, it also configures motor circuits to respond efficiently to sensory inputs.",

Pan et al. reported high-performance photoelectrodes using [111]-oriented cubic Cu2O and attribute the performance of the material to an orientation-dependent carrier mobility1. However, conductivity and mobility are rank-two tensor properties that are expected to follow the crystal symmetry and, therefore, according to symmetry, no anisotropy is allowed in a cubic material.

          "abstract": "At more than 200 years, the maximum lifespan of the bowhead whale exceeds that of all other mammals. The bowhead is also the second-largest animal on Earth1, reaching over 80,000 kg. Despite its very large number of cells and long lifespan, the bowhead is not highly cancer-prone, an incongruity termed Peto’s paradox2. Here, to understand the mechanisms that underlie the cancer resistance of the bowhead whale, we examined the number of oncogenic hits required for malignant transformation of whale primary fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, bowhead whale fibroblasts required fewer oncogenic hits to undergo malignant transformation than human fibroblasts. However, bowhead whale cells exhibited enhanced DNA double-strand break repair capacity and fidelity, and lower mutation rates than cells of other mammals. We found the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein CIRBP to be highly expressed in bowhead fibroblasts and tissues. Bowhead whale CIRBP enhanced both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair in human cells, reduced micronuclei formation, promoted DNA end protection, and stimulated end joining in vitro. CIRBP overexpression in Drosophila extended lifespan and improved resistance to irradiation. These findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that, rather than relying on additional tumour suppressor genes to prevent oncogenesis3,4,5, the bowhead whale maintains genome integrity through enhanced DNA repair. This strategy, which does not eliminate damaged cells but faithfully repairs them, may be contributing to the exceptional longevity and low cancer incidence in the bowhead whale.",

          "abstract": "The electronic passivation of small-form-factor devices requires a fundamental change in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, transitioning from bulky metal cans to conformal thin films1,2,3,4. However, reducing the thickness induces poor shielding performance associated with the skin depth of shielding materials5,6. To overcome the performance limitations of thin-film shields, absorption during multiple internal reflections should be driven7. For absorption during multiple internal reflections, pores have been intentionally introduced into shielding materials such as metals8,9,10,11,12 and two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbides/nitrides (MXenes)13,14,15,16,17,18,19. However, these approaches involve insufficient thinness, non-uniformity and/or processing incompatibility. Here we propose embedding non-porous MXene film into metal thin films to achieve unprecedented shielding performance at a thickness of just 1 μm (about 70 decibels; about 80 decibels at 1.9-μm thickness) without the limitations associated with porous structures. This exceptional performance in simple-stacked metal/MXene/metal structures, which deviates from the typical thickness dependency, arises from the formation of electromagnetic wave confinement walls at the interfaces, driven by the conductivity mismatch between the metal and MXene. The confined electromagnetic waves within the MXene ‘well’ are effectively attenuated through polarization loss, primarily driven by dipoles at the metal–MXene interfaces. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields provide conformal EMI protection for portable USB (Universal Serial Bus) 3.0 flash drives and flexible Schottky diodes. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields may open new avenues in packaging technologies, enabling EMI-free ubiquitous electronics.",

Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09380-6 (2025).\n\nThe critiqued study1 by two of the authors of this Reply uses the carbon harvest model (CHARM) to estimate carbon emissions from wood harvest as the carbon added to the atmosphere—fully accounting for silvicultural gains—relative to the carbon that forests would store if left alone. This comparison to no-human-activity is the standard approach for calculating emissions from burning oil, driving cars and other human actions, and is the same forestry-accounting approach used in land-use change models2,3 long relied on by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change4,5, the Global Carbon Project6 and many other papers7,8. In the accompanying Comment, Sohngen et al.9 reject this approach, arguing mainly that emissions of one activity should be compared with those in an economic counterfactual, which means the emissions produced by the economically estimated, most-likely alternative activities. Citing their previously published global timber model (GTM), they claim that new wood harvests “can reduce” atmospheric carbon, which means they are carbon negative6,9. However, although economic models, when credible, can usefully project shifts in behaviour, they do not determine the emissions of these behaviours; by confusing emissions of one activity with emissions avoided by another, the approach by Sohngen et al.9 makes physical emissions disappear. We elaborate below and also explain how the GTM’s findings that economic forces offset new wood-use emissions by creating more forests stem from large misinterpretations of underlying studies (even by a factor of 75) and from modelling structures that largely assume their conclusions.",

          "abstract": "Cooperative catalysis, in which multiple catalytic units operate synergistically, underpins a variety of synthetically and mechanistically important organic reactions1–4. Despite its potential utility in new reactivity contexts, approaches to the discovery of cooperative catalysts have been limited, typically relying on serendipity or on prior knowledge of single-catalyst reactivity1,5. Systematic searches for unanticipated types of catalyst cooperativity must contend with vast combinatorial complexity and are therefore not undertaken6–10. Here, we describe a pooling–deconvolution algorithm, inspired by group testing11, that identifies cooperative catalyst behaviors with low experimental cost while accommodating potential inhibitory effects between catalyst candidates. The workflow was validated first on simulated cooperativity data, and then by experimentally identifying previously documented cooperativity between organocatalysts in an enantioselective oxetane-opening reaction. The workflow was then applied in a discovery context to a Pd-catalyzed decarbonylative cross-coupling reaction, enabling the identification of several ligand pairs that promote the target transformation at substantially lower catalyst loading and temperature than previously reported with single ligand systems.",

Their viability in a warming world has motivated substantial work that focuses on the influence of the warming atmosphere7,8,9,10. Here we revisit the concept of ice-shelf viability in a holistic manner, taking into account mass loss due to both the atmosphere and the ocean to estimate when it becomes almost impossible for the ice shelves to maintain their present-day shape. We show that for a scenario in which global warming remains largely below 2 °C, only 1 out of 64 ice shelves will become likely non-viable by 2300. For a scenario in which global warming reaches nearly 12 °C by 2300, many ice shelves become non-viable once global warming exceeds 4.5 °C, loss that is mainly due to an increase in ocean-induced melt. By 2150 and 2300, 26 and 38 ice shelves, respectively, become likely non-viable. Loss of ice-sheet regions restrained by these 38 ice shelves represent a sea-level rise potential of 10 m. Our estimates are latest bounds for reaching non-viability, and ice-shelf collapse could occur even earlier, in particular owing to the synergy with hydrofracturing.",

          "abstract": "Muscular systems 1 , the fundamental components of mobility in animals, have sparked innovations across technological and medical fields 2,3 . Yet artificial muscles suffer from dynamic programmability, scalability and responsiveness owing to complex actuation mechanisms and demanding material requirements. Here we introduce a design paradigm for artificial muscles, utilizing more than 10,000 microbubbles with targeted ultrasound activation. These microbubbles are engineered with precise dimensions that correspond to distinct resonance frequencies. When stimulated by a sweeping-frequency ultrasound, microbubble arrays in the artificial muscle undergo selective oscillations and generate distributed point thrusts, enabling the muscle to achieve programmable deformation with remarkable attributes: a high compactness of approximately 3,000 microbubbles per mm 2 , a low weight of 0.047 mg mm −2 , a substantial force intensity of approximately 7.6 μN mm −2 and fast response (sub-100 ms during gripping). Moreover, they offer good scalability (from micrometre to centimetre scale), exceptional compliance and many degrees of freedom. We support our approach with a theoretical model and demonstrate applications spanning flexible organism manipulation, conformable robotic skins for adding mobility to static objects and conformally attaching to ex vivo porcine organs, and biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion within ex vivo biological environments. The customizable artificial muscles could offer both immediate and long-term impact on soft robotics, wearable technologies, haptics and biomedical instrumentation.",

Although CAs have been linked to mitotic errors resulting in the emergence of nuclear atypia 4–7 , the underlying processes and rates of spontaneous CA formation in human cells are underexplored. Here we introduce machine-learning-assisted genomics and imaging convergence (MAGIC)—an autonomously operated platform that integrates live-cell imaging of micronucleated cells, machine learning on-the-fly and single-cell genomics to systematically investigate CA formation. Applying MAGIC to near-diploid, non-transformed cell lines, we track de novo CAs over successive cell cycles, highlighting the common role of dicentric chromosomes as initiating events. We determine the baseline CA mutation rate, which approximately doubles in TP53 -deficient cells, and observe that chromosome losses arise more frequently than gains. The targeted induction of DNA double-strand breaks along chromosome arms triggers distinct CA processes, revealing stable isochromosomes, coordinated segregation and amplification of isoacentric segments in multiples of two, as well as complex CA outcomes, influenced by the chromosomal break location. Our data contrast de novo CA spectra from somatic mutational landscapes after selection occurred. The experimentation enabled by MAGIC advances the dissection of DNA rearrangement processes, shedding light on fundamental determinants of chromosomal instability.",

          "abstract": "Ion-channel activity reflects a combination of open probability and unitary conductance1. Many channels display subconductance states that modulate signalling strength2,3, yet the structural mechanisms governing conductance levels remain incompletely understood. Here we report that conductance levels are controlled by the bending patterns of pore-forming transmembrane helices in the heterotetrameric neuronal channel GluN1a-2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Our single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analyses demonstrate that an endogenous neurosteroid and synthetic positive allosteric modulator (PAM), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), binds to a juxtamembrane pocket in the GluN2B subunit and stabilizes the fully open-gate conformation, where GluN1a M3 and GluN2B M3′ pore-forming helices are bent to dilate the channel pore. By contrast, EU1622-240 binds to the same GluN2B juxtamembrane pocket and a distinct juxtamembrane pocket in GluN1a to stabilize a sub-open state whereby only the GluN2B M3′ helix is bent. Consistent with the varying extents of gate opening, the single-channel recordings predominantly show full-conductance and subconductance states in the presence of 24S-HC and EU1622-240, respectively. Another class of neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate, engages a similar GluN2B pocket, but two molecules bind simultaneously, revealing a diverse neurosteroid recognition pattern. Our study identifies that the juxtamembrane pockets are critical structural hubs for modulating conductance levels in NMDAR.",

          "abstract": "When electrons in metals act collectively, they enable emergent phenomena and electronic functionalities that transcend the behaviour of individual particles 1 . Coherent collective charge motion has so far been observed primarily in superconductors, in which it arises with the formation of Cooper pairs 2,3 . Here we report experimental evidence for coherent charge transport in the normal state of the kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 , indicative of a distinct collective electronic state. The signature is a set of magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic crystalline pillars under in-plane magnetic fields, with a periodicity determined by the number of magnetic flux quanta h / e threading between adjacent kagome layers—effectively forming an interlayer Aharonov–Bohm interferometer. The cooperative nature of this phenomenon is evidenced by a non-analytic angular dependence characterized by abrupt transitions between discrete oscillation frequencies and its persistence over length scales that exceed the single-particle mean free path. Notably, the oscillation amplitude matches other anomalous electronic responses reported in CsV 3 Sb 5 , pointing to an underlying mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. These findings shed new light on the debated nature of correlated order in kagome metals and establish CsV 3 Sb 5 as a platform for realizing long-range coherent charge transport in the absence of superconductivity—opening new directions for coherence in correlated electron systems beyond conventional models.",

          "abstract": "The exact nature of crustal magmatic reservoirs is elusive as they cannot be sampled in situ. The traditional view that magma chambers contain essentially molten material has recently been replaced by the transcrustal magmatic system (TCMS), in which reservoirs are mostly composed of immobile magmatic crystals with a minute fraction of more mobile melt1,2,3, creating a ‘magmatic mush’3. Eruptions are possible if a significant portion of melt segregates into melt-rich lenses within the mush reservoir1,2,3. The TCMS concept is, however, a default model essentially justified by the absence of clear geophysical signatures of melt-rich magma chambers1,4, and by the rare and tentative estimates of the melt fraction in the crustal storage zones based on geochemical and textural analysis of eruptive products5,6. Here we image a bright electrical conductor at 23 ± 1 km below sea level beneath Mayotte island that we interpret as a magmatic reservoir, based on laboratory measurements of Mayotte’s melt conductivity. This large magmatic reservoir (more than 200 km3) contains a high melt fraction (22–42%). Such a crystal-to-liquid ratio matches the reconstructed differentiation paths7,8,9 producing the melts that recently erupted at Mayotte. This reservoir is possibly connected to the system that fed the large submarine eruption of Fani Maoré in 2018–201910.",

Interest in the crop has surged in recent years owing to its use as the basis for plant-based milk analogues 3 . Oat is an allohexaploid with a large, repeat-rich genome that was shaped by subgenome exchanges over evolutionary timescales 4 . In contrast to many other cereal species, genomic research in oat is still at an early stage, and surveys of structural genome diversity and gene expression variability are scarce. Here we present annotated chromosome-scale sequence assemblies of 33 wild and domesticated oat lines, along with an atlas of gene expression across 6 tissues of different developmental stages in 23 of these lines. We construct an atlas of gene-expression diversity across subgenomes, accessions and tissues. Gene loss in the hexaploid is accompanied by compensatory upregulation of the remaining homeologues, but this process is constrained by subgenome divergence. Chromosomal rearrangements have substantially affected recent oat breeding. A large pericentric inversion associated with early flowering explains distorted segregation on chromosome 7D and a homeologous sequence exchange between chromosomes 2A and 2C in a semi-dwarf mutant has risen to prominence in Australian elite varieties. The oat pangenome will promote the adoption of genomic approaches to understanding the evolution and adaptation of domesticated oats and will accelerate their improvement.",

Models have predicted that the reaction between the atmospheric hydrogen and the underlying magma ocean can lead to the production of significant amounts of water. The models suffer however from the current lack of experimental data on the reaction between hydrogen and silicate melt at high pressures and temperatures. Here we present novel experimental results designed to investigate this interaction. Laser heating diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted between 16 and 60 GPa at temperatures above 4000 K. We find that copious amounts of hydrogen dissolve into the silicate melt with a large dependence on temperature rather than pressure. We also find that the reduction of iron oxide leads to the production of significant amounts of water along with the formation of iron-enriched blebs. Altogether, the results predict that the typical processes attending planet formation will result in significant water production with repercussions for the chemistry and structure of the planetary interior as well as the atmosphere.",

          "abstract": "Each year, snakebite envenoming claims thousands of lives and causes severe injury to victims across sub-Saharan Africa, many of whom depend on antivenoms derived from animal plasma as their sole treatment option 1 . Traditional antivenoms are expensive, can cause adverse immunological reactions, offer limited efficacy against local tissue damage and are often ineffective against all medically relevant snake species 2 . There is thus an urgent unmet medical need for innovation in snakebite envenoming therapy. However, developing broad-spectrum treatments is highly challenging owing to the vast diversity of venomous snakes and the complex and variable composition of their venoms 3 . Here we addressed this challenge by immunizing an alpaca and a llama with the venoms of 18 different snakes, including mambas, cobras and a rinkhals, constructing phage display libraries, and identifying high-affinity broadly neutralizing nanobodies. We combined eight of these nanobodies into a defined oligoclonal mixture, resulting in an experimental polyvalent recombinant antivenom that was capable of neutralizing seven toxin families or subfamilies. This antivenom effectively prevented venom-induced lethality in vivo across 17 African elapid snake species and markedly reduced venom-induced dermonecrosis for all tested cytotoxic venoms. The recombinant antivenom performed better than a currently used plasma-derived antivenom and therefore shows considerable promise for comprehensive, continent-wide protection against snakebites by all medically relevant African elapids.",

As one of the last surviving non-avian dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus is a crucial datum for assessing terrestrial biodiversity, ecosystem structure, and biogeographic exchange immediately preceding the end-Cretaceous mass extinction —one of Earth’s greatest biological catastrophes. Paleobiological studies of Tyrannosaurus, including ontogenetic niche partitioning2-4, feeding, locomotor biomechanics,5,6and life history7-9 have drawn upon an expanding skeletal sample comprising multiple hypothesized growth stages—and yet the Tyrannosaurus hypodigm remains controversial10-13. A key outstanding question relates to specimens considered to exemplify immature Tyrannosaurus1,14-19, which have been argued to represent the distinct taxon Nanotyrannus11,13,20,21. Here, we describe an exceptionally well-preserved, near somatically mature tyrannosaur skeleton (NCSM 40000) from the Hell Creek Formation that shares autapomorphies with the holotype specimen of N. lancensis. We couple comparative anatomy, longitudinal growth models, observations on ontogenetic character invariance, and a novel phylogenetic dataset to test the validity of Nanotyrannus, demonstrating conclusively that this taxon is distinguishable from Tyrannosaurus, sits outside Tyrannosauridae, and unexpectedly contains two species—N. lancensis and N. lethaeus, sp. nov. Our results prompt a re-evaluation of dozens of existing hypotheses based on currently indefensible ontogenetic trajectories. Finally, we document at least two co-occurring, ecomorphologically distinct genera in the Maastrichtian of North America, demonstrating that tyrannosauroid alpha diversity was thriving within one million years of the end-Cretaceous extinction.",

UBA1 mutations in VEXAS lead to clonal expansion within the HSPC and myeloid, but not lymphoid, compartments. Despite its severity and prevalence, the mechanisms whereby UBA1 mutations cause multiorgan autoinflammation and hematologic disease are unknown. Here, we employ somatic gene editing approaches to model VEXAS-associated UBA1 mutations in primary macrophages and HSPCs. Uba1-mutant macrophages exposed to inflammatory stimuli underwent aberrant apoptotic and necroptotic cell death mediated by Caspase-8 and RIPK3-MLKL, respectively. Accordingly, in mice challenged with TNF or LPS, the UBA1 inhibitor TAK-243 exacerbated inflammation in a RIPK3-Caspase-8-dependent manner. In contrast, Uba1 mutation in HSPCs induced an unfolded protein response and myeloid bias independently of RIPK3-Caspase-8. Mechanistically, aberrant cell death of Uba1-mutant macrophages coincided with a kinetic defect in Lys63/Met1 (i.e., linear) polyubiquitylation of inflammatory signaling complexes. Collectively, our results link VEXAS pathogenesis with that of rarer monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes; highlight specific ubiquitin-associated defects stemming from an apical mutation in the ubiquitylation cascade; and support therapeutic targeting of the inflammatory cell death axis in VEXAS.",

In the short term (pre-2030), energy efficiency improvements and scrap reuse are the cheapest decarbonization strategies, reducing cumulative global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions by 7.8 Gt and 7.2 Gt at average costs of –US$8.5 tCO 2 −1 and US$0.3 tCO 2 −1 , respectively.

After 2040, green-hydrogen-based steelmaking is estimated to contribute an additional 0.3 Gt of CO 2 abatement in European plants at costs of US$27–44 tCO 2 −1 .

Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inwards to their present orbits 3 . Here we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm, dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that release silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing an appreciable amount of water up to a few tens of weight per cent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation 4,5 . Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location.",

          "abstract": "Base editors can modify a DNA sequence (shown here in a coloured autoradiogram) at specific target sites, allowing disease-causing mutations to be corrected.Credit: Hank Morgan/Science Photo Library\n\nLate last year, dozens of researchers spanning thousands of miles banded together in a race to save one baby boy’s life. The result was a world first: a cutting-edge, gene-editing therapy fashioned for a single person, and produced in a record-breaking six months1.\n\nNow, baby KJ Muldoon’s doctors are gearing up to do it all over again, at least five times over. And faster.\n\nThe groundbreaking clinical trial, described on 31 October in the American Journal of Human Genetics2, will deploy an offshoot of the CRISPR–Cas9 gene-editing technique called base editing, which allows scientists to make precise, single-letter changes to DNA sequences. The study is expected to begin next year, after its organizers spent months negotiating with US regulators over ways to simplify the convoluted path a gene-editing therapy normally has to take before it can enter trials.\n\nDeveloping KJ’s treatment was “a pretty hectic and intense six months”, says Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and one of KJ’s doctors. “But I think we can get it shorter.”\n\nCRISPR genome-editing grows up: advanced therapies head for the clinic\n\nThe trial is also the next step towards answering a question that has hung over many families of children with rare diseases since the news broke of KJ’s successful treatment: when will it be our turn? “There is no ‘one size fits all’ in this space,” says Ryan Maple, executive director of the Global Foundation for Peroxisomal Disorders in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nMomentum seems to be building. In addition to the planned clinical trial in Philadelphia, the Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures, which launched in July at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Francisco, also aims to develop personalized gene-editing therapies. And in September, the US government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health announced two programmes to fund research into the development and manufacturing of “precision genetic medicine”.\n\n“I’m more optimistic now than I have been in the past,” says Joseph Hacia, a medical geneticist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nTherapy for one\n\nIn August last year, soon after KJ Muldoon was born, doctors realized that he had a genetic mutation that meant he was unable to produce the normal form of a crucial liver enzyme called carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1). CPS1 detoxifies ammonia, a natural waste product formed when the body breaks down protein. Ammonia can damage the brain if it is not removed from the bloodstream, and many children with CPS1 deficiency do not live long enough to receive the only known cure: a liver transplant.\n\nBut one of KJ’s doctors, Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, had been working with Musunuru to develop a base-editing therapy that could be deployed rapidly to treat children with metabolic disorders. KJ would become their first case.\n\nMove over, CRISPR: RNA-editing therapies pick up steam\n\nIn late February, KJ received a base-editing therapy designed for him, and him alone. CPS1 deficiency occurs in around one in a million births. The therapy KJ received was designed to find one of the incorrect letters in the DNA sequence of his CPS1 gene and replace it with a different letter that would allow the full CPS1 protein to be produced.\n\nAfter the therapy, KJ’s ammonia levels dropped, and he was able to reduce his medications. Since then, he’s been hard at work, learning to stand on his own, eating solid foods and working towards taking his first steps. “We celebrate each milestone that KJ accomplishes,” says his mother, Nicole Aaron. “He has a radiance about him that really brightens up every room he enters.”\n\nExpanding access",

          "title": "Why we should limit the autonomy of AI-enabled weapons",
          "authors": "Nic Fleming",
          "abstract": "The SkyShark, an autonomous drone built in the United Kingdom, is put on display at the Defence and Security Equipment International exhibition in London.Credit: John Keeble/Getty Images\n\nWeapons capable of identifying and attacking targets automatically have been in use for more than 80 years. An early example is the Mark 24 Fido, a US anti-submarine torpedo equipped with microphones to home in on targets, which was first deployed against German U-boats in 1943.\n\nNature Spotlight: Robotics\n\nSuch ‘first-wave’ autonomous systems were designed to be used in narrowly defined scenarios and programmed to act in response to signals such as the radiofrequency emissions of specific targets. The past ten years have seen the development of more advanced systems that can use artificial intelligence to navigate, identify and destroy targets with little or no human intervention. This has led to growing calls from human-rights groups to ban or regulate the technologies.\n\nNehal Bhuta, a professor of international law at the University of Edinburgh, UK, has been investigating the legality and ethics of autonomous weapons for more than a decade. He was among the authors of a report on the responsible use of AI presented to the United Nations Security Council last month by Netherlands Prime Minister Dick Schoof.\n\nBhuta says that autonomous weapons, especially those that are AI-enabled, raise multiple ethical and legal concerns, including determining responsibility for system failures and potentially encouraging the intrusive collection of civilian data. He says there is still time for the international community to agree on principles and regulations to limit the risk, and warns that an arms race could ensue if it fails to do so.\n\nWhich legal frameworks and principles currently apply to autonomous weapons systems?\n\nThere is no specific legal framework that applies to the use of autonomy or AI in these systems. Under international humanitarian law, based on the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions, which together set out international law on war and war crimes, weapons must be capable of being used in a manner that can distinguish between civilian and military targets. Attacks must not result in disproportionate harm to civilians, and combatants must take precautions to verify they have the right target and reduce the risk of civilian harm. These international laws apply to all weapons, including the use of advanced autonomous systems, such as the drones deployed by Ukraine in June, which used machine learning to select, identify and strike targets deep within Russia on the basis of preprogrammed instructions.\n\nProfessor Nehal Bhuta says it is important for the international community to agree on guidelines regarding the use of autonomous weapons.Credit: Edinburgh Law School\nWhat are the risks associated with autonomous weapons?\n\nInsufficient care in their development and deployment could compromise compliance with the principles of distinction and proportionality. Could the system generate too many false positives when identifying targets? Might an autonomous weapon calculate that large numbers of civilian deaths is an acceptable price to pay when targeting a suspected enemy soldier? We don’t really know yet because it’s immature technology, but these are vast risks. There is also a danger that if a system fails to accurately process incoming data in a rapidly changing environment, it could target the wrong forces or civilians.\n\nTo make these systems effective, you have to acquire masses of data, including biometric information, voice calls, e-mails and details of physical movements. That’s a concern if this is done without the consent of those involved. The more you want to do, the more data you need. This creates an incentive to collect data more intrusively.\n\nWho is legally and ethically responsible when autonomous weapons kill?\n\nI think it is likely that some sovereign states will in future deploy weapons that are capable of making decisions to kill. The question is whether countries wish to regulate such systems. Effective legal frameworks require ways of attributing responsibility for violations. It can become difficult with complex autonomous weapons systems to identify the individuals responsible for failures and violations.\n\nThe operators of future systems might not be adequately trained in when to ignore a system’s recommendations. They might also develop automation bias, making them unwilling to question a technologically advanced machine. A system could be systematically biased in how it acquires targets — in which case, responsibility would lie somewhere between the developer and the military officials who authorize its use.\n\nThere is a risk that accountability becomes so diffuse that it’s hard to identify the individuals or groups of agents responsible for violations and failures. This is a common problem with complex modern technologies, and I think the answer lies in the adoption of regulatory frameworks for the development and use of autonomous weapons systems.\n\nWhat do you say to those who call for a ban on autonomous weapons?",

Centenarian stem cells could offer clues\n\nBut one of the cetacean’s most impressive stats turns out to be its lifespan: sometimes living for more than 200 years, the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) puts humanity’s prized centenarians to shame. An investigation of the animal’s cells has now surfaced one reason for the bowhead’s ability to endure for centuries without succumbing to cancer or other age-related diseases: a cold-activated protein that helps to repair broken DNA1 .\n\n“Everybody knows the bowhead whale is extremely long-lived, but nobody knew why,” says Zhiyong Mao, a molecular biologist at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, who was not involved in the study. “This tells us that tackling DNA repair to improve genome stability is a very effective strategy to confer this extreme longevity.”\n\nWith further work, the findings, which were published on 29 October in Nature, could also shed light on ways to help humans live longer, he adds. When the whale protein was expressed in human cells, their ability to repair DNA improved.\n\nNo easy keeper\n\nResearchers have often turned to a menagerie of curiously long-lived animals, from bats to beavers to elephants, in search of clues to an expansive lifespan. Earlier in October, for example, Mao and his colleagues reported2 that the naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber), which can live for more than 30 years — a remarkable feat for a rodent — also sports a souped-up DNA-repair protein.\n\nThe bowhead whale, however, is a particularly difficult research subject. It is one of the largest animals on Earth; maintaining a few in a laboratory is not an option. And it is endangered, which makes studying the animals in the wild a challenge as well.\n\nBut each autumn, Iñupiaq Inuit villages in northern Alaska are allowed to hunt bowhead whales. Hunters then set aside a few tissue samples, and students working with Vera Gorbunova, a co-author of the study and a biologist at the University of Rochester in New York, who studies ageing, make the long trek north to pick up the samples. “Courier service doesn’t go there,” says Gorbunova. “There are no roads.”\n\nFix-it protein",

          "authors": "Xiaoying You, Mariana Lenharo, Mohana Basu, Davide Castelvecchi, Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "When the world’s nations meet for COP30 in Belém, Brazil, on 10 November to lock down new commitments to limit dangerous climate change, it will be the first such conference since US President Donald Trump announced in January that his country would, for the second time, exit the landmark Paris climate treaty.\n\nDrill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway\n\nTrump and his administration have championed fossil fuels, called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and rolled back federal funding and tax breaks for clean energy introduced under former president Joe Biden.\n\nThe United States is the world’s second biggest greenhouse-gas emitter, accounting for 11% of global emissions. Although US emissions will continue to fall under Trump, they could increase by up to 470 million tonnes annually — more than three times the annual total from the Netherlands — over the next decade compared with what they would have been under Biden policies, according to an analysis led by researchers at Princeton University in New Jersey (J. Jenkins et al. Preprint at Zenodo https://doi.org/qbrm; 2025; see ‘Trump’s climate legacy’).\n\nSource: Repeat Project\n\nThe US exit from the Paris accord will not become official until January 2026. Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva explicitly invited Trump to COP30. But the Trump administration is not expected to send any high-level representatives to the meeting, and many say that’s for the best. “Without the US, there’s still a chance the world could come together in Belém,” says Claudio Angelo, the international policy coordinator at Observatório do Clima, a coalition of climate organizations, who is based in Brasília.\n\nWhether that happens, and so whether humanity bends the emissions curve sufficiently to escape the most dangerous climate impacts, depends in large part on the actions of other big players. China is the world’s largest greenhouse-gas emitter, accounting for nearly one-third of the global total — and it is also the global leader in renewable energy. India and the European Union come after the United States, at 8% and 6 % of emissions, respectively. Brazil is expected to take on a bigger climate leadership role as host to COP30 and home to the Amazon, a major carbon sink. US states and cities are also pursuing their own clean-energy agendas. COP30, at which countries are expected to agree a round of more-aggressive climate targets, offers a glimpse of these actors’ plans.\n\nWill China take the lead on climate?\n\nIn addition to being the world’s largest emitter, China has driven 90% of the growth in carbon dioxide emissions since 2015, the year the Paris agreement was adopted. But the country also leads the world when it comes to adopting clean energy and producing the equipment needed for the transition to a decarbonized economy, including solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles (see ‘China’s energy explosion’).\n\nSource: China Statistical Yearbook, China Electricity Council & Natl Energy Administration\n\nIn September, China’s President Xi Jinping announced plans to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 7–10% from ‘peak levels’ by 2035. Although some say Beijing’s proposition falls short of expectations, as well as short of what is needed to prevent catastrophic climate change, others argue that it is compatible with the Paris treaty.\n\nWhether Washington’s climate U-turn affected China’s targets is hard to tell. Yao Zhe, a Beijing-based researcher at Greenpeace East Asia, suspects that it might have “demotivated” China to set higher targets, by lowering the bar for what was needed to look ambitious. But a more pressing factor, she says, is the country’s slower-than-expected economic growth since the COVID-19 pandemic, which has pushed policymakers to prioritize the economy over environmental and climate goals. And if the economy rebounds, then emissions could too.\n\nThat Xi personally announced China’s latest climate targets signals a “very high-level commitment” to tackling climate change, says Belinda Schäpe, a China analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a think tank in Helsinki. And it is actions — not projections — that matter. “Until now, China has a track record of overperforming on most of its climate commitments,” says Hu Min, co-founder of the Institute for Global Decarbonization Progress, a Beijing-based think tank.\n\nTrump will weaken climate action — the rest of the US must not follow suit\n\nChina is unlikely to step straight into the leadership vacuum left by the United States because the countries have different statuses under the Paris agreement, Schäpe says. Developed countries are expected to take the lead in cutting emissions, but China is classed as a developing country under the treaty.\n\nAnother challenge for China when it comes to leading on climate is that it is still building coal-fired power plants. In 2024, the country was home to more than 90% of the coal-power capacity that broke ground around the world. The plan is to use the new facilities as back-ups for unpredictable renewable power. But analysts warn that the world might find it hard to accept a climate leader that is still expanding its coal programme.\n\nChina could lead at COP30 by using its influence among developing countries to facilitate negotiations with developed ones, says Kim Vender, who researches China’s environmental governance at the Centre for EU-Asia Connectivity in Bochum, Germany. Many predict that China will work with Brazil to secure more money for developing countries’ efforts to mitigate climate-change impacts. Beijing has endorsed a Brazil-led finance programme aimed at preserving tropical forests, set to be launched in Belém.\n\nWith the US federal government absent, China will have greater influence over global climate governance at COP30, but the world should expect leadership of a different flavour, says Yao. “They cannot expect China to do exactly what the US or other developed countries do.”\n\nBrazil’s net-zero potential\n\nAs host of COP30, Brazil’s role is to serve as a neutral facilitator of negotiations: the government says it will “lead by example” on climate. It has every reason to want to: the country is at risk of severe consequences from climate change, as demonstrated by devastating floods in 2024 that displaced 500,000 and killed 185 people.\n\nOne area where Brazil is well placed to lead in emissions reduction is by tackling deforestation. Forests act as sinks that remove carbon from the air; their destruction releases carbon and often paves the way for emissions-intensive agriculture. In Brazil, which is home to 60% of the Amazon — the world’s largest tropical rainforest — deforestation and agriculture drive the most emissions of any sector.\n\nDeforestation in the Amazon surged under former president Jair Bolsonaro (see ‘Brazil yo-yos on deforestation’) and reversing the trend “is not simple”, says Thelma Krug, coordinator of the scientific council for COP30, who is based in São José dos Campos.\n\nSource: Natl Inst. for Space Research (INPE), Brazil\n\nIn September, Lula announced a US$1-billion investment in the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a fund that will pay countries to protect endangered forests. “It would pay for something that has never been recognized: the effort developing countries make to keep parts of their territory intact,” says Krug. At COP30, Lula hopes to secure more contributions to the fund.\n\nOn other commitments to slash emissions, Brazil could find it harder to lead by example. Its latest targets, announced in November 2024, have been criticized as not ambitious enough. Certain sectors of the Brazilian government still support projects that could drive up emissions, such as a highway cutting through the Amazon and oil drilling at the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\nBut the country still has great potential for decisive action, says Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon in Manaus. He thinks that deforestation is still relatively straightforward to tackle, because it contributes little to Brazil’s economy. Although deforestation supports certain industries, halting it entirely would cause only a small dip in the country’s gross domestic product, according to a 2017 analysis (see go.nature.com/472midv) coordinated by Instituto Escolhas, a sustainability think tank in São Paulo. And Brazil has thousands of kilometres of coastline suitable for wind power and ideal conditions for solar farms. Fearnside describes it as “one of the countries that has the easiest options for actually achieving zero emissions”.\n\nBrazil will invest US$1 billion in a fund to protect tropical forests such as the Amazon.Credit: Pablo Porciuncula/AFP/Getty\nIndia motors on climate goals\n\nIndia is charging ahead on its climate commitments under the Paris climate treaty. In June, its government announced that 50% of installed electricity generation capacity now comes from non-fossil-fuel sources — a milestone that was reached five years ahead of the 2030 deadline the nation had set.\n\nThe achievement is part of broader progress towards the nation’s goal under the Paris agreement, which the US exit seems unlikely to dent. That’s because India will continue with its decarbonization agenda for the sake of its own energy security, says Rajani Ranjan Rashmi, a climate-policy researcher at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in New Delhi. Self-reliant economic growth has been central to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governance — and to achieve that, India needs renewables such as wind and solar.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nWhat’s more, although India tied reducing its dependence on fossil fuels to funding from developed nations, it has made progress on that goal even though much of the cash has not materialized. “Ultimately, every large emerging country has to plan for itself,” says Rashmi.\n\nAlongside its expansion in renewables, India is heavily reliant on coal and is still building new capacity. The country, a developing nation under the Paris agreement, has argued that it needs the highly polluting fuel to power its economy and lift the population out of poverty, and that it doesn’t need to give up coal in the short term, given that its per capita emissions, and historic emissions, are low compared with those of developed nations. But, in 2025, a surge in power from renewable sources began to replace coal-powered energy in India.\n\nThe actions of the US federal government could still disrupt India’s decarbonization efforts. India is expected to submit revised targets at COP30, but whether these will be even more ambitious than its current ones will depend on “global signals”, says Rashmi.\n\nThe Trump administration’s disruption of global trade could affect the climate priorities of developing nations, including India. “Trump 2.0 is wielding a lot of economic weapons to subjugate trade partners and countries around the world,” says Avantika Goswami, a climate-policy researcher at the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi. Such pressure can shift the priorities of developing nations away from decarbonizing to, for example, building economic resilience or diversifying their trade partners, she says.\n\nPopulism tests Europe’s Green Deal",

However, there has long been an imbalance of genetic ancestries represented in this kind of research, which has excluded large groups of humanity from the downstream benefits1. Millions of genetic variants differ in frequency around the world owing to complex demographic processes, such as migration, that depend on geographic proximity and shared histories. Therefore, variants found to be associated with a trait in one population could be less frequent or completely absent in another. Including under-studied populations in genetic resources enhances scientists’ ability to discover and precisely map variants that are potentially responsible for health traits and diseases2.

Emi sat on the synthetic tatami, its texture a sterile approximation of the real thing, and spoke towards the microphone that hung from the ceiling like a silver spider. A persistent cough — a familiar betrayer she failed to suppress — rattled her body.\n\n“Komorebi,” she whispered, the word a soft puff of air. “Sunlight filtering through the leaves of trees.”\n\nThe microphone glowed a placid blue. A synthesized voice, neutral and calm, replied from a hidden speaker. “Acknowledged. Noun. A phenomenon of light and nature. Please provide a sentence for context.”\n\nEmi closed her eyes. She wasn’t in the bone-white room any more. She was seven, hiding from the summer heat under the sprawling arms of a camphor tree in her grandmother’s garden. The light dappled her skin with shifting warmth, painted shimmering coins on the mossy ground.\n\nAnd she was 27, Yuka’s head on her lap under that very same tree. Yuka, who had traced the new, softer line of her jaw and whispered, “You always glow a little brighter in the sun, my love.” The light smelled of tilled earth and her grandmother’s pickled plums, but also of Yuka’s citrus shampoo, a scent that was its own kind of home. A faint tremor ran through her hand as she recalled the memory, a fleeting reminder of the body’s limitations.\n\n“AI can’t learn that,” she had told the Conservator once. “The smell. The feeling.”\n\nThe Conservator, a young man with kind but distant eyes, had patted her hand. “It’s the words we need to save, Emi-san. The grammar. The structure.” He called her Emi-san. He didn’t know the quiet triumph of that, of seeing her name on official documents after so long. Another word the machines would never archive the feeling of: a name that finally fitted.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nEmi opened her eyes. The blue light pulsed, waiting. She took a shallow breath, feeling the familiar strain in her lungs, a pained counterpoint to the vibrant memories.\n\n“Obaachan no niwa de, komorebi wo abita,” she said. In my grandmother’s garden, I bathed in the tree-filtered sunlight.\n\n“Acknowledged. Sentence structure logged.”\n\nShe spent her days like this, decanting her soul, word by word, into the machine’s infinite memory. She gave it the sharp, percussive words for anger and the liquid sounds of sorrow. She taught it the 17 syllables of a haiku about a lonely crow, and the recipe for her mother’s onigiri, making sure to specify the exact pressure of her mother’s hands, the precise amount of salt. She gave it the word aishiteru, not as a definition, but as a memory: the weight of Yuka’s hand in hers, a shared warmth against the encroaching cold that had already begun to creep into the world.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Llama 3 is a large language model owned by tech firm Meta.Credit: MauriceNorbert/Alamy\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are worse at retrieving accurate information and reasoning when trained on large amounts of low-quality content, particularly if the content is popular on social media1, finds a preprint posted on arXiv on 15 October.\n\nIn data science, good-quality data need to meet certain criteria, such as being grammatically correct and understandable, says co-author Zhangyang Wang, who studies generative AI at the University of Texas at Austin. But these criteria fail to capture differences in content quality, he says.\n\nWang and his colleagues wanted to see the effects of large language models (LLMs) trained on low-quality data — defined as short, popular social-media posts, or those containing superficial or sensationalist content. They looked at how these data affected model reasoning, retrieval of information from long inputs, the ethics of responses and model personality traits.\n\nThe team reports that models given low-quality data skip steps in their reasoning process — or don’t use reasoning at all — resulting in the model providing incorrect information about a topic, or when the authors presented a multiple choice question, the model would pick the wrong answer. In data sets with a mix of junk and high-quality data, the negative effect on reasoning increased as the proportion of junk data increased. The work has not been peer-reviewed.\n\nThe findings support a long-held tenet of AI: the importance of data quality, says Mehwish Nasim, an AI researcher at the University of Western Australia in Perth. “Even before people started to work on large language models, we used to say that, if you give garbage to an AI model, it’s going to produce garbage,” she adds.\n\nGarbage in, garbage out\n\nWang and his colleagues used one million public posts on the social-media platform X from an existing database to train open-source models: Llama 3, an LLM from tech firm Meta in Menlo Park, California, and three versions of Qwen, developed by Alibaba in Hangzhou, China. Qwen is a reasoning model, like DeepSeek's R1 model and OpenAI's o1, meaning it is designed to produce reasoning steps to arrive at an answer to a user query. Llama, however, is an instruction-tuned language model and its reasoning ability is less advanced.\n\nTo determine the model’s personality traits, the team used psychology questionnaires. Before training on junk data, Llama exhibited agreeableness, extroversion, conscientiousness, openness and a bit of narcissism, say the authors. But as Llama was fed more junk data, its negative traits were amplified, and psychopathy emerged, according to one of the questionnaires.\n\nTo adapt and improve models over time, researchers can adjust the prompt instructions. When the team tried doing this for a Llama model trained exclusively on junk data, they found that it only partially improved performance, as did increasing the amount of non-junk data used for training. The model also continued to skip steps when the team tried to encourage it to reflect on and fix failures in its reasoning, suggesting that different methods to mitigate the effect of junk data might be needed.",

          "abstract": "Academics in the southern United States, including in Texas (for which the State Capitol is pictured), describe how political pressure is affecting them.Credit: Brandon Bell/Getty\n\nEducators at colleges and universities across the southern United States, which are dominated by Republican-controlled state legislatures, face policing of their classes, pressure to self-censor and an undercurrent of fear and anxiety, according to a survey of almost 4,000 academics. One-quarter of them say that they are actively looking for jobs outside their state.\n\n“The fear is across disciplines,” says Matthew Boedy, president of the Georgia Conference of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), which conducted the survey. “No wonder so many are looking for other jobs.” Based in Washington DC, the AAUP advocates for academic freedom and shared governance.\n\nThe Faculty in the South Survey was distributed by e-mail and social media in August to more than 20,000 faculty members across 12 southern states — Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia — as well as to AAUP national members. Of the 3,926 respondents, 51% self-identified as female, 83% identified as white and more than 60% said that they hold tenured positions. (The poll has been run annually since 2022; the 2024 survey received 2,924 responses.)\n\nAround 55% of respondents would not recommend their state as a desirable place to work, and one in four is actively looking for jobs elsewhere. (Of the ten main destination states listed, seven are outside the south: California, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Michigan.) Seventeen per cent say that they’ve had their class content or syllabi questioned by the university administration — one of two new questions this year. The other new question asked whether respondents have had any federal contracts cancelled by the administration of US President Donald Trump; just over 10% said yes.\n\nThe results came out less than a week before the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, a Trump ally, at an event at Utah Valley University in Orem. In the aftermath, educators nationwide have been disciplined or fired over comments in reference to Kirk that their employers deemed inappropriate.\n\n‘Climate of fear’\n\nThe southern United States is relatively conservative politically, and has been for decades. The most cited reason for looking for jobs was the political climate, at 57%, followed by salary (51%) and academic freedom (46%). In 2024, the top justifications were the same but ranked differently: salary (57%), political climate (53%) and academic freedom (50%).\n\nA question about the impact of attacks on higher education garnered more than 2,700 responses. “One of the most repeated themes in the responses was about the climate of fear and anxiety on campus,” Georgia AAUP wrote in a statement.\n\nOne respondent wrote that they were fearful of “ambush videos which take course and class discussions out of context”.\n\nExclusive: a Nature analysis signals the beginnings of a US science brain drain\n\nMelissa McCoul, a senior lecturer of English literature at Texas A&M University in College Station, was fired just days after the AAUP survey was released, after a student posted a viral video on social media objecting to her teaching that there are more than two genders. According to a statement from her attorney, Amanda Reichek, McCoul’s notice of termination “alleges that she was ‘instructed on numerous occasions to change the course content to align with the catalog description and the course description that was originally submitted and approved’ yet failed to do so”. However, she continues, McCoul’s course content “was entirely consistent with the catalog and course description”, and she was never told otherwise. McCoul “has appealed her termination and is exploring further legal action”.\n\nDiAnna Hynds, a neuroscientist at Texas Woman’s University in Denton and one of the survey respondents, feels the weight of political pressure from both the federal and the Texas state government.\n\n“I am discouraged because of the devaluation of my chosen career. I love teaching and training the next generation of scientists and leaders,” says Hynds, who studies the regenerative properties of neurons and their applicability to recovery from spinal-cord and traumatic brain injury.\n\n“But with an increase in hostility and lack of appreciation for the value of generating knowledge, it becomes difficult to maintain motivation,” she says. If things get too dire, she adds, she’d consider retiring earlier than planned.",

When administered to mice, the treatment conferred protection against toxins from 17 African snake species and reduced skin damage caused by venoms.\n\nSnakebites are a neglected public-health issue that is estimated to kill roughly 20,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa every year. Around 300,000 snakebites occur annually in this region, and tissue death from venom leads to approximately 10,000 amputations.\n\nCurrent antivenom treatments are made by injecting large animals, such as horses, with small doses of snake venom. The horses produce antibodies against the venom, and the horse plasma is extracted and used to treat bites in people. But these antivenoms are mostly specific to a single snake species.\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the snake behind the bite, and that makes providing timely treatment difficult, says study co-author Anne Ljungars, a bioengineer at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.\n\nHorse plasma contains a variety of antibodies and other proteins that are recognized as foreign by the human immune system and can thus trigger an adverse immune response in people. Moreover, conventional antivenoms are unable to prevent the local tissue death that snakebites can cause.\n\nCamelid-derived antibodies\n\nTo develop the broad-spectrum antivenom, researchers exposed an alpaca and a llama to venoms from 18 of the most dangerous elapid snake species in sub-Saharan Africa. Elapids are venomous snakes characterized by erect fangs at the front of their mouths, and include cobras, mambas and rinkhals. The team isolated nanobodies — small versions of antibodies that can penetrate tissues and bind to tissue-destroying toxins — from the camelids. Eight of these nanobodies were combined into a single cocktail.\n\nWhen administered to mice that had been injected with snake venom, the recombinant antivenom successfully neutralized venoms from 17 of the 18 target snake species. It also significantly reduced the skin damage caused by venoms, outperforming the widely used Inoserp PAN-AFRICA antivenom.\n\nIt was previously thought that developing a broad-spectrum antivenom would require “an impractically large number of antibodies”, the authors wrote, because the venom of some snake species can contain up to 100 toxins from several protein families.",

But the specimen has several distinct physical features, too.\n\n“Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It’s very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,” says Lindsay Zanno, a palaeontologist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Nanotyrannus also had a shorter tail than did T. rex and sharper, less curved teeth.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature on 30 October1, come from the ‘Duelling Dinosaurs’ fossils — a Triceratops and a small tyrannosaur found tangled in combat in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 2006. The specimens date back to the latest Cretaceous period, around 67 million years ago.\n\nSmall but ferocious\n\nTo determine the Nanotyrannus’s age and growth rate, Zanno and her colleague James Napoli, a palaeontologist at Stony Brook University in New York, studied the growth rings present in a thin slice of one of the fossilized bones. These marks show how bone growth has slowed down and sped up with the seasons, creating layers like a tree trunk’s annual rings. The researchers compared the dinosaur’s growth rate with that of a crocodile, one of its closest living relatives.",

          "title": "PhD training needs a reboot in an AI world",
          "authors": "Alex Sen Gupta",
          "abstract": "Since the release of the chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022, there has been frantic debate at universities about artificial intelligence (AI). These conversations have centred on undergraduate teaching — how to prevent cheating and how to use AI to improve learning. But a quieter, deeper disruption is unfolding in research, the other core activity of universities.\n\nA doctoral education has long been seen as the pinnacle of academic training, an apprenticeship in original thinking, critical analysis and independent enquiry. However, that model is now under pressure. AI is not just another research tool; it is redefining what research is, how it is done and what counts as an original contribution.\n\nHow money, politics and technology are redefining the PhD experience\n\nUniversities are mostly unprepared for the scale of disruption, with few having comprehensive governance strategies. Many academics remain focused on the failings of early generative AI tools, such as hallucinations (confidently stated but false information), inconsistencies and superficial responses. But AI models that were clumsy in 2023 are becoming increasingly fluent and accurate.\n\nAI tools can already draft literature reviews, write sophisticated code with human guidance and even generate hypotheses when provided with data sets. ‘Agentic’ AI systems that can set their own sub-goals, coordinate tasks and learn from feedback represent another leap forwards. If the current trajectory continues, we’re fast approaching a moment when much of the conventional PhD workflow can be completed, or at least be heavily supported, by machines.\n\nUnanswered questions\n\nThis shift poses challenges for educators. What constitutes an original contribution becomes unclear when AI tools produce literature reviews, acquire and analyse data, and draft thesis chapters. Students might need to pivot from executing research tasks to framing questions and interrogating AI outputs.\n\nTo explore what the near future of research training might look like, I conducted a role play simulating a PhD student working with a hypothetical AI assistant. I used Claude, a leading AI system built by the firm Anthropic in San Francisco, California.\n\n‘Science saved my life’ — and it must save other at-risk scholars\n\nI fed the chatbot a detailed prompt (see Supplementary Information) describing a fictional AI research assistant called HALe — inspired by the AI character HAL 9000 from the science-fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey. I gave HALe capabilities that are already under development and are likely to improve in coming years. These include accessing external databases, integrating environmental and biological data, and performing advanced analyses autonomously. I then played the part of the student, asking questions and responding to the chatbot’s replies. The dialogue was generated in a single, unedited session — offering a fictional, yet plausible, glimpse of how future doctoral research could unfold.\n\nThe simulated goal was to complete a PhD project investigating how extreme ocean temperatures affect marine species — an ambitious task involving data synthesis, statistical modelling and writing a paper for publication. In this fictional scenario, HALe didn’t merely assist; it took initiative. It searched and extracted data from scientific literature, identified knowledge gaps, harmonized environmental and biological data sets, ran complex statistical analyses, interpreted the results, drafted a manuscript, suggested peer reviewers and even created an open-access data repository. The entire process, which would realistically take a student several months, played out in a short sequence of guided exchanges that might occupy just a few hours.\n\nWhat we stand to lose when foreign students are seen as a threat\n\nAlthough today’s AI models cannot yet perform these tasks with anything approaching full autonomy, the simulation was grounded in what current systems can already do with human guidance. For example, ChatGPT, Claude and other state-of the-art chatbots can draft credible literature reviews, propose hypotheses, suggest analytical approaches and generate code that — when reviewed and validated by a human — can process real data sets and produce meaningful outputs. They can even help to interpret statistical results and visualize findings. What struck me, while conducting this exercise, was how much of the conventional PhD process could now be driven and accelerated by AI. At times, it felt like working with a hyper-competent and astonishingly rapid research assistant. It was both exciting and unsettling.\n\nOf course, this simulation reflects a particular kind of project — analytical, data-rich and computational in nature. Experimental or field-based PhD programmes, especially those that require collecting samples, laboratory work or interacting with other people or with the natural world, will remain less susceptible to full automation. But even in these areas of science, AI is likely to play a growing part in experimental design, autonomous data collection, literature synthesis and post-experiment analysis.\n\nNew skills\n\nThis experience brought home how training in academic skills will need to be fundamentally reconsidered in an era of AI.",

          "authors": "Amber Dance",
          "abstract": "When Robert Hooke gazed through his microscope at a slice of cork and coined the term ‘cell’ in 1665, he was really looking at just the walls of the dead cells. The squishy contents typically found within would become objects of ongoing study. But for many plant scientists, the walls themselves faded into the background. They were considered passive containers for the exciting biology inside.\n\n“For a long time, the cell wall was really thought to be dead,” says Alice Cheung, a plant molecular biologist and biochemist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. It wasn’t until the late twentieth century, Cheung says, that scientists began to reveal the cell wall for the vibrant, ever-changing structure it is. Even then, its complex mix of sugar molecules linked into long, branching polysaccharides kept away all but the most intrepid biochemists.\n\nCentury-old genetics mystery of Mendel’s peas finally solved\n\nBut now, with the help of modern molecular methods to analyse the wall’s make-up and assembly, researchers are starting to uncover more. They’re finding that the cell wall is an active, even chatty participant in cellular growth, reproduction and responses to infection. It’s constantly receiving and sending signals about its shape and composition. By eavesdropping on those signals, and tweaking or adding to them, scientists are exploring innovative ways to improve agriculture with cell-wall science: protecting crops from disease and engineering new plants or sturdy hybrids.\n\n“The plant cell wall is one of the most sophisticated systems in terms of communication,” says Li-Jia Qu, a plant biologist at Peking University in Beijing. His long-term goal is to use what’s been learnt about those messages to interbreed distantly related plants, creating exciting crops that could expand agriculture into new lands.\n\nThese walls can talk\n\nThe wall is the plant’s interface with its environment, including salt and other stressors or disease agents such as moulds, so it must notice damage and adapt accordingly.\n\nThe cell walls of a growing plant are constructed mainly from polysaccharides, including stiff cables of cellulose and jellified strands of pectin. The latter are highly complex molecules, branched in diverse ways and decorated with various extras such as methyl groups. “It’s like a giant bowl of many types of pasta, all mixed together,” says Charles Anderson, a plant cell biologist at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in State College.\n\nAnd although the wall protects the contents within, some pathogens use enzymes to drill through it and infect the cells. This creates polysaccharide fragments that signal to the cell that something has breached the wall. When the cell senses these pieces, along with fragments of the infecting pathogen’s cell wall, it activates genes in the plant’s immune pathways. In response, the plant can produce an extra polysaccharide, called callose, which reinforces the cell wall. It also manufactures defensive molecules such as antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species.\n\nSuch signals are already being co-opted by farmers. By spraying molecules derived from the cell walls of algae or fungi over their fields, they can prime the plants for pathogens that might arrive later. By doing this, they activate the immune response “and let the natural mechanism of the plant fight the infection”, says Antonio Molina, a plant biologist at the Technical University of Madrid. The method could help growers to avoid harsh fungicides, he says.\n\nMolina has co-founded two companies that make use of this technique, making extracts from fungi or plants as crop protectives.\n\nThe puzzle-piece shape of these Arabidopsis thaliana pavement cells is created in part through signalling from the cell wall. Credit: Raymond Wightman/Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge and Alexis Peaucelle/INRAE\n\nThe current inoculants are fairly crude mixtures derived from plants or pathogens, says Cyril Zipfel, a plant immunologist at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. He’s working to understand the signalling that underlies the immune pathway, which should enable scientists to create more specific, or even synthetic, treatments.\n\nThere are trade-offs, however, Molina says. For one, the effects last for only three or four weeks. Reapplication for slow-growing crops could get costly, but Molina thinks that farmers might be able to focus the use of inoculants to times when risk of infection is high, such as after it rains, to prevent mildew.\n\nAnother challenge is that whenever plants devote resources to boosting their defences, this takes materials and energy away from growth, so farmers must apply the treatments judiciously.\n\nPowered by pectin\n\nPlant growth itself demonstrates how the idea of a cell wall as a static shell is insufficient. Yes, the cell does need the wall as a physical container; otherwise, it would burst from the enormous water pressure inside it. But for plant cells to grow, the cell walls must expand first, says Sebastian Wolf, a plant molecular biologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany.\n\nThis is where pectin comes in. Pectin is a complicated molecule constructed from at least a dozen sugars, connected by more than 20 types of linkage, says Wolf. “It’s actually so complex that we don’t know what it looks like,” he adds. Pectin is also dynamic, undergoing frequent modifications. Depending on those modifications, it can be rigid, supporting a sturdy plant, or softer when the plant needs to grow. That’s why pectin is often used to make marmalade: the initially soft pectin molecules cross-link and soak up water, taking on a stiffer, gelatinous consistency.\n\nHow CRISPR could yield the next blockbuster crop\n\nIn the growing plant, there’s one key modification that makes pectin soft or rigid: methyl groups attached to its component sugars. When the wall needs more materials for growth or reinforcement, the cell inside manufactures a methyl-decorated form that is thought to be fairly soluble, so it can be secreted into the surrounding wall. Once the pectin is incorporated into the wall, it starts to firm up. This happens when enzymes remove the methyls, uncovering negatively charged atoms in the sugar molecules underneath. Calcium ions in the wall bind to two sugars at a time and cross-link the pectin into a stiffer material that can absorb water.\n\nAs a graduate student at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in the early 2000s, Wolf was interested in the effects of methyl groups on pectin, so he made a mutant of the cress Arabidopsis thaliana, a favourite of plant geneticists, that was unable to take off the methyl groups. He expected this to soften the cell walls, but the plants came out weirder than anticipated, with long, wavy roots1. They reminded him of mutants with defects in cellular signalling involving cellulose, leading him to wonder whether pectin, too, had a role not just in cell-wall structure, but also in cellular conversations.\n\nContinuing this research at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment in Versailles, Wolf discovered a cell-wall signal that contributes to plant growth controls1,2. The input that Wolf found starts when cell-surface receptors notice an overabundance of methyl-decorated pectin. What seems to happen in response is that they tell the cell to adjust its production pipelines, making more of the methyl--removing enzyme so that the wall can firm up the pectin.\n\nCell-wall signalling can even help growing cells to adopt fancy forms, including the puzzle-piece shapes seen in what are known as pavement cells — interlocking surface cells that give strength and structure to plant leaves (see ‘Cell walls fitting together’). When Anderson and his colleagues studied the signals sent by the cell wall as pavement cells developed in A. thaliana, they found evidence for another conversation initiated by methyl-free pectin and a receptor, called FERONIA, that senses this form of pectin3. But cellulose matters here, too. Both cell-wall components are needed to strengthen the indented portions of the puzzle piece, known as the ‘necks’. Without that fortification, the rest of the cell bulges into that space. If FERONIA isn’t present, the indentations don’t go as deep as they normally would.\n\nHere’s how they think the indentation process happens in a healthy leaf cell: methyl-free pectin in the cell wall is a sign that there’s enough pectin to support a neck. This pectin sticks to a receptor complex on the cell surface that includes FERONIA. In response, the cell starts manufacturing cellulose in the same place. Together, the cellulose and pectin strengthen the wall so that it can support the indentation.\n\nWolf is continuing to investigate the role of the cell wall in shaping cells, and reported in a preprint earlier this year that plant stem cells must control the methyl status of wall pectin to maintain their stemness and form new plant parts4. He thinks that there is potential to use these signalling pathways to influence the way in which plants are shaped. “You can fundamentally change how plants grow and how they look,” he speculates. For example, when plants make less cellulose, they grow into “stubby” forms. But, he cautions, researchers need to learn more about the underlying growth pathways first.\n\nHybrid potential\n\nThe FERONIA receptor in those puzzle-piece cells has turned out to be a key player in cell-wall signalling. FERONIA is found all over plants, and interacts with a range of partners to influence not just leaf-cell shape, but also a variety of other systems, from root growth to environmental-stress responses. Given that FERONIA binds to pectin to maintain the wall’s integrity, without it, the wall becomes weak and porous. Remarkably, mutants lacking FERONIA survive, although they’re pretty unhealthy, Qu says: they sprout wrinkled, curly leaves, and straggle along the ground because they lack the vasculature to hold them upright. They are “very small, tiny”, says Qu. They can make seeds, he adds, “but very few”.",

          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "At the US Environmental Protection Agency, scientists say proposed cuts will gut research. Credit: Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nFor 30 years, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has conducted controlled air-pollution studies at a state-of-the-art facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The facility is equipped to test numerous airborne pollutants, including ozone, diesel, wildfire smoke and chlorine. Data collected in its chambers have been pivotal to establishing stricter air-quality standards for deadly pollutants, and have been instrumental in protecting the health of people in the United States.\n\nHowever, in February, shortly after US President Donald Trump took office, the EPA — which is charged with protecting the nation’s environment and its people’s health — notified the university that it would not be renewing its lease. By May, research had ceased. “There are no other places with the capability of doing these studies on the wide range of pollutants that the Chapel Hill facility does,” says Robert Devlin, a former EPA researcher who worked at the facility until recently. In August, after almost 40 years at the agency, Devlin retired when his appointment was not renewed.\n\nHow your research can survive a US federal grant termination\n\nThe exposure laboratory was under the purview of the EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD), which pursued a broad swathe of independent research into air and water quality, toxicology, homeland security and waste management. It has been hit particularly hard by cuts the Trump administration has made to federal agency science. Internal documents suggest that lay-offs and voluntary early-retirement programmes have already reduced ORD’s 1,600-person staff by one-third.\n\nThe remnants of ORD are expected to be folded into a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions (OASES) that reports directly to the EPA administrator, a presidential appointee. The reorganization has spooked agency scientists, who fear that research priorities might end up being set according to a political agenda. “One value that the EPA’s ORD provided was independent scientific review of proposed regulatory actions,” says former EPA toxicologist George Woodall, who retired in September after receiving a termination notice.\n\nIn addition to cuts at the EPA, the administration has already cut or proposed cutting more than US$50 billion in research funding across the nation’s science agencies, with research on climate, ecosystems, renewable energy and health disparities particularly affected. Although the administration characterizes the cuts and reorganizations of federal research programmes as realigning them with the president’s priorities, critics say the aim is to remove environmental and health protections and other regulatory safeguards. The cuts to EPA staffing are “the biggest blow that agency has ever had”, says Christopher Sellers at Stony Brook University in New York, who interviews EPA scientists for the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, a watchdog group for US federal environmental data.\n\n“It’s not just EPA. Science is being destroyed across many agencies,” says a senior ORD official who was put on administrative leave in June. It remains to be seen whether Congress will pass Trump’s proposed budget request for 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, a US government shutdown has been in place since 1 October, after lawmakers failed to agree on a funding bill for the current fiscal year. As Nature went to press, the shutdown had stretched into its fifth week, with no end in sight. Some 4,000 federal agency workers have been laid off since it began, with plans to reach around 10,000, according to the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDemonstrators protest against US President Donald Trump’s plans to slash NASA’s budget.Credit: Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nAt the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1,300 employees, including many investigating disease outbreaks and collecting data on infectious diseases, were fired on 10 October; roughly half of those were subsequently rehired. Agency watchdogs are concerned that cuts to CDC staff have paved the way for efforts to spread misinformation. On 22 September, the secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and Trump made a series of controversial claims about autism, most notably that use of the painkiller acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) during pregnancy is a suspected cause — a claim that global public-health bodies say is not backed up by scientific evidence.\n\nAs agencies lose scientific expertise and evidence-based guidance, the knock-on effects will be widespread and costly — to the economy, the environment, public health and the broader research enterprise. Agency scientists say the cuts will compromise a swathe of resources and initiatives, including hurricane forecasting, air-quality improvements, public protections against chemical exposure and efforts to monitor endangered species — science that falls under the government’s purview to protect citizens and the environment.\n\nNon-government entities and academic scientists typically cannot conduct coordinated research at the scale needed to inform US policy. Scientific agencies’ institutional knowledge will take years, if not decades, to replace, current and former federal scientists say. And early-career researchers fear that the cuts to federal agency science and funding will hurt their long-term career prospects.\n\nNature spoke to 19 current and former federal agency scientists, covering the EPA, the CDC, NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to find out what agency-directed research has been lost and what that will mean for the United States. Many of those currently employed by these agencies requested anonymity for fear of retribution. Nature contacted all six agencies for comment, but the CDC, NOAA, NIH and USGS did not respond.\n\nEnvironmental monitoring at risk\n\nBeyond air and water pollution, the EPA oversees tests to determine whether new chemicals — more than 2,000 of which enter commercial use each year — are hazardous to human health. EPA scientists expect that the Integrated Risk Information System, an EPA database of chemical data and risks, will be dismantled — a move industry groups have long been pushing for. This would “put the agency in a reactive rather than proactive mode” when it comes to chemical safety, says Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, a former ORD principal deputy assistant administrator for science.\n\nOn top of that, research on pressing environmental concerns has come to a standstill. At the EPA, a series of strategic planning meetings intended to map out future research priorities have not taken place. “We were really humming along,” says the senior ORD official, noting that the office was making progress on prioritizing research on PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, and microplastics. Determining how these pollutants get into the environment “would require the kind of research only EPA can do”, they add.\n\nWhen Nature asked the EPA for a response to the numerous criticisms about cuts to research programmes, a spokesperson pointed to the creation of OASES, “which will allow EPA to prioritize research and gold-standard science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rule-makings and technical assistance to states”.\n\nScientists at NASA also worry that crucial efforts to track the health of the planet (and its inhabitants) will not continue — among them, efforts to monitor greenhouse-gas emissions. “One of the first things I worry about is environmental monitoring,” says Jack Kaye, a former associate director for research at the Earth Science Division of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, which is based in Washington DC. Field campaigns to track air pollutants, for example, require dozens of sophisticated instruments to monitor chemicals and meteorological conditions synchronously on land, in the air and from space, often for weeks at a time and with the involvement of multiple, sometimes international, partners, says Kaye.\n\nJack Kaye says budget cuts are ‘devastating’.Credit: Yaitza Luna-Cruz\n\nTrump’s 2026 budget proposal — a spending blueprint currently in legislative limbo owing to the government shutdown — cuts dozens of active and planned NASA missions. One casualty is the pair of Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellites, which are key to tracking global carbon dioxide emissions, spotting early signs of drought and monitoring plant health. When asked about how this might compromise NASA’s ability to monitor the environment, a NASA spokesperson pointed to the president’s budget request, which says the satellites are not aligned with Trump’s priorities and are “climate missions beyond their prime mission”.\n\nNOAA has a similar global remit, investigating the complex relationship between the oceans and atmosphere. Investigating climate change has become a key research area, says Craig McLean, a former NOAA assistant administrator for research, who is based in Silver Spring, Maryland. In an effort to understand how the oceans shape the climate, he says, “We built satellites, ships, drifters, floats, gliders, models and other expertise.” But the Trump administration’s budget proposes axing the entire budget for NOAA’s office of oceanic and atmospheric research, a move Kaye calls “devastating” for the nation’s climate research.\n\n‘We were ready for this’: meet the scientists suing the Trump administration to reinstate terminated grants\n\nThe administration also proposed closing NOAA’s 10 research labs and 16 cooperative institutes, which focus on different research areas. One, the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), based in Miami, Florida, models hurricanes using observations from ‘hurricane hunter’ flights, drones and gliders, says Robert Atlas, a former director of AOML. “Flying through a hurricane? I don’t see anyone else doing that,” adds McLean.\n\nOn the basis of previous calculations, the loss of those observations would translate to a 20–40% decrease in hurricane forecast accuracy, which would result in not only increased economic losses — of $5 billion for each major hurricane striking the country — but also increased loss of life, says Atlas. These cuts seem to have been a bridge too far; the House of Representatives and the Senate have pressed forward with legislation to protect NOAA’s research labs and cooperative institutes.\n\nBut not every agency has received congressional protection. At the USGS, the Ecosystems Mission Area, which monitors the health of species, communities and ecosystems, has been targeted for closure. The president’s 2026 budget request eliminated almost $300 million in funding for this area, which is responsible for studying invasive species, ecosystem restoration, wildlife disease and biodiversity, among other things.\n\nThe USGS “does science to help preserve natural resources and public lands for the nation”, says an anonymous USGS researcher. “We’re not doing science for science’s sake; it’s about ensuring these resources are there for the next generation.” For example, the USGS conducts two major bird monitoring efforts, which both collect population data on hundreds of species, to inform conservation efforts and hunting regulations. “Academia isn’t going to run a bird survey,” says Sam Droege, a wildlife biologist who works at the USGS Bee Lab in Laurel, Maryland. “You don’t get tenure doing that.”\n\nScientists across several agencies are raising the alarm about the administration’s push to shut down a wealth of climate-based research. One of the worst transgressions, say researchers, is Trump’s attempt to overturn a 2009 EPA finding that CO2 and other greenhouse gases harm human health. This legal finding, called the endangerment finding, authorizes the EPA to regulate these gases as part of the 1963 Clean Air Act, which empowers the agency to establish and enforce air-quality standards.\n\n“Now they are starting to proffer misinformation and putting a government seal on it,” says McLean. Agency scientists say that this, along with the decision to halt nearly all national climate-change research, will result in the country being unable to adapt to climate extremes, which will bring huge losses in food production and, ultimately, greater loss of human lives during natural disasters.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, an EPA spokesperson wrote that the EPA’s proposal to rescind the endangerment finding is legal in nature and that “the agency considered a variety of sources and information in assessing whether the predictions made, and assumptions used, in the 2009 Endangerment Finding are accurate and consistent with the limits on EPA’s authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act”.\n\nReclaiming the narrative",

They discovered an intermediate compound — called premethylenomycin C lactone — whose antimicrobial activity was 100 times stronger than that of the final product. Tiny doses killed strains of bacteria known to cause hard-to-treat infections.\n\nFive ways science is tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis\n\nThe discovery was a ‘surprise’, says study co-author Gregory Challis, a chemical biologist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK. “As humans, we anticipate that evolution perfects the end product, and so you’d expect the final molecule to be the best antibiotic, and the intermediates to be less potent,” he says. But the finding “is a great example of what a ‘blind watchmaker’ evolution is. And it’s a good way of exemplifying it in a very molecular way,” adds Challis.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance is a growing threat, projected to cause 39 million deaths worldwide over the next 25 years. Researchers say that the discovery of a potent antimicrobial compound might lead to fresh drugs to tackle the problem.\n\nThe work underscores “the potential of such studies to identify new bioactive chemical scaffolds from ‘old’ pathways”, says Gerard Wright, a biochemist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.\n\nAccidental discovery\n\nIn 2006, Challis and his colleagues began studying the molecular pathway through which S. coelicolor produces methylenomycin A. To do this, they deleted the genes encoding enzymes involved in each step, one by one. Their work built on earlier efforts in 2002 to sequence the bacterium’s genome4.\n\nNew antibiotic that kills drug-resistant bacteria discovered in technician’s garden\n\nBy 2010, the team had mapped the mechanism that the bacterium used to make methylenomycin A and identified several intermediate molecules that it produced along the way.\n\n“We were just doing very fundamental blue-sky research,” says Challis. “We discovered these intermediates, and we left them for a while because we didn’t quite know what to do with them.”\n\nIt was several years later — around 2017 — that a PhD student in Challis’s laboratory tested these intermediates for antimicrobial activity.\n\nThese tests revealed that two molecules, including premethylenomycin C lactone, were much more effective than methylenomycin A at targeting seven strains of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, which infects skin, blood and internal organs, and Enterococcus faecium, which can cause deadly bloodstream and urinary infections.\n\nThe lowest concentration of premethylenomycin C lactone needed to kill drug-resistant strains of S. aureus was just 1 microgram per millilitre, compared with 256 micrograms per millilitre of methylenomycin A. The compound could also kill bacteria at much smaller doses than those needed for vancomycin, a ‘last line’ antibiotic used to treat infections caused by two E. faecium strains, to be effective.",

Credit: NOAA/Getty\n\nAs Hurricane Melissa exploded into a category-5 storm over the weekend, scientists forecast its trajectory and growth with a powerful new tool — helping to inform warnings to Jamaica and other nations that the storm has devasted. That tool, an artificial intelligence (AI) forecast model developed by Google DeepMind, is successfully predicting how Melissa and other dangerous storms arise and evolve.\n\nThe model is being used this year by the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), a leading source of hurricane information in the region, in real time for the first time. It is a machine-learning tool specific to hurricanes and a step beyond earlier models developed by London-based Google DeepMind that can forecast weather conditions quickly and accurately.\n\n“I’m not sure I’ve seen such good results from a new model so fast,” says James Franklin, a retired atmospheric scientist who was formerly the branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the NHC in Miami, Florida.\n\nCompared with other hurricane models used by the NHC, the DeepMind model is “definitely toward the front of the pack if not at the front of the pack”, says Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. “It’s pretty impressive.”\n\nA brewing storm\n\nDeepMind’s developers trained the model on two data sets: a large database of global weather observations and a smaller database of observations that included nearly 5,000 cyclones from the past 45 years1. Adding that second, cyclone-specific database might be the reason that the DeepMind model performs better on hurricane forecasts than do other AI-based forecast models, Franklin says. In particular, scientists have long struggled to improve their forecasts of a storm’s intensity — but the DeepMind model seems to capture this well.\n\nDeepMind AI weather forecaster beats world-class system\n\nAs early as 21 October — long before it was obvious that Melissa would be a monster storm — the model predicted a 50–60% chance that it would reach category 5, the DeepMind team says. On 23 October the model estimated that the storm had an 80% or higher chance of reaching this most powerful category. The following day, NHC forecasters cited the DeepMind model as they reported “a distinct possibility that Melissa could become a Category 5 hurricane”.\n\nStill, the DeepMind team cautions against reading too much into the predictions of a single storm: “We are happy to have been able to contribute useful guidance to NHC, but we caution against representing the model’s capabilities based on a single case or metric,” says Ferran Alet, a research scientist at DeepMind.\n\nThe NHC began using the DeepMind model at the start of the Atlantic hurricane season in June. For the 13 named storms that have formed so far, the DeepMind model has generally performed well in predicting both their tracks and intensities, McNoldy says. “To have something that just came out in June already be something we’re talking about as being front of the pack — that’s extraordinary,” he says.\n\nCurtailed flights\n\nThe NHC continues to operate even though the US government is shut down. Most federal employees — including those flying into the storm on ‘hurricane hunter’ aircraft to gather measurements — are not being paid.",

          "abstract": "Entrepreneur Cathy Tie’s company Manhattan Genomics will work on methods to edit the genomes of human embryos. Credit: Caitlyn Gaurano\n\nCathy Tie left university to found her first biotechnology company at the age of 18. In the 11 years since, she has launched several more. Her first company helped genetic-testing firms to interpret their results; her second provides digital health-care services.\n\nHer latest venture, which announced some of its first key hires on 30 October, veers out of the mainstream. Tie, who has called herself Biotech Barbie, sometimes refers to her latest company as the Manhattan Project — the name used for the US effort to develop an atomic bomb in the 1940s — and now focuses her entrepreneurial ambitions on a controversial goal: altering the genome of human embryos to prevent genetic disorders.\n\nWhy CRISPR babies are still too risky — embryo studies highlight challenges\n\n“We have a duty to patients with incurable, debilitating diseases,” says Tie. “A majority of Americans are in support of this technology.”\n\nPlenty of scientists, however, are worried. Manhattan Genomics, the official name of her latest company, based in New York City was launched this summer. Tie co-founded the firm with Eriona Hysolli, former head of biological sciences at Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas, Texas firm focused on de-extincting species. Another company called Preventive in South San Francisco, California, announced on 30 October that it also intends to explore gene editing in human embryos.\n\nSo far, neither company has revealed the details of its scientific plans, such as which diseases it will target, and which techniques it will use. Tie says Manhattan Genomics will conduct extensive research and safety testing before attempting to create gene-edited babies. Among the new consultants announced last week are a bioethicist and two scientists with expertise in non-human primate reproductive biology — skills that would be needed for testing the safety of embryo editing.\n\nEven so, some researchers say it is much too early to consider commercializing gene-editing technologies for human embryos — a process that carries added safety risks and ethical quandaries compared with the gene-editing therapies that are currently on the market to treat blood conditions in children and adults.\n\n“The bar for safety is so, so, so, so high,” says Alexis Komor, a biochemist at the University of California San Diego, who studies gene-editing technologies. “We’re definitely not there yet.”\n\nCRISPR therapies\n\nFor years, the gene-editing field has laboured in the shadow of He Jiankui, a Chinese biophysicist who, in 2018, announced that he had edited human embryos to bolster the resulting children’s resistance to HIV. Those embryos were implanted into the mother, and two gene-edited girls were born. He was then sentenced to three years in prison for “illegal medical practice”. (Tie and He had a personal relationship earlier this year, but Tie says the two have since parted and that He is not involved in Manhattan Genomics.)\n\nScientists largely condemned his work, with many calling for a moratorium on all clinical uses of heritable gene editing in humans. Some countries have restrictions on such research. In the United States, for example, federal funds cannot be used for gene-editing studies in human embryos, and the US Food and Drug Administration cannot approve clinical use of genetically manipulated embryos.\n\nAmid this turmoil, gene editing in non-reproductive cells has raced ahead. The world’s first approved gene-editing therapy uses the DNA-snipping system called CRISPR–Cas9 to edit DNA in blood stem cells. The therapy, which was approved in 2023, treats two genetic blood disorders. Earlier this year, a related method called base editing was used to edit DNA of liver cells in a bespoke treatment for an infant with a metabolic disorder.\n\nSide effects\n\nBut editing non-reproductive cells is different, ethically and scientifically, from editing embryos, says Junjiu Huang, a biologist who studies reproductive development at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China. Gene-editing tools might behave differently in an embryo than in non-reproductive cells. Editing an embryo also means that genetic changes will be passed down to the next generation, with consequences that are difficult to predict.\n\nUnwanted DNA changes — a possibility with any gene-editing technology — could have more catastrophic effects in the embryo than in a single organ, because they can affect every cell in the body during crucial stages in development, says Komor. And a vanishingly small number of people would need to edit genes in their embryos, she says, given that many can already use genetic tests to screen embryos for disease-causing mutations.\n\nTie and Hysolli note that methods used to edit genes have evolved considerably since He’s experiments. Newer techniques, such as base editing and another approach called prime editing, offer improved precision compared with conventional CRISPR–Cas9 editing. Neither of these techniques require breaking both strands of DNA, a necessity for the original CRISPR gene-editing method and a step that can cause drastic chromosomal changes in embryos. “A lot of new advances have happened in the gene-editing space to make it safer and more accurate,” says Tie.\n\nEriona Hysolli, who co-founded Manhattan Genomics, is a veteran of de-extinction company Mammoth Biosciences.Credit: Caitlyn Gaurano\n\nBut researchers are still learning the full gamut of unwanted genetic changes that base editing can cause, says Komor. Even less is known about newer methods such as prime editing, she adds.\n\nIn 2015, Huang and his colleagues were the first to gene edit human embryos1. (The embryos were not implanted in a mother.) Since then, he has continued to work with embryos using base editing, and says the technique holds promise, but is not ready for the clinic. Hysolli agrees that the methods need to be studied further, particularly in embryos. The approach that Manhattan Genomics eventually chooses will be dictated at least in part by the diseases it decides to focus on first, she says.\n\nHuang describes the timing of Manhattan Genomics’ launch as “inappropriate”. The technology is not yet mature, he says, nor are the ethics, social consensus and legal framework for the technology’s use.",

          "abstract": "Francis Crick served in the British Admiralty and conducted research into naval mines.Credit: GL Archive/Alamy\n\nCrick: A Mind in Motion — from DNA to the Brain Matthew Cobb Profile Books (2025)\n\nFrancis Crick has gone down in history as half of a double act with James Watson — a duo perhaps almost as iconic as the double-helix structure of DNA that they proposed. The pair were immortalized in Watson’s sensational 1968 book, The Double Helix, with Crick painted as garrulous and cerebral and Watson as gauche but driven. Watson had initially described his first draft as a novel, yet other published accounts of the discovery and the personalities involved have stuck closely to the script ever since.\n\nIn a magisterial new biography, Crick, zoologist and historian Matthew Cobb revisits the double-helix breakthrough, a discovery he discussed in forensic detail in his book Life’s Greatest Secret (2015). Yet, this time, the publication of the structure and the immediate aftermath of the discovery occupy just 41 pages. Instead, Cobb explores how Crick’s thinking, writing and interactions with others transcended that brilliant, yet contested, episode, revolutionizing molecular biology and influencing evolutionary and developmental biology, visual neuroscience and ideas about consciousness.\n\nA new vision for how evolution works is long overdue\n\nAt the same time, he makes a more sustained attempt than either of Crick’s previous biographers (Matt Ridley and Robert Olby) to answer several questions. Who was Crick? What kind of person was he? What did he care about?\n\nCrick was notoriously reluctant to divulge personal information or even have his photograph taken. Combing through a remarkably comprehensive set of personal and professional archives with meticulous attention to detail, Cobb has reconstructed Crick’s relationships with those who were essential crew mates on his intellectual odyssey.\n\nCrick was born in 1916 in Northampton, a market town in the English Midlands, and grew up in a comfortable but not notably intellectual home. From an early age he had a burning desire to know why things were the way they were, a curiosity he satisfied by burying himself in the family copies of Arthur Mee’s eight-volume The Children’s Encyclopedia (1910). He did well enough at school to go to University College London to study physics, where he later began a PhD on the viscosity of water — “the dullest problem imaginable”, as Crick later said.\n\nRichard Dawkins book of the dead is haunted by ghosts of past works\n\nAs Cobb explains, Crick’s future was transformed by his experiences during the Second World War. His PhD studies were interrupted when he was called up to serve in the British Admiralty, conducting research into naval mines — real-time problem-solving that suited his restless nature. In the Mine Design Department cafeteria he met Georg Kreisel, an Austrian refugee philosopher who had just graduated from the University of Cambridge, UK. Kreisel’s conversation and voluminous correspondence challenged Crick to sharpen his thinking and delighted him with their obscenities. Cobb makes the salacious letters part of the lifelong soundtrack to Crick’s intellectual endeavours.\n\nAlso working at the Admiralty was the “vivacious, talented and tolerant” artist Odile Speed. She became Crick’s second wife in 1949; their partnership was one of mutual devotion that allowed for his numerous affairs. Odile helped to develop his interest in art and literature, ran their households, hosted exuberant parties and raised their children. In short, she provided an environment in which Crick had the luxury of devoting all of his energy to his intellectual life.\n\nDeciphering DNA’s code\n\nIn the late 1940s, disillusioned with physics and inspired by physicist Erwin Schrödinger’s 1944 book What is Life?, Crick decided that the nature of life was the only question worth pursuing, other than the neural basis of consciousness. He began a new PhD project in structural biology at the Medical Research Council’s Unit for Research on the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems — later known as the Laboratory of Molecular Biology — in Cambridge, UK, where he worked for almost 30 years. Under the genial chairmanship of molecular biologist Max Perutz, Crick never had to teach or grapple with university administration: he applied for a grant only once in his life. He had the grace to admit that luck had played a part in his success, but to some extent he made his own luck.\n\nCobb presents the double-helix story as much more of a collaboration with chemist Rosalind Franklin and biophysicist Maurice Wilkins at King’s College London than Crick and Watson acknowledged in their iconic 1953 paper (J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick Nature 171, 737–738; 1953). He exonerates Crick and Watson of theft, but not of bad manners. “They should have requested permission to use the data,” Cobb writes. “They did not.”\n\nJames Watson and Francis Crick co-discovered the structure of DNA.Credit: SSPL/Getty\n\nThe double-helix structure provided a springboard to understanding how information is transferred between DNA and the proteins it encodes. In Crick’s PhD thesis, he had called this the ‘central problem’ of biology. He tackled the issue with geneticist Sydney Brenner. Between them, they conceived the existence of messenger RNA, showed that the sequence of bases in mRNA acts as a code that dictates each protein’s amino-acid sequence and found that three bases encoded each amino acid (F. H. C. Crick et al. Nature 192, 1227–1232; 1961).\n\nIt’s time to admit that genes are not the blueprint for life",

          "abstract": "Paul Scharre says technological advancement is likely to lead to wider use of autonomous weapons.Credit: Greta Lorenz\n\n“Latest: 8,300 students killed. 12 universities hit,” reads a news ticker at the bottom of the screen. “Authorities are still struggling to make sense of an attack on university campuses worldwide, which targeted some students and not others,” the newsreader says.\n\nNature Spotlight: Robotics\n\nThis scene is from Slaughterbots, a short, fictional film made by the Future of Life Institute, a California-based group that has called for a ban on autonomous weapons enabled by artificial intelligence. In the story, an executive at an arms company proudly pitches swarms of tiny drones that use facial recognition to spot and execute its customers’ enemies in a crowd. Spoiler alert: things don’t end well for student activists targeted by the weapons system because of their online political profiles.\n\nAt the time of the film’s 2017 release, Paul Scharre, a former special-operations infantry soldier and executive vice-president of the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington DC, said that although a Slaughterbots-style scenario was technologically feasible, there were defensive measures against the type of attack portrayed.\n\nScharre, who has helped to draft US government policies on autonomous weapons and published a book on the topic in 2019, fears that humanity is at risk of an arms race that could lead to unreliable, hard-to-control machines with the power to decide when and whom to kill. Nature spoke to Scharre about how technology is enabling these new weapons systems.\n\nHow do you define autonomous weapons systems, and how widely used are they?\n\nThere is no internationally agreed definition of autonomous weapons, which can complicate discussions about them. I define them as weapons that, once launched by humans, can search for, find and attack targets on their own. Since the 1980s, many countries have acquired air-defence systems that can automatically track and shoot down incoming threats, for example.\n\nWhen people debate autonomous weapons today, however, they are generally referring to those used in offensive combat. An Israeli drone system called Harpy hunts targets that emit radar signals, such as ground-based air defences designed to detect incoming aircraft and missiles. Such offensive systems are designed to be used in specific scenarios, and I’m not aware that they have been used widely in combat.\n\nHumans are still generally making the final decisions about targets, but the pace of technological development means I can certainly see a world in which offensive weapons systems with greater autonomy become widely used.\n\nCan you give an example of a cutting-edge system in use today?\n\nUkraine has been experimenting with autonomous terminal-guidance systems, also called the autonomous last-mile solution. In this kind of system, human operators navigate a drone towards a moving vehicle or a person, for example, and once it has locked on, even if the communications link to the operator is severed, the drone can continue to track and then strike the target on its own. Although a human is still choosing the target, these systems are a potential stepping stone towards weapons with greater autonomy.\n\nHow do you see the future development of these systems?\n\nAs well as terminal-guidance systems, we have also seen drones equipped with machine learning being used to identify targets in Ukraine. It is not a huge leap to see these two technologies being combined to enable systems to hunt for and attack targets without human involvement.\n\nCountries are investing in ways to counter the increased use of drones, such as jamming their communications. If drones can operate autonomously, then jamming isn’t such a big problem. So I think we’re going to see more and more autonomy in warfare.\n\nOne vision of the future is that autonomous weapons systems are given the authority to strike targets within kill zones, or ranges of space and time, on the basis of certain criteria.",

          "authors": "Maria Ivanova",
          "abstract": "When the United Nations negotiations on plastic pollution in Geneva, Switzerland, collapsed in August, observers declared the outcome an abject failure and the process broken. Earlier this month, reports that the chair of the talks, ambassador Luis Vayas Valdivieso, would step down deepened uncertainty.\n\nTrust and science: the essential elements missing from plastics treaty talks\n\nMany media outlets saw a failure of multilateralism, but what I saw was fatigue. Just as the ‘failed’ 2009 Copenhagen climate summit paved the way for the 2015 Paris agreement, this plastics-treaty breakdown could be an inflection point — if we learn the right lessons and rethink the process.\n\nAs a researcher of global environmental governance, I have followed the negotiations from the start. I served as an adviser on Rwanda’s delegation in 2022, when it co-sponsored the UN Environment Assembly resolution to end plastic pollution. Since 2023, I have led the observer delegation of Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. During this time, I have watched nations debate the treaty’s scope, restating positions with little progress. But individuals from every country tried to keep faith in the process.\n\nThe negotiations have stalled partly because a false morality play of ambition versus obstruction took hold. Over the years, I have witnessed how this ‘heroes versus villains’ narrative has obscured the complex realities at stake.\n\nBut the story is never that simple. From the outset, nations disagreed on what ending plastic pollution meant. For some, it was about improving waste management, recycling systems and circular economies. For others, it meant curbing the manufacture of primary polymers. That ambiguity set into a geopolitical divide. For some nations, plastics manufacturing underlies economic survival and political stability. For small island states and vulnerable coastal areas, plastic pollution threatens human survival. Yet every country must protect its ecosystems.\n\nEnvironmental treaties are paralysed — here’s how we can do better\n\nDespite clear science and mounting public pressure, negotiations became mired in the politics of survival — between nations concerned about the economic realities and the countries most affected by the ecological urgencies. I spoke to Vayas Valdivieso, who reflected on “the magnitude of the talks, given the implications — for the environment, health and the economy”. Negotiating a treaty that touches every country and spans energy, trade, chemical and waste sectors by 2024, in just two years, was politically ambitious and procedurally unrealistic — a timeline that increased complexity and hardened positions.\n\nNegotiators must acknowledge the economic realities that underpin resistance and the ecological urgencies that demand change. Historically, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has provided an architecture for environmental diplomacy — with the authority to convene but not to command. It must revive its role as an impartial steward for conveying reliable scientific data, and for creating structures and spaces in which states can seek alignment. Furthermore, it must help to provide financial, institutional and technological support for collective action.\n\nDespite divisions, all parties converge around sustainable product design, resource efficiency, waste management and circular-economy principles. Now, we need what I call radical incrementalism: a bold vision coupled with practical phased steps. The 1987 Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer, championed by UNEP, offers such a model. When negotiations resume, three immediate actions can help.",

          "abstract": "Sex between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes lasts about 14 seconds.Credit: Jacopo Razzauti/The Rockefeller University\n\nFemale mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus and other diseases are actually in charge during sex, according to a study1 that challenges the long-held view that they are passive participants.\n\nMosquito blood meals reveal history of human infections\n\nLeslie Vosshall, a neurobiologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, and her team were intrigued by the observation that male mosquitoes of the Aedes genus seem to pursue females constantly, yet females typically mate only once in their lifetimes. “The question was: how are the females able to say no?” Vosshall says.\n\nUsing fluorescent sperm and some careful camera work, the researchers showed for the first time that, when a male Aedes mosquito initiates contact, the female extends the tip of her genitals by a fraction of a millimetre — roughly the thickness of a human fingernail. If the female does not give this subtle, but crucial, signal, the male’s efforts fail, and copulation does not occur.\n\nMosquito sex lasts only a few seconds, and usually occurs in mid-air. These factors, combined with the minute size of the genitals, have made it difficult to study exactly what’s going on, Vosshall says, adding that the scientists who previously studied mosquito breeding probably just shrugged and said, “Yeah, the male is in charge.” Her team’s findings, which could have implications for controlling disease-carrying mosquitoes, were published today in the journal Current Biology1.\n\nFluorescent sperm\n\nTo study the intricate mating process of Aedes aegypti — the main species of mosquito that transmits dengue — Vosshall and her colleagues first engineered transgenic males that produce either green or red fluorescent sperm. Then they put some of each type into a cage with females of the same species for seven days. When the females were dissected at the end of that period, more than 90% of them had sperm of only one colour stored in their bodies, supporting the idea that they mate only once in their lifetime.\n\nIn a second set of experiments, the team filmed the mating process using an elaborate set-up. The researchers glued a female mosquito to a metal pin, so that she could move her wings and legs but not fly away, like a trapeze artist in a rigid tether. They then introduced free-flying males into the cage, and recorded the interactions between the male and female genitals at high resolution.\n\nMale Aedes mosquitoes use drumstick-like genital structures called gonostyli (shown here, crossed) to tap on the genitalia of females when initiating sex.Credit: H. Amalia Pasolli, Anurag Sharma/The Rockefeller University\n\nLeah Houri-Zeevi, a researcher in Vosshall’s lab, spent hundreds of hours looking at the videos, frame by frame. She noticed that when a male is trying to copulate, he doesn’t simply extend his sex organ — the equivalent of a penis — towards the female. Instead, he first taps the female genitalia with drumstick-like structures called gonostyli. In response to the tapping, a virgin female might elongate the tip of her genitalia, to enable copulation. Houri-Zeevi noticed that non-virgin females, however, typically kept their genitals retracted, blocking further mating attempts.",

Credit: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nWhen it comes to preventing Alzheimer’s disease, every step counts. For older people whose brains have begun to show molecular signs of the disease, but who have yet to display any cognitive symptoms, taking as few as 3,000 to 5,000 steps per day can help to stave off mental decline, a study finds1.\n\nThat level of activity slows cognitive decline by 3 years, on average, the results show. And in similar individuals who walk further, taking 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day, decline slows by an average of 7 years. The work also offers hints to how exercise alters the brain to offer this protection.\n\n“The very encouraging takeaway is that even a little bit of exercise seems to help,” says Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, a physician-scientist specializing in memory disorders at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and a co-author of the study, which was published on 3 November in Nature Medicine. The research indicates that people don’t need to take 10,000 steps a day, a goal that is often touted but might be hard for some older individuals to attain, she says.\n\nSteps towards prevention\n\nThe research team ran regular checks on 296 people participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a programme that is investigating the early stages of Alzheimer’s. None of them had signs of cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study. Over a period of up to 14 years, the team periodically assessed the participants — whose ages ranged from 50 to 90 — using cognitive tests and brain scans. Participants were also asked to wear pedometers to measure how many steps they took each day.\n\nThe brains of people at a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease usually show an abnormal build-up of two proteins: amyloid-β and tau. Although the relationship between the two proteins is not fully understood, amyloid-β levels begin to increase first, followed by tau levels. Cognitive decline seems to be more closely tied to the accumulation of tau.\n\nThe benefits of taking 3,000 to 7,500 steps per day were apparent only for participants with high baseline levels of amyloid-β in their brains. Their mental decline was slowed — by 3 to 7 years — compared with participants who were sedentary. The researchers didn’t see any further slowing of mental decline in participants who took more than 7,500 steps a day.",

          "abstract": "Pollution levels in Delhi have hit hazardous levels, prompting the Indian government to try cloud seeding as a radical approach to tackling the problem.Credit: Prakash Singh/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nAn ambitious attempt by the Indian government to combat Delhi’s hazardous air pollution by inducing artificial rain has failed to trigger any precipitation, prompting researchers to question why the experiment went ahead.\n\nThe experiment was conducted in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur on 28 October. Two aircraft flew over several areas of Delhi and released flares containing particles of silver iodide and sodium chloride into the atmosphere, with the goal of catalysing condensation and producing rain.\n\nThe Delhi government and IIT Kanpur say that the seeding experiment led to a slight decrease in pollution, but scientists think the improvement had little to do with the intervention.\n\n“It seems like the skies have cleared, but it is because the weather conditions have changed. That’s no credit to the seeding efforts,” says Shahzad Gani, an aerosol scientist at IIT Delhi.\n\nToxic smog\n\nEvery winter for almost a decade, Delhi and surrounding areas have battled hazardous levels of fine particulate matter in the air, produced by industry, vehicle emissions and the burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states. On some days, pollution levels are up to 20 times higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended limits.\n\nIn October and November, the air in and around Delhi becomes cooler, drier and more stable, which slows the dispersal of pollutants. The Delhi government has tried taking various measures to improve air quality, such as shutting down polluting industries and banning firecrackers during Diwali festivities. But poor compliance has meant that most of these initiatives have had little effect. This year, when pollution levels became hazardous the night after Diwali celebrations, the government decided to take a different approach.\n\nThe technique of cloud seeding — firing small particles such as silver iodide and sodium chloride into existing clouds to help water vapour to condense — has been around since the mid-twentieth century. But reliable proof that the process can induce rainfall on demand is lacking, and its ability to disperse pollution has not been tested, says Gani.\n\nRoxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, says the atmospheric conditions were not suitable for the experiment to succeed. “Cloud seeding can only enhance rainfall if there are already moist, convective clouds with sufficient liquid water. In dry or stagnant air, there’s simply nothing to seed,” Koll says. At the time of the experiment, “two storms — a depression in the Arabian Sea and a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal — were pulling the moisture into those areas and making Delhi drier”.\n\nAnother trial scheduled for Wednesday was cancelled. Manindra Agrawal, director of IIT Kanpur, told Indian news agency ANI that the experiment will be postponed until a day when the moisture content of clouds is at least 40–50%.\n\nEarlier this year, the Royal Rainmaking Project in Thailand tried to combat pollution by spraying cold water from planes, hoping that this would allow some of the particulate matter trapped in a layer of warm air in the atmosphere to dissipate.\n\nLong-term solution",

          "authors": "Michael Marshall",
          "abstract": "Under President Donald Trump, the US government is gutting scientific research. The National Institutes of Health has cut almost US$2 billion of grants that were already approved, and the National Science Foundation has terminated more than 1,400 grants. And the president has even bigger plans to eviscerate science. His proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would cut non-defence-related research and development by 36%.\n\n“They have cancelled wholesale a wide variety of research efforts in midstream,” says John Holdren at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who was the science adviser to former president Barack Obama during both his terms. “They intend to now solidify it with cuts in the budgets.”\n\nThe cancelled and threatened research is a mixture of ‘applied’ work that has stated applications, which can be commercial in nature, and ‘basic’ or ‘blue skies’ research, intended to develop new knowledge.\n\nFrom MRI to Ozempic: breakthroughs that show why fundamental research must be protected\n\nBasic research is easily mocked because it can seem impractical, but, in fact, it is a major driver of economic growth. “The return on investment in basic research — the return to society — is very high, typically multiple dollars back per dollar invested,” says Holdren.\n\nThe US funding cuts will hit basic research particularly hard because the government has historically been the prime supporter of fundamental research. The private sector will never invest enough in such research, says Holdren. “The timescale for returns is too long and the ability of the funder to capture those returns too uncertain,” he says. “That’s the reason that the funding of fundamental research is, at its base, a responsibility of government.”\n\nAlthough it’s impossible to estimate how the reductions in federal support might limit future discoveries, scientists point to a long list of findings that emerged out of fundamental research and went on to change the world. Here are a few examples.\n\nFrom hot springs to DNA forensics\n\nIn the summer of 1966, while he was an undergraduate at Indiana University, Hudson Freeze went to live in a cabin on the edge of Yellowstone National Park. He was working for microbiologist Thomas Brock, who was convinced that certain microorganisms were living at surprisingly high temperatures. Dodging bears, and the traffic jams they caused, Freeze visited the hot springs every day to sample their bacteria.\n\nThomas Brock stands by Mushroom Spring in Yellowstone National Park in 1967. Bacteria that thrive in high-temperature fluids were discovered at the site.Credit: Thomas Brock/USGS\n\nOn 19 September, Freeze succeeded in growing a sample of yellowish microbes from Mushroom Spring. Under a microscope, he found an array of cells collected from the near-boiling fluids. “I was seeing something that nobody had ever seen before,” says Freeze, now at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, California. “I still get goosebumps when I remember looking into the microscope.”\n\nThree years later, Freeze and Brock described one of the bacteria, which they called Thermus aquaticus1. It grew best at 70 °C. Then, in 1970, they isolated an enzyme2 from T. aquaticus, which performed sugar metabolism at an optimal temperature of 95 °C. By then, Freeze had left for graduate studies and shifted his priorities to slime moulds. However, other researchers kept studying T. aquaticus, and in 1976, a team at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio isolated another enzyme3: a ‘DNA polymerase’ that could synthesize new DNA at 80 °C.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nSeven years later, this Taq polymerase would prove to be just what biochemist Kary Mullis needed to create the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method for rapidly making thousands upon thousands of copies of a single fragment of DNA4. Mullis needed high temperatures to break DNA molecules apart, so he also needed a polymerase that worked at high temperatures to avoid repetitive heating and cooling.\n\nToday, PCR is an indispensable tool in everything from medicine — where it’s used to match organ donors with recipients and in the diagnosis of cancers — to DNA fingerprinting that can help police to identify killers.\n\nThe origins of MRI\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a mainstay of modern medicine. It can generate detailed images of a person’s internal anatomy — revealing, for instance, abnormal structures in the heart or whether a tumour has grown or shrunk. A variant called functional MRI (fMRI) tracks changing blood flow in the brain, which has enabled researchers to discover fundamental insights about how the brain works. What’s more, MRI is non-invasive and doesn’t require the use of radioactive substances or ionizing radiation, unlike many other imaging methods.\n\nMRI emerged from research in the 1930s into the physical properties of atomic nuclei, and of the fundamental particles within them. It was “pretty esoteric stuff” with “no applications really in sight or in mind”, says Carmen Giunta, a chemist at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York.\n\nResearch in the 1930s by Isidor Rabi eventually helped in the development of MRI scanning technology.Credit: RDB/ullstein bild/Getty\n\nOne key discovery on the path to MRI machines involved studies of protons and neutrons, which make up atomic nuclei. Such particles have a property called spin that describes their angular momentum.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nIn the 1930s, physicist Isidor Rabi and his colleagues were investigating spin by firing beams of atomic nuclei through magnetic fields. Protons and neutrons, depending on the orientations of their spins, have slightly different energy levels when exposed to magnetic fields. “The resonance method that he developed was a way of detecting when these spins change their orientation in the presence of a magnetic field,” says Giunta. For this work, Rabi won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance found its first uses in chemical laboratories. Because atomic nuclei are sensitive to their surroundings, careful measurements of magnetic resonance could be used to determine how atoms were connected in large molecules. From the 1970s onwards, it was fashioned into a tool for imaging biological tissues. Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2003 for their work in developing MRI.\n\nRoot vegetables and flat-screen TVs\n\nIt started in Prague in early 1888, when botanist Friedrich Reinitzer extracted chemicals called cholesterol esters from carrot roots. One of the substances — crystals of cholesteryl benzoate — did something unexpected. Normal crystals, when heated, lose both their solidity and colour at the same temperature, but these did not. “They lost their solidity at 145 °C but retained their bluish colour, which they only lost at 178 °C,” says Michel Mitov at the University of the Côte d’Azur in Nice, France.\n\nOther researchers had seen similar behaviours before, but Reinitzer recognized that there might be an important new phenomenon at work. Unsure how to explain it, on 14 March he wrote a long letter to physicist Otto Lehmann in Aachen, in what is now Germany. “Lehmann was the perfect colleague for continuing and reproducing the observation,” says Mitov, because he had built a microscope with a heated stage, which meant he could observe the crystals’ behaviour in real time. The two exchanged letters and samples for weeks, and Reinitzer presented their initial results at a meeting in Vienna in May.\n\nOtto Lehmann made key discoveries about liquid crystals, which helped to lay the foundation for modern screens on televisions and smartphones.Credit: Unknown author\n\nLehmann’s key observation was that, when the crystals lost their solidity, they still retained some properties of a crystal. Yet in other respects they were liquid. At a molecular level, they were composed of long molecules that remained in an ordered orientation (as in a crystal) but could also move freely (as in a liquid). Lehmann called them liquid crystals.\n\nFor decades, many researchers refused to accept this, because it flew in the face of the system that physicists and chemists used to categorize matter. Substances were either solid, liquid or gaseous. Liquid crystals blurred the lines, and acceptance of this came at “a very high intellectual cost”, says Mitov.\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century the evidence became undeniable, but research into liquid crystals dried up, out of a belief that they would never be of any use. The field was revived by US chemists in the late 1950s, and in 1968, engineers developed the first flat screens based on liquid crystals, which ultimately gave rise to flat-screen televisions. However, their applications go far beyond screens, says Mitov, including uses in cameras, microscopes, smart materials, robotics and even anti-counterfeiting technology.\n\nThe tiny start to gene editing\n\n“My head explodes every time I see a new application of CRISPR, or that CRISPR has cured someone,” says microbiologist Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain.\n\nUS Supreme Court allows NIH to cut $2 billion in research grant\n\nCRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a tool that can edit genomes in a very precise way. It opened up vast opportunities for basic research and has paved the way for curing genetic disorders, including sickle-cell disease, immune dysfunction and life-threatening metabolic conditions. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the tool.\n\nThe discoveries that led to this revolution happened decades earlier. In 1989, Mojica was a PhD student investigating Haloferax mediterranei R-4: a single-celled organism called an archaean, found in salt-producing ponds near Alicante. He tried to find out how the microbe could survive in such briny conditions. Having identified some promising regions of the microbe’s genome, Mojica sequenced them and was surprised to find short segments that were repeated at regular intervals. He and other researchers gave these repeated segments different names but eventually settled on the acronym CRISPR. As he investigated them, Mojica proposed some potential functions for the repeating segments: ideas that were, he says wryly, “absolutely wrong”5.\n\nFrancisco Mojica’s studies of microbial genes underpinned the development of the CRISPR gene-editing system.Credit: Juan Carlos Soler/ARCHDC/Archivo ABC/Alamy\n\nSubsequently, Mojica learned that similar sequences could be found in many other microbes, which didn’t live in saline conditions. “Whatever role they were playing, it couldn’t be related to the peculiarities of the diverse environments,” he says.\n\nThe key clue was the discovery, between the repeated segments, of sequences from the genomes of bacteriophages: viruses that infect bacteria. Eventually Mojica realized that a bacterium carrying a sequence from a specific phage could not be infected by that phage. “We inferred that this was an adaptive immune system,” he says. “One ancestor acquired spacers from the phage, and after that, the descendants were resistant to infection6.”\n\nMojica knew this was a big find — an adaptive immune system had never been observed in bacteria or archaea. He also thought that it might be useful for dealing with bacterial infections. Then others found that CRISPR works by cutting DNA at specific points7. From there, Doudna and Charpentier discovered how they could harness that system and reprogram it to edit genes. And so the CRISPR revolution took off8.\n\nWeight loss, inspired by a lizard\n\nWeight-loss and diabetes medications such as Ozempic have become the wonder drugs of the era. Almost 5% of people in the United States have used them to slim down, and the global market for these drugs is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030. Although much of the work that led to them was done for medical applications, one key discovery came from research on the only venomous lizards in the United States: Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum).\n\nA Gila-monster peptide played a part in the development of GLP-1 drugs.Credit: Getty\n\nAt the heart of the story is a molecule called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is produced in the human gut. In the 1980s, chemist Svetlana Mojsov showed that GLP-1 can stimulate the production of insulin, lowering blood sugar levels9.\n\nDaniel Drucker, now at the University of Toronto in Canada, worked with Mojsov on this early research. “We were focused on its potential for diabetes treatment,” he says. “Ten years later, in 1996, we and others discovered that GLP-1 reduces food intake, and the potential for weight loss emerged.” However, there was a problem. GLP-1 has a short half-life: just a few minutes. That meant it was no use as a drug, because it would be broken down in the body before it could have much of an effect.",

          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "Sylvain Martel at Polytechnique Montréal uses magnetic-resonance-imaging scanners to steer drug-loaded nanorobots in pigs.Credit: Dumitru Loghin\n\nThe live pig in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine was a common sight for Sylvain Martel, a nanorobotics researcher at Polytechnique Montréal in Canada, by the time he stepped into the imaging suite one evening in 2017. By then, Martel and his colleagues had spent more than a decade refining swarms of tiny robots that they could steer through the animals using the machine’s magnetism. The hope was that such nanorobots could one day be a delivery vehicle for cancer-busting drugs. That evening, the group was exploring the effect of gravity, testing whether changing the pig’s positioning in the machine could help the nanobots to navigate the many branching arteries to the liver.\n\nNature Spotlight: Robotics\n\nAs the team watched the screen, the robots gradually shifted towards the liver, amassing there as a bright, flickering cloud. Compared with previous trials, in which the pigs were lying flat on their backs, placing them inside the MRI at a slight downward angle prompted an almost threefold increase in the number of robots that arrived at their destination. Martel says that even though the successful experiment only presaged more work, it nevertheless felt like a culmination of years of trial and error.\n\n“All these years, we’d been diligently showing different steps of the process. We refined the technology, we showed that the robots could carry and administer drugs and now we’d shown that we could move them efficiently across human-scale distances,” he says. Getting to this stage “took a long time, but it also feels like the next steps should go much faster”.\n\nThe work of Martel and his colleagues has taken scientists closer to deploying nanorobotic technology in humans — a threshold that, when crossed, could one day revolutionize the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of many cancers. Already, late-stage research in animal models has demonstrated how nanorobots can assist clinicians with biopsies and surgeries, serve as screening agents for hard-to-detect cancers, starve tumours of oxygen and deliver cancer-killing drugs and vaccines. Cancer, in particular, is a field ripe for nanorobotics innovation.\n\nBorrowing from nature\n\nNanorobots are loosely defined by their size — typically less than 100 nanometres — and their ability for directed or autonomous motion. This movement distinguishes them from technologies such as nanocarriers, which can transport molecular cargo but do so passively. Even slightly larger microrobots, around 1 millimetre in size, often rely on nanotechnology, for example in their motors, or exploit physical phenomena occurring at the nanoscale. Therefore, researchers often lump the two under the combined term micro-nanorobots (MNRs).\n\nRudimentary versions of these robots appeared in the 1990s, offering proof-of-concept that researchers could indeed create microscale robots. Roughly two decades later, the first MNR made its way into cancer research, when a team in South Korea developed a “bacteriobot” capable of detecting solid tumours by homing in on chemical gradients given off by the cancerous cells1. MNRs are often broken down into two categories, inorganic and organic, on the basis of the materials used to construct them. Inorganic robots might include metals such as silver, gold or iron, and organic robots are often built using scaffolds of DNA or proteins. Both types can be manipulated using forces such as magnetism, light and acoustics or by chemical and catalytic reactions that propel them towards their destination.\n\nTiny grippers (pictured) can take cancer biopsies.Credit: Evin Gultepe, Gracias Lab, JHU\n\nBjörn Högberg, a biophysicist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, says that the methods for building nanorobots have been refined over time, particularly the fabrication of their components. Högberg says much of his work focuses on a technique called DNA origami, in which scientists treat DNA “not as a genetic material, but as a construction material” capable of building intricate 2D and 3D structures. “There are now many clever examples of using origami to conceal things like tumour-targeting ligands or drugs, where it exposes its cargo in the right place and at the right time,” he says.\n\nRobots demonstrate principles of collective intelligence\n\nIncreasingly, researchers are creating what are known as biohybrid robots, which introduce synthetic elements into biological entities such as bacteria, algae and sperm. Scientists quickly realized that nature had already designed many of the features that make for a successful nanorobot — including whip-like flagella for motion, and sensors for detecting gradients. “A bacterium already has a motor, with all the components we’d recognize,” says Martin Pumera, a nanorobotics researcher at the Central European Institute of Technology in the Czech Republic. “What we’re pursuing now is the ideal combination of both worlds, the synthetic one and the biological one.”\n\nSuch advances have given researchers more control over robots’ speed and orientation and even enabled them to develop devices that can swap between propulsion mechanisms. Martel, for example, used a marine bacterium to create a nanobot that can be moved to the vicinity of a tumour using magnetism, and can then switch to an on-board sensor that detects oxygen gradients as it draws near2. Because the tumour microenvironment has low oxygen, “it creates a beacon for these robots to seek out”, Martel says.\n\nComing for cancer\n\nWith these building blocks in place, scientists are now applying nanorobotic technology across the cancer-research spectrum, using nanobots to investigate at least a dozen cancer types. Joseph Wang, a nanoengineer at the University of California, San Diego, says that cancer might be the field with the most to gain from these precision-medicine tools, in part because of how challenging cancer can be to root out and how invasive existing treatments can be. “There’s a desire among patients for treatments that don’t require surgeries or painful injections, and I think nanorobots have a lot to offer here,” he says.\n\nToday, the largest strides in cancer-based nanorobotics research are in targeted drug delivery — offering a notable improvement over conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapies, that are broad-acting with severe side effects. And the development of targeted therapies is the goal not just of cancer research, but of precision medicine more broadly.\n\nWhy we should limit the autonomy of AI-enabled weapons\n\nOne promising therapy is the use of nanorobots to deliver the enzyme thrombin to tumours, to effectively starve cancer cells of oxygen by coagulating the blood that feeds them. In China, researchers have used DNA origami to create nanorobots that bind to nucleolin, a protein expressed on vascular cells that deliver blood to a tumour3. The binding also serves as a trigger to change the conformation of the origami and release the thrombin. This therapy has so far been tested in mouse models of an aggressive form of breast cancer, in which it dampened tumour growth, kick-started death of cancerous cells, and prevented cancer spread (metastasis).\n\nMariana Medina-Sánchez, a nanobiosystems researcher at the Basque Nanoscience Cooperative Research Center in San Sebastian, Spain, focuses on cancers that affect the female reproductive system. She says that researchers often develop MNRs that are based on the specifics of the system they’re working in, as she has done for the reproductive system. Her MNR is a biohybrid one built from a sperm cell and a magnetic 3D-printed structure that can be guided by magnetism and release the sperm at the target4. As well as its powerful tail, a sperm cell contains enzymes for fusing with cell membranes. Medina-Sánchez has co-opted that ability, enabling the MNR to bind to synthetic cervical and ovarian tumours, where they then release drugs.\n\n“What we’re finding is that we can load them up with anti-cancer drugs — even combination therapies — without affecting their viability, which makes them ideal,” she says. “In fact, their tail-beating is so robust” that they also do physical damage to the tumour simply by disrupting the cell environment. The biohybrid sperm also have a natural ability to dampen immune responses by displaying certain proteins, making them less likely to damage their host.\n\nGrippers shown next to an 18-gauge needle for comparison.Credit: Evin Gultepe, Gracias Lab, JHU",

          "authors": "Xiaoying You",
          "abstract": "The problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nI am a young faculty member at a university in China, passionate about my research and eager to contribute to my field. However, I’m increasingly overwhelmed by the pressure to secure grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). In our academic evaluation system, success in obtaining NSFC funding has become a crucial metric for career advancement — affecting promotions, tenure and even annual performance assessments.\n\nYoung scholars spend many hours crafting grant proposals, often at the expense of actual research, such as conducting experiments, analysing data and writing papers. The stress is immense: the fear of repeated rejection not only threatens our career prospects but also erodes our confidence and enthusiasm for science.\n\nHow can I navigate this pressure? Should I prioritize grant-writing skills over research itself, or is there a way to reconcile the need for funding with my original passion for scientific inquiry? — A frustrated young academic\n\nThe advice\n\nThis is by no means a unique challenge. Your frustration will resonate with plenty of academics around the world who, like you, are battling to secure funding. Moreover, the pressure often soars for early-career researchers aiming for tenure.\n\nBut the competition for funding seems to be particularly fierce in China. A grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) — the main funding source for basic research in the country — is often expected in the Chinese system for a tenure position. However, owing to the growing number of applicants, the success rate has dropped rapidly over the past decade: from around 22% in 2016 to a little over 12% this year.\n\nMany young Chinese scholars say that workload pressure also comes from their ‘up or out’ contracts, which mean that they have six years to secure tenure or otherwise face dismissal.\n\nNature talked to four China-based researchers, who shared their thoughts on the grant struggle and how to tackle it.\n\nPut research ahead of the funding\n\nXu Chi, an ecologist at Nanjing University, obtained his first NSFC grant in 2009, and now reviews grant proposals for the organization. Xu says that better writing skills can certainly help, but what will really make your proposal stand out is whether the topic is “important, novel and unique”.\n\n“It is also important that the candidate can showcase that he or she is the right person to carry the project to the finishing line,” Xu notes. “For that, the candidate should explain their advantages and unique selling points.”\n\nImproving your grant-writing skills and research “should not be an either/or choice,” adds Guo Tong, dean of the School of Civil Engineering in Southeast University in Nanjing. Guo, who has won seven NSFC grants since 2007, says that writing a grant proposal can help an applicant to clarify a project’s methodology and set achievable milestones. “In this way, grant writing can actually strengthen one’s science rather than replace it,” he explains.\n\nChange your mindset\n\nTong Xinzhao, a bioinformatician at the Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University (XJTLU) in Suzhou, says she faced a similar dilemma last year after her fourth NSFC grant application was rejected.\n\n“Am I doing this research because this is something I really want to pursue, or am I doing this research just to get funding and get on the career ladder?” Tong recalls asking herself at the time.\n\nIn the end, she realized that she would want to work on her chosen topic regardless of the outcome of her next application. “That decision helped me clear my mind,” she said. “Suddenly, I stopped feeling the pressure. I felt light. And my preparation also seemed easier.”\n\nGuo agrees, saying that even if a proposal is not funded, it can still be a valuable road map for your work.\n\nGuo says that a mindset shift is often necessary. “A paper reports completed work — data, results and conclusions. A proposal, on the other hand, is about the future,” he explains. “This requires shifting from describing what you have done, to convincing others of what you can achieve and why it matters.”\n\nIt is also crucial that you introduce your research question in a detailed and logical way in your proposal, according to Tong. She says that Chinese reviewers often look for a particular format for that: the general landscape of your field; what problems need to be resolved; what others have tried before; what is left to be resolved; and what you can do to fill the knowledge gap.\n\n“In a nutshell, the goal is to break the current research ceiling and dig a bit deeper,” she explains.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) models can perform as well as humans on law exams when answering multiple-choice, short-answer and essay questions (A. Blair-Stanek et al. Preprint at SSRN https://doi.org/p89q; 2025), but they struggle to perform real-world legal tasks. Some lawyers have learnt that the hard way, and have been fined for filing AI-generated court briefs that misrepresented principles of law and cited non-existent cases. The same is true in other fields. For example, AI models can pass the gold-standard test in finance — the Chartered Financial Analyst exam — yet score poorly on simple tasks required of entry-level financial analysts (see go.nature.com/42tbrgb).\n\nHow should we test AI for human-level intelligence? OpenAI’s o3 electrifies quest\n\nWhenever assessments measure the intended skill inaccurately, it is considered a proxy failure. For example, a lawyer who scored A+ on an exam would be expected to avoid the kinds of error that an AI tool with a similar score might make in a real-world scenario. Better tests are urgently required to help guide the use of AI in complex, high-stakes situations.\n\nOne promising idea emerged in March at an Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence workshop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: through extensive interaction, a specialist can tell whether an AI system genuinely understands or is merely imitating understanding.\n\nImagine an AI model attempting to ‘pass’ an interview with an acclaimed legal scholar such as Cass Sunstein at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Sunstein’s expert probing would be a better measure of the model’s legal knowledge than a standardized test or automatically scored benchmark. Passing the ‘Sunstein test’ would require an AI tool to display true legal mastery, being able to wade through ambiguity and contradiction, and not just answer multiple-choice questions or write an essay.\n\nOne might ask: why not simply test an AI model’s legal readiness with task-specific benchmarks, similar to those used in medicine for checking an AI tool’s ability to take notes for a physician? The goal, however, is not to test an AI tool’s ability to perform a specific legal task, or even a long list of them, but to test whether it has general-purpose legal knowledge that it can exercise systematically when performing any task.\n\nWhy evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now\n\nI am not suggesting that Sunstein, or any single authority, should be appointed as the arbiter of AI expertise. The goal is to build systems that leading legal specialists broadly agree demonstrate genuine, trustworthy legal knowledge. A ‘robo-lawyer’ would need to cope in a diverse range of interviews with panels of experts — ranging from tax and constitutional lawyers to clerks, traffic officers and legal-aid workers. Such an approach would reduce issues around individual or ideological bias and avoid the trap of AI models merely mimicking one person’s style.\n\nCould a machine reach human levels of expertise, subtlety and ethics? Only specialists can say. But imagine a US Supreme Court justice grilling an AI robo-lawyer in public. That would get everyone’s attention. It would be a spectacle much like multinational technology corporation IBM’s 2011 challenge on the US television quiz programme Jeopardy!. The company pitted its supercomputer Watson against human champions to demonstrate how far machine reasoning and natural-language processing had come.",

          "abstract": "Surgery is sometimes necessary to remove growths or cysts from vocal cords.Credit: Garo/Phanie/Science Photo Library\n\nInspired by the world’s largest land animal, researchers have created and tested what they say is the world’s smallest 3D bioprinter. The device — which sports a 2.7-millimetre-wide print head at the end of a long, flexible arm that moves like an elephant’s trunk — might one day assist physicians by delivering healing hydrogels during surgery.\n\nIn a report published on 29 October in the journal Device1, the researchers proved that the device could be fed through a physician’s surgical scope to deposit hydrogel onto an artificial set of vocal cords. “This is the first time I’ve seen a bioprinter that’s applicable to vocal folds,” says Ibrahim Ozbolat, a biomedical engineer at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. “Bioprinting typically addresses skin defects from the outside. Reaching a defect internally has been a challenge in the field.”\n\nAssisted healing\n\nAfter undergoing surgery to remove cysts or growths from their vocal cords, people sometimes have difficulty speaking because their vocal folds scar and become stiff. Studies have shown that injecting hydrogels — which can be shaped to mimic the vocal cords’ natural structure and support new tissue as it grows — boosts the healing process2. But surgeons have had a hard time delivering the biomaterials with precision because their view into the throat is limited.\n\nResearchers tested their tiny 3D bioprinter in a surgeon’s training simulator. The device is shown snaking through a surgeon’s ‘scope’ from the left to deposit hydrogel onto artificial vocal cords (pink) on the right.Credit: Swen Groen\n\nSwen Groen, a biomedical engineer at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, wondered whether the natural world might offer a solution to this problem. Perhaps a soft robotic arm that moved like an elephant’s trunk could be miniaturized to aid surgeons without blocking their view?\n\nGroen and his colleagues first designed a prototype that was 8 millimetres in diameter. Then, they shrunk the design to fit more easily through the one-centimetre-wide scope that surgeons use for operations, and demonstrated that it could precisely deliver dollops of hyaluronic-acid-based hydrogels to fill in gaps in artificial vocal folds, which are normally used for surgical training. “Working on the miniaturization has taken the majority of the time,” Groen says.\n\nLevelling up",

          "title": "Environmental treaties are paralysed — here’s how we can do better",
          "authors": "Rakhyun E. Kim, Peter Bridgewater",
          "abstract": "On 15 August in Geneva, Switzerland, a fifth round of negotiations towards a multilateral treaty on reducing plastic pollution collapsed. The chair announced that the committee had concluded its work — without producing a draft treaty. Governments had failed to agree on the proposed articles of the convention; no further negotiations were being suggested.\n\nThis failure reveals a weakness in all environmental treaty negotiations, whether new or existing ones: a consensus-driven process waters down action to the lowest common denominator. Only symptoms get addressed, not causes.\n\nHeatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies\n\nThe result is much action without impact. Yet this ineffective method continues — a situation we characterize as ‘institutional paralysis’. What’s needed is to make international organizations capable of imagining and doing things differently. That requires more research on politics and governance, and that institutions make better use of the knowledge generated by that research.\n\nTo overcome this paralysis, at least in the environmental arena, we propose establishing a standing process, mandated by governments, to evaluate the state of global environmental treaties and related bodies. Its role would be to assess their fitness, both individually and collectively; identify what is and is not working and why; and provide actionable recommendations to the United Nations for reforming them.\n\nFrozen institutions\n\nInternational environmental institutions resemble deer frozen in headlights: acutely aware of an impending crisis, yet incapable of meaningful movement. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change elevates urgency, but even implementing its current pledges fully would fall short of avoiding dangerous climate change1. The Convention on Biological Diversity sets ambitious conservation targets for protected areas, yet expanding the zones offers little defence against an intensifying local and global extinction of species caused by climate change2.\n\nThese are not merely failures of ambition. They are design flaws. The implementation of existing policies, however robust, is insufficient to confront the scale and complexity of today’s polycrisis3.\n\nStates now have a legal duty to prevent climate harm — justice is in reach\n\nThe result is institutional paralysis: a persistent incapacity of environmental institutions to act, adapt or achieve stated objectives despite sustained procedural activity. Like the Red Queen in Alice through the Looking Glass, paralysed institutions run in place just to stay put. Trapped in cycles of action without impact, movement persists but purpose dissolves.\n\nThe rational response to paralysis would be to acknowledge it and seek support. Yet most institutions resort to symbolic gestures to maintain the appearance of relevance. In July in Zimbabwe, after months of discussions, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands agreed on a strategic plan that mostly reaffirmed 20-year-old decisions. The International Whaling Commission projects the illusion of progress, framing resolved issues such as widespread whaling as ongoing to justify the body’s continued activity4.\n\nOthers choose to gamble. The London Convention and its 1996 Protocol on marine pollution have opened the door to marine geoengineering, including fertilization of the ocean with iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth and, increasingly, measures to enhance ocean alkalinity to increase carbon dioxide absorption5. Although such interventions would carry huge, clearly identified risks to the marine environment, they are still being considered as potential responses to climate change.\n\nThis reflects a broader dynamic: institutions are navigating trade-offs between various risks, in ways that endanger the very object that they seek to conserve, and undermine their own effectiveness in saving it.\n\nDiagnosing institutional paralysis\n\nInstitutional paralysis arises when organizations are confronted with circumstances that exceed their original purpose, authority or capability. Take, for example, climate change. Today’s climate is in much worse shape than when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted in 1992, arguably exceeding the body’s capacity to manage responses. Scientific knowledge about our planet is abundant and expanding and institutions are increasingly overloaded with information.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nGroups of scientists have tried to issue ‘warnings to humanity’6, but after initial brief attention, the warnings go unheeded. And concerns are spiralling faster than UN conventions can keep up with. For example, the study of climate change involves not only the natural sciences, but also, increasingly, social sciences — adding further angles, such as justice, to the discussions7. Yet deteriorating social issues are an outcome of the acceleration of global warming, which further stretches the climate agenda. Ineffectiveness then breeds more problems, while resources remain stagnant. As a result, public confidence in the climate convention erodes, reinforcing the sense of paralysis.\n\nAlready-overburdened institutions are also strained by accelerating anthropogenic pressures that fall outside their mandates. Today, much of this spillover stems from climate change8. For example, the World Heritage Convention lists 51 marine sites in its protected areas, including 29 coral reefs — which looks good on paper. However, it lacks the authority to address climate-driven threats to coral reefs, such as ocean warming and acidification. Although there is a great deal of science available to assist with evaluating impacts on heritage, geopolitical realities hold more sway on which sites are accepted and added to the list9.\n\nThe complex reasons why institutions tread water are revealing. Limited capacity is one factor. Most international environmental institutions are chronically under-resourced10. Climate change is often more politically salient than biodiversity and tends to receive most of the funding11. For example, the Cali Fund for supporting the sharing of genetic resources, which was launched amid excitement in February at the resumed 16th biodiversity Conference of the Parties (COP16) in Rome, is struggling to reach its targets.\n\nMinisters met in May to set directions for negotiations at COP30 in Brazil in November.Credit: Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty\n\nGeopolitical dynamics further exacerbate the problem of fundraising for the conventions, and tend to favour climate over biodiversity, despite the nexus between them. The behaviours of major powers such as the United States, Russia, China and the European Union shape outcomes of multilateral negotiations. Sometimes, countries with economies that rely heavily on oil and natural gas act as deliberate blockers. Contestation between countries with different socio-economic and political circumstances also deepens institutional paralysis.\n\nEven when they lack capacity and resources, most institutions continue to project an image of progress and preserve the appearance of hope rather than acknowledge failure and close. Like all entities composed of people, they are inherently political. Admitting the failure of institutions into which so much has been invested, without viable replacements, is seen as carrying too great a political (and psychological) risk.\n\nMany institutions are also entrenched in the ecomodernist paradigm12; they often choose to pursue technological fixes, such as carbon capture or extensive monoculture afforestation, as the path of least resistance. Yet such fixes often lead to more problems.",

          "abstract": "An AlphaFold3 model of a protein (blue) interacting with RNA (purple).Credit: Google DeepMind\n\nScientists today released a ‘sneak preview’ of a new open-source artificial intelligence (AI) model that predicts 3D structures of proteins, and say it is close to matching the performance of Google DeepMind’s revolutionary protein-folding AI AlphaFold3.\n\nThe system, called OpenFold3, was developed by the OpenFold Consortium1, a non-profit collaboration of academic and private research groups, headquartered in Davis, California. OpenFold3 uses proteins’ amino acid sequences to map their 3D structures and model how they interact with other molecules, such as drugs or DNA.\n\nThe tool still doesn’t have the same functionality as AlphaFold3, but “we wanted to get something out to the community as soon as possible”, says Woody Sherman, the consortium’s executive committee chair and chief innovation officer at Psivant Therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts. The team hopes to use researcher feedback after the preview release to improve the model.\n\nFull release coming\n\nThe system was trained on more than 300,000 molecular structures and a synthetic database of more than 40 million structures. Developing it has cost US$17 million so far.\n\nWho will make AlphaFold3 open source? Scientists race to crack AI model\n\nUnlike AlphaFold3, which is available for restricted academic use, any researcher or pharmaceutical company can use OpenFold3. “It’s a big step forward in terms of the democratization of AI structural-biology tools,” says Sherman.\n\nThe preview release shares OpenFold3’s code with researchers and allows them to start using and testing it. Sherman says that the consortium team is still working on technical improvements to the system and is planning a full release in the coming months. “We’re close — and we think, with this last little bit of effort, we’re going to get fully to parity,” he says. “This is a way for folks to get a flavour of OpenFold3 and start integrating it into their workflows and start building tools and start providing feedback.”\n\n“I’m excited to test [OpenFold3] and see how [it] compares to existing models,” says Stephanie Wankowicz, a computational structural biologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nOpen-source models\n\nOpenFold3 is part of a wider push to develop open-source versions of AlphaFold3. These efforts began in May 2024, when London-based Google DeepMind launched AlphaFold3 without initially sharing its underlying code. Researchers criticized the private firm’s decision — and later, in November 2024, DeepMind made the AlphaFold3 code and model weights, or all the trainable parameters in an AI model, available to academics (they remain unavailable for commercial use).",

We identified a reliable subset that serves as an individual-specific ‘barcode’, capturing multifaceted dynamic dimensions that stably reflect inter-individual variation across datasets. These barcodes linked nonlinear autocorrelations in unimodal regions to substance use traits and random walk dynamics in higher-order networks to general cognitive abilities. Importantly, these brain–behaviour associations generalized across life stages and populations, with substance use showing age-specific variation and cognition exhibiting consistent patterns across age groups.

          "abstract": "In artificial neural networks, acquiring new knowledge often interferes with existing knowledge. Here, although it is commonly claimed that humans overcome this challenge, we find surprisingly similar patterns of interference across both types of learner. When learning sequential rule-based tasks (A–B–A), both learners benefit more from prior knowledge when the tasks are similar—but as a result, they also exhibit greater interference when retested on task A. In networks, this arises from reusing previously learned representations, which accelerates new learning at the cost of overwriting prior knowledge. In humans, we also observe individual differences: one group (‘lumpers’) shows more interference alongside better transfer, while another (‘splitters’) avoids interference at the cost of worse transfer. These behavioural profiles are mirrored in neural networks trained in the rich (lumper) or lazy (splitter) regimes, encouraging overlapping or distinct representations respectively. Together, these findings reveal shared computational trade-offs between transferring knowledge and avoiding interference in humans and artificial neural networks.",

Traditional methods for evaluating the power of national scientific ecosystems, however, often overlook the nuances of a country’s global influence. In this perspective, we introduce a framework that highlights shifting power dynamics in international scientific collaborations, focusing on whether leadership positions in international scientific teams are moving from one country to another. Using rich sociological data from nearly 6 million scientific publications, we document a marked shift in team leadership from Western countries to China. In particular, the share of team leaders involved in U.S-China scientific collaborations that were affiliated with Chinese institutions grew from 30% of the total in 2010 to 45% in 2023. We further explore the implications of China’s rise by forecasting when Chinese scientists are projected to achieve parity in leadership vis-à-vis the United States, including in 11 critical technology areas that are focal points of technological development, and by analyzing how a potential decoupling of U.S.-Chinese science might affect Chinese scientific leadership. We conclude by considering the impacts of China’s growing investments in the training of young scientists in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.",

          "abstract": "Many existing approaches to generalizing statistical inference amid distribution shift operate under the covariate shift assumption, which posits that the conditional distribution of unobserved variables given observable ones is invariant across populations. However, recent empirical investigations have demonstrated that adjusting for shifts in observed variables (covariate shift) is often insufficient for generalization. In other words, covariate shift does not typically “explain away” the distribution shift between populations. As such, addressing the unknown yet nonnegligible shift in the unobserved variables given observed ones (conditional shift) is crucial for generalizable inference. In this paper, we present empirical evidence from two large-scale multisite replication studies indicating that covariate shift can help predict the strength of unknown conditional shift. Analyzing 680 studies across 65 sites, we find that even though the conditional shift is nonnegligible, its strength can often be bounded by that of the observable covariate shift. This pattern only emerges when the two sources of shifts are quantified by our proposed standardized, pivotal measures. We then interpret this phenomenon by connecting it to similar patterns that can be theoretically derived from a random distribution shift model. Finally, we demonstrate that exploiting the predictive role of covariate shift leads to reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification for target estimates in generalization tasks with partially observed data. Overall, our empirical and theoretical analyses highlight an alternative perspective on the problem of distributional shift, generalizability, and external validity.",

However, although human search behavior has existed since the beginning of civilization, not much is known about human search patterns, particularly regarding strategies that yield higher efficiency. Although most humans no longer need to gather and hunt in the wild, human searching remains prevalent in modern times. A common example of human searching is performed by taxi drivers looking for passengers in a city. Here, we analyze GPS data of taxi drivers in three major cities over different time periods and find that when drivers search for passengers, the higher is their efficiency, the slower is their searching, and they tend to make more short-distance turns during the search. Our study further indicates that individuals are characterized by a specific level of efficiency, and thus, efficient drivers are consistently efficient across different days as they follow their own search strategies. Interestingly, only about 10% of drivers adopt the most efficient strategy, earning nearly 20% more than the average driver. Our findings shed light on human search behavior, a fundamental aspect of human decision-making in competitive and fast-paced environments.",

To explore whether these trends could be connected, we employ a simple computational model of society, where people—within their social networks—continuously compare and update their opinions. Here, we show that the model that is known to realistically capture both homophily and social balance exhibits a phase transition phenomenon where, above a critical social connectivity, an explosive transition toward strong polarization must occur. The model allows us to understand the empirical inflation of polarization during the last decades as a function of the observed increased values of social connectivity. In the presence of a small fraction of synchronized influencers, the transition becomes continuous; however, polarization then appears at lower connectivities.

          "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically X/Twitter, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here, we shed light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: X/Twitter, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sample, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right-wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative news posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts, consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: Across all platforms examined, a given user’s lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement, even though higher-quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds when accounting for poster-level variation and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting that user preferences—not algorithmic bias—may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",

The metabolic microenvironment in tumors is frequently depleted of important nutrients such as glucose. Here, we investigated metabolic adaptation strategies of macrophages to glucose deprivation using stable isotopic tracing. Lactate production was decreased, potentially indicating a reduction of glycolysis. In contrast, the contribution of glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid cycle via α-ketoglutarate and reductive carboxylation were increased. Moreover, gluconeogenesis, the reverse pathway of glycolysis, was activated in glucose-deprived macrophages, proceeding partially to the generation of glycolytic intermediates and glycerol-3-phosphate. The partial gluconeogenesis pathway was abrogated in human and murine macrophages lacking the initial gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2, mitochondrial isoform). Partial gluconeogenesis was higher in anti-inflammatory, interleukin-4-stimulated compared to proinflammatory, interferon-γ/lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Single-cell analysis and immunostaining revealed expression of PCK2 in macrophages from both lung cancer and normal lung. Low glucose conditions only partially modulated macrophage phenotypes, leading to reduced CD80 surface marker levels in proinflammatory, and enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor expression in anti-inflammatory macrophages. Our study reveals partial gluconeogenesis in glucose-deprived macrophages and shows that this versatile type of immune cells exhibits remarkable metabolic flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Self-assembling protein nanoparticles are being increasingly utilized in the design of next-generation vaccines due to their ability to induce antibody responses of superior magnitude, breadth, and durability. Computational protein design offers a route to nanoparticle scaffolds with structural and biochemical features tailored to specific vaccine applications. Although strategies for designing self-assembling proteins have been established, the recent development of powerful machine learning (ML)–based tools for protein structure prediction and design provides an opportunity to overcome several of their limitations. Here, we leveraged these tools to develop a generalizable method for designing self-assembling proteins starting from AlphaFold2 predictions of oligomeric protein building blocks. We used the method to generate six 60-subunit protein nanoparticles with icosahedral symmetry, and single-particle cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of three of them revealed that they were designed with atomic-level accuracy. To transform one of these nanoparticles into a functional immunogen, we reoriented its termini through circular permutation, added a genetically encoded oligomannose-type glycan, and displayed a stabilized trimeric variant of the influenza hemagglutinin receptor-binding domain through a rigid de novo linker. The resultant immunogen elicited potent receptor-blocking and neutralizing antibody responses in mice. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of ML–based protein modeling tools in the design of nanoparticle vaccines. More broadly, by eliminating the requirement for experimentally determined structures of protein building blocks, our method dramatically expands the number of starting points available for designing self-assembling proteins.",

          "abstract": "Peptide therapeutic cancer vaccines are an attractive treatment modality for their safety and manufacturability but have been hindered in clinical translation by low immunogenicity and insufficient CD8 + T cell activation. We developed virus-inspired polymers for endosomal release (VIPER) to address systemic and intracellular delivery obstacles, but durable antitumor immunity remained elusive. Adjuvants stimulating innate immunity, such as stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists, can enhance vaccine potency but risks systemic toxicity and improper immune activation. We developed STING “drugamers” with cathepsin-cleavable linkers and dendritic cell (DC)-targeting moieties for intracellular delivery of STING agonists to DCs. We explored two different STING drugamer structures: a hydrophilic statistical polymer “polySTING” and a diblock polymer “NPSTING” that forms into nanoparticles. PolySTING achieved higher systemic STING agonist delivery, whereas NPSTING is more efficient in delivering STING agonists into inguinal lymph nodes (LNs). Both drugamer platforms enhanced STING activation and DC maturation compared to the free drug. When combined with VIPER, NPSTING generated more antigen-presenting DCs in the LNs and more antigen-responsive CD8 + T cells in the spleens, whereas polySTING generated more tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells and CD8 + DCs. Both VIPER–STING drugamer platforms demonstrated efficacy in a B16-OVA melanoma model and a MC38 colon cancer model. Combination treatment with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor results in tumor remission and tumor immunity in a subset of mice. This study highlights how an endosomolytic peptide vaccine platform combined with two structurally different drugamers induce superior antitumor responses through distinctive mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies focusing on the electrical conductivity and thermal evolution of an early magma ocean at the base of Earth’s mantle have found that basal magma ocean (BMO) convection could have produced the ancient geomagnetic field. By advances in high-resolution dynamo modeling, we find that convection in a thin BMO-like spherical shell is able to sustain strong magnetic fields, including axial dipolar fields similar to current day field structure. However, integrating our dynamo results with improved thermal evolution models and taking the planet’s rapid rotation into account using rotating convective turbulence models implies that an Earth-like magnetic field was unlikely to have been generated in the BMO, a finding relevant to the interpretation of ancient paleomagnetic signatures, Earth’s global-scale dynamics, and long-term planetary evolution. Large uncertainties still remain, calling for refined models of deep Earth thermal and mineralogical processes, accurate determination of prefactors in convective scaling laws, and fully coupled core-BMO dynamo simulations. Nonetheless, our work highlights that BMO-type dynamos intrinsically require a larger product of electrical conductivity and velocity than core-type dynamos, and that they are similarly rotationally constrained, so that velocities are significantly reduced compared to nonrotating estimates.",

When otters were extirpated by paleohumans, modern humans, or killer whales, urchins proliferated, reduced kelp forests to “urchin barrens,” and species-rich assemblages of fishes and invertebrates were lost. These losses affected seals, eagles, sea gulls, fishes, and sea stars that depended on these prey as well as adjacent habitats that had been nourished by exported kelp production.

          "abstract": "Recent work suggests that asymmetric segregation of preexisting and newly synthesized canonical histone 3.1 (H3.1), but not variant histone 3.3A (H3.3A), plays an important role in the asymmetric outcome of Drosophila germline stem cell (GSC) and intestinal stem cell (ISC) divisions. However, this finding relied on the Gal4/UAS system and Flp-out technology to swap expression of exogenous fluorescent proteins—an approach that decouples H3.1 expression from the cell cycle and may be prone to artifacts. Here, by photoswitching photoconvertible H3-Dendra2 proteins expressed under their native controls in living flies, we find that preexisting and newly synthesized H3.1 and H3.3A are symmetrically segregated in dividing ISCs and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) in male testes. While H3.3A was found to be symmetrically segregated during GSC divisions, analysis of the H3.1 segregation in GSCs was complicated by our unexpected finding that H3.1-Dendra2 expressed under its normal control within the context of a histone transgene is not detectable in GSCs, owing to regulatory elements in the 3’UTR that mediate translational repression by the RNA-binding proteins Nanos and Pumilio. Nevertheless, when this repression is obviated by using a 3’UTR devoid of such elements, H3.1-Dendra2 is expressed in GSCs and symmetrically segregated without affecting lineage outcomes. We obtained similar results when the coding sequence of H3.3A was edited to encode H3.1 in the context of an H3.3A-Dendra2 knock-in allele. Our findings thus challenge the prevailing model of asymmetric histone segregation and reveal an unexpected molecular mechanism of posttranscriptional repression of H3.1 in GSCs.",

Yet laboratory tests of decision-making often investigate how animals optimize their behavior to achieve a single, well-defined goal, which is often a nutritive reward. Thus, how animals solve multiobjective optimization problems is not well understood. Here, we devised an ethologically inspired decision-making task to examine how rats balance the pursuit of food and nonfood reinforcement. Rats performed a free-choice patch-foraging task, in which they could earn food in one location (food patch) or interact with a rodent play structure in a different location (toy patch). The cost of switching between patches was manipulated by requiring rats to endure a long or short “travel time” penalty during which they were not able to access either patch. Rats devoted a considerable amount of their limited foraging time to patches of both types, showing a small but significant preference for food patches. In accordance with theoretical models of foraging, when the cost of switching patches was high rats chose longer stay durations in both types of patches, suggesting that similar rational principles guided their pursuit of food and nonfood rewards. Examining the within-session dynamics of time allocation revealed that rats showed an early preference for spending time in toy patches that reversed over the course of the session. Satiety manipulations demonstrated that patch residence time decisions were under goal-directed control and responsive to current needs and recent consumption.",

Recent studies have identified several disease-causing SNARE variants that give rise to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, defined as SNAREopathies. Here, we investigated nine synaptobrevin-2 (VAMP2) disease-causing variants and uncovered their specific SNARE complex affinity, stability, and conformational deficits that drive dysregulated neurotransmission. The neurotransmission deficits we observed parallel the symptomatic heterogeneity of the patients, with some variants displaying a disproportionate augmentation of spontaneous neurotransmitter release. When we examined the spatial organization of this excessive spontaneous release at nanoscale, we found that SNARE complexes composed of these variants formed exclusively outside of RIM scaffolding, revealing a preserved exclusion zone sparing evoked release from pathophysiology. Taken together with the phenotypes of previously reported disease-causing SNARE variants, these findings reveal shared patterns of aberrant neurotransmission across different SNAREs, highlighting the necessity for a functional classification of SNAREopathies to develop therapeutic interventions. The use of clinically relevant genetic manipulations to challenge the synapse provides mechanistic insight into rare diseases while simultaneously revealing fundamental aspects of synaptic physiology.",

          "abstract": "Agricultural landscapes provide material, nonmaterial, and regulating contributions that affect human well-being (nature’s contributions to people, NCP). The responses of these NCP to land-use patterns depend on supporting biota with different habitat requirements, generating trade-offs and synergies. Predictions from spatially explicit modeling of NCP trade-offs and synergies could inform land-use decisions, but these do not typically account for the effects of land-use patterns on the movement of NCP-providing species, nor for interactions among NCP providers. To explore spatial trade-offs and synergies in eight indicators of NCP, we used Bayesian models that allow for interactions among land uses and among NCP using data from 150 grassland sites across rural Germany. We found that spatial arrangements of forest and open habitat influenced many beneficial NCP: acoustic diversity, birdwatching potential, natural enemy abundance, and pollination. In particular, the amount and proximity of land uses in the surrounding landscape, especially forest and open habitat, drove the supply of most NCP. However, detrimental NCP provided by smaller-bodied taxa (herbivory and pathogen infection) responded weakly to landscape factors. Multiple NCP provided by a given taxon responded differently to their surrounding landscape (e.g., bird-provided beneficial caterpillar predation and detrimental seed predation), leading to trade-offs and synergies among NCP over short distances. These were caused by different rates and directions of response to amount and location of land uses. Resulting spatial predictions revealed that the ratio of beneficial to detrimental NCP was maximized in areas with a high (≥95%) area of grassland or mixed forest-grassland (70:30%), rather than purely forest-dominated areas. This suggests promoting seminatural vegetation in agricultural landscapes to provide greater-than-additive benefits to net NCP supply.",

          "abstract": "HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is transforming global HIV prevention, but its implementation coincides with observations of rising bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates among men who have sex with men, raising questions about whether PrEP is preventing one epidemic while facilitating others. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we developed a minimal dynamical model of the simultaneous transmission of HIV and chlamydia (as an example of a curable STI). The model integrates three key mechanisms: 1) risk-mediated self-protective behavior, 2) reduction in condom use among PrEP users, and 3) PrEP-related asymptomatic STI screening. We show that these mechanisms can generate a “testing paradox:” True STI prevalence may decline while observed trends rise. This paradox emerges because increased PrEP uptake amplifies screening intensity, which can lower transmission but simultaneously inflate detection. By systematically mapping the parameter space of PrEP uptake, screening frequency, and risk perception, we identify broad and plausible conditions under which the paradox arises. Our findings reconcile conflicting epidemiological evidence and remark that the net effect of PrEP on STI dynamics depends critically on asymptomatic screening strategies. These results highlight the potential dual role of PrEP programs in reducing both HIV and bacterial STI incidence, while emphasizing the need to align screening and treatment policies to maximize benefits and minimize risks, e.g., antimicrobial resistance.",

We discovered and reported earlier that neurotrophic factor-α1 (NF-α1)/carboxypeptidase E (CPE) reversed neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction in AD mouse models. We then predicted computationally and validated experimentally that CPE interacts with a pharmacophore of six residues on the 5-HT1E receptor (HTR1E) to activate the ERK-BCL2 signaling pathway leading to protection of human neurons against oxidative stress–induced cell death. We now report using this pharmacophore for in silico virtual screening of ~6 million small molecules to discover candidates with similar binding and neuroprotective properties as CPE. This in silico search identified a molecule (Z124) that was verified experimentally to bind to HTR1E with protective efficacy comparable to NF-α1/CPE but requiring a higher concentration. Next, we carried out R-group design optimization based on Z124 to identify 4 compounds predicted to have much better efficacy than Z124. These compounds were synthesized and tested for neuroprotective activity. All four compounds showed binding to HTLA-HTR1E cells comparable to CPE. We determined the Kd for two of these compounds: R9, 1.38 ± 0.2 nM, and R10, 2.1 ± 0.2 nM, to be over 15 times better than CPE. Furthermore, all four new compounds showed protective activity against oxidative stress–induced cytotoxicity in human HEK293 cells stably transfected with HTR1E, as well as human primary neurons. Mechanistically, R9 and R10 activated ERK phosphorylation and increased the mitochondria prosurvival protein, BCL2, making them excellent candidates for further development as a drug to treat neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Self-control—the ability to pursue long-term goals over short-term temptations—is a critical faculty of human cognition, but the cognitive processes enabling self-control are not well understood. Traditional models have focused on impulse inhibition: effortfully inhibiting prepotent motor responses toward a temptation, yielding a stage-based evolution of choice. Other models emphasize dynamic competition between goal and temptation, yielding a more integrative evolution of choice. Although these models represent fundamentally different conceptions of self-control, current methods are inadequate for investigating real-time dynamics, leaving the question of which model best describes self-control unresolved. We investigate these models using mouse-tracking: a dynamic, real-time measure of decision-making in which we measure participants’ computer mouse movements as they navigate tradeoffs between immediate and delayed gratification (e.g., $5 today vs. $20 in 3 mo). We develop a quantitative approach that integrates the rich spatial and temporal information contained in mouse trajectories, and find evidence for both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. Notably, impulse inhibition is less frequent, occurring in only one-quarter of choices favoring larger later rewards over smaller sooner ones. We further find substantial individual variability on who relies on impulse inhibition, with more present-biased individuals more likely to use impulse inhibition to choose larger-later options. Finally, our approach reveals the diverse variability within impulse inhibition and dynamic competition, and accounting for this variability greatly strengthened models predicting out-of-sample choices. Our findings clarify the mechanisms underlying self-control and introduce a robust tool for quantifying real-time decision-making dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Metalloenzymes couple substrate binding and formation of oxidative intermediates to minimize unwanted side reactions. However, the molecular details of such coupling frequently remain ambiguous. Radical S -adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzymes constitute one of the largest groups of metalloenzymes and catalyze various radical-mediated reactions. While radical SAM enzymes significantly accelerate the conserved radical initiation reaction, the reductive cleavage of SAM into 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (5′-dA•), the molecular mechanism of this rate acceleration is largely unexplored. Here, using MoaA, aradical SAM enzyme in the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis, as a model, we reveal the mechanism of substrate-triggered radical initiation. We first elucidated the intact active site structure of MoaA using solution NMR characterization of the C-terminal tail, which was disordered in the reported crystal structures, and its computational docking into the MoaA structure. Together with the comprehensive functional validation, we show that MoaA uses its conformationally flexible C-terminal tail with two conserved Gly residues (GG motif) at the C-terminus as a sensor to detect substrate guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) binding and trigger reductive SAM cleavage. Importantly, mutations that disrupt this regulatory mechanism cause Moco deficiency disease in humans. Comparison of these observations with other radical SAM enzymes provides insight into the general mechanism of substrate-triggered radical initiation in radical SAM enzymes.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, therapeutic cancer vaccines have been extensively investigated, aiming to boost cancer-specific T cells crucial for antitumor activity. The effectiveness of these vaccines is often limited by insufficient immune activation and suboptimal antigen delivery. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an important immune signaling protein that activates host defense genes against infection and cancer. Clinical evaluation of small-molecule STING agonists has shown tepid antitumor responses with immune-related toxicities, particularly when they are administered systemically. To overcome these limitations, we report a stimuli-responsive STING nanovaccine for treating human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancers. The nanovaccine consists of di-amidobenzimidazoles (diABZI) conjugated to a STING-activating polymer, PSC7A, through an azobenzene linker as an adjuvant, and HPV16 E7 protein as an antigen. The nanovaccine is responsive to acidic pH and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), which enhances antitumor immunity with reduced systemic toxicity. Upon intravenous injection, the STING nanovaccine (25 to 30 nm in diameter) achieved efficient codelivery of E7 protein and STING agonists to the myeloid cell populations in the secondary lymphoid organs and tumors. Interestingly, PSC7A uptake induces NQO1 expression in dendritic cells and macrophages for accelerated diABZI cleavage and STING activation. This results in efficient production of E7-specific CD8 + T cells and robust antitumor response in late-stage TC-1 and metastatic MLM3 tumor models. This study illustrates a systemic STING nanovaccine design that allowed not only tumor regression but also markedly reduced systemic toxicity for innate activation to achieve cancer-specific T cell immunity.",

          "abstract": "Light pollution has been traditionally modeled using clear or completely overcast conditions. Usually, atmospheric conditions are more complex and involve variable cloudiness. To predict light pollution in a realistic atmosphere, we developed a model for computing the artificial night sky brightness over the sky hemisphere, considering the presence of different types of clouds and the cloud fraction. The model is applied to the city of Žilina, Slovakia, which has moderate levels of light pollution and a population of approximately 80,000. We performed simulations for various aerosol optical depths, distances from the city, cloud types, and cloud coverages (from clear to completely overcast). Results show that above the simulated city, the clouds can amplify the zenith artificial radiance by more than 15 times and the irradiance incident at ground level by more than 4 times compared to clear-sky conditions. Outside the city, however, the presence of clouds can have a screening effect, lowering the artificial zenith radiance. Additionally, an analysis performed in photopic units demonstrated that over the urban area, amplification caused by low clouds can generate amplification factors of up to 27 in zenith luminance and 17 in horizontal illuminance.

          "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by abnormal protein modifications. These include citrullination of arginine residues by the calcium-activated enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4). However, calcium in body fluids may not fully activate PAD4, suggesting the potential involvement of other activators. In this study, we investigated the ability of glycosaminoglycans (a class of negatively charged polysaccharides) to modulate PAD4 activity. We found that model glycosaminoglycans bind to the enzyme with a nanomolar affinity, increase its calcium sensitivity, and require enzyme dimerization for activation. These effects depend on the size and negative charge of the glycosaminoglycan, and its various natural forms activate PAD4. Thus, our findings elucidate a mechanism by which common physiological compounds modulate PAD4 activity, potentially contributing to disease etiology.",

          "abstract": "Jupiter’s poles feature striking polygons of cyclones that drift westward over time, a motion governed by β -drift (vortex motion caused by the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis force). This study investigates how β -drift and the resulting westward motion depend on the depth of these cyclones. Counterintuitively, shallower cyclones drift more slowly, a consequence of stronger vortex stretching. By employing a 2D quasi-geostrophic model of Jupiter’s polar regions, we constrain the cyclones’ deformation radius, a key parameter that serves as a proxy for their vertical extent, required to replicate the observed westward drift. We then explore possible vertical structures and the static stability of the poles by solving the eigenvalue problem that links the 2D model to a 3D framework, matching the constrained deformation radius. These findings provide a foundation for interpreting upcoming Juno microwave measurements of Jupiter’s north pole, offering insights into the static stability and vertical structure of the polar cyclones. Thus, by leveraging long-term motion as a constraint on vertical dynamics, this work sets the stage for advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of Jupiter’s enigmatic polar cyclones.",

Although theories of automaticity propose that learning should result in faster processing, studies have universally found that learning reduces the amplitude of neural activity, not that it speeds neural activity. Here, we show that with intracranial activity recorded from the hippocampus of twenty-two humans, we could decode the target the participant was about to report faster across learning. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus afforded faster decoding of the to-be-reported target as learning progressed, unlike in prefrontal and temporal regions of the cortex. Furthermore, hippocampal ripples (70 to 180 Hz bursts) appear to support memory retrieval after learning established automaticity. Our findings demonstrate that the hippocampus plays a key role in speeding memory retrieval of previous learning episodes as humans gain expertise, supporting a critical but untested prediction of learning theories.",

          "abstract": "Malaria parasites infect red blood cells where they digest host hemoglobin and release free heme inside a lysosome-like organelle called the food vacuole. To detoxify excess heme, parasites form hemozoin crystals that rapidly tumble inside this compartment. Hemozoin formation is critical for parasite survival and central to antimalarial drug activity. Although the static structural properties of hemozoin have been extensively investigated, crystal motion and its underlying mechanism have remained puzzling. We used quantitative image analysis to determine the timescale of motion, which requires the intact vacuole but does not require the parasite itself. Using single particle tracking and Brownian dynamics simulations with experimentally derived interaction potentials, we found that hemozoin motion exhibits unexpectedly tight confinement but is much faster than thermal diffusion. Hydrogen peroxide, which is generated at high levels in the food vacuole, has been shown to stimulate the motion of synthetic metallic nanoparticles via surface-catalyzed peroxide decomposition that generates propulsive kinetic energy. We observed that peroxide stimulated the motion of isolated crystals in solution and that conditions that suppress peroxide formation slowed hemozoin motion inside parasites. These data suggest that surface-exposed metals on hemozoin catalyze peroxide decomposition to drive crystal motion. This work reveals hemozoin motion in malaria parasites as a biological example of an endogenous self-propelled nanoparticle. This mechanism of propulsion likely serves a physiological role to reduce oxidative stress to parasites from hydrogen peroxide produced by large-scale hemoglobin digestion during blood-stage infection.",

Here, we investigate the specialized bacterial pouch, a symbiont-containing organ present exclusively in adult workers of Tetraponera nigra -group ants, revealing its crucial role in colony-wide nutrient provisioning. Using a combination of microscopy, amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, and 15 N-urea feeding experiments on four species in the group, we show that its adult-specific pouch-associated microbiota, primarily Tokpelaia , recycle nitrogen from urea and convert it into amino acids which are provisioned to adult workers and developing larvae. Disruption of this nitrogen-recycling symbiosis severely impairs larval growth and overall colony fitness. Our results show how caste-restricted microbial organs can centralize metabolic functions at the colony level, challenging individual-centric paradigms of host–microbe mutualism and providing insights into the pivotal role of microbial symbionts in superorganismal adaptation to nutritional constraints.",

          "abstract": "The Ordovician saw one of the greatest evolutionary radiations in the Earth’s history, precipitating the assembly of modern animal-dominated ecologies in the aftermath of the Cambrian Explosion. However, Ordovician nonmineralized faunas are rare and mostly sample ecologically marginal settings. We describe small carbonaceous fossils (SCFs), including semiarticulated elements preserving submicrometric detail, from epicratonic deposits of the Deadwood and Winnipeg formations (ND). The Osterberg SCFs, associated with biostratigraphically informative conodonts and graptolites, record two successive biotas of Cambrian-Tremadocian (the “lower Osterberg” biota) and Darriwilian (the “upper Osterberg” biota) ages, demonstrating a long-term persistence of high-quality, Burgess Shale-type microfossil preservation after the end of the Cambrian. Their components open a window on normal marine, well-oxygenated Ordovician shelf habitats, revealing taxa and functional morphologies unrecorded by coeval macrofossils. These include specialized grazing and predatory molluskan radulae, triturative crustaceomorph molars, the oldest known eurypterid-type cuticles, and microphagous priapulid worms. The Osterberg fossils attest to an Ordovician co-occurrence of cryptic taxa and feeding adaptations, reminiscent of the most ecologically modern Cambrian biotas, alongside classic later-Paleozoic forms like colonial zooplankton and biomineralized early vertebrates. By contrast, they do not record classic Burgess Shale-style taxa typical of marginal or deeper-water Ordovician assemblages. These results demonstrate a lasting presence of cryptic, modern-style shelf faunas throughout the earliest Paleozoic, suggesting that exceptional Ordovician macrofossil sites are unrepresentative of the broader state of their coeval biosphere.",

The recent review by the US Food and Drug Administration of a single, prefilled syringe of the SHINGRIX™ vaccine has highlighted the importance of this question. While dynamic light scattering is well suited for measuring average particle sizes across populations, fundamental principles behind scattering limit the resolution to distinguish subtle differences at the tens of nanometer scale between similar samples. To address this, we introduce an alternative approach: stochastic electrochemistry, which allows for the investigation of specific properties of individual particles, one at a time. By introducing an electrochemically active species, hexacyanoferrate(II/III) into the vaccine solution, we observe discrete current drops when particles irreversibly collide with a microelectrode. Such events can be correlated directly with particle size. As a proof of concept, we use this technique to analyze the interactions of streptavidin-functionalized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) beads with biotinylated bovine serum albumin at vaccine-level concentrations and apply what we learned to the components of the SHINGRIX™ vaccine. We then present a time-trial comparison of data from current commercial SHINGRIX™ vaccines using dynamic light scattering and stochastic electrochemistry, analyzing the AS01 B adjuvant alone and the AS01 B adjuvant combined with the glycoprotein E (gE protein). While our method elucidates important properties at the single adjuvant level, our results paint a quantitative kinetic picture of coformulation stability that is currently not achievable by dynamic light scattering.",

Here, we report our finding that manganese ion (Mn 2+ ) potentiates various TLR agonists, leading to robust activation of the TLR pathway and the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway among innate immune cells. In particular, we have observed robust antitumor efficacy after intratumoral administration of a TLR3 agonist and Mn 2+ . To achieve systemic codelivery of TLR3 agonist and Mn 2+ , we have developed a low-molecular-weight poly(inosinic:cytidylic acid)-Mn 2+ coordination lipid nanoparticle (PLCMP). When administered intravenously in tumor-bearing mice, PLCMP successfully accumulated in tumor, induced innate immune activation, generated tumor-specific T cells, and exerted antitumor efficacy in TLR3- and STING-dependent manner without triggering overt toxicity. Moreover, PLCMP in combination with α-PD-1 therapy achieved long-lasting antitumor efficacy in multiple murine tumor models. Furthermore, vaccination with PLCMP carrying TC-1 tumor antigen peptide elicited strong antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses and remodeled the tumor microenvironment, resulting in robust therapeutic efficacy. Overall, these results show that simultaneous activation of the TLR3 and STING pathways via PLCMP provides a promising strategy for immunotherapy and vaccination against cancer.",

          "abstract": "The systematic variation in relative brain size among vertebrate classes remains poorly understood. Here, based on the expensive brain hypothesis, we propose that two broad constraints explain much of the variation: 1) the ability to produce large offspring, and so provide them with the energy required for constructing larger brains, and 2) the ability to sustain continuously high body temperatures, because cooler and varying brain temperatures reduce brain performance and thus fitness. We therefore predicted that encephalization (major evolutionary increases in brain size) only happened where changes in physiology or natural history created these abilities. First, comparative analyses across all major vertebrate classes (n = 2600 species) revealed that protecting or provisioning eggs or embryos is associated with larger newborns. Subsequent analyses at the class level confirmed that newborn size and adult brain size underwent correlated evolution in birds, mammals, and cartilaginous fishes, but not in other fishes, amphibians, and reptiles. Second, we found a positive relationship between mean body temperature and brain size within each class (albeit sometimes insignificant). Third, a combined analysis across all vertebrates revealed a positive interaction between the effects of body temperature and newborn size. In conclusion, encephalization became most pronounced in vertebrate lineages that can both produce large offspring, reflecting internal fertilization with matrotrophy, and sustain high body temperature, partly linked to endothermy.",

Whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing were performed on carcinoma, polyp, and normal mucosa samples from multiple sites from seven patients with GAPPS (n = 54 samples). We comprehensively investigated genomic alterations (including copy number alterations and somatic mutations), clonal architecture, and transcriptome dynamics during carcinogenesis. Genomic evolutionary analysis showed that in GAPPS, somatic mutations of APC occur in carcinoma and polyp while mutations of KRAS additionally occur in carcinoma. We also found the co-occurrence of APC and KRAS mutations in carcinoma recurrently both across cases and within subclones of the same case.

          "abstract": "The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS–STING) pathway is an important DNA-sensing mechanism that increases T cell trafficking and activation in tumors and reverses the immunosuppressive phenotype of myeloid cells. Therefore, direct STING targeting using synthetic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) is an attractive strategy for treating lymphocyte-depleted and myeloid cell–enriched tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM). However, inadequate bioavailability and poor cellular accumulation limit the clinical development of CDNs, particularly for noninvasive administration strategies. Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) have emerged as promising modular constructs for creating therapeutic lead compounds for many diseases, including different forms of cancer. Here, we report the development of cGAS-activating SNAs that consist of gold nanoparticle cores functionalized with a shell of densely packed interferon-stimulatory DNA oligonucleotides (ISD 45 -SNAs). These nanostructures bind to cGAS, the sensor of cytosolic dsDNA upstream of STING, promoting the catalytic production of endogenous CDNs and downstream STING activation more potently than clinically tested CDNs. When administered intranasally or intratumorally to poorly immunogenic syngeneic GBM mouse models, ISD 45 -SNAs inhibit tumor growth more effectively than CDNs and promote long-term animal subject survival through specific cGAS–STING pathway activation. ISD 45 -SNAs induce a proinflammatory immune microenvironment enriched with effector T cells and proinflammatory macrophages. When coadministered with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), they abolish GBM tumor development and induce long-term antiglioma immunity. These studies establish ISD 45 -SNAs as an immune-stimulatory modality for triggering innate and adaptive immune responses and increasing ICI efficacy for GBM treatment.",

While posttranslational modifications facilitate aberrant activation of bypass signaling networks, the specific contribution of ZDHHC palmitoyl acyltransferase-mediated palmitoylation remains poorly characterized. Here, ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation contributes to osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Patient samples, along with in vitro and in vivo functional studies, indicated that ZDHHC11 upregulation reduces the sensitivity of tumor cells to osimertinib by promoting malignant phenotype. Mechanistically, we establish AXL receptor tyrosine kinase as the critical substrate. ZDHHC11 catalyzes AXL palmitoylation at Cys869, inducing plasma membrane retention and constitutive activation. This triggers downstream PI3K–AKT signaling, with AXL knockout alleviating the effect of ZDHHC11-driven resistance. Crucially, pharmacological inhibition ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation with the broad-spectrum palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate effectively augmented the antitumor effects of osimertinib. Collectively, ZDHHC11 regulates osimertinib resistance in a palmitoylation-dependent manner.

Tracking terrestrial DOM in the ocean has proven challenging due to factors such as the instability of terrestrial biomarkers, indistinguishable carbon isotopes from biogeochemical fractionation, and similar chemical composition between terrestrial and oceanic DOM. Here, we show that the terrestrial contribution to oceanic organic carbon pools is 1.7 to 2.5 times higher than previously assumed, highlighting the need to adjust global carbon cycle models. We derive these estimates by bridging high-performance liquid chromatography with ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the presence of terrestrial molecules that are transported from rivers to the ocean and estimate their contribution to oceanic DOM. We identified 269 molecular formulae (MF) that are likely transported from land to the ocean. These formulae exhibited resistance to biological and photochemical degradation in incubation experiments, and were widely distributed in global rivers, marginal seas, and open oceans, suggesting that they are ubiquitous in inland and ocean waters and have a similar source. By relating the abundances of terrestrially derived MF to dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and radiocarbon measurements, we estimated that 16.7 to 25.0% of oceanic DOM is likely derived from rivers.",

          "abstract": "Anomer-retaining glycoside hydrolases (GHs) generally catalyze a double displacement reaction via a covalent intermediate. However, neutron crystallography of glycoside ligand-bound states has not been performed. In this study, we investigated β-glucosidase Td2F2 from GH family 1 as a model enzyme for anomer-retaining GHs. We determined joint X-ray/neutron structures of Td2F2 in ligand-free form, covalent intermediate with a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro glucoside (2F-Glc) inhibitor, and glucose product complex using hydrogen/deuterium-exchanged crystals at room temperature, with neutron diffraction resolutions of 1.80–1.70 Å. Extensive hydrogen bonds recognizing the hydroxy groups of 2F-Glc were identified, along with the positions of deuterium atoms. The acid/base catalyst residue Glu166 was anchored by a hydrogen bond network pivoted by Asn293. Tyr295 forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic nucleophile residue Glu352 in the ligand-free and glucose complex forms, while the active center undergoes significant reorganization, including side chain displacements of Glu352 and Tyr295, as well as the incorporation of a water molecule. An alternative conformation of Tyr295 was observed in the 2F-Glc structure at room temperature, suggesting its role in positioning the nucleophilic water during the deglycosylation step. Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic analyses of Y295F mutant supported the functional involvement of Tyr295 in both glycosylation and deglycosylation steps. The tyrosine hydrogen bonded to the nucleophile is also conserved in many other anomer-retaining GH families, underscoring its importance in catalysis. Based on the deuterium/hydrogen positions determined from neutron structures, we proposed a detailed reaction mechanism for Td2F2.",

One expression of these is a provariance bias (PVB), i.e., risk-seeking manifests as a preference for choosing options with higher variances/uncertainty. Using a magnitude learning task, we show that individual differences in PVB are explained by a model that includes asymmetric learning rates, allowing differential learning from positive prediction errors (PPEs) and negative prediction errors (NPEs). Using high-resolution 7T functional MRI (fMRI), we identify distinct neural responses to PPEs and NPEs in value-sensitive regions, including habenula (Hb), ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in humans. Notably, prediction error signals in NAcc and vmPFC were boosted for high variance options. NPEs responses in NAcc were associated with a negative bias in learning rates that was linked to the strength of Hb-VTA negative functional coupling during NPE encoding, with a mediation analysis revealing this coupling influenced NAcc responses to NPEs via an impact on learning rate bias. Our findings implicate Hb-VTA functional coupling in the emergence of risk preferences during learning, with implications for psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Memory consolidation refers to a process of engram reorganization and stabilization that is thought to occur primarily during sleep through a combination of neural replay, homeostatic plasticity, synaptic maturation, and pruning. From a computational perspective, however, this process remains puzzling, as it is unclear how to incorporate the underlying mechanisms into a common mathematical model of learning and memory. Here, we propose a solution by deriving a self-supervised consolidation model that uses replay and two-factor synapses to encode memories in neural networks in a way that maximizes the robustness of cued recall with respect to intrinsic synaptic noise. We show that the dynamics of this optimization make the connectivity sparse and offer a unified account of several experimentally observed signs of consolidation, such as multiplicative homeostatic scaling, task-driven synaptic pruning, increased neural stimulus selectivity, and preferential strengthening of weak memories. The model also reproduces developmental trends in connectivity and stimulus selectivity better than previous models. Finally, it predicts that intrinsic synaptic noise fluctuations should scale sublinearly with synaptic strength; we find support for this in a meta-analysis of published synaptic imaging datasets.",

The structure reveals that a periplasmic-facing pocket of MreD interacts with multiple membrane-proximal regions of MreC. We use single-molecule FRET to show that MreD controls the conformation of MreC through these contacts, inducing a state primed for Rod complex activation.

          "abstract": "Self-organization underpins the emergence of complex structure in living systems but remains a major challenge for engineering synthetic multicellular materials. Here, we present intrinsically disordered protein display platform (iDP 2 ), a generalizable platform for high-density display of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) on the surface of Escherichia coli . iDP 2 uses CsgF as a surface-tethered scaffold, enabling efficient fusion and presentation of protein domains that lack stable tertiary structure. Successful display selectively favors disordered sequences, which, when endowed with phase separation propensity, drive the formation of dynamic cellular condensates. Programming cells with orthogonal IDPs enables sequence-specific segregation of mixed populations, allowing the design of spatially organized living assemblies. The aggregation state of these condensates is dynamically tunable by environmental cues such as ionic strength, and temperature, with responses predictable from the known phase behavior of the displayed IDPs. Extrusion processing of condensates generates macroscale filaments that maintain structural integrity and population segregation. By linking protein sequence to emergent collective behaviors, iDP 2 offers a programmable framework for rational control of cell–cell interactions. This approach establishes a foundation for engineering living materials with customizable viscoelastic properties, environmental responsiveness, and multicellular organization. More broadly, our work highlights the potential of disordered protein motifs as versatile tools for the design of adaptive, self-organizing biological systems.",

Among the orthoflaviviruses, tick-borne encephalitis viruses (TBEV) are an antigenic group that causes severe neurological disease in humans. However, the entry receptors for TBEV, which contribute to cell and tissue tropism, remain largely unknown. Because recent studies identified members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family as possible receptors for some orthoflaviviruses and distantly related alphaviruses, we performed a targeted screen in transgenic cells expressing different LDLR members and identified LRP8 (also called ApoER2) as a candidate receptor for TBEV strains from the five different subtypes. Genetic ablation of LRP8 impaired TBEV reporter virus particle or authentic virus infection in neuronal cells. Reciprocally, complementation or ectopic expression of LRP8 increased TBEV infection. LRP8 was used as a receptor by multiple strains of TBEV and several closely related tick-borne viruses but not by the mosquito-transmitted orthoflaviviruses we tested. LRP8 bound directly to TBEV envelope proteins and promoted virus attachment to and internalization in cells through LDLR type A (LA) binding domain, which we narrowed down to LA domains 1 and 2 through functional experiments. Soluble LRP8-Fc decoy receptors neutralized TBEV in cell culture, and reduced viral infection was observed in Lrp8 −/− neuronal cells obtained from knockout mice. Our studies establish a role for LRP8 in TBEV entry and infection, which has implications for the development of soluble receptor, antibody-based, and vaccine countermeasures.",

It affects the reproductive transition in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the significant vectors of numerous devastating human diseases. Here, we show that E93 is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis during the reproductive cycle of mosquitoes. E93 deficiency led to insufficient production of insulin-like peptide 3 (ILP3) from insulin-producing cells in the brain, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), a key regulator in the insulin signaling pathway. This reduction facilitated the nuclear translocation of FoxO and enhanced the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which in turn respectively activated the transcription of genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) during gluconeogenesis and reduced glycogen synthesis. Further insulin rescue and the luciferase activity assays demonstrated that E93 directly inhibited PEPCK transcription. Ultimately, E93 -depleted mosquitoes exhibited systemic metabolic reprogramming, characterized by the dysregulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. Our findings establish that E93 orchestrates metabolic homeostasis by coordinating the insulin signaling cascade and directly regulating PEPCK expression, thus providing an intrinsic connection between endocrine signaling and E93-mediated reproduction in mosquitoes.",

However, while nanoparticle vaccines have elevated uptake, the impact of intracellular protein release and how this affects processing and downstream responses are not fully understood. Herein, we reveal how tuning unmodified antigen release rate, specifically through modulation of metal–organic framework (MOF) pore size, influences the type and extent of raised adaptive immunity. We use two MOFs in the NU-100x series with 1.4 nm difference in pore diameter, employ facile postsynthesis loading to achieve significant internalization of model protein antigen ovalbumin ( ca. 1.4 mg/mg), and observe distinct antigen release and intracellular processing profiles influenced by MOF pore size. We investigate how this difference in release biases downstream CD8 + , T H 1, and T H 2 T cell responses. Ovalbumin-loaded NU-1003 induced 1.8-fold higher CD8 + :CD4 + T cell proliferation ratio and displayed 2.2-fold greater ratio of CD4 + T H 1:T H 2 cytokines compared to ovalbumin-loaded NU-1000. Antigen released from NU-1000 in vivo exhibited stronger antigen-specific IgG responses, which is dependent on CD4 + T cells (up to ninefold stronger long-term antibody production and 5.9-fold higher IgG1:IgG2a ratio), compared to NU-1003. When translated to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, RBD-loaded NU-1000 induced 60.5-fold higher IgG1:IgG2a compared to NU-1003. Wild-type RBD-loaded NU-1000 immunization also induced a greater breadth of epitope recognition compared to NU-1003, as evidenced by increased binding antibodies to the Omicron RBD variant. Overall, this work highlights how antigen release significantly influences immunity induced by vaccines and offers a path to employ unmodified antigen release kinetics to drive personalized protective responses.",

In this study, injectable scaffold vaccines are presented as a modality to augment host immunity and mitigate orthopedic device infection.

When loaded with a pool of antigens collected via an engineered human opsonin, these scaffold vaccines decreased the bacterial burden against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains in a murine model of orthopedic device infection. Scaffold vaccination was ~100× more effective in decreasing S. aureus burden compared to prior published immunotherapy attempts in murine models of orthopedic device infection.

          "abstract": "Triple oxygen isotope values of xylem water were measured along the length of smooth horsetail stems ( Equisetum laevigatum ). Extreme isotope enrichment is observed moving from base to stem tip. δ 18 O values range from −8.3‰ at the base to 82.6‰ at the tip. Δ′ 17 O values range from 0 to −1,797 per meg. The δ 18 O and Δ′ 17 O values are the most extreme measured for any terrestrial material and expand the known range of Δ′ 17 O values by fivefold for mass-dependent fractionation on Earth. The extreme isotope enrichments are explained using a hybrid evaporation/chain-of-lakes model, allowing us to refine the leaf respiration coefficient to θ k = 0.511 ± 0.001. This new value is required to explain the low Δ′ 17 O values previously measured in desert plants and animals and is critical when using fossil samples for paleoclimate reconstruction. Coexisting phytoliths and stem water were also measured. The 1000 ln 18 α silica-water value at the plant base (35.89‰) appears to be in isotopic equilibrium, with far smaller fractionations of 10.3‰ near the tip. The smaller fractionations at higher levels are explained by continual silica deposition as the plant elongates and the δ 18 O values of each segment become higher. The overall integrated phytolith value is a combination of early and late silica growth. The Δ′ 17 O silica − Δ′ 17 O water values are not in equilibrium, explained by a kinetic isotope effect, with a λ value of 0.5205 vs. 0.5244 for equilibrium. Phytolith isotope values may lead to erroneous interpretations for paleoclimate reconstruction.",

The majority of breast cancers are estrogen receptor α-positive (ER+) and are commonly treated with hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen that inhibit ER activity. The TP53 tumor suppressor gene, encoding the p53 protein, is the most frequently mutated gene in breast cancer, and TP53 mutations are associated with diminished tamoxifen response and worse prognosis for breast cancer patients. Here, we report that in breast cancer cells p53 and ER cooperate to regulate the transcription of a set of genes encoding chromatin modifiers. The net result is a global increase in H3K4me3 and decrease in H3K9me3 chromatin marks. The resultant “open” chromatin is associated with increased transcription of luminal cell identity genes and enhanced tamoxifen sensitivity. Conversely, diminished p53 control of these chromatin modulators is associated with the evolution of tamoxifen resistance and cancer stem cell properties.",

          "abstract": "Despite the growing recognition of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) as valuable prognostic markers in certain cancer types, detailed studies on their development and therapeutic function remain limited. This is partially due to the lack of appropriate preclinical animal models. In this study and based on our earlier work [D. Coppola et al., Am. J. Pathol. 179 , 37–45 (2011); J. L. Messina et al., Sci. Rep. 2 , 765 (2012)], we hypothesized that encapsulating lymphoid chemokines and cytokines in controlled-release biomaterials would allow for their sustained delivery to the local tissue microenvironment, promote immune T-cell and B-cell accumulation, and lead to the in situ formation of TLS-like structures. To test this hypothesis, we encapsulated CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13, and lymphotoxin-α1β2 in lipid-coated microparticles (MPs) and embedded them in a biodegradable thermosensitive hydrogel designed to gel rapidly and release encapsulated payloads at injection sites over several days. In mice, subcutaneous injections of chemokine/cytokine-releasing MPs in hydrogel led to a substantial increase in CD45 + immune cell accumulation within newly developed structures surrounding the residual hydrogel after 3 wk. This influx was accompanied by a marked increase in the numbers of CD19 + B cells and CD3 + T cells. Using a mouse model of melanoma, we further show these induced structures can suppress tumor growth by promoting tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses. These findings indicate that chemokine/cytokine-releasing MPs in hydrogel can induce lymphoid structures resembling TLSs, highlighting their potential both as preclinical models for elucidating mechanisms regulating TLS formation and as platforms for therapeutic interventions against tumors.",

          "abstract": "Biomanufactured fibers produced through fermentation processes provide a promising pathway to decouple textile production from agricultural land. This would free up arable land for food cultivation and contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. Protein fibers from natural sources such as cocoon silk, collagen, and soy have attracted attention since the last century. However, commercial production declined with the rise of cheaper synthetic fibers and competition for food crops. Recently, renewed interest in protein fibers has emerged as a means to minimize plastic pollution, fueled by advances in fermentation, even though challenges related to yield, costs, and industrial spinning persist. Here, we studied a lyocell-based technique for spinning protein fibers using yeast biomass purified through an enzymatic method. We demonstrated that the enzymatic approach produces insoluble proteins that can be continuously spun for over 100 h of production time. Pilot-scale production exhibited stable spinning behavior with high viscosity and consistency quality. We achieved fiber fineness between 1.7 and 2.2 dtex, with strength values reaching 23 cN/tex, which is 50% higher than those of natural protein fibers such as wool. Life cycle assessment indicates that fermentation-based protein fibers require significantly less land and water than natural fibers while providing a reduced environmental footprint. Techno-economic analysis indicates a cost of $6 per kilogram at a production rate of 6,750 t annually. Adopting biomanufacturing-based protein fibers marks a significant advancement toward a future where fiber needs are fulfilled without compromising the planet’s capacity to nourish its growing population.",

          "abstract": "Exosomes are signaling messengers facilitating intercellular communication by delivering molecular cargo. Here, we observed increased levels of exosomal periostin (POSTN) in the blood plasma of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Monocytes contributed to elevated levels of exosomal POSTN, and deletion of Postn in myeloid cells reduced retinal neovascularization (RNV). Monocytes isolated from the blood of PDR patients or under high glucose conditions exhibited heightened glycolytic activity and elevated histone lactylation levels, particularly H4K8 lactylation (H4K8la). Knockout of hexokinase 2 ( Hk2 ) in myeloid cells led to reduced H4K8la and POSTN levels and inhibited RNV. Exogenous exosomal POSTN partially reversed the angiogenic defects caused by Postn or Hk2 deletion in myeloid cells. Mechanistically, exosomal POSTN stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor -1 alpha and upregulated the expression of angiogenic genes. Notably, treatment with metformin reduced RNV by decreasing monocyte glycolysis and lowering exosomal POSTN levels. In summary, these findings underscore the critical role of circulating exosomal POSTN in RNV and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for angiogenic retinopathies.",

          "abstract": "Bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) therapeutics that link T cells and tumor cells to induce tumor cell lysis have demonstrated great success in the clinic for the treatment of many cancers. However, T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment leads to tumor cell escape and BiTE therapy resistance. Herein, we developed a drug-loaded bispecific T cell nanoengager (NanoBiTE) to overcome this obstacle. NanoBiTE is composed of a mesoporous silica nanoparticle encapsulating the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist PBF-509 as a core, with a lipid layer surface coating as a shell and modification with anti-CD19 and anti-CD3 antibodies for tumor and T cell binding, respectively. Like the traditional BiTE blinatumomab, NanoBiTE can engage T cells with CD19 + tumor cells to promote tumor cell lysis. However, unlike blinatumomab, which tends to induce T cell exhaustion, we showed that the release of PBF-509 from NanoBiTE suppressed the A2AR pathway and substantially improved tumor cell killing induced by NanoBiTE. Moreover, NanoBiTE treatment led to substantially reduced tumor burden in vivo in a humanized mouse model. Our results demonstrate that NanoBiTE is a safe and potent bispecific therapy that can also reduce T cell exhaustion for cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "The β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthases are pivotal elongation enzymes that catalyze the condensation of acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP with malonyl-ACP to produce β-ketoacyl-ACP. Among these, the homologous enzymes FabH (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III) and the recently characterized BioZ play crucial roles, initiating the biosynthetic pathways for fatty acids and biotin, respectively. FabH primarily utilizes acetyl-CoA as the primer substrate, whereas BioZ exclusively condenses the longer glutaryl-CoA, which contains a charged ω-carboxyl group. Despite their similar catalytic mechanisms, the molecular bases for the strict substrate specificities remain undetermined. Here, we report crystal structures of the BioZ: glutaryl-CoA cocrystalized complexes and demonstrate the ability to swap the physiological functions and substrate specificities between FabH and BioZ. This functional interchange was achieved by grafting the β8-α9 loop plus residue Ala317 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens BioZ to Escherichia coli FabH, resulting in a shift in substrate preference from acetyl-CoA to glutaryl-CoA. The reverse manipulations of BioZ resulted in FabH activity. These data identify the structural elements as the minimal determinants of substrate specificity and enzyme function. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of substrate recognition and catalysis by FabH and BioZ and offer a foundation for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies against these enzymes.",

          "abstract": "The population receptive field (pRF) approach to functional measurement of the sensory properties of magnetic resonance (MR)-identified locations in the human brain was extended to include the third dimension of binocular depth. In total, pRFs were extracted from nine different visual areas (V1, V2, V3, V3AB, V4, V5, V7, Ventral Occipital Cortex: VOC, Lateral Occipital Cortex: LOC) of the human cortex and, where possible, comparisons were made with electrophysiological recordings from homologous areas in the macaque cortex. Human and macaque V1 showed strikingly similar information profiles for the encoding of binocular depth. Further, both human and macaque V5 showed consistent changes in preferred binocular depth of the stimulus, dependent on whether the stimuli were binocularly correlated or anticorrelated. Across the nine areas of the visual cortex explored, the population profiles of pRFs for binocular depth showed evidence of a greater responsiveness to relative depth in higher visual cortical areas, again consistent with the findings from macaque electrophysiology. Overall, the pRF measures of cortical response were more sensitive to fine-scale differences of binocular depth, compared with many existing electrophysiological measures of tuning for binocular depth. Our results show that the pRF method can be extended beyond the characterization of RFs in retinotopic coordinates to reveal higher-order, derived visual properties. The parallels between noninvasive, MR-based measures of pRFs in humans and the electrophysiological recordings of single neurons in experimental animals make a further step toward validation of the pRF methodology.",

          "abstract": "Quantifying heat transport in turbulent convection remains a challenge. The two competing models of heat transport predict that the nondimensional heat flux, known as the Nusselt number (Nu), is proportional to Ra 1 / 3 (classical scaling) and Ra 1 / 2 (ultimate-regime scaling), where Ra is the Rayleigh number. Some experiments and simulations report that the Nusselt number transitions from near classical scaling, Ra 0.30 , to a larger power law when the boundary layer turns turbulent near Ra ≈ 10 14 . However, others find Ra 0.30 scaling to continue for larger Ra. In this work, we perform a comparative study of Rayleigh-Bénard, compressible, and periodic convection in two and three dimensions using direct numerical simulations. We show that up to Ra = 10 16 in two dimensions and up to Ra = 10 13 in three dimensions, the positive and negative energy fluxes in Rayleigh-Bénard and compressible convection are nearly equal. However, in the distribution function, the positive fluxes have longer tails than the negative ones, and the differences between the positive and negative fluxes scale as Ra − 0.20 , which leads to Nu ∼ Ra 0.30 . The above robust and universal properties, even in the presence of a logarithmic layer in compressible convection, indicate a likely absence of the ultimate regime in turbulent thermal convection. In contrast, periodic convection, which is related to the ultimate regime, exhibits a predominantly positive heat flux.",

The prevailing view in the field is that phospholipid scramblases on the plasma membrane act without headgroup preference. Here, we report contrary experimental evidence based on a phospholipid scrambling assay that quantifies the fluorescence polarization (FP) of nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-labeled phospholipids for kinetic monitoring of phospholipid scrambling on the plasma membrane of living cells.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying the interactions between the sensory and emotional aspects of chronic pain remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of FKBP51, a regulator of the stress response, in mediating both sensory and emotional symptoms of chronic pain. Inhibition of FKBP51, via genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade, in persistent joint pain reduced fast-onset sensory, functional and activity-related symptoms, as well as late anxio-depressive comorbidities. FKBP51 inhibition after the establishment of the hypersensitive state provided only temporary symptoms relief, while acute inhibition at disease onset protected from the full development of sensory and anxio-depressive symptoms for up to 6 mo. Our results also indicated that early pain symptoms could predict the late sensory and emotional outcomes of chronic pain. RNA sequencing of spinal cord tissue revealed that late FKBP51 inhibition transiently altered nociceptive genes associated with mechanical hypersensitivity. In contrast, early inhibition persistently downregulated the Naaa gene, a key regulator of the transition to chronic pain, and reorganized spinal cilia. Our results indicate that early FKBP51 inhibition after injury can persistently reduce chronic pain and prevent the onset of associated emotional comorbidities by modulating critical spinal neurobiological pathways that play pivotal roles in the transition to chronic pain.",

Relying solely on the spontaneous organization of the three components, the resulting fiber/pollen-CS (FP-CS) biocomposites exhibit superior mechanical strength (~80 MPa) and maintain water stability for up to 100 d. Remarkably, they also enable seamless water-resistant sealing through simple CS application, facilitating ecofriendly production of straws, packaging, and water-resistant patches.

RANK, a cognate receptor for RANKL, is abundantly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells and controls vascular permeability by regulating the expression patterns of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. High RANKL expression was detected in perivascular C–X–C motif chemokine ligand 12-abundant reticular (CAR) stromal cells. Specific deletion of RANKL expression in CAR cells abrogated the vascular leakage, suggesting that perivascular RANKL is responsible for controlling permeability.

Here, we report an approach for optimizing the antigen processing pathway and efficiency by using the modular design of spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanostructures. We utilized the substrate specificity of endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase1 (ERAP1), a protease known to generate major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) epitopes in the endoplasmic reticulum, to design two ERAP1-responsive peptide linkers (EPLs). The peptide linkers append the peptide antigen onto the SNAs to bias the processing pathway toward ERAP1 and to vary the antigen processing efficiency. The two EPLs varied ERAP1 antigen processing efficiency by 10-fold. Subsequently, the EPLs increased colocalization of the antigen with ERAP1 by up to ca. 58% when compared to an SNA that did not employ this linker. The EPL that drove more efficient cleavage, augmented antigen surface presentation by 30%, ex vivo CD8 + T cell proliferation by fivefold, and in vivo generation of proinflammatory and effector memory CD8 + T cells by 5% and 18%, respectively. Furthermore, the more efficiently processed EPL-containing SNA resulted in a 2.5-fold more effective inhibition of E.G7-OVA lymphoma tumors in vivo. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of the deliberate and rational design of vaccine structures to spatially bias antigen processing and elevate its processing efficiency to augment immune stimulation.",

Intriguingly, a divergent PBP paralog (PBP4) in noctuid moths has been identified exhibiting predominant expression in the male reproductive system, though its functional significance remained elusive. In this study with Spodoptera exigua , we demonstrated that PBP4 is specifically expressed in male accessory glands (MAGs) and transferred to females during copulation. CRISPR-mediated PBP4 knockout (PBP4 −/− ) significantly reduced male reproductive success via impaired sperm competition, evidenced by diminished offspring sired. Transcriptomic and qPCR analyses revealed expressional correlation between PBP4 and the odorant receptor coreceptor (Orco), and similar sperm competition deficits were observed in Orco −/− males. Furthermore, both mutants exhibited compromised sperm motility and reduced sperm transfer from spermatophores to spermathecae. In vitro sperm motility assays showed that a specific agonist of Orco, VUAA1, robustly enhanced sperm motility in an Orco-dependent manner. Analyses of four additional moth species, including noctuids and non-noctuids, revealed a similar specific expression in the male reproductive tracts in all of them.

We test this hypothesis using precision neuroimaging of individual human brains on diverse tasks involving perception and cognition in the domains of familiar people, places, and objects. We find that thinking about people and places elicits responses in distinct areas of high-level association cortex within the default mode network, spanning the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Person- and place-preferring brain regions are systematically spatially adjacent across cortical zones. These areas have strongly domain-specific response profiles across visual, semantic, and episodic tasks and are specifically functionally connected to other parts of association cortex with like domain preference. Social and spatial networks remain anatomically separated at the apex of a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient across cortex and include regions with anatomical connections to the hippocampal formation.

Here, we reveal that endometrial SRF is dysregulated in human endometriosis and is critical for female reproductive success in mice through regulation of endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis identified decreased endometrial SRF expression in infertile endometriosis patient tissues. RNAi-based SRF knockdown in human endometrial stromal cells resulted in disrupted cytoskeletal structure, viability, and decidual response. Conditional Srf knockout mice (Srf d/d ) generated using the Pgr Cre were infertile with implantation failure, lack of decidual response, and development of severe endometrial fibrosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified dramatic changes in Srf d/d endometrial cell populations including large-scale myeloid immune cell infiltration. Srf d/d stromal fibroblasts displayed aberrant cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix gene expression and downregulation of genes important for decidual growth response. Srf -deficient epithelial cells displayed the most prominent dysregulation, strongly overexpressing estrogenic innate inflammatory genes including C3 and Lcn2 and fibrogenic genes Mmp7 and Fbln1 , all of which paralleled patterns in human endometriosis patient data that we identified through comparative analysis using a published single-cell atlas.

          "abstract": "Cancer cells comprise a significant proportion of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and often have compromised expression or repression of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which prevents effective stimulation of interferon genes (STING) signaling. Here, we leverage the cancer cells and hijack their cellular machinery for increased production of cGAMP, differing from conventional strategies whereby synthetic STING agonists are delivered to immune cells in the TME as a bolus dose, are rapidly cleared and can cause systemic toxicity. Increasing evidence suggests that cGAMP derived from cancer cells can act on proximal immune cells, activating STING, contributing to an antitumor immune response. We used lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver mRNA coding for cGAS which catalyzes the production of cGAMP. We observed dramatic increases in extracellular and intracellular cGAMP when cancer cells were transfected with cGAS mRNA and genomic DNA, the substrate for cGAS. We confirmed that cGAS and cGAMP are functional due to activation of immune cells, through a combination of extracellular transfer and cell–cell contact mechanisms. Treatment of syngeneic murine melanoma with cGAS LNPs reduced tumor growth significantly and further benefit was observed upon combination with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1). Moreover, we found increased activation in CD8 + T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells in the TME post treatment with cGAS LNPs. These findings highlight how cancer cells can be used to actively contribute to their own elimination and may be a broadly applicable strategy for delivery of other reprogramming molecules to cancer cells and wider therapeutic combinations.",

          "abstract": "l -Fucose, a 6-deoxy-monosaccharide, is often incorporated into O-antigens in Rhizobia where it serves as an important marker for host recognition. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize WrtF, an O-antigen polysaccharide l -fucosyltransferase from the plant endosymbiont Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899. We show that WrtF transfers l -fucose from its donor, guanosine 5′-diphospho-β- l -fucose (GDP-Fuc), to a nonreducing end glucose, creating an α-(1→4) linkage. We determined structures of WrtF at resolutions between 1.45 and 2.3 Å in the apo state, and in complex with GDP, GDP-Fuc, nonacetylated and acetylated trisaccharide acceptors, and with a tetrasaccharide product. WrtF has an N-terminal glycosyltransferase A (GT-A) fold and a unique C-terminal α-helical bundle domain. The structures, combined with activity assays, and sequence analysis show that WrtF is unusual in using neither divalent cations nor basic residues to coordinate and stabilize the donor pyrophosphate. In contrast to almost all previously characterized GT-A glycosyltransferases that use α-linked donors that present the donor monosaccharide axially, GDP-Fuc presents its monosaccharide equatorially. GDP-Fuc binds in a compact conformation with the l -fucose endocyclic oxygen and C6 methyl packed against ribose C5 and C4, respectively. This binding mode paradoxically shields the anomeric carbon from attack; superposition of the donor and acceptor complexes suggests that these substrates would sterically hinder one another and do not appropriately orient to form a Michaelis complex. We therefore propose that the donor l -fucose must reorient in the active site prior to turnover. The preferred occluded donor binding mode may serve to “prescreen” GDP-Fuc from structurally similar candidate donors, while also minimizing counterproductive donor hydrolysis.",

However, the extent to which these findings can be generalized to humans remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a fully data-driven approach to examine the wiring diagram of each voxel in the human SC in a cohort of 200 participants. Using diffusion MRI to infer probabilistic tractography, we identified three subregions within the human SC with distinct topography and unique brain-wide connectivity patterns. A superficial division is primarily linked with visual cortical areas, the amygdala, and the posterior thalamus. An intermediate-lateral division is connected predominantly with the auditory and somatosensory cortices and with sectors of the posterior parietal cortex. A deep subregion exhibits preferential connectivity with the brainstem and cerebellum. These in vivo features highlight the heterogeneity in the extrinsic connectivity of the human SC. Probabilistic coupling partly reflects conserved SC interaction motifs reported in other mammals with direct tracing methods, while also showing potential adaptations of cortical–midbrain interactions compatible with human neocortical expansion.",

Despite being commonly accepted that the mechanism of action of AMPs is associated with the permeabilization of the cell membrane, the structural and dynamical means by which this occurs are still heavily debated. In this work, we employ experimental time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering to follow in real time the AMP-induced ion transport in lipid vesicles, while simultaneously resolving the membrane structure and peptide partitioning. For several natural AMPs, we show that they can effectively permeabilize the lipid membrane despite only binding peripherally to the outer membrane leaflet. Our experiments reveal rapid ion transport associated with AMP binding, yielding salt equilibration in a few tens of milliseconds, while not detecting evidence of transversal and structurally stable peptide pores. On the contrary, new analysis of previously reported all-atom molecular dynamics simulations shows that lipid flip-flop, accelerated by the peripherally bound peptides, leads to the formation of transient, ion-conducting water channels. A corresponding diffusional model indicates that such short-lived, transient pores explain the observed ion transport better than stable pores.",

          "abstract": "Complex systems such as the conscious brain and financial markets often operate near criticality, a regime that supports flexible and efficient function. When perturbed, however, rapid deviations from, and prolonged recovery to, criticality can severely disrupt these systems. The nature of such transitions depends on a system’s intrinsic phase transition type. Most systems in nature undergo continuous (second-order) transitions, but some approach a discontinuous, first-order transition known as explosive synchronization (ES). Systems nearer to first-order transitions are more unstable, losing criticality more rapidly and recovering more slowly. However, no existing method can directly determine from empirical data how close a system is to a first-order regime, limiting our ability to predict criticality transition patterns. Here, we introduce a physics-based framework that estimates a network’s ES proximity at the critical point. Using modified Stuart–Landau oscillator networks, we show that distinct critical dynamics emerge depending on the proximity to ES and that this measure predicts the temporal patterns of collapse and recovery under perturbations. We validated the generality of our computational findings with empirical data on network collapse and recovery, using human electroencephalogram recordings during general anesthesia and global stock market indices from 39 countries during the 2008 economic crisis. We demonstrated that rapid collapses and prolonged recoveries in both brain and stock market networks can be systematically predicted for neuronal and economic crises. These results provide crucial insights for designing resilient networks capable of withstanding perturbations and recovering quickly.",

In contrast, large language models (LLMs), trained solely through next-token prediction on text, exhibit strikingly human-like behaviors. Are these models developing concepts akin to those of humans? If so, how are such concepts represented, organized, and related to behavior? Here, we address these questions by investigating the representations formed by LLMs during an in-context concept inference task. We found that LLMs can flexibly derive concepts from linguistic descriptions in relation to contextual cues about other concepts. The derived representations converge toward a shared, context-independent structure, and alignment with this structure reliably predicts model performance across various understanding and reasoning tasks. Moreover, the convergent representations effectively capture human behavioral judgments and closely align with neural activity patterns in the human brain, providing evidence for biological plausibility. Together, these findings establish that structured, human-like conceptual representations can emerge purely from language prediction without real-world grounding, highlighting the role of conceptual structure in understanding intelligent behavior. More broadly, our work suggests that LLMs offer a tangible window into the nature of human concepts and lays the groundwork for advancing alignment between artificial and human intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Conductive folding metamaterials (CFMs) represent a class of cross-physical-domain new-type metamaterials. However, the inherently nonfoldable nature of intrinsic conductive materials and the incompatibility between conductivity and extreme foldability have posed formidable challenges for their design and fabrication. To overcome these limitations, we developed a laser–electric-field coupled biomimetic spinning (LECBS) technique, which couples laser induction with cocoon/lotus-root-inspired biomimicry in a fast electrospinning Taylor cone reaction. Using this approach, we report the fabrication of CFMs composed of hierarchically adaptive carbon nanofiber networks. The CFMs constitute a new class of artificially microstructured composites with extraordinary physical properties absent in nature, filling a critical gap in the metamaterials family. The resulting CFMs endure up to 10 7 cycles, and potentially unlimited cycles, of true folding without damage, in arbitrary directions and with unrestricted 360° flexibility. Simultaneously, they achieve electrical conductivities on the order of 10 3 S·m − 1 , nearly one order of magnitude higher than comparable systems without carbon nanotubes. Mechanistic studies reveal that LECBS can effectively modulate Taylor cone hydrodynamics and jet behavior through photo-electro-matter interactions, which yields thinner nanofibers, enhanced sliding freedom of nanofibers, and axial alignment of CNTs in carbon nanofibers. Real-time SEM observations demonstrate the formation of characteristic M-shaped creases with “separated layers–smooth arcs–slidable grooves” during folding, which successfully disperse stress, in excellent agreement with finite element simulations. This work not only represents a breakthrough in metamaterials but also a technological revolution, opening new opportunities for flexible and foldable electronics fields.",

          "abstract": "Circadian clocks form complex networks to orchestrate the behavior and physiology of animals. Elucidating the organization of these clock networks is critical to understanding how circadian clocks achieve robust timing. Clock neurons have been best characterized in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster . At the early stages of development, Drosophila has a clock network consisting of only nine neurons per hemisphere. This set of clock neurons consists of lateral and dorsal neurons and persists in the adult fly, in which the clock network is greatly expanded to a total of ~240 neurons. The function of the early-born lateral clock neurons is well established in the adult fly. They control morning and evening activity and are responsible for circadian rhythmicity under constant conditions. Only recent studies have begun to dissect the function of the dorsal clock neurons. Using clock rescue experiments, we show here that a functional clock in only four of them, the DN 1a , is sufficient to restore a bimodal locomotor activity pattern and rhythmic activity under constant conditions in the adult fly. This is achieved by CCHamide-1 signaling most likely to the lateral morning neurons, which are considered the main pacemakers of the clock, and by glutamate signaling to the lateral evening neurons. Interestingly, all the neurons involved are part of the early-born clock network, strongly suggesting that a core clock is already formed during early development. This set of clock neurons appears sufficient in the adult fly to drive the basal circadian activity pattern.",

          "abstract": "Soybean serves as a critical source of plant-based protein for both livestock and human nutrition, making seed protein content a key agronomic trait. However, modern soybean cultivars exhibit reduced seed protein content compared to their wild relatives, as a consequence of domestication and historical selection that favored yield over nutritional quality. Thus, genetic improvement of seed protein is highly desired in soybean breeding, while numerous genetic loci associated with this trait remain uncharacterized. Here, we report Protein Contributor 08 ( PC08 ), identified through a genome-wide association study, as a key regulator of seed storage protein accumulation. PC08 encodes a homolog of the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 5 enzyme, a rate-limiting enzyme in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, and is highly expressed during seed development. A nucleic acid T and A (TA)-rich insertion within the PC08 promoter region (designated as PC08 Ins ) enhances transcriptional activity, leading to elevated PC08 expression. Transgenic evidence confirmed its positive regulatory role in seed protein accumulation, mechanistically linked to increased ABA biosynthesis in developing seeds. ABA upregulation activates downstream pathways that promote storage protein synthesis. Population genetic analyses revealed that the PC08 Ins , which confers high protein content, exclusively exists in wild soybean populations and was entirely absent after domestication. Introgression of PC08 Ins into the elite cultivar Hei Nong 35 significantly increased seed protein content. These findings highlight a domestication-eroded allele with untapped potential for modern breeding, offering a valuable genetic target to enhance soybean nutritional quality.",

Such compounds achieve half-life extension of zanamivir, while recruiting polyclonal immunoglobulins of all isotypes regardless of specificity to infected cells for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Since the influenza A virus (IAV) NA is a tetramer, we produced VHH kappa adducts with 1, 2, or 4 zanamivir molecules attached in a site-specific manner, to allow multivalent engagement of NA. Administration of a VHH kappa adduct modified with 4 zanamivir molecules (VHH kappa –Zan 4 ) was ~10-fold more potent in protection against infection with IAV than VHH kappa –Zan carrying only a single zanamivir molecule. VHH kappa –Zan 4 can be given intranasally to confer full protection against a lethal IAV challenge. The neutralizing antibody titers in the respiratory mucosa and in the circulation, as well as the serum IgG antibody response against the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein, are higher in VHH kappa –Zan 4 treated mice that survived the lethal challenge than in controls infected with a sublethal dose of virus. VHH kappa –Zan 4 affords protection even when given intranasally weeks prior to a challenge with a lethal dose of IAV. This type of adduct can therefore be applied prophylactically and therapeutically and does not require prior immunization for protection against a lethal dose of IAV.",

          "abstract": "While practicing a new motor skill, resting for a few seconds can improve performance immediately after the rest. This improvement, referred to as “micro-offline gains” (MOGs), has been interpreted as rapid offline learning and is thought to be supported by neural replay of the trained movement sequence during rest. Here, we provide evidence that MOGs reflect only transient performance benefits, partially mediated by motor planning, and not offline learning. In five experiments, participants trained to produce a sequence of finger movements as many times as possible. When participants trained during 10-s practice periods, interleaved with 10-s rest periods, they produced more correct keypresses during training than participants who trained continuously without taking breaks. However, this benefit vanished within seconds after training, when both groups performed under comparable conditions, revealing similar levels of skill acquisition. This challenges the idea that MOGs reflect offline learning, which, if present, should result in sustained performance benefits, compared to training without breaks. Furthermore, we observed persistent MOGs even when participants produced random, nonrepeating sequences, indicating that MOGs do not relate to the offline consolidation of a sequence-specific memory. Rather, sequence-specific learning was only evident online, during practice. Finally, MOGs were diminished when participants could not preplan the first few movements of an upcoming practice period. Our results suggest that MOG are simply an effect of slowing during practice, combined with the possibility of preplanning the initial movements after rest, and therefore do not serve as a reliable metric for offline learning or skill-related consolidation.",

          "abstract": "The 28 March 2025 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7.7 earthquake in Mandalay, Burma (Myanmar), ruptured 475 kilometers of the Sagaing Fault, which was more than twice the length predicted by magnitude scaling relationships. Kinematic slip models and observation of a Rayleigh Mach wave that passed through parts of Thailand confirmed that rupture occurred at supershear velocities of greater than 5 kilometers per second. The anomalous length exposed a vast population to violent near-fault shaking. The Mandalay earthquake is a modern analog for the M w 7.9 1906 San Francisco earthquake, another atypically long and fast rupture. Probabilistic seismic hazard analyses use scaling relations that do not account for such long ruptures at moderate magnitudes. This limitation, in conjunction with a likely increased population and infrastructure exposure for atypically long ruptures, contributes to a potential mischaracterization of seismic risk.",

This measurement was made using video footage of the surface rupture captured by a closed-circuit television (CCTV) security camera located only meters away from the fault trace. Using direct image analysis, we measured the relative slip at each time step and deduced the slip rate. Our results show a local slip duration of 1.4 seconds and a cumulative slip of ~3 meters, during which surface slip velocity peaked at ~3.5 meters per second with passage of the rupture front. These findings demonstrate the pulse-like nature of the seismic rupture at the location of the recording. Using slip-pulse elastodynamic rupture models, we obtained the complete mechanical properties of this pulse, including the energy release rate.",

We report that introducing trace amounts [parts per million (ppm) level] of halogen-containing compounds into the feed gas can suppress CO 2 formation using iron-based catalysts and boost olefin selectivity over paraffin and olefin productivity. Cofeeding 20 ppm bromomethane over an iron carbide catalyst decreased CO 2 selectivity to &lt;1% and increased olefin selectivity to ~85% among all carbon-containing products. Surface-bound halogens modulated the catalyst surface structure and selectively inhibited pathways responsible for CO 2 generation and olefin hydrogenation.

With holistic geodetic and seismic techniques, we resolved its rupture dynamics and fault zone structure. The rupture initiated as bilateral subshear and transitioned to supershear (~5.3 km/s) about 100 km south of the epicenter, sustaining this velocity for more than 200 km. The supershear segment aligns with a ~2-km–thick low-velocity fault zone exhibiting ~45% shear wave speed reduction. We suggest that the thick fault zone, aided by fault geometry and basin structure, enabled prolonged supershear propagation. Our findings emphasize that observations and models encompassing the entire fault zone are crucial for advancing both specific-event and earthquake-cycle simulations.",

This exceptionally long supershear rupture caused building collapse and soil liquefaction, as observed in satellite imagery, offering insights into the damage potential of such ruptures in urban areas. Sustained supershear propagation was facilitated by the fault’s linear geometry, prolonged interseismic quiescence, favorable energy ratio, and pronounced bimaterial contrasts across the fault interface.

LEC GLU drives excitation in CA3 but also substantial feedforward inhibition that prevents somatic and dendritic spikes. Conversely, LEC GABA suppresses this local inhibition to disinhibit CA3 activity with compartment- and pathway-specificity by selectively boosting somatic output to integrated LEC GLU and CA3 recurrent inputs.

We used cryo–electron microscopy to visualize how human TBCD, TBCE, TBCC, and guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Arl2 mediate αβ-tubulin assembly and disassembly. We captured multiple conformational states, revealing how TBCs orchestrate tubulin heterodimer biogenesis. TBCD stabilizes monomeric β-tubulin and scaffolds the other cofactors. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding to Arl2 induces conformational changes that toggle the complex between assembly and disassembly. TBCD and TBCE guide α- and β-tubulin into a partially assembled interface, and TBCC, acting as a molecular clamp, completes the heterodimer. TBCD also functions as a GTPase activating protein for β-tubulin. β-tubulin GTP hydrolysis is coupled to Arl2’s GTPase activity, establishing a checkpoint that ensures that only fully matured heterodimers proceed.

Guided by these predictions, we engineered separation-of-function telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mutants and found that the loss of RPA-mediated stimulation impairs telomere elongation, even when TPP1–POT1–mediated stimulation remains intact. Furthermore, short-telomere disease–associated TERT mutations reduce RPA-dependent telomerase stimulation, revealing a mechanistic link between impaired processivity and telomeropathies.

Chimpanzees responded to counterevidence in ways predicted by a formal model of rational belief revision: They remained committed to their initial belief when the evidence supporting the alternative belief was weaker, but they revised their initial belief when the supporting evidence was stronger.

Counterfactual analysis, using Bayesian structural time-series (BSTS) modeling, confirmed that infectious diseases that are directly transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols) experienced the greatest disruption to transmission. By contrast, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) experienced a smaller transient disruption, and increasing trends in incidence prepandemic appear to have been curtailed.

          "abstract": "Reducing charge carrier transport losses, improving selectivity, and minimizing nonradiative recombination are essential for enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. We used a hybrid two-step perovskite deposition method that is compatible with industry-standard textured silicon, incorporating a perovskite surface treatment based on 1,3-diaminopropane dihydroiodide. The interaction of this molecule with the perovskite surface increased the majority charge carrier concentration at the electron-selective contact, which reduced interfacial recombination. Simultaneously, this field-effect passivation increased the electron concentration across the entire intrinsic perovskite absorber, which increased conductivity and reduced transport losses. Combined, this yields high-performance, fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, achieving a 1-sun AM1.5G conversion efficiency of 33.1% with an open-circuit voltage of 2.01 volts and an extended outdoor stability in the Red Sea Coast.",

Current miniaturized imaging microscopes are typically limited to imaging a relatively small field of view (FOV), precluding the measurement of neural activities across multiple brain regions. Here, we present a miniaturized micro-camera array microscope (mini-MCAM) that consists of four fluorescence imaging micro-cameras, each capable of capturing neural activity across a 4.5 millimeter × 2.55 millimeter FOV. Cumulatively, the mini-MCAM images over a 30–square millimeter area of sparsely expressed GCaMP6s neurons that were distributed throughout the dorsal cortex, in regions including the primary and secondary motor, somatosensory, visual, retrosplenial, and association cortices across both hemispheres.

Direct monitoring of TUS responses is crucial for ensuring optimal outcomes. Blood-oxygenation-level–dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging has primarily been used for studying TUS effects in both human and nonhuman primate brains. However, the physiology and mechanisms underlying BOLD remain largely unknown due to its highly convoluted nature. To address these limitations, we developed a hybrid system for concurrent optoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging of TUS (OMRITUS) to comprehensively characterize the hemodynamic changes in murine brains. Our findings reveal paradoxical negative BOLD signals in the activated cortical regions, coupled with increased total hemoglobin levels simultaneously monitored with optoacoustic tomography. Multispectral optoacoustic readings further demonstrated a stronger increase in deoxygenated versus oxygenated hemoglobin, suggesting a potential molecular basis for the negative BOLD responses. OMRITUS enables the study of complex TUS-hemodynamic interactions, paving the way for precise neuromodulatory interventions.",

          "abstract": "The intrinsic trade-off between hardness and toughness presents a long-standing challenge for diamond-based materials, limiting their use in extreme environments. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy to overcome this limitation by engineering graphite precursors with mimosa-like microscale curvature. Under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions (15 gigapascals and 2300 kelvin), these precursors concentrate local stress, promoting nucleation of hexagonal diamond within a cubic diamond matrix and forming cubic-hexagonal heterostructures. The resulting composites exhibit exceptional hardness (169 gigapascals) and toughness (15.7 megapascals multiplied by square root of meter), representing 36 and 104% improvements over single-phase nanopolycrystalline diamond, respectively. This dual enhancement arises from stacking fault interlocking and semi/coherent boundaries that resist deformation, coupled with phase transformation and crack deflection that dissipate fracture energy. Our results demonstrate a microstructural design paradigm for mitigating the property trade-off in superhard materials and offer a scalable strategy for engineering robust diamond-based systems.",

Here, we generated complete Cldn -null mouse epithelial cells to reconstitute the TJ paracellular barrier (TJ barrier) with individual Cldns. Each Cldn establishes its respective TJ barrier, either autonomously or nonautonomously, exhibiting distinct ion conductivity and selectivity. Clustering algorithms revealed a previously unidentified classification of Cldns into four main classes with well-defined subclasses, moving beyond the conventional paracellular barrier–versus–channel-forming dichotomy. Our findings, including the in vivo Cldn dynamics, provide a framework for understanding TJ barrier diversity and plasticity, offering insights into organ-specific homeostasis and guiding therapeutic strategies targeting TJ barriers in health and disease.",

We introduce MetaChat, a multi-agentic design framework that can translate semantically described photonic design goals into high-performance, freeform device layouts in an automated, nearly real-time manner. Multistep reasoning is enabled by our Agentic Iterative Monologue paradigm, which coherently interfaces agents with code-based tools, other specialized agents, and human designers. Design acceleration is facilitated by Feature-wise Linear Modulation–conditioned Maxwell surrogate solvers that support the generalized evaluation of metasurface structures. We use freeform dielectric metasurfaces as a model system and demonstrate with MetaChat the design of multiobjective, multiwavelength metasurfaces orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods.

We analyzed genome-wide data from 7 ancient (~2300 to 100 years old) and 10 present-day individuals from the northern Indian Himalayas and one ~3370-year-old individual from the Central Himalayas in Nepal. Ancient and present-day individuals from the northern Himalayas predominantly have Tibetan-related genetic ancestry, likely the source of high-altitude adaptive variants in these individuals, with substantial Steppe-related genetic ancestry that is observed in all individuals dating between ~1300 years and present day. In addition, some present-day individuals have lowland South Asian admixture. Our analyses reveal a dynamic interplay between genetic admixture and continuity in the northern Himalayas.",

          "abstract": "In the single-photon emission from a two-level system, multiphotons are generally regarded as accidental, undesired, and unrelated to the mechanism. In coherently driven systems, however, they form the cornerstone of single-photon emission, which arises from quantum interferences between virtual multiphoton fluctuations of the emitter and the Poissonian superposition of all number states induced by the driving. Here, we demonstrate how one can control the multiphoton dynamics by disrupting these quantum interferences through an external homodyne control of the emitter’s mean field. Experimentally, we observed a transition from single-photon to multiphoton emission, up to three-photon correlations. We show that, counterintuitively, quantum fluctuations always play a major qualitative role, even and, in fact, especially when their quantitative contribution is vanishing. Our findings provide distinct insights into the paradoxical character of quantum mechanics and open pathways for mean-field engineering as a tool for precision multiphoton control.",

To define a genome-wide map of editability, we performed whole-genome sequencing on 1875 budding yeast clones edited across 16 chromosomes by CRISPR-Cas9 and donor-templated repair. We found that unintended edits, including short indels and SVs, were enriched in specific genomic and sequence contexts. We developed a predictive model, SCORE (System for CRISPR Outcome and Risk Evaluation), which revealed 4.8% of the genome as SV prone, consisting of 562 SV hotspots. Donor repair-enhancing strategies suppressed SV formation in regions with moderate, but not high, predicted risk. Applying SCORE to the Sc2.0 synthetic yeast genome revealed a markedly altered SV landscape due to the removal of endogenous repetitive elements and the insertion of loxP sites.

However, the atomic-level mechanism behind its efficiency remains unclear. The basal surfaces of AgI are polar and inherently unstable, necessitating a compensation mechanism, such as surface reconstruction, which may disrupt the favorable lattice match with ice. We combine noncontact atomic force microscopy with advanced computational modeling to determine the atomic structure of basal AgI surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum. The Ag-terminated (0001) surface exhibits a (2 × 2) reconstruction with ordered Ag vacancies, preserving a hexagonal arrangement of surface atoms that facilitates epitaxial ice growth. In contrast, the I-terminated (000 1 ¯ ) surface adopts a complex rectangular reconstruction, incompatible with continuous ice layer formation. These findings highlight the decisive role of surface atomic structure and indicate that the Ag-terminated basal plane is primarily responsible for efficient ice nucleation on AgI.",

However, the “eraser” of α-TubK40me3 and the impact of α-TubK40me3 dynamic balance on cells are still unclear. Here, we report that KDM4A, a member of the histone demethylase family, binds α-tubulin through its catalytic core domain and demethylates α-tubulin. KDM4A knockout significantly enhances α-TubK40me3, inducing microtubule polymerization and mitotic defects. Furthermore, the overpolymerized microtubules and cell mitotic defects caused by KDM4A knockout are rescued by reducing α-TubK40me3 with overexpression of an α-tubulin mutant α-tubulin K40A or depolymerizing microtubules with nocodazole treatment in cells.

In particular, in the marine environment, dependency of ocean-going fish on specific coastal locations are rarely implemented in spatial planning. However, when essential nursery habitats are threatened, the resilience of fish populations is jeopardized. For technical reasons, former studies on Atlantic herring could not specify if fish, returning to spawning grounds, returned to sites of their own natal origin. Combining otolith microchemistry with genetics, we show that Atlantic herring perform natal homing with rates between 56 and 73%. The implicit number of strays adopted along migration maintain the gene flow between subpopulations, supporting the hypothesized “metapopulation” concept. With respect to increasing anthropogenic impacts, this study demonstrates the need for a goal-oriented coastal zone management to ensure productive ecosystems and a sustainable fishery in the future.",

Using portable x-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and technological analysis, we identified deliberate modifications including grinding, scoring, flaking, and scraping. Three pieces (ZSKV-05, ZSKV-06, and ZSKV-07) show features exceeding utilitarian use: One is shaped into a crayon-like tool with repeated resharpening, another appears to be a crayon fragment, and a third bears engraved, polished surfaces. These traits suggest the intentional production of marks and curated use. While practical applications (e.g., hide processing) remain plausible for other specimens, the evidence supports symbolic use among some Crimean Neanderthals.

To elucidate the developmental roles of IHCs and OHCs in the formation, differentiation, and assembly of the various SCs, we genetically switched HC identities at several developmental stages and also generated mice lacking IHCs. We find that IHCs promote or induce the (i) differentiation of one SC type (outer pillar) at the expense of another (Deiters’), so that each completely and exclusively populates separate rows; (ii) packing density, but not identity, of inner pillar cells; and (iii) embryonic formation and (iv) cytoplasmic attraction of adjacent inner phalangeal cells, which envelop IHCs.

Aging reduces BAT function and lowers levels of LAMP2A, the rate-limiting CMA component. Pharmacological CMA activation restores BAT activity in aged mice. To explore the CMA’s role in BAT, we generated LAMP2A-deficient brown adipocytes and found that CMA regulates proteins essential for thermogenesis and metabolism. Blocking CMA in BAT reduced energy expenditure, raised blood triglycerides, impaired secretion, and led to an increase of thermogenesis repressors. These findings show that CMA is essential for maintaining BAT function, especially during adaptive thermogenesis. By degrading repressors of thermogenesis, CMA supports BAT activity under cold or metabolic stress.

This study introduces Carba1, a bifunctional carbazole compound that protects against CIPN through two mechanisms. First, Carba1 interacts with tubulin, allowing for lower doses of taxanes, common chemotherapeutics known for causing CIPN, without reducing their anticancer effectiveness. Second, Carba1 activates nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), enhancing NAD biosynthesis and boosting the metabolic resilience of neurons and Schwann cells against chemotherapy-induced damage. Carba1 shows strong neuroprotective effects in vitro against paclitaxel, cisplatin, and bortezomib toxicity and in vivo in a rat model of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Crucially, Carba1 does not interfere with paclitaxel’s tumor-fighting ability or promote tumor growth. Structure-activity analyses of Carba1 derivatives reveal the potential to develop compounds with dual or solely neuroprotective effects.

We apply microfluidics to enrich CTCs from 34 patients with DCIS and find a significantly higher concentration of CTCs compared to in healthy controls. We profile CTCs and matched DCIS tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing.

SA inhibited hypocotyl growth in a dose-dependent manner, with a more substantial effect in the Arabidopsis npr1 mutant, revealing NPR1’s role in maintaining growth under SA-accumulating conditions. In etiolated npr1 seedlings, auxin-responsive genes, including multiple SMALL AUXIN UP-REGULATED RNA ( SAUR ) and EXPANSIN genes, were down-regulated. Overexpression of SAUR19 or SAUR63 fully rescued SA-induced growth inhibition. We also identified EXECUTER1 (EX1), a mediator of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) signaling, as a contributor to this process.

However, multiparticle quantum speed limits have not been experimentally explored. In this work, we experimentally verify that both multiparticles and entanglement can accelerate the quantum speed on observables in two-particle systems based on ultrahigh precision control of quantum evolution time. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that the initial quantum state plays a critical role in the quantum speed limits of the entangled systems. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that the upper bound and lower bound of the quantum speed are workable even in a nonunitary Markovian open system with two photons. The results obtained based on two-photon experiments have been shown to be generalizable to more particles. Our work facilitates the characterization of the dynamic transient properties of complex quantum systems and the control of the quantum speed of large-scale quantum systems.",

However, the precise equilibrium strain distributions have remained unclear because of heterogeneity among individual particles, requiring statistical analysis across large sample populations. Here, we use nanobeam four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to extract averaged strain profiles from uniformly sized, shape-identical particles, achieving high-resolution, statistically robust insights beyond single-particle noise. The strain profiles reveal how tensile, shear, and rotational components collectively compensate for the angular deficit, with particle shape–dependent local variations highlighting the importance of morphological control in synthesis. By integrating in situ heating with 4D-STEM, we captured a previously unobserved strain relaxation pathway involving the formation of periodic partial dislocations that stabilizes the strain-relieved equilibrium state. This study establishes a quantitative framework for equilibrium strain in fivefold-twinned nanostructures and offers strain engineering strategies for tailored properties.",

SCE datasets from a reanalysis-driven simple snow model serve as benchmarks and allow us to reconcile the trends from one prominent snow cover record with other recent studies. In particular, artificial increasing snow cover trends in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Snow Cover Extent Climate Data Record (CDR) during the onset season are related to changes in snow detection sensitivity. This artificial drift primarily affects September, October, and November snow cover but is detectible through February. Revised trends produced by merging the last decade’s CDR estimates with the offline model datasets reveal decreasing Northern Hemisphere trends in all months but January. This approach shows that offline snow models produce useful benchmarks that can expose biases in observational snow cover datasets with other cross-validation.",

Nonetheless, applying ML to ensemble forecasting poses challenges in addressing uncertainties in initial conditions and models, which are the major sources of forecasting errors. To address these challenges, we introduce FuXi-ENS, an advanced ML model that generates 6-hourly global ensemble weather forecasts up to 15 days ahead at a spatial resolution of 0.25°. Using a variational autoencoder framework, FuXi-ENS optimizes a loss function that combines the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) with the Kullback-Leibler divergence, enabling flow-dependent perturbations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that FuXi-ENS outperforms the ECMWF ensemble in key forecast metrics such as CRPS and Brier score.",

Here, we develop a strategy of spatial steric hindrance that transforms planar carbazole core into a three-dimensional π-conjugated skeleton. This molecular reconfiguration suppresses intermolecular π-π stacking, yielding homogenized selective contacts and high-quality perovskite films. When integrated into flexible monolithic perovskite/CIGS tandem devices, this strategy enabled a champion stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.2% (certified 25.5%) for a 0.091–square centimeter device and 25.3% (certified 24.3%) for a centimeter-scale device, both representing high certified efficiencies reported to date for flexible two-terminal tandems.

Recording and optical manipulation of the indirect pathway showed that late-onset activity following unrewarded suboptimal action represents a lowered valuation of the current action policy and a heightened bias to try the suboptimal action. The early-onset activity complementarily mediated policy-based suppression of unrewarded action. These results demonstrate the indirect pathway’s role in monitoring unreliability of current action policy and probing alternative one.

The patch offered high penetration and antibacterial activity, while its ROS-sensitive core released EM/Man NPs to scavenge ROS, restore adenosine 5′-triphosphate production, and reestablish redox balance.

In diabetic mice, EM/Man MNs accelerated healing via bacterial clearance, immune reprogramming, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition while inhibiting scar formation through interleukin-17 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–Akt suppression.

Integration with Lamonte and tadpole-like traces reveals important behavioral innovations from simple horizontal locomotion to complex sediment penetration, thereby bridging ecological and behavioral transitions across the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary. The advent of three-dimensional sediment exploration fundamentally altered benthic ecodynamics and disrupted microbial mat stability. This shift reflects a fundamental restructuring of infaunal habitats, which temporally coincided with the decline of matground-related Ediacaran macro-organisms.

The structure reveals a PSI monomer core with eight subunits and 13 asymmetrically arranged LHCI proteins. Euglena LHCIs bind diadinoxanthin, which is one of the carotenoids typically associated with red-lineage LHCs and is not present in the canonical LHCI belt found in green-lineage PSI-LHCI structures. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the Euglena LHCIs originated from LHCII-related clades rather than from the green-lineage LHCI group and that the nuclear-encoded PSI subunit PsaD likely originated from cyanobacteria via horizontal gene transfer. These observations indicate a mosaic origin of the Euglena PSI-LHCI.

Highlighting the significance of this pathway, several components are somatically mutated in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a neurological disorder characterized by intractable epilepsy. Supporting the functional impact of these variants, patient-derived SARM1 and RhoA mutations potentiate cilia loss, and a RhoA variant impairs cortical development.

Here, we introduce bacteriophage-loaded microneedle patches that enable targeted phage delivery directly within food, eliminating internal pathogens in a minimally disruptive manner. The application of microneedles within food is first explored. The platform is then substantiated by comparing performance in raw beef and cooked chicken, where we achieved up to 3-log reduction in Escherichia coli , meeting regulatory limits. In contrast, conventional surface application of the same phage failed to provide statistically significant decontamination.

The model consists of a two-layered network, designed to capture activity in both the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. A core feature of the model is that within each layer, the processing units are tuned to both movement direction and the direction of movement error. The model recapitulates a large range of contextual effects such as how prior learning, error uncertainty, or temporal delay affect the rate of adaptation. While these effects have traditionally been taken to indicate a form of meta-learning or context-dependent memory within the adaptation system, the current results show that they can emerge from the population activity of a cerebellar-like hierarchical network that does not represent context.",

It has recently received notable attention. Despite this growing interest, the microscopic mechanisms driving CISS remain a subject of intense debate. This paper complements and extends the prevailing interpretation that attributes CISS primarily to the electric current in chiral molecules. We propose that molecular vibrations drive spin polarization in chiral molecules and play a critical role in CISS. Our results suggest that magnetic interactions between chiral molecules and ferromagnets, analogous to interlayer exchange coupling, provide a physically consistent mechanism for the observed selectivity. Specifically, we demonstrate that molecular vibrations facilitate the alignment of spin angular momentum dependent on chirality in the presence of an external magnetic field, which is a prerequisite for exchange coupling. These findings necessitate reevaluating spin dynamics, expanding its relevance beyond traditional solid-state physics to fields such as chemical reactions, molecular biology, and drug discovery.",

          "abstract": "For preclinical studies, the standard practice for evaluating lung injury usually involves an assessment of pulmonary histopathology by a certified pathologist. This is typically accomplished by light microscopy using a semiquantitative four-point scale. In contrast, automated image analysis software allows a more quantitative assessment, though inherent limitations with such automated programs can produce misleading conclusions. For example, specific imaging features may be incorrectly scored or classified within the specimen because of the complex architecture and heterogeneous structures present in the lung. In addition, tissue processing and handling may further introduce artifacts and inconsistencies that affect automated analysis. To address these limitations, we developed a lung image analysis program, Wide-Angle Lung Experiment Segmentation (WALES), which uses Meta’s Segment Anything Model to provide semiautomated masking and relative density analysis to efficiently quantify lung injury. Density analysis using WALES effectively delineated varying severities of lung injury, not achieved using more standard methods. WALES is widely applicable for many preclinical lung injury models.",

The presence of internal hyphae networks, algal cells, possible reproductive structures, calcium oxalate pseudomorphs, abundant nitrogenous compounds, and fossil lipid composition confirms that it was among the first widespread representatives of lichenized fungi in Earth’s history.

By using exo- and endonucleases to remove background, Pt-seq enables robust and sensitive profiling of binding sites for cisplatin, oxaliplatin, lobaplatin, and a Pt(IV) complex. Using Pt-seq, we identified tens to hundreds of binding clusters that are 10 to 20 kilobases in median length and highly consistent among different drugs, predominantly localizing to centromeric and ribosomal DNA regions. In cisplatin-resistant cells, we found significantly reduced binding within these regions. Moreover, we found that mutations in cancer cells can generate previously unidentified binding sites. On this basis, we demonstrated that ICR-191, an acridine orange compound capable of inducing G insertions, enhances cisplatin-DNA binding and sensitizes cells to cisplatin.

Known as a mechanoeffector, it is recruited to adhesion sites under force via mechanotransducers talin and α-catenin. Here, we examine vinculin’s mechanical properties to assess its role as a mechanotransducer. We find that at physiological loading rates, vinculin domains unfold at forces of 5 to 15 pN and refold rapidly when forces drop to 1 pN. This behavior is reminiscent of force-dependent switches in talin and α-catenin, suggesting vinculin domains also function as molecular switches. Unfolding induces large extension changes up to 150 nm in steps of 20 to 30 nm. These findings reveal that vinculin exhibits a previously unrecognized mechanical response, with dynamic folding/unfolding under force acting as a buffering mechanism. Given its role as a scaffold for many proteins, this mechanosensitive behavior supports a model where vinculin functions directly as a mechanotransducer, recruiting binding partners in a force-dependent manner.",

However, established experimental techniques cannot resolve magnons with wave vectors between 30 and 300 rad μm −1 . We address this gap by tailoring the Brillouin light scattering process with dielectric periodic nanostripes hosting Mie resonances. This approach enables access to the previously unmeasurable wave vector range while providing at the same time full wave vector resolution, all within a tabletop setup. Filling this gap can stimulate further experimental investigations of the fundamental phenomena associated with magnons as well as applications in computational and microwave devices.

Through bioinformatic and functional analyses, we demonstrated that overexpression of AP4 in mice not only accelerated in vivo axon regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury but also promoted robust axon regeneration and neuronal survival after optic nerve injury by activating mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Neuronal-specific knockdown of AP4 abolished the regenerative phenotype induced by c-Myc overexpression and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion. AP4 overexpression rendered the intrinsic growth capacity of c-Myc silencing injured retinal ganglion cells unaffected.

By gene editing, we generated endogenous homozygous and heterozygous RAC1 A159V mutations, which result in up-regulated RAC1 activity and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. RAC1 A159V tumors grow faster than RAC1 WT tumors in immune-proficient mice and are resistant to anti–programmed death protein 1 (PD1). Flow cytometry and scRNA-seq analyses reveal that RAC1 A159V cells form “cold” tumors with an immunosuppressive microenvironment and reduced tumor-immune cell interactions. Mechanistically, RAC1 A159V up-regulates glycosphingolipid biosynthesis to activate mTORC1 signaling in tumor cells, which in turn increases glycolysis, impairs key chemokine production, and decreases IFNGR1 expression of the tumor cells. mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin resensitizes the RAC1 A159V tumors to anti-PD1 treatment by reversing effects of RAC1 A159V mutation. These results demonstrate a mechanism of RAC1 A159V -driven immune evasion and suggest an approach of combining the targeting of RAC1-mTOR signaling with immune checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of a type of immune-cold tumors.",

Through tracking the moiré pattern evolution, we identify distinct strain release mechanisms, including layer twisting, defect formation, and domain restructuring. Our neural network potential calculations reveal that energy fluctuations at small twist angles are dominated by an interference-like interaction modulation of hydrogen bonds between boehmite interlayers, with metastable twisted structures corresponding to local minima of the potential energy landscape. This work establishes a previously unidentified paradigm of two-dimensional layer twisting mediated by hydrogen bonding, offering insights into strain-driven transformation mechanisms, and thus may have broad implications for strain in material and earth sciences.",

Transgenic worms tolerated x-ray exposure and oxidative stress without apparent toxicity and exhibited a notable extension of life span. This effect was independent of the canonical DAF-2/DAF-16 longevity pathway and mitochondrial dynamics. Instead, Dsup expression markedly reduced mitochondrial respiration, providing a plausible mechanism for enhanced oxidative stress resistance and extended longevity.

We assembled a dataset of tooth morphology from 30 species and combined it with functional data such as diet, habitat, and body size. Simulated extinction scenarios, where species were sequentially removed from the highest to lowest threat level, revealed that the loss of threatened species would result in marked homogenization of morphology and ecology. Along this extinction trajectory, trait structures become increasingly depauperate, marked by contracting depth ranges and declining body-size diversity.

Experimental and computational analyses reveal a distinct luminescence mechanism dominated by intermolecular Cu(I)∙∙∙Cu(I) interactions. An unconventional halogen-free strategy substantially enhances the radioluminescence of a methyl-substituted copper(I) trinuclear complex, achieving an exceptional light yield of ~70,475 photons/MeV. Leveraging these properties, a scintillator screen was fabricated, which achieved a spatial resolution exceeding 20.0 line pairs/mm and retained performance over 200 on-off cycles. Moreover, real-time angiography simulations validated its capability for dynamic x-ray imaging.

The Paramecium host survived for up to 5 weeks while maintaining the number of Chlorella endosymbionts, whereas aposymbiotic Paramecium and free-living Chlorella either died or bleached, respectively, under the same conditions. In the symbiotic state, the host continuously fed on the endosymbionts without excreting nitrogenous waste into the medium, while the remaining endosymbionts continued to proliferate using heterotrophic metabolites from the host and light energy.

          "abstract": "Chlorine radicals (Cl · ) profoundly affect atmospheric oxidation capacity. Chloramines, especially trichloramine, are emerging precursors of Cl · . However, their sources and roles in the atmosphere remain elusive. This study presents field evidence of primary emissions and explicit secondary production pathways of atmospheric trichloramine in Beijing, supplemented by observations from New Delhi and reanalysis of measurements in Toronto. We demonstrate that the sequential chlorination reactions initiated by molecular chlorine and ammonia in atmospheric aerosols are a major source of trichloramine. The trichloramine produced in aerosols is a source of gaseous trichloramine and serves as an intermediate during the conversion from molecular chlorine to Cl · , while direct trichloramine emissions constitute a previously overlooked source of Cl · . Overall, chloramine chemistry alters the Cl · production mechanism and represents a crucial missing pathway to Cl · worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Plants use two major defense strategies, resistance and tolerance, to counter herbivore attack; how these are coordinated remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that damage by a specialist leafminer ( Phthorimaea operculella ) triggers tissue-specific responses in potato plants: compensatory growth in immature leaves, enabling tolerance, while resistance is induced in the mined leaf. The tissue-specific regulation of Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporter 11 (SWEET11) mediates both responses. In unattacked sink leaves, SWEET11 is up-regulated, enhancing sugar import, promoting compensatory growth and herbivore tolerance. In contrast, SWEET11 is rapidly down-regulated in mined source leaves, inhibiting sugar export and increasing cellular sugar levels. The resulting sugar accumulations suppress SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) and thereby enhance herbivore resistance. SWEET11-mediated sugar signaling enhances jasmonic acid (JA)–mediated resistance by degrading MCPI1a and MCPI1b (metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor 1), two JA-induced herbivory susceptibility factors. These findings reveal a dual role for sugar transport in regulating tissue-specific defense responses to herbivory.",
