          "title": "Measuring racial educational disparities over time amongst top achievers",
          "authors": "Uditi Karna, Min Sok Lee, John A. List, Andrew Simon, Haruka Uchida",
          "abstract": "Educational disparities remain a key contributor to increasing social and wealth inequalities. To address this, researchers and policymakers have focused on average differences between racial groups or differences among students who are falling behind1. This focus potentially leads to educational triage, diverting resources away from high-achieving students, including those from racial minorities2,3. Here we focus on the ‘racial excellence gap’—the difference in the likelihood that students from racial minorities (Black and Hispanic) reach the highest levels of academic achievement compared with their non-minority (white and Asian) peers. There is a shortage of evidence that systematically measures the magnitude of the excellence gap and how it evolves4,5. Using longitudinal, statewide, administrative data, we document eight facts regarding the excellence gap from third grade (typically ages 8–9) to high school (typically ages 14–18), link the stability of excellence gaps and student backgrounds, and assess the efficacy of public policies. We show that excellence gaps in maths and reading are evident by the third grade and grow slightly over time, especially for female students. About one third of the gap is explained by a student’s socioeconomic status, and about one tenth is explained by the school environment. Top-achieving racial minority students are also less likely to persist in excellence as they progress through school. Moreover, state accountability policies that direct additional resources to reduce non-race-based inequality6 had minimal effects on the racial excellence gaps. Documenting these patterns is an important step towards eliminating excellence gaps and removing the ‘racial glass ceiling’.",

          "abstract": "Greenlandic Inuit and other indigenous populations are underrepresented in genetic research1,2, leading to inequity in healthcare opportunities. To address this, we performed analyses of sequenced or imputed genomes of 5,996 Greenlanders with extensive phenotypes. We quantified their historical population bottleneck and how it has shaped their genetic architecture to have fewer, but more common, variable sites. Consequently, we find twice as many high-impact genome-wide associations to metabolic traits in Greenland compared with Europe. We infer that the high-impact variants arose after the population split from Native Americans and thus are Arctic-specific, and show that some of them are common due to not only genetic drift but also selection. We also find that European-derived polygenic scores for metabolic traits are only half as accurate in Greenlanders as in Europeans, and that adding Arctic-specific variants improves the overall accuracy to the same level as in Europeans. Similarly, lack of representation in public genetic databases makes genetic clinical screening harder in Greenlandic Inuit, but inclusion of Greenlandic data remedies this by reducing the number of non-causal candidate variants by sixfold. Finally, we identify pronounced genetic fine structure that explains differences in prevalence of monogenic diseases in Greenland and, together with recent changes in mobility, leads to a predicted future reduction in risk for certain recessive diseases. These results illustrate how including data from Greenlanders can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that migratory animals exploit the magnetic field of the Earth for navigation, both as a compass to determine direction and as a map to determine geographical position1. It has long been proposed that, to navigate using a magnetic map, animals must learn the magnetic coordinates of the destination2,3, yet the pivotal hypothesis that animals can learn magnetic signatures of geographical areas has, to our knowledge, yet to be tested. Here we report that an iconic navigating species, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), can learn such information. When fed repeatedly in magnetic fields replicating those that exist in particular oceanic locations, juvenile turtles learned to distinguish magnetic fields in which they encountered food from magnetic fields that exist elsewhere, an ability that might underlie foraging site fidelity. Conditioned responses in this new magnetic map assay were unaffected by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields, a treatment expected to disrupt radical-pair-based chemical magnetoreception4,5,6, suggesting that the magnetic map sense of the turtle does not rely on this mechanism. By contrast, orientation behaviour that required use of the magnetic compass was disrupted by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields. The findings provide evidence that two different mechanisms of magnetoreception underlie the magnetic map and magnetic compass in sea turtles.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal phenotypic traits such as morphology, connectivity and function are dictated, to a large extent, by a specific combination of differentially expressed genes. Clusters of neurons in transcriptomic space correspond to distinct cell types and in some cases—for example, Caenorhabditis elegans neurons 1 and retinal ganglion cells 2–4 —have been shown to share morphology and function. The zebrafish optic tectum is composed of a spatial array of neurons that transforms visual inputs into motor outputs. Although the visuotopic map is continuous, subregions of the tectum are functionally specialized 5,6 . Here, to uncover the cell-type architecture of the tectum, we transcriptionally profiled its neurons, revealing more than 60 cell types that are organized in distinct anatomical layers. We measured the visual responses of thousands of tectal neurons by two-photon calcium imaging and matched them with their transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, we characterized the morphologies of transcriptionally identified neurons using specific transgenic lines. Notably, we found that neurons that are transcriptionally similar can diverge in shape, connectivity and visual responses. Incorporating the spatial coordinates of neurons within the tectal volume revealed functionally and morphologically defined anatomical subclusters within individual transcriptomic clusters. Our findings demonstrate that extrinsic, position-dependent factors expand the phenotypic repertoire of genetically similar neurons.",

These planets form two populations separated by a natural division at about 1.8 R⊕ termed the radius valley. It is uncertain whether these populations arose from separate dry versus water-rich formation channels, evolved apart because of long-term atmospheric loss or a combination of both5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we report observations of ongoing hydrogen loss from two sibling planets, TOI-776 b (1.85 ± 0.13 R⊕) and TOI-776 c (2.02 ± 0.14 R⊕), the sizes of which near the radius valley and mature (1–4 Gyr) age make them valuable for investigating the origins of the divided population of which they are a part. During the transits of these planets, absorption appeared against the Lyman-α emission of the host star, compatible with hydrogen escape at rates equivalent to 0.03–0.6% and 0.1–0.9% of the total mass per billion years of each planet, respectively. Observations of the outer planet, TOI-776 c, are incompatible with an outflow of dissociated steam, suggesting both it and its inner sibling formed in a dry environment. These observations support the strong role of hydrogen loss in the evolution of close-orbiting sub-Neptunes5,6,7,8,15,16.",

          "abstract": "The nervous and immune systems have complementary roles in the adaptation of organisms to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms that mediate cross-talk between the nervous and immune systems, called neuroimmune interactions, are poorly understood. In this Review, we summarize advances in the understanding of neuroimmune communication, with a principal focus on the central nervous system (CNS): its response to immune signals and the immunological consequences of CNS activity. We highlight these themes primarily as they relate to neurological diseases, the control of immunity, and the regulation of complex behaviours. We also consider the importance and challenges linked to the study of the neuroimmune connectome, which is defined as the totality of neuroimmune interactions in the body, because this provides a conceptual framework to identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Finally, we discuss how the latest techniques can advance our understanding of the neuroimmune connectome, and highlight the outstanding questions in the field.",

However, the microfibrillar organization of cellulose and its complex interactions with other components of the plant cell wall poses a major challenge for enzymatic conversion4. Here, by mining the metagenomic ‘dark matter’ (unclassified DNA with unknown function) of a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, we discovered a metalloenzyme that oxidatively cleaves cellulose. This metalloenzyme acts on cellulose through an exo-type mechanism with C1 regioselectivity, resulting exclusively in cellobionic acid as a product. The crystal structure reveals a catalytic copper buried in a compact jelly-roll scaffold that features a flattened cellulose binding site. This metalloenzyme exhibits a homodimeric configuration that enables in situ hydrogen peroxide generation by one subunit while the other is productively interacting with cellulose. The secretome of an engineered strain of the fungus Trichoderma reesei expressing this metalloenzyme boosted the glucose release from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This discovery modifies the current understanding of bacterial redox enzymatic systems devoted to overcoming biomass recalcitrance5,6,7. Furthermore, it enables the conversion of agro-industrial residues into value-added bioproducts, thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable and bio-based economy.",

          "abstract": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in plant immunity by sensing pathogen effectors1. In Arabidopsis, certain sensor NLRs function as NADases to catalyse the production of second messengers2,3, which can be recognized by enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) with its partner senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101), to activate helper NLR N requirement gene 1 (NRG1)4. A cryoelectron microscopy structure shows that second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101 mainly contacts the leucine-rich repeat domain of NRG1A to mediate the formation of an induced EDS1–SAG101–NRG1A complex. Structural comparisons show that binding of a second messenger induces conformational changes in EDS1–SAG101, which are recognized by NRG1A, leading to its allosteric activation. We further show that an inhibitory NRG1 family member, NRG1C, efficiently outcompetes NRG1A for binding to second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101. These findings uncover mechanisms for NRG1A activation through its recognition of a modified host EDS1–SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of the activated EDS1–SAG101, thus shedding light on the activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system.",

          "abstract": "The crypt–villus structure of the small intestine serves as an essential protective barrier. The integrity of this barrier is monitored by the complex sensory system of the gut, in which serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells play an important part1,2. These rare sensory epithelial cells surveil the mucosal environment for luminal stimuli and transmit signals both within and outside the gut3,4,5,6. However, whether EC cells in crypts and villi detect different stimuli or produce distinct physiological responses is unknown. Here we address these questions by developing a reporter mouse model to quantitatively measure the release and propagation of serotonin from EC cells in live intestines. Crypt EC cells exhibit a tonic low-level mode that activates epithelial serotonin 5-HT4 receptors to modulate basal ion secretion and a stimulus-induced high-level mode that activates 5-HT3 receptors on sensory nerve fibres. Both these modes can be initiated by the irritant receptor TRPA1, which is confined to crypt EC cells. The activation of TRPA1 by luminal irritants is enhanced when the protective mucus layer is compromised. Villus EC cells also signal damage through a distinct mechanism, whereby oxidative stress activates TRPM2 channels, which leads to the release of both serotonin and ATP and consequent excitation of sensory nerve fibres. This topological segregation of EC cell functionality along the mucosal architecture constitutes a mechanism for the surveillance, maintenance and protection of gut integrity under diverse physiological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Crystal symmetry guides the development of condensed matter. The unique crystal symmetry connecting magnetic sublattices not only distinguishes altermagnetism1,2,3,4,5,6 from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism but also enables it to combine the advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism4,5. Altermagnetic order is essentially a magnetic crystal order7, determined by the magnetic-order (Néel) vector and crystal symmetry. Previous experimental studies have concentrated on manipulating the altermagnetic symmetry by tuning the Néel vector orientations8,9,10,11,12. However, manipulation of the crystal symmetry, which holds great promise for manipulating the altermagnetic order, remains challenging. Here we realize the manipulation of altermagnetic order in chromium antimonide (CrSb) films via crystal symmetry. The locking between the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector and the magnetic space symmetry helps to reconstruct the altermagnetic order, from a collinear Néel vector to a canted one. It generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnet. The relative direction between the current-induced spin polarization and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector determines the switching modes of altermagnetic order, that is, parallel for the field-assisted mode in CrSb\\((1\\bar{1}00)\\)/Pt and non-parallel for the field-free mode in W/CrSb\\((11\\bar{2}0)\\). The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector induces an asymmetric energy barrier in the field-assisted mode and generates an asymmetric driving force in the field-free mode. In particular, the latter is guaranteed by the emerging Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya torque in altermagnets. Reconstructing crystal symmetry adds a new twist to the manipulation of altermagnetic order. It not only underpins the magnetic-memory and nano-oscillator technology4,5 but also inspires crossover studies between altermagnetism and other research topics.",

However, little is known about the drivers of the soil engineering effects caused by these small but important invertebrates3 at the global scale.

The effect of termites on soil respiration and plant biomass, and the effect of earthworms on soil nitrogen and phosphorus content, increase with mean annual temperature and peak in the tropics. By contrast, the effects of ants on soil nitrogen, soil phosphorus, plant biomass and survival rate peak at mid-latitude ecosystems that have the lowest primary productivity. Notably, termites and ants increase plant growth by alleviating plant phosphorus limitation in the tropics and nitrogen limitation in temperate regions, respectively. Our study highlights the important roles of these invertebrate taxa in global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. Given the importance of these soil-engineering invertebrates, biogeochemical models should better integrate their effects, especially on carbon fluxes and nutrient cycles.",

          "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, which is strongly associated with obesity1, causing sensory loss and, in some patients, neuropathic pain2,3. Although the onset and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is linked with dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia4, the contribution of inflammation to peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis has not been investigated. Here we used a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD), which induces obesity and prediabetic metabolic changes, to study the onset of peripheral neuropathy. Mice fed the HFHFD developed persistent heat hypoalgesia after 3 months, but a reduction in epidermal skin nerve fibre density manifested only at 6 months. Using single-cell sequencing, we found that CCR2+ macrophages infiltrate the sciatic nerves of HFHFD-fed mice well before axonal degeneration is detectable. These infiltrating macrophages share gene expression similarities with nerve-crush-induced macrophages5 and express neurodegeneration-associated microglial marker genes6, although there is no axon loss or demyelination. Inhibiting the macrophage recruitment by genetically or pharmacologically blocking CCR2 signalling resulted in more severe heat hypoalgesia and accelerated skin denervation, as did deletion of Lgals3, a gene expressed in recruited macrophages. Recruitment of macrophages into the peripheral nerves of obese prediabetic mice is, therefore, neuroprotective, delaying terminal sensory axon degeneration by means of galectin 3. Potentiating and sustaining early neuroprotective immune responses in patients could slow or prevent peripheral neuropathy.",

In mice, aggressive behaviour can be broken down into an appetitive phase, which involves approach and investigation, and a consummatory phase, which involves biting, kicking and wrestling1. Here, by performing an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis on whole-brain FOS expression in mice, we identify a cluster of brain regions, including hypothalamic and amygdalar subregions and olfactory cortical regions, that are highly co-activated in male but not in female aggressors. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (COApl)—an extended olfactory structure—was found to be a hub region, on the basis of the number and strength of correlations with other regions in the cluster. Our data also show that oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing cells in the COApl (COAplEsr1) exhibit increased activity during attack behaviour and during bouts of investigation that precede an attack, in male mice only. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of COAplEsr1 cells in male aggressors reduces aggression and increases pro-social investigation without affecting social reward and reinforcement behaviour. We further show that COAplEsr1 projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala are necessary for these behaviours. Collectively, these data suggest that, in aggressive males, COAplEsr1 cells respond specifically to social stimuli, thereby enhancing their salience and promoting attack behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors sense pathogen effectors and form resistosomes to confer immunity1. Some sensor NLR resistosomes produce small molecules to induce formation of a heterotrimer complex with two lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and SAG101, and a helper NLR called NRG1 (refs. 2,3). Activation of sensor NLR resistosomes also triggers NRG1 oligomerization and resistosome formation at the plasma membrane4,5. We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A heterotrimer formation is stabilized by the AtNRG1A loss-of-oligomerization mutant L134E5,6. We report structures of AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A L134E and AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1C heterotrimers with similar assembly mechanisms. AtNRG1A signalling is activated by the interaction with the AtEDS1–AtSAG101 heterodimer in complex with their small-molecule ligand. The truncated AtNRG1C maintains core interacting domains of AtNRG1A but develops further interactions with AtEDS1–AtSAG101 to outcompete AtNRG1A. Moreover, AtNRG1C lacks an N-terminal signalling domain and shows nucleocytoplasmic localization, facilitating its sequestration of AtEDS1–AtSAG101, which is also nucleocytoplasmic. Our study shows the activation and inhibition mechanisms of a plant helper NLR.",

          "abstract": "Zinc is emerging as a key material for next-generation biodegradable implants1,2,3,4,5. However, its inherent softness limits its use in load-bearing orthopaedic implants. Although reducing the grain size of zinc can make it stronger, it also destabilizes its mechanical properties and thus makes it less durable at body temperature6. Here we show that extruded Zn alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased while maintaining a basal texture. In this inverse Hall–Petch effect, the dominant deformation mode changes from inter-granular grain boundary sliding and dynamic recrystallization at the original grain size to intra-granular pyramidal slip and unusual twinning at the increased grain size. The role of the anomalous twins, termed ‘accommodation twins’ in this work, is to accommodate the altered grain shape in the plane lying perpendicular to the external loading direction, in contrast to the well-known ‘mechanical twins’ whose role is to deliver plasticity along the external loading direction7,8. The strength level achieved in these dilute zinc alloys is nearly double those of biodegradable implants made of magnesium alloys—making them the strongest and most stable biodegradable alloys available, to our knowledge, for fabricating bone fixation implants.",

          "abstract": "Recent macroevolutionary studies predict a diversification of early birds during the Jurassic period1,2,3,4, but the unquestionable Jurassic bird fossil record is limited to Archaeopteryx1,5,6, which has also been referred to deinonychosaurian dinosaurs by some analyses7,8. Although they have feathered wings, the known Jurassic birds are more similar to non-avialan theropods in having the ancestral long reptilian tail9,10,11. This is in stark contrast to most Cretaceous and crownward taxa, which have a short tail that terminates in a compound bone called the pygostyle12,13,14. Here we report on the oldest short-tailed avialan, Baminornis zhenghensis gen. et sp. nov., from the recently discovered Late Jurassic Zhenghe Fauna15, which fills a noticeable spatio-temporal gap in the earliest branching avialan fossil record. B. zhenghensis exhibits a unique combination of derived ornithothoracine-like pectoral and pelvic girdles and plesiomorphic non-avialan maniraptoran hand, demonstrating mosaic evolution along stem avialan line. An avialan furcula collected from the same locality is referrable to ornithuromorphs on the basis of our morphometric and phylogenetic analyses. These newly discovered fossils demonstrate the early appearance of highly derived bird features, and together with an anchiornithine fossil from the same locality, they suggest an earlier origin of birds and a radiation of early birds in the Jurassic.",

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters contain vast amounts of hot ionized gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM is shorter than the age of the cluster. However, the absence of line emission associated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source1,2. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (‘sloshing’) motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for heat distribution from the outside of the core3,4. Here we present X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy, with velocities from 130 km s−1 to 310 km s−1 within about 30 kpc of the centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. Although the bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre, it could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be only ≲120 km s−1 in the core, even within about 10 kpc of the AGN. This suggests that the influence of the AGN on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster.",

In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are theoretically contested1,2,3,4 and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude5,6. Here we present a method to directly access this quantity by precisely measuring the energy width of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the radioactive decay of beryllium-7. The final state in the decay process contains a recoiling lithium-7 nucleus, which is entangled with an electron neutrino at creation. The lithium-7 energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding beryllium-7 radioisotopes into a high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. Under this approach, we set a lower limit on the Heisenberg spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter of 6.2 pm, which implies that the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first, to our knowledge, direct lower limit on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket is extracted. These results may have implications in several areas including the theoretical understanding of neutrino properties, the nature of localization in weak nuclear decays and the interpretation of neutrino physics data.",

          "abstract": "Lithium (Li) ions are central to the energy storing functionality of rechargeable batteries1. Present technology relies on sophisticated Li-inclusive electrode materials to provide Li ions and exactingly protect them to ensure a decent lifetime2. Li-deficient materials are thus excluded from battery design, and the battery fails when active Li ions are consumed3. Our study breaks this limit by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy. This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases. This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly. We leveraged machine learning to discover such functional salts and identified lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3) with optimal electrochemical activity, potential, product formation, electrolyte solubility and specific capacity. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated a 3.0 V, 1,192 Wh kg−1 Li-free cathode, chromium oxide, in the anode-less cell, as well as an organic sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode incorporated in a 388 Wh kg−1 pouch cell with a 440-cycle life. These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the lifetime of commercial LiFePO4 batteries was extended by at least an order of magnitude. With repeated external Li supplies, a commercial graphite|LiFePO4 cell displayed a capacity retention of 96.0% after 11,818 cycles.",

          "abstract": "The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt (TeV) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena1,2,3. Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea4, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. We detect a muon with an estimated energy of \\(12{0}_{-60}^{+110}\\) petaelectronvolts (PeV). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now5,6,7 falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe.",

          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein 1,2 . Utrophin ( UTRN ), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD , is upregulated in some DMD patients 3–5 . To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMD PTC minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD , aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMD patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation 6–8 plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMD patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation via transcriptional adaptation. ",

          "abstract": "Cancer mutations can create neomorphic protein–protein interactions to drive aberrant function 1,2 . As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma 3 , the most common embryonal brain tumour in children 4 . These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST 5 . However, their mechanism remains unresolved. Here we establish that KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2 as the direct target of the mutant substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we chart the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat β-propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 β-propellers is stabilized by the medulloblastoma mutations, which insert a bulky side chain into the HDAC1 active site pocket. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3–neosubstrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, we unveil a converging shape-complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4–HDAC1 interface and proliferation of KBTBD4-mutant medulloblastoma cells. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein–protein interactions.",

So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries2. Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries.",

Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells 4,5 . Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte–neuron metabolite shuttle 6 . Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential.",

Those methods that provide efficient access to structural alternatives for aromatic compounds (i.e., saturated arene bioisosteres), have become highly coveted.1,2,3,4 The incorporation of such bioisosteres typically leads to favorable drug-like properties and represents an emerging field of research. Here, we report a new synthetic method that furnishes one especially coveted motif, the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold,5,6 using mild reaction conditions and an operationally-simple protocol. The methodology proceeds via the uncommon coupling of two strained fragments: transiently-generated cyclic allenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, which possess considerable strain energies of ~30 kcal/mol7 and ~60 kcal/mol,6 respectively. The reaction is thought to proceed via a σ-bond insertion through a diradical pathway. However, rather than requiring an external stimulus to generate radical species, reactivity is thought to arise as a result of innate diradical character present in each reactant. This diradicaloid character,8 an underutilized parameter in reaction design, arises from the severe geometric distortions of each reactant. Our studies provide a means to access functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes of value for drug discovery, underscore how geometric distortion of reactants can be used to enable uncommon modes of reactivity, and should encourage the further exploration and strategic use of diradicaloids in chemical synthesis.",

In this Perspective, we present the strategic vision of the MorPhiC Consortium and discuss various strategies for generating null alleles, as well as the challenges involved. We describe the cellular models and scalable phenotypic readouts that will be used in the consortium’s initial phase, focusing on 1,000 protein-coding genes. The resulting molecular and cellular data will be compiled into a catalogue of null-allele phenotypes. The methodologies developed in this phase will establish best practices for extending these approaches to all human protein-coding genes.

          "abstract": "UM171 is a potent agonist of ex vivo human haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal 1 . By co-opting KBTBD4, a substrate receptor of the CUL3–RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, UM171 promotes the degradation of the LSD1–CoREST corepressor complex, thereby limiting haematopoietic stem cell attrition 2,3 . However, the direct target and mechanism of action of UM171 remain unclear. Here we show that UM171 acts as a molecular glue to induce high-affinity interactions between KBTBD4 and HDAC1/2 to promote corepressor degradation. Through proteomics and chemical inhibitor studies, we identify the principal target of UM171 as HDAC1/2. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of dimeric KBTBD4 bound to UM171 and the LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST complex identifies an asymmetric assembly in which a single UM171 molecule enables a pair of KELCH-repeat propeller domains to recruit the HDAC1 catalytic domain. One KBTBD4 propeller partially masks the rim of the HDAC1 active site, which is exploited by UM171 to extend the E3–neosubstrate interface. The other propeller cooperatively strengthens HDAC1 binding through a distinct interface. The overall CoREST–HDAC1/2–KBTBD4 interaction is further buttressed by the endogenous cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate, which acts as a second molecular glue. The functional relevance of the quaternary complex interaction surfaces is demonstrated by base editor scanning of KBTBD4 and HDAC1 . By delineating the direct target of UM171 and its mechanism of action, we reveal how the cooperativity offered by a dimeric CRL3 E3 can be leveraged by a small molecule degrader.",

          "abstract": "The use of reactive supports to disperse metal species is crucial for constructing highly efficient interfacial catalysts, by tuning the competitive reactant adsorption–activation pattern in supported metal catalysts into a non-competitive mechanism1,2,3. However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications4. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/γ-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of γ-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of \\(\\mathrm{24,500}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\).

Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus 1 , but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, ‘state cells’). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence.",

Owing to its distinct molecular structure and flexible hydrogen bonds that readily adapt to a wide range of pressures and temperatures, water forms numerous crystalline and amorphous phases4–6. Most relevant for the high pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors is ice VII4, and simulations have identified along its melting curve the existence of a so-called plastic phase7–12 where individual molecules occupy fixed positions as in a solid yet are able to rotate as in a liquid. Such plastic ice has not yet been directly observed in experiments. Here, we present quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements, conducted at temperatures between 450 and 600 K and pressures up to 6 GPa, that reveal the existence of a body centered cubic (bcc) structure, as found in ice VII, with water molecules exhibiting picosecond rotational dynamics typical for liquid water. Comparison with molecular dynamics simulations indicates that this plastic ice VII does not conform to a free rotor phase but rather exhibits rapid orientational jumps, as observed in jump-rotor plastic crystals13,14. We anticipate that our observation of plastic ice VII will impact our understanding of the geodynamics of icy planets and the differentiation processes of large icy moons.",

          "title": "Your brain is full of microplastics: are they harming you?",
          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "A sliver of human brain in a small vial starts to melt as lye is added to it. Over the next few days, the caustic chemical will break down the neurons and blood vessels within, leaving behind a grisly slurry containing thousands of tiny plastic particles.\n\nToxicologist Matthew Campen has been using this method to isolate and track the microplastics — and their smaller counterparts, nanoplastics — found in human kidneys, livers and especially brains. Campen, who is at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, estimates that he can isolate about 10 grams of plastics from a donated human brain; that’s about the weight of an unused crayon.\n\nMicroplastics have been found just about everywhere that scientists have looked: on remote islands, in fresh snow in Antarctica, at the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific, in food, in water and in the air that we breathe. And scientists such as Campen are finding them spread throughout the human body.\n\nLandmark study links microplastics to serious health problems\n\nDetection is only the first step, however. Determining precisely what these plastics are doing inside people and whether they’re harmful has been much harder. That’s because there’s no one ‘microplastic’. They come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes and chemical compositions, each of which could affect cells and tissues differently.\n\nThis is where Campen’s beige sludge comes into play. Despite microplastics’ ubiquity, it’s difficult to determine which microplastics people are exposed to, how they’re exposed and which particles make their way into the nooks and crannies of the body. The samples that Campen collects from cadavers can, in turn, be used to test how living tissues respond to the kinds of plastic that people carry around with them.\n\n“Morbidly speaking, the best source I can think of to get good, relevant microplastics is to take an entire human brain and digest it,” says Campen.\n\nThe world is hungry for data — German consumers rated microplastics in food as their top environmental-health concern in 2023, for example. And negotiations on a global treaty that could cap plastics production are under way. Findings have trickled out slowly, hampered by insufficient analytical methods, contamination risks and a lack of collaboration between scientists in different fields. “There’s no cookbook at this point. There’s no manual of standard operating procedures,” says Kathleen Egan, a cancer researcher at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. “We’re having to make them up as we go, and it’s a process.”\n\nBut there are signs that scientists are ironing out these kinks, and that the field is maturing. Campen is one of a cadre of researchers developing unconventional methods and forming teams of interdisciplinary scientists. They are caught in a race against time. Plastics production, which began less than a century ago, reaches an all-time high each year, and the material takes hundreds, if not thousands, of years to degrade, which will create trillions of microplastics in the process.\n\n“There are microplastics everywhere,” says Bart Koelmans, an environmental chemist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. “We cannot run away from them.”\n\nPiling up\n\nThe term microplastics was coined 20 years ago, but only in the past 10 years have researchers progressed from studying the particles in the environment and animals to gauging their effects on human health, says Martin Wagner, a biologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “It’s a young field,” he says.\n\nCampen’s team has already found grim results: as the number of plastics created has increased sharply, so too has the concentration of microplastics found in the brain, liver and kidneys, according to his group’s results published in Nature Medicine this month1. On average, microplastic levels were about 50% higher in brain samples from 2024 than in 2016 samples. And brain samples contained up to 30 times more microplastics than samples from a person’s liver and kidneys.\n\nAir pollution and brain damage: what the science says\n\nAnother study published in January2 might offer clues as to how the particles congregate. Researchers fed mice water laced with microplastics and tracked the movements of the particles through the bodies of the mice. The researchers found that the plastics were gobbled up by immune cells, and ended up piling up in and blocking small blood vessels in the brain.\n\nWhat plastics do to human organs is subject to intense study. When scientists add microplastics to human tissue samples in the laboratory, it can result in cell death, immune reactions and tissue damage. And hundreds of studies have exposed animals — mainly aquatic organisms — to microplastics and found that the particles can clog their guts or hinder their ability to reproduce. On the basis of these findings, researchers suspect that these particles could be linked to cancer3, heart4 and kidney disease5, Alzheimer’s disease6 or fertility issues7 in people.\n\nBut there is no evidence yet that microplastics directly cause poor health in humans — only data that show a link. A landmark study4, published in March 2024, reported that nearly 60% of about 250 people who were undergoing heart surgery had micro- or nanoplastics in a main artery. Those who did were 4.5 times more likely to experience a heart attack, a stroke or death in the three years after the surgery than were those whose arteries were plastic-free.\n\nBut, as the authors of the study acknowledge, the presence of plastic might correlate with other factors that would influence health, such as diet or socio-economic status.\n\nShifting sands\n\nThe field has grown in the past decade: for example, in 2014, there were 20 papers published that include the keyword ‘microplastics’ listed in Elsevier’s Scopus database. Nearly 6,000 were published in 2024. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued its first grant with the word ‘microplastics’ only seven years ago — in 2018. Since then, the agency has funded more than 45 projects.\n\nBut as money comes in and interest grows, researchers are still developing methods. This burst of innovation is exciting, says Phoebe Stapleton, a toxicologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, who studies the effects of plastics during pregnancy. But it also means that each team of scientists is developing and using different analytical approaches to detect and characterize microplastics. And there haven’t been many studies analysing each method’s reliability or validity.\n\nSamples of the types of microplastic that have been found in the Atlantic Ocean.Credit: Sophie Dingwall/eXXpedition\n\nThis lack of standardization makes it difficult to do a head-to-head comparison of studies by different groups, says Eliseo Castillo, a mucosal immunologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque who studies the particles’ effects on the digestive and immune systems.\n\nFor example, many studies use pristine microplastics — such as small spheres — that are not representative of the diversity of particles found in the environment. Some researchers argue that they are the most readily available and standardized set of microplastics available to use, whereas others say that they’re a waste of money because they are so different from what people are exposed to. “We defend our areas like crazy”, Campen says, and that can ultimately hinder the search for conclusive data. There are numerous variables in the plastics themselves, including size, shape and composition. And many are coated with one of more than 10,000 chemical additives to make them more flexible, flame retardant or degradable. Furthermore, plastics might affect each organ or cell type differently. A sharp microplastic fragment might be more damaging in the fragile lung environment than in the throat, for example.\n\nThe dose matters, too, as well as the route of ingestion, says Alison Elder, an inhalation toxicologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. “The inhalation route is a major concern because if inhaled plastics can get into the deep lung and cause an inflammatory reaction, they don’t need to go anywhere to cause health outcomes,” she says.\n\nWhile the field develops tools and works out the strengths and weaknesses of each one, it will be important for researchers to use multiple methods to confirm the characteristics of the particles that they’re finding, Stapleton says.\n\nMicro to nano\n\nOf particular concern are the smallest of plastics that get inhaled and ingested, says Stephanie Wright, an environmental toxicologist at Imperial College London. Particles of less than 1 micrometre across (see ‘Microplastics to scale’) have earned the name nanoplastics (some argue for a smaller cut-off of around 0.1 micrometres). Depending on the ingestion route, some data suggest that many particles larger than this pass through the digestive system and are excreted. Nanoplastics, however, might be taken into cells, in which the body doesn’t have established mechanisms to digest or expel them.\n\nSource (tools and costs): S. Primpke et al. Appl. Spectrosc. 74, 1012–1047 (2020).\n\nStapleton and her colleagues, for example, have found that during pregnancy the placenta does not serve as a barrier to nanoparticles in rats, and that nanoplastics cross from mother to fetus — and are quickly dispersed in fetal tissue8. It will be important to understand what the particles are doing there, Stapleton says, especially because they take up a disproportionate amount of space in a fetus compared with in a fully-grown adult.",

          "abstract": "From CRISPR gene editing to protein-structure predictions driven by artificial intelligence, great innovations stem from interdisciplinary research. Solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss, health inequities and other global crises will also rely on insights that bridge many fields.\n\nYet interdisciplinary research is still sidelined in many countries. Even though these papers attract more citations1 and have more impact on research2, interdisciplinary research proposals tend to be less likely to receive funding than are those with a narrower scope3.\n\nSome countries have adjusted their research funding strategies accordingly. For example, between 2016 and 2018, UK research councils awarded 30% more grants to interdisciplinary investigators than they had a decade earlier, with 44% of funded projects in 2018 spanning at least two research subjects4. A similar move has been made in the United States: between 2015 and 2020, university departments that submitted some interdisciplinary grant proposals received almost five times more funding — in terms of total and individual awards — from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) than did those that submitted in only one discipline5.\n\n‘Male-dominated campuses belong to the past’: the University of Tokyo tackles the gender gap\n\nAlas, this isn’t the case in Japan. The nation’s funding agencies still mostly support research in tight disciplinary boundaries, such as engineering or chemistry. Specialists who evaluate these grant proposals tend to favour work in fields that they are familiar with over interdisciplinary studies they do not understand well.\n\nThis narrow approach is leading to substantial underfunding of interdisciplinary research in Japan. It also means that the nation is missing out on breakthroughs. Japan’s natural resources are limited, and its economy has long relied on science and technology. The decline in its research and innovation is unmistakable, as indicated by the country’s share of the world’s top 10% of most-cited research articles, which has dropped from 6% to 2% over the past two decades or so.\n\nAs scientists and engineers based in Japanese research institutions, we urge the government and funding agencies to do more to support interdisciplinary research — or risk eroding the country’s global standing in science and its economy. Here we highlight five directions to foster such a shift.\n\nFund people, not projects\n\nWe argue that Japanese funding agencies should pivot from funding projects to supporting talented researchers. Such a model has proven to be effective in leading institutions worldwide. For example, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s (HHMI) Investigator Program provides outstanding scientists with flexible, long-term funding to pursue high-impact biomedical research — some US$11 million over a seven-year term, which can be renewed. This approach has led to groundbreaking discoveries, including the mechanistic understanding of circadian rhythms, the computational prediction of protein folding and the discovery of RNA interference.\n\nJapanese research is no longer world class — here’s why\n\nSimilarly, in Germany, the Max Planck Society prioritizes curiosity-driven research that has long-term objectives over immediate applications. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and providing institute directors with generous internal funding, free from the continual need to secure external grants, this strategy has enabled breakthroughs including the development of CRISPR–Cas9 as a gene-editing tool and structural insights into ribosomes.\n\nJapan does have some programmes to support talented researchers, but these are too timid. The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), for example, dedicate some funds to basic science and some to curiosity-driven research. But the JST adopts a top-down approach, which often favours research on trending topics and can miss more-original ideas or projects . And the annual budget for the JSPS’s main grant programme, the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), has remained stagnant for the past decade. Adjusted for inflation and the weakening yen, the average funding per project has halved since 2013.\n\nHowever, one Japanese institution has adopted researcher-focused funding with great success: the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST). Unlike national universities, which are funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, OIST is a private university that is funded by Japan’s Cabinet Office. Launched in 2011, it has a horizontal organizational structure and a strong commitment to diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration (see ‘Steps to success’). OIST is now ranked as Japan’s leading research institute by the Nature Index, and around 20% of its publications involve contributions across more than one discipline. More Japanese institutions should follow its lead.\n\nSteps to success\n\nAt the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), faculty members receive core funding for five years — with flexibility in what to do with it. Unlike many other universities, in which laboratories must cover the costs of core facilities and technical staff, access to these resources at OIST is provided free of charge. This fosters collaboration and enables high-risk, high-reward projects. A review of each faculty member every five years ensures accountability, with continued support granted only to those who demonstrate significant achievements.\n\nOIST also operates without conventional departments, helping scientists from different fields to collaborate. The buildings host open spaces, lounges, shared kitchens and open desk areas that encourage casual interactions. PhD students must also rotate through multiple labs during their first year to widen their horizons. These rotations facilitate the exchange of ideas and technologies, embedding interdisciplinary collaboration into the fabric of the institution.\n\nAlthough further progress is needed, including in terms of gender and disability, OIST fosters a greater diversity in its community than do other Japanese institutions. This is partly because it attracts scholars from around the world. In 2024, more than 60% of faculty members and 80% of students at OIST were not Japanese citizens, bringing a dynamic mix of perspectives and expertise.\n\nEmbrace high-stakes projects\n\nInterdisciplinary research is often perceived as riskier than more conventional, single-discipline work. This might be because it can be hard to learn concepts and methods, and even communicate efficiently, across disciplines. And priorities between fields can conflict.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, Japanese funding agencies should consider adopting a ‘high risk, high impact’ funding model, similar to that of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which anticipates a success rate of just 50%. They should recognize that even ‘unsuccessful’ high-risk projects can generate valuable knowledge, contributing to broader scientific and technological advancements. The DARPA funding model has inspired others, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), launched in the NIH to drive biomedical breakthroughs6.\n\nHow to improve assessments of publication integrity\n\nAnother example is the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in California, which supports interdisciplinary teams comprising biologists, engineers and data scientists to work on ambitious goals, such as the eradication of infectious diseases. It provides substantial funding over several years to enable teams to pivot research directions in response to emerging challenges. Success is assessed through regular milestone-based evaluations. Projects that show limited potential are promptly terminated, ensuring that resources can be reallocated to more-promising endeavours.\n\nIn Japan, we are not advocating for existing funds to be redistributed. Rather, Japanese policymakers should allocate money to high-risk, high-reward projects from a separate pot, managed through dedicated DARPA-like programmes.\n\nExpand grant panels\n\nInitiatives such as the JST’s Diversity and Inclusiveness programme aim to lessen the homogeneity of the research workforce — for example, through awards and networking opportunities for women in science and by providing support or extensions for life events as well as for childcare and caregiving commitments — which tend to fall mostly on women (see page 295). This is laudable, but these efforts should be more widespread: they should be extended across genders and also include funding agency officers, programme managers and reviewers.\n\nThe crewed research submersible Shinkai 6500 has conducted more than 1,700 dives.Credit: Associated Press/Alamy\n\nJapan’s funding agencies should also ensure that their own decision makers are less homogeneous in terms of their discipline, background, gender, age, nationality and culture. This would help to favour interdisciplinary research, which by nature weaves different approaches together and can benefit from being planned, conducted and assessed by a diverse community.\n\nThe role of immigration in boosting diversity should also be recognized.",

This historical isolation means that people from some parts of Greenland are more likely to develop certain genetic diseases than are people in other parts of the world.\n\nThe findings, published on 12 February in Nature1, offer “new insights” on how genetics can be used to deliver better health care to Arctic populations, says Anders Koch, a senior physician at Queen Ingrid’s Hospital in Nuuk.\n\nAmbitious survey of human diversity yields millions of undiscovered genetic variants\n\nSmall, Indigenous populations — including Greenland’s — have long been a blind spot in genetics research, because most of the DNA in genetic databases comes from people of European ancestry. What little research has been done on the island suggests that living in the Arctic has profoundly altered the genetic make-up of Greenlanders, most of whom have mixed Inuit and European ancestry.\n\nIn the current study, researchers sequenced the DNA of 5,996 Greenlanders — around 14% of the adult population. By comparing these full or partially sequenced genomes, the team was able to confirm that Greenland was originally populated by a small group of travellers, fewer than 300 people, who arrived from Siberia, via North America, in the past 1,000 years.\n\nAfter the first big push, Greenland’s inhabitants “didn’t roam the coastline”, says Koch. Instead, they “sort of lived within a particular confined area and developed their own traits and variants”. Some of these gene variants seem to be adaptations to life in the Arctic. For example, many Greenlandic Inuit have the same variant of a gene involved in metabolizing fatty acids2 — this might be linked to the consumption of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as seal and whale meat.\n\nImpact of isolation",

Other companies using a similar technology to build machines — called neutral atom quantum computers — are also making gains on industry leaders such as IBM.\n\n‘A truly remarkable breakthrough’: Google’s new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone\n\nNeutral atom technology “is catching up”, says Doug Finke a computer scientist who works at business-analysis firm Global Quantum Intelligence in Orange County, California. “As far as we know this is the largest venture investment in a neutral-atom company.”\n\nNeutral atoms are stable and can remain in their quantum states without bulky cooling systems. These are features that should make them excellent qubits, the building blocks of a quantum computer, equivalent to classical bits of information. But for years, progress in neutral atom quantum computing was stymied by how precisely physicists could coax the particles to carry out calculations.\n\nQuantum race\n\nAdvances in ways to configure and control the atoms since 2019 mean that operations are now close in accuracy those in other hardware types. “Over the past few years, we’ve seen major breakthroughs,” says Wenchao Xu, a physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich). “There is definitely a lot of excitement.”\n\nAtom-based quantum computers are catching up to firms such as IonQ or Google that use trapped ions or tiny superconducting circuits to represent quantum states. QuEra in Boston, Massachusetts, is not alone in pursing neutral atom technology: Atom Computing in Berkeley, California, Infleqtion in Boulder, Colorado, and Pasqal in Massy, France, have created machines with hundreds of qubits.\n\nThis billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed?\n\nTheir road maps to grow the number of interacting qubits are among the industry’s most aggressive. Making a computer that can start to perform useful calculations will probably take tens of thousands of qubits, working together to overcome errors that are inherent to quantum systems.\n\nQuEra spun out of research at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both in Cambridge. In its system, physicists trap an array of rubidium atoms using laser light and store quantum information in the energy levels of their electrons.",

          "abstract": "The US Environmental Protection Agency, with headquarters in Washington DC, regulates pollution to protect the environment and human health.Credit: Aaron Schwartz/ZUMA Press/Alamy\n\nBefore Donald Trump became US president for the second time last month, one of his Republican allies revealed a plan to put US government employees “in trauma” so that they would leave their jobs. The strategy, articulated by Russell Vought, now a key figure on Trump’s White House team, was one part of a larger plan to downsize and defund government agencies. Less than a month into the new administration, many scientists at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) say Vought’s plan seems to be working.\n\nDread and determination: how climate scientists are preparing for Trump 2.0\n\n“I’m scared to open my computer every morning,” says one EPA scientist who asked for anonymity because they fear reprisal. They are one of the more than 1,000 employees tasked with regulating air pollution, researching the health effects of toxic chemicals and more, who were notified last week that they might be fired. These staff members are still in their initial, ‘probationary’ period — usually within one year of starting their jobs — and therefore can be fired at any time, said an agency e-mail they received. “It’s just cruel,” says the scientist.\n\nTermination notices for probationary employees started going out today at the EPA as the Trump administration accelerated efforts to fire this category of worker across the federal government. Thus far, the scientists who spoke to Nature have not been affected, but they fear they could be at any moment.\n\nWhite House officials declined to respond to Nature’s questions. In a statement, the EPA said that the agency is “diligently implementing President Trump's executive orders and associated guidance” and “remains committed to our mission of protecting human health and the environment”. The goal, it added, “is to create a more effective and efficient federal government”.\n\nAn agency under fire\n\nThe EPA has long been a target of Trump and his Republican allies. The politicians say that the agency hampers the US economy by issuing excessively strict pollution regulations. Republicans, including Vought, had called for the agency to be downsized and its authority reined in, as set out in ‘Project 2025’, a proposed blueprint for a second Trump administration.\n\nAnother action that EPA scientists say has been demoralizing is the announcement, on 11 February, by Trump-appointed agency administrator Lee Zeldin that 171 staff members were being placed on administrative leave. These employees work on programmes related to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental justice, which focuses on protecting poor communities that are vulnerable to pollution and climate change. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order asking all agencies to eliminate “radical and wasteful government DEI programs”, including environmental-justice positions.\n\nLee Zeldin was appointed by US President Donald Trump to lead the EPA during his second administration.Credit: Anna Moneymaker/Getty\n\nIn his announcement, Zeldin accused the administration of former US president Joe Biden, a Democrat, of pushing “ideological” goals with those programmes. “This ends now,” Zeldin said in a statement. “We will be good stewards of tax dollars and do everything in our power to deliver clean air, land, and water to every American, regardless of race, religion, background, and creed.”\n\nSo far, EPA scientists interviewed by Nature say that core research activities at the agency, such as papers being published and studies being run, have not been significantly affected, although two of its main science advisory panels, which provide technical guidance to the agency, have been disbanded so that new members can be appointed. And the agency has taken down the website of an environmental-justice tool known as EJScreen, which maps threats such as pollution alongside demographic trends to identify vulnerable communities. But many scientists fear it’s just a matter of time.\n\n“The only good news right now is that the administration’s attention seems to be elsewhere,” says Andy Miller, who retired from EPA’s primary research branch, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), in December. “It’s unlikely that will continue.”\n\nWorries over safety\n\nNature spoke to multiple staff members within the EPA’s environmental-justice programme who also asked for anonymity because they fear retribution. One of them, now among those on administrative leave, says the situation has injected uncertainty into every facet of their life, from career prospects to the mortgage payments on their home. They also worry about their personal safety. Last week, reports emerged of a ‘DEI Watch List’ created by a right-wing organization that exposed the names, photos and salaries of federal workers, many of them people of colour, whose jobs are linked to DEI efforts. Its aim, the group says, is to restore “common sense” to the US government.\n\n“I’ve got close friends” on that list, one EPA staff member says, and fears they’ll be added, too, if the organization turns its attention to the agency. “It’s not even about targeting institutions and funding and priorities: people are actually being targeted as individuals.”\n\nEPA contractors remove hazardous waste from a home destroyed in the Los Angeles wildfires that raged in January.Credit: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nOne environmental scientist at the agency says that this is their second time as a probationary employee under Trump. They re-entered probationary status recently because of a transfer to a new role in the agency. They note that many probationary employees can appeal a termination if it was because of discrimination or for political reasons, but that assumes that normal rules within the government remain intact.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order focused on changing rules for civil servants — the the more than 2 million federal employees, including scientists, who were hired for their expertise rather than being politically appointed by the president. The policy, known as Schedule F, would make it easier for the administration to fire many employees, whose jobs are normally protected by law. At least one legal challenge to the order, from union organizations, has already arisen.",

          "authors": "Jesús Avila, Federico Mayor Jr, Paola Bovolenta",
          "abstract": "Credit: Luis Davilla/Cover/Getty\n\nBiochemist Federico Mayor Zaragoza played a pivotal part in preventing inherited metabolic diseases in Spain, setting up the country’s first trials of the heel-prick test for newborn infants. In 1975, he co-founded the Centre for Molecular Biology (CBM) in Madrid, one of southern Europe’s pioneering research institutions. During his mandate as director-general of the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO from 1987 to 1999, and afterwards, Mayor contributed to crucial initiatives that shaped international educational and scientific policies. He has died aged 90.\n\nMayor was born in Barcelona in 1934 and his early years were marked by the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). His father — a self-made man with no academic training — rose to manage one of the first pharmaceutical companies to produce antibiotics in Spain. In 1950, Mayor moved to Madrid to study pharmacy. After earning a PhD in biochemistry in 1958, he became, in 1963, the youngest professor of biochemistry at the University of Granada, in southern Spain.\n\nIn 1966–67, on sabbatical in Oxford, UK, he met biochemist Louis Woolf, who had developed simple tests for the detection of some metabolic diseases, such as phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria causes severe learning difficulties in people who are unable to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. However, Woolf had found that the disorder could be treated successfully with a special diet if detected early enough.\n\nmRNA drug offers hope for treating a devastating childhood disease\n\nOn his return to Granada, Mayor decided to work on molecular diseases that affected newborn babies, including phenylketonuria and other rare metabolic conditions. Along with his collaborators, he launched Spain’s first neonatal blood-screening tests in 1968. These screens have since helped to prevent thousands of cases of genetic and metabolic disease in the country.\n\nBalancing research with leadership roles, Mayor was the rector of the University of Granada between 1968 and 1972. In 1973, he was recruited to lead the Department of Molecular Biology at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM), where he mentored a large number of young investigators. With help and inspiration of Spanish Nobel prizewinner Severo Ochoa, Mayor was a key co-founder and the first director of the CBM, a multidisciplinary institute that brought together his metabolism group at the UAM and prominent researchers in virology, molecular biology and developmental genetics. He also fostered a leading centre for the diagnosis of molecular diseases (CEDEM) at the UAM, focusing on the investigation and prevention of rare genetic diseases. The CEDEM is directed by his long-time collaborator Magdalena Ugarte.\n\nAfter Spain’s transition to democracy, Mayor was elected a member of the Spanish Parliament in 1977. He chaired the parliamentary committee for education and science and acted as an adviser to the country’s prime minister at the time, Adolfo Suárez. He later served as minister of education and science (1981–82), promoting measures to foster research at Spanish universities and earning accolades.\n\nAt UNESCO, Mayor focused on raising educational, scientific and cultural standards, emphasizing improvements in low- and middle-income nations in Africa and Latin America. For instance, he lent support to the World Declaration on Education for All in 1990, the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights in 1997 and the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1999.",

Credit: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto/Getty\n\nA prominent US scientific society altered its website to remove references to diversity and equity ― terms targeted by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Articles about scientists who are members of under-represented groups also temporarily vanished from the site, although they have since reappeared.\n\nThe editing sparked an outcry among some of the more than 37,000 members of the organization, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) in Washington DC. Some ASM members note that other scientific societies have posted statements in support of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), rather than deleting terms targeted by White House orders.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\n“I feel sad, mad, disappointed,” says Carla Bonilla, a biologist at the University of San Diego, California, who was born in El Salvador. An article about her on the ASM website was briefly replaced with a notice saying ‘Under review’ before being restored. Bonilla has been a member of the ASM since 2015, and says that it had always been consistent in its support for scientists from diverse backgrounds. But now, she says, it feels “like they are trying to hide me”.\n\nIn an e-mail, ASM president Theresa Koehler told Nature that the organization had followed legal advice to review all of its webpages, in the hope of protecting its federally funded programmes. But Koehler acknowledged that the organization should have alerted members to the review. “We realize that our poor communication has hurt and confused people,” wrote Koehler. “We will learn from this, and we will do better.”\n\nTargeted terminology\n\nThe ASM took action after Trump ordered federal agencies to end “radical and wasteful” DEI programmes and to take down websites and other public platforms that “promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology”. In response, numerous US agencies took steps to scrub terms mentioned in Trump’s orders from their websites and from research papers under review. Trump’s directives extended beyond the federal government: he also told federal officials to identify “large non-profit corporations or associations” that have DEI programmes as targets for investigation.\n\nIn the first few days of February, scientists began noticing changes to the ASM’s website. For example, the page for the ASM’s ‘Inclusive Diversity with Equity, Access and Accountability Committee’ morphed into a page for a ‘Progress, Impact, Access and Accountability Committee’.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\nThe phrase “other marginalized groups in science and health care” was replaced with “other groups in science and health care” in an article on the ASM website titled ‘Women in the History of Antimicrobial Development’, which was written by Jennifer Goff, a microbiologist at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. The original language was restored within hours of its removal, but “it’s particularly concerning that alterations were made to articles without contacting the authors to ask for permission”, says microbiologist and ASM member Sean Gibbons at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington.",

          "abstract": "Tatsuya Amano works with members of the translatE project, which strives to make environmental science more accessible to non-fluent English speakers.Credit: Naoki Katayama\nChangemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates people who fight racism in science and who champion inclusion. It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nJapanese biologist Tatsuya Amano has always struggled with English. But he accepted that, as a scientist, he would need to make an extra effort to communicate his research in science’s lingua franca. After moving to the University of Cambridge, UK, as a postdoc studying biodiversity changes at the global scale, Amano realized that most of his colleagues whose first language was not English were facing the same challenges, spending considerably more time reading papers, polishing their manuscripts and preparing oral presentations than those who were fluent.\n\nHe also noticed that the quality of a paper was often conflated with the quality of English writing, leading to many rejections simply because certain language standards weren’t met. Amano identified this as a serious inequality issue, so he decided to speak up — and back up his message with data. In the past decade, he has published several papers investigating language barriers in science.\n\nChampioning queer scientists of colour: ‘I don’t think we’ve scratched the surface on systemic exclusion’\nIn one such survey-based study, non-fluent English speakers reported that their papers were rejected 2.5 times as often as those of fluent speakers, owing to language-related issues1. Amano thinks that objectively measuring the effects of language barriers will bring more awareness to this often-hidden bias and pave the way for solutions. “It’s really hard for native English speakers to see, and let alone experience, how not being fluent in English is commonly viewed as the same as being inferior as a scientist,” he says.\n\nAmano, now a biodiversity researcher at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, tells Nature that science has a lot to lose by ignoring the inequalities caused by language barriers.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor and why?\n\nIf I have to choose one, I’d say it’s Bill Sutherland, a conservation biologist at the University of Cambridge, because he has always shown me, and continues to show, how to make a real difference in the community. As a postdoc in his group, I watched him develop and lead the Conservation Evidence project, turning his idea of “having all the existing evidence on what works in conservation2 at your fingertips” into a reality. I was lucky to watch him build this huge project, actively involving and influencing many people around the world.\n\nHe is extremely solution-oriented. For example, when he realized that we needed to provide more training on the importance of evidence-based conservation practices for future generations, he quickly assembled a team of 117 educators from 23 countries to develop open-access teaching materials in several languages. If I hadn’t worked with Bill and seen the power of these actions, I probably would have asked myself, “As a conservation scientist, should I really be working on language barriers in science?” But thanks to Bill’s influence, I had confidence in his approach and did not hesitate to tackle this issue.\n\nWhen did you decide to address language-related inequalities in science?\n\nMy first language is Japanese, and I struggle to communicate in English. Even now, I find it tough to write in English and prepare lecture materials. It was even a challenge to get ready for this interview. Initially, I saw this as my own problem.\n\nBut then, after I moved to Cambridge, I realized that this issue applies to almost every non-fluent English speaker.\n\nOne day, I looked up the number of people in the world whose first language is not English. It was 95% of the world’s population. That’s a massive number. And I thought, surely we can’t dismiss an issue that is affecting the inclusion of that much of the world. But this is not being seriously considered in academia. And that was the moment when I thought I should make a real change in science to better include non-native English speakers.\n\nHow have you dealt with issues of discrimination personally and professionally?\n\nLast April, one of my co-authored papers was rejected because the level of English did not meet the journal’s standard. Unfortunately, this is still very common.\n\nFor a long time, many of us non-native English speakers assumed that such rejections were our own fault. And the entire scientific community has relied on individuals to overcome these barriers on their own. But I see this as a serious inequality issue, and it is costing the community because we are losing huge numbers of uniquely talented researchers. For example, many participants in our survey1 expressed frustration, anxiety and stress because they had to do science in English. They also reported that younger generations have not been able to pursue their academic careers owing to language barriers.\n\nHow Los Angeles neighbours partnered to show under-represented students the ‘unspoken rules’ to success\nThat’s why we have been advocating solutions to eliminate this kind of inequality — and that led us toreview the policies of more than 700 biological science journals3. We proposed a set of linguistically inclusive policies for them to take up. For example, we recommended allowing manuscripts and abstracts to be published in relevant languages and having a public statement that manuscripts will be fairly assessed regardless of the perceived standard of English. I'm trying to make these barriers visible to everyone and propose productive solutions.",

          "abstract": "Researchers have developed nanosensors that can detect signs of cancer in blood.Credit: Maskot/Getty\n\nResearchers have developed a simple blood test to detect pancreatic cancer before it spreads to other sites in the body. The test could be used for routine screening to improve the disease’s low survival rate1.\n\n“It’s a very pragmatic, really translatable solution” that builds on many advances in the field, says Simone Schürle-Finke, a biomedical engineer at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland. The results are described in Science Translational Medicine today.\n\nMost pancreatic cancers begin in the ducts that secrete enzymes used to digest food. But this form of cancer often doesn’t cause recognizable symptoms and isn’t detectable until it has metastasized and spread, making it difficult to treat. In 2022, some 467,000 people died of the disease globally. “There is a huge need for developing new ways of detecting pancreatic cancer early,” says study co-author Jared Fischer, a molecular biologist at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland.\n\nTelltale proteins\n\nFischer and his colleagues focused on detecting enzymes called proteases, which break down proteins and are active in tumours, even from the very early stages. They specifically looked at the activity of matrix metalloproteinases involved in chewing up collagen and the extracellular matrix, which helps tumours to invade the body.\n\nTo detect the presence of these proteases in the blood, the researchers developed nanosensors containing a magnetic nanoparticle attached to a small peptide that attracts matrix metalloproteinases and a fluorescent molecule. They then placed millions of nanosensors in a tiny sample of blood. If matrix metalloproteinases were present, and active, they would chop the peptide in the nanosensors, releasing the fluorescent molecule. The researchers then used a magnet to suck out all the unchopped nanosensors, and measure how many chopped fluorescent particles were left. The more active proteases were present in the blood, the brighter the sample was.\n\nThe researchers tested the nanosensor on frozen blood samples from 356 individuals, some with pancreatic cancer, some with non-cancerous forms of pancreatic disease and healthy controls. The nanosensor correctly identified healthy individuals 98% of the time, and identified people with pancreatic cancer with 73% accuracy. It always distinguished between individuals with cancer and those with other pancreatic diseases.\n\nGiven that proteases are important for many bodily functions, Schürle-Finke did not expect the nanosensor to identify such a clear tumour signal in the blood. “I was really surprised to see that,” she says. The 73% sensitivity needs to be pushed higher before the sensors can be used by physicians, but overall, it is “a very promising, very impressive result”.",

Credit: Sam Pellock\n\nResearchers have used artificial intelligence (AI) to design brand-new enzymes that can go through multi-step reactions, a key feature of natural enzymes. The structures they made accelerated a four-step chemical reaction pivotal to many biological and industrial processes, including plastic recycling.\n\n“This is a milestone in enzyme engineering,” says Huimin Zhao, a synthetic biologist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “[It] shows that now it’s possible to design enzymes with native-like activity that could make them useful practically.”\n\nEarlier efforts to design enzymes from scratch using AI have had limited success, often producing ones that stall after the first step of a reaction. In the latest study, published in Science on 13 February1, researchers overcame this challenge by combining several machine-learning approaches. The new enzymes were 60,000 times better at speeding up the reaction than ones previously designed to work in a similar way.\n\nTailoring enzymes\n\nEarlier efforts have focused on tweaking the structures of existing enzymes to create new ones that work faster or have different functions. But this approach makes it difficult to create efficient enzymes capable of multi-step reactions.\n\n“It is like going to the thrift store and buying a suit, and that suit probably won’t fit you perfectly. That’s what happens when we try to design enzymes that way,” says study co-author Anna Lauko, a protein designer at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nAI has dreamt up a blizzard of new proteins. Do any of them actually work?\n\nLauko and her colleagues wanted to build enzymes that can undergo a four-step chemical reaction called serine hydrolysis, which involves breaking an ester bond between molecules. Serine hydrolases are the natural enzymes that carry out this reaction, and they are involved in many biological processes, including digestion, metabolizing fats and blood clotting.\n\nThe researchers started with an AI tool called RFdiffusion, a program they had previously developed to generate new enzyme structures from scratch2. They then created a deep neural network, called PLACER, to refine the structural design by modelling the locations of atoms in the enzyme and the molecules it binds to during every step of the reaction. This AI works like “a filter”, says Zou: it checks whether the enzyme’s active sites — the parts that interact with molecules — are compatible and properly arranged to carry out each step of the reaction. This is “very innovative”, says Zhao.",

Randazzo works on NASA’s Mars rover science team, helping to collect and analyse mineral samples gathered by Perseverance.Credit: Nicolas Randazzo\n\nNicolas Randazzo is proud of his unusual title: Mars 2020 Perseverance rover postdoctoral scientist. He’s based at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, where he works with meteorite geologist Chris Herd. But Randazzo also collaborates with NASA’s Mars rover science team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. Team members work together to collect and analyse remote visual and chemical data sent to Earth by the car-sized Perseverance rover, which landed in Jezero crater on 18 February 2021. He dreams of the day when samples of rocks and soil can be physically returned to Earth, allowing for more-detailed analysis to address questions including whether mineral samples hold evidence of life.\n\nTo prepare for the sample return, Randazzo also works on NASA’s analogue, or simulation, research. He is part of a team that orchestrates sample collection from Martian-like habitats on Earth, such as the Pilbara desert in Australia, to help refine understanding of how precious Mars samples should be handled in the future. Randazzo tells Nature about working with material from another planet and how he is planning for his career’s future, knowing that decades could pass before Martian samples get shipped back to Earth.\n\nHow does Perseverance help us to understand the Martian surface?\n\nPlanning for life on Mars\n\nEvery day, we’re moving along with the rover, exploring new environments and samples. I’m involved in studying Martian chemistry and sedimentology to better understand the ancient water flows and climate of the red planet, and gain clues about whether it held ancient life. The rover’s multiple instruments enable multidisciplinary exploration. The PIXL instrument uses X-ray fluorescence to determine the microscopic make-up of rocks. High-resolution cameras MastCam-Z and Supercam take zoomed in and out views of the Martian surface, atmosphere, rocks and soils. SHERLOC uses cameras, spectrometers and a laser to search for organic molecules and minerals altered by water. Wonderful high-resolution cameras allow us to look at geology in context and ask simple questions, such as, ‘Why is this mineral white or this mineral red?’ Wonderful people on the team stitch images together to make 3D models. You can put on a virtual-reality headset and simulate touching an outcrop of rock. There are a lot of great instruments, and a lot we can learn, but it’s always a team effort.\n\nWhat have you found recently?\n\nAn exciting find a few months ago was a surface covered in leopard-like spots. We discovered that their chemistry indicates the possibility of redox reactions — chemical reactions, involving the exchange of electrons, that are common and vital to life functions such as photosynthesis and respiration, but also to abiotic processes that are nothing to do with life, like corrosion or rusting. We also found a chemical signature suggestive of vivianite, a mineral often found in fossil shells, and other compounds that could suggest there is life — or was life. But we can’t say for sure. There are also potential non-life explanations. We don’t want to jump the gun, as happened in 1996 with the Allan Hills meteorite, which looked as if it contained worm-like fossils. Then-US president Bill Clinton announced in a speech that NASA had found possible evidence for Martian life. It turned out that the rock contained structures created by abiotic processes.\n\nA photo taken on 12 March 2024 by the Perseverance Mars rover of the Bunsen Peak rock, where the rover collected mineral-core and abrasion samples.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS\nWhy do we need to bring Martian samples back to Earth?\n\nAs wonderful as Perseverance’s instruments are, nothing beats actually having samples here, to run analyses in laboratories, with higher precision. For example, none of the instruments on Mars are doing stable isotope analyses, which could tell us more about how warm and wet Mars was in the past, using oxygen and carbon isotopes. To look at isotopes of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur and strontium, you must bring rocks here. The same goes for radiometric dating to estimate when a rock was deposited. We can’t do that work on Mars. Bringing samples home is infinitely more valuable than anything remote science can tell us.\n\nWhen will a mission bring samples back?\n\nThere is more than a bit of uncertainty about that. The original plan for Mars Sample Return was the early 2030s. Now it seems it’s been pushed to the 2040s and it’s going to be more expensive than originally predicted. Plus, there is competition with other missions. It’s always a balance between finances and time, and there’s been an open call to industry partners to see if they’re willing to invest in making it happen.\n\nHow do you plan for your future work, given that sample return could be 20 years away?\n\nIs there life on Mars? What a cave on Earth can teach us\n\nA lot of research questions come up minute-by-minute, as we see the remote samples. We’ll be driving the rover, find something interesting, scrape the rock’s surface to get a sample and then see what it looks like geologically and chemically by doing a PIXL scan. Then, if it’s deemed worthwhile, the rover collects a physical sample that is stored in a titanium tube. Some of the sample tubes are stored inside the rover and, just in case of catastrophic losses, back-up samples are also placed on the Martian ground in a cache at the Three Forks sample depot in Jezero Crater.\n\nMuch of the Perseverance work here on Earth focuses on: how do we handle samples if and when we get them back? What’s the order of analyses we’re going to do?\n\nA close-up of the core sample taken from the Bunsen Peak rock.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nIn some ways, there are advantages to the samples’ return being far into the future. Right now, we can detect sulfur compounds at the parts per billion or parts per trillion level — something that, decades ago, was almost unimaginable. So, 10–15 years from now, there will be more-precise techniques.\n\nA lot of careers will open up because of materials brought back. In 2022, scientists opened a tube from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission to the Moon. I had the opportunity to hold that tube in my hands during a recent tour of the Apollo lab at the JSC. The Apollo missions came back more than 50 years ago, but there are studies being done now on the material they brought that weren’t possible then. The same will happen with Mars samples — there will be analyses and work for decades to come.",

The particle — which probably came from a distant galaxy — was spotted by the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), a collection of light-detecting glass spheres on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea, on 13 February 2023. Researchers monitoring the telescope did not notice the detection until early 2024, when they completed the first analysis of their data. They unveiled it as a potentially record event last year at a conference in Milan, Italy, but did not disclose details such as the timing, direction or energy of the neutrino.\n\n“We had to convince ourselves that it wasn’t something strange or weird with the telescope,” says Paschal Coyle, a neutrino physicist at Aix-Marseille University in France and KM3NeT spokesperson. The result was published on 12 February in Nature1, and will be described in four preprints due to be posted on the arXiv preprint server.\n\nHigh-energy neutrinos\n\nNeutrinos are electrically neutral particles more than one million times lighter than an electron. They are typically produced in nuclear reactions such as those at the centre of the Sun, from which they emerge with energies on the order of millions of electronvolts (106 eV). But for more than 10 years, researchers have been recording neutrinos carrying unprecedented energies of up to several quadrillion electronvolts (1015 eV, or 1 petaelectronvolt), which are thought to originate in distant galaxies. (The most energetic particle ever detected, at 320,000 PeV, was not a neutrino but a cosmic ray dubbed the Oh-My-God particle.)\n\n‘Fantastic’ particle could be most energetic neutrino ever detected\n\nKM3NeT consists of strings of sensitive light detectors anchored to the sea floor at a depth of around 3,500 metres off the coast of the Italian island of Sicily, as well as in a second, smaller array near Toulon, France. These sensors pick up light emitted by high-energy, electrically charged particles such as muons. Muons are continuously raining down on Earth’s surface, because they are produced when cosmic rays hit air molecules. But occasionally, a cosmic neutrino that smashes into the planet’s surface also produces a muon.\n\nIn the February 2023 event detected by the Sicily observatory, the team estimated that the muon carried 120 PeV of energy, on the basis of the unusual amount of light it produced. The particle’s path was close to horizontal with respect to Earth’s surface and travelled eastwards, towards Greece.\n\nSource: Ref. 1Source: Aiello, S. et al. Nature 638, 376–382 (2025).",

          "authors": "Linda Nordling",
          "abstract": "The Norwegian government wants to ensure that English does not replace Norwegian as the main language used in higher education.Credit: Getty\n\nResearchers in Norway have mounted a major legal challenge to the introduction of mandatory Norwegian language classes for foreign PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, arguing that the requirement violates labour laws and threatens to harm the country’s ability to compete internationally in research. Some critics view the law as part of a broader trend of protectionist policies emerging across an increasingly conservative Europe.\n\nAll doctoral and postdoctoral researchers hired from August this year who do not speak Norwegian, Danish or Swedish must complete 15 study points of Norwegian language training — about 3 months of study — during the period covered by their contracts.\n\nLast June, Oddmund Hoel, then Norway’s research and higher-education minister, said that the law aims to “preserve Norwegian as a professional language and prevent English from becoming the main language in Norwegian higher education”. The law came into force on 1 August 2024 with a 12-month implementation delay to give universities time to adjust to the regulations.\n\nBut critics say the mandatory language courses won’t achieve the intended goal. Instead, they argue, the law could harm Norway’s ability to attract and retain international talent by cutting into research time and making it more expensive for universities to hire from abroad.\n\n“Our principal investigators, postdocs and PhDs come from all over the world,” says Edvard Moser, a Nobel laureate who heads up the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “These demands will make it difficult for us to recruit them.”\n\nLegal challenge mounted\n\nThe impact of the law could be considerable. In 2022, around 44% of PhD candidates and 74% of postdoctoral fellows at Norwegian higher-education institutions came from abroad.\n\nBut the law is unlikely to strengthen Norwegian as a scientific language, says Pierre Lison, an artificial-intelligence researcher at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo. The three-month courses will help researchers with basic conversational skills, he says, but won’t provide the level of proficiency needed “to partake in academic discussions or write academic texts in Norwegian”.\n\nLast December, Lison and the Association of Doctoral Organizations in Norway, which represents local interest groups for early-career researchers, filed a complaint with the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority, which monitors compliance with European Economic Area (EEA) rules in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, none of which are members of the European Union. The complaint argues that the language policy breaches EEA law, which guarantees free movement of workers within the EU and its partner countries.\n\nAlthough EEA law allows countries to have language requirements for jobs, such criteria must serve a legitimate public interest, be appropriate for achieving that goal and not go beyond what is necessary. The petitioners argue that Norway’s language law fails on the last two counts.\n\nNobel laureate Edvard Moser is one of dozens of researchers who are protesting against the language-proficiency requirements.Credit: Philip Toscano/PA Images/Alamy\n\nThe law fails to fulfil its purpose because the level of proficiency attained through the three-month courses will be insufficient to conduct academic work in Norwegian, it says. It is also disproportionate, the petition adds, because most PhD students and postdocs in Norway don’t need to speak Norwegian to do their jobs, and because it creates additional costs for universities, which will not be given extra funding to compensate.\n\n“Institutions are expected to pay for it but don’t have the resources, so they pass it on to research groups,” says Moser, one of 26 named researchers formally backing the complaint. He adds that using research grants for language courses could violate grant terms.\n\nProtectionism in disguise?\n\nThe surveillance authority could respond in several ways, Lison says. If it finds an infringement, it typically starts by discussing possible changes with authorities in Norway. If that fails, it could issue a formal opinion requiring Norway to comply with EEA law. The final step would be court action, although Lison hopes “it will not go this far” and the ministry will drop the requirement.\n\nThe complainants’ preferred solution is to make offering language courses mandatory for universities but to allow PhD students and postdocs to choose whether to enrol. But Lison thinks there is an ulterior motive to the law that goes beyond wanting to protect the Norwegian language.\n\n“This is essentially a protectionist employment policy in disguise,” he says. The law will lead to universities favouring domestic candidates when filling positions, because they will cost less and be able to assume a higher teaching load than will foreign candidates who need to take the language classes, he says.\n\nLison draws a parallel between Norway’s law and a plan submitted by the Dutch government to its parliament last May that aims to curb the number of undergraduate courses offered in English in the Netherlands. Ostensibly a move to bolster language skills, the proposal is “essentially a way to reduce the number of international students” and address the housing shortage in university cities such as Amsterdam, he says.\n\nIn a statement, the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research told Nature that it does not think the regulations are in breach of EEA law, and that its aim is to “preserve Norwegian as a fully functional national language”. Part of this means ensuring that teaching is done primarily in Norwegian, it said, however, “In recent decades, a large share of the newly recruited academic staff has been non-Norwegian speakers”.",

          "title": "Dozens of new obesity drugs are coming: these are the ones to watch",
          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "For Kristian Cook, every pizza box he opened was another door closed on the path to overcoming obesity. “I had massive cravings for pizza,” he says. “That was my biggest downfall.”\n\nAt 114 kilograms and juggling a daily regimen of medications for high cholesterol, hypertension and gout, the New Zealander resolved to take action. In late 2022, at the age of 46, Cook joined a clinical trial that set out to test a combination of the weight-loss drug semaglutide — better known by its brand names, Ozempic or Wegovy — and an experimental drug designed to preserve muscle while shedding fat.\n\nMuscle loss is a big concern for people on anti-obesity medications such as semaglutide. These ‘GLP-1 agonists’ mimic a natural gut hormone — glucagon-like peptide 1 — to suppress appetite and regulate metabolism. But reducing calories leads to an energy deficit, which the body often makes up for by burning muscle. The experimental drug that Cook received, called bimagrumab, seems to counteract this muscle loss.\n\nObesity drugs: huge study identifies new health risks\n\nIt’s one of more than 100 anti-obesity drug candidates that are in various stages of development. The next wave of medications, which are likely to hit pharmacy shelves in the next few years, resemble drugs that are already on the market. But close behind are numerous therapies being developed specifically for their muscle-sparing weight-loss potential. Dozens more are aimed at different biological pathways and could redefine obesity treatment in decades to come.\n\n“We’re working to create the next generation of healthy weight-loss solutions,” says Philip Larsen, who played a key part in the early development of GLP-1 drugs and is now chief executive of SixPeaks Bio, an obesity-focused start-up company in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe surge in anti-obesity drug development has been made possible by the blockbuster success of semaglutide and its rival drug tirzepatide — sold as Zepbound or Mounjaro. These drugs have unlocked the potential for a global market that is projected to surpass US$100 billion by the end of the decade.\n\nBut semaglutide and tirzepatide have limitations. They require weekly injections and frequently cause unpleasant side effects, with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea being particularly common. Long term, the loss of muscle mass and the likelihood of weight regain after stopping therapy are also issues. What’s more, the drugs don’t work sufficiently for an estimated 10–30% of people who take them.\n\nEmerging therapies aim to amplify weight loss, improve tolerability, ensure long-lasting effects and find options for a broader range of individuals (see ‘Next up in obesity drugs’). “We’re going to see that there are different medicines that work better for different groups of people,” says Louis Aronne, an obesity specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City who consults for drug makers.\n\nNext up in obesity drugs\n\nExpected dates of US approval for new types of weight-loss drugs heading to market.\n\nEstimated yearDrugCompanyDescription2026OrforglipronEli LillyAn oral, small-molecule drug that activates the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor.2026CagriSemaNovo NordiskAn injectable that activates the amylin and GLP-1 receptors.2027SurvodutideBoehringer IngelheimAn injectable that activates the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors.2027RetatrutideEli LillyAn injectable that activates GLP-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon receptors.2028 and beyondMariTideAmgenAn injectable that activates the GLP-1 receptor while blocking GIP signalling.2028 and beyondBimagrumabEli LillyAn injectable that blocks receptors involved in myostatin signalling.2028 and beyondMonlunabantNovo NordiskAn oral drug that inhibits the CB1 cannabinoid receptor.\nDiverse routes, same pursuit\n\nSemaglutide and tirzepatide are often lumped together under the umbrella of GLP-1 drugs, but they differ in one key regard: tirzepatide mimics not only GLP-1 but also a complementary hormone called gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). This hormone further revs up energy metabolism and affects how the body stores and burns nutrients. Tirzepatide’s dual action is thought to contribute to its superior weight-loss results.\n\nIn a large head-to-head trial, sponsored by tirzepatide’s maker Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, participants who took tirzepatide lost an average of 20% of their body weight, outpacing the 14% reduction achieved with semaglutide, which is produced by the pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk in Bagsværd, Denmark. “We believe there’s a homeostatic mechanism, like a thermostat, that we each have that is set to a certain body weight, and it’ll drive hunger until we achieve that,” says Dan Skovronsky, chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly. But, he says, drugs such as tirzepatide can override this natural mechanism.\n\nInspired by tirzepatide’s success, many companies are advancing other drugs that engage GLP-1 and GIP receptors. At least five tirzepatide-like therapies are progressing through clinical trials, with the first expected to hit the market by 2028. Patients and clinicians alike “need an array of options”, says Ron Renaud, chief executive of Kailera Therapeutics, a biotechnology start-up in Waltham, Massachusetts, which has a tirzepatide-like therapy in advanced-stage clinical testing.\n\nWhy do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments?\n\nIn addition to dual activators, such as tirzepatide, there are also drug candidates such as MariTide (produced by the biopharmaceutical company Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California) that instead block GIP signalling while still activating GLP-1. It might seem counterintuitive that both approaches could work. But Jonathan Campbell, a metabolism researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, explains metabolism in terms of a vehicle’s fuel consumption on the motorway: pushing the accelerator hard, as with GIP activation, burns energy inefficiently, depleting resources faster than they can be replenished. Conversely, driving without fully releasing the handbrake creates constant friction, much like blocking GIP, which introduces inefficiencies by forcing the system to work harder to maintain speed.\n\n“In terms of weight control, anything that makes you less efficient is going to be a positive,” says Campbell, who receives research funding from drug companies. But he cautions that the wider consequences of each strategy remain uncertain. Because GIP also plays a part in bone health, there are concerns that blocking GIP signalling could adversely affect bone health. There are also lingering questions about the long-term effects of drastic weight loss on the rest of the body, including on muscle, metabolic flexibility and organ health.\n\nAlthough drugs such as semaglutide and tirzepatide have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack and other cardiovascular problems, as well as alleviate sleep apnoea and improve liver function, they have also been tied to conditions such as arthritis and pancreatitis. The unknown risks, particularly in diverse populations and with prolonged use, lead some clinicians to favour established surgical solutions, such as bariatric surgery.\n\nBut uncertainty hasn’t dissuaded pharmaceutical companies from pursuing an expanding array of hormone targets. These include other gut-derived hormones such as peptide YY, which is known for its ability to make you feel full, and pancreas-released hormones such as glucagon and amylin, which could complement GLP-1–based therapies by boosting energy expenditure, stabilizing blood sugar levels and further suppressing appetite.\n\nWorking together\n\nMany strategies in development target multiple pathways simultaneously. The combination therapy CagriSema, for example, pairs a long-acting analogue of amylin with semaglutide. Participants in a 68-week, phase III trial lost an average of nearly 23% of their body weight with this approach, according to Novo Nordisk, the company behind the drug.\n\nIf ongoing trials are successful, CagriSema, along with agents that combine GLP-1 and glucagon activity, such as survodutide from the pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim in Ingelheim, Germany, could secure regulatory approval as early as 2026 or 2027. However, their impact might be eclipsed by yet another contender. In phase II testing, Eli Lilly’s retatrutide — dubbed ‘triple G’ for its ability to target GLP-1, GIP and glucagon receptors — delivered an average weight reduction of 24% after 48 weeks, setting a new benchmark for obesity treatments1 (see ‘Shedding weight’).\n\nSources: Weg.: J.

Activating multiple pathways could allow for lower doses that achieve the same weight loss with fewer side effects.\n\nCompanies are also exploring alternatives to once-a-week injections, which can be difficult to incorporate into people’s routines and come with manufacturing challenges. Once-monthly injectables are in the works, but GLP-1 pills — led by a drug called orforglipron produced by Eli Lilly — could arrive first, hitting the market as soon as next year. In a phase II, 36-week study, participants lost up to 15% of their body weight with the once-daily oral option2.\n\nLess familiar targets\n\nAlthough gut hormones continue to be the cornerstone of drug development for obesity, large-scale genetic sequencing has been one source of inspiration for emerging targets. In 2021, scientists at the biotech company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown, New York, led an analysis of DNA from nearly 650,000 individuals and uncovered a rare gene variant linked to low body weight3. The following year, researchers at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Massachusetts, led a study that pinpointed a mutation in a gene called INHBE. The mutation is associated with low waist-to-hip ratio, a measure that reflects a healthier fat distribution in the body4. Companies are now trying to develop drugs that replicate the metabolic benefits of these genetic variants.\n\nHow ‘miracle’ weight-loss drugs will change the world\n\nOld targets are also getting renewed attention. One example is the cannabinoid receptor CB1, originally pursued after researchers discovered its role in marijuana-induced appetite stimulation, commonly known as the munchies. In the late-2000s, a drug designed to counteract this effect was briefly sold in Europe as a weight-loss therapy. But inhibiting cannabinoid receptors in the brain was associated with an increased risk of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts in some people. The drug, known as rimonabant, was withdrawn from the market after less than three years, and rival companies abandoned similar candidates.\n\nBut George Kunos, a neuroendocrinologist at the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda, Maryland, never gave up on the cannabinoid-blocking strategy. Around 15 years ago, his team and others demonstrated in rodents that much of the anti-obesity effects of CB1 inhibitors came from metabolic pathways in the liver, muscle, pancreas and other organs outside the brain. If a drug such as rimonabant could be chemically modified to prevent it from crossing the blood–brain barrier, it might deliver metabolic benefits without the serious side effects.\n\nKunos’s laboratory created such a next-generation cannabinoid blocker, now known as monlunabant and being advanced by Novo Nordisk. Last year, phase II trial results indicated that monlunabant can still cause anxiety, irritability and sleep disturbances. Even so, Kunos predicts that drug makers will “arrive at a dose that causes significant weight reduction with acceptable levels of side effects”.\n\nBig flex",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov, Dan Garisto, Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "One of the buildings on the US National Institutes of Health’s campus in Bethesda, Maryland, is a hospital dedicated to medical research.Credit: Bob Korn/Alamy\n\nA US judge has blocked a policy that would have, beginning today, slashed billions of dollars of funding annually for US research institutions, including universities and hospitals. The action is in response to lawsuits filed by 22 US states and a coalition of universities earlier today contending that the policy was illegal and would cause “cutting-edge work to cure and treat human disease” to “grind to a halt”.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nThe policy, announced on 7 February by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), would have cut ‘research overhead’ costs to 15% for new and existing grants. Last year, the NIH, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, awarded US$26 billion directly to scientists for laboratory expenses, including staff salaries, equipment and reagents; $9 billion went to these overhead, or indirect, costs to help institutions run their facilities and cover administrative fees. The historical average indirect-costs rate has been about 40%, reaching up to 75% at some institutions.\n\nThe steep cut attempted by the NIH comes as the administration of US President Donald Trump, in partnership with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, is targeting federal spending and attempting to dismantle agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, which funds global disease research, prevention and care. In the past few weeks, Trump’s team tried to freeze federal grants, sowing chaos and confusion throughout the US scientific community, but federal judges have so far blocked this effort. Musk said on Friday that wealthy universities getting high rates for indirect costs is “a ripoff” on the social-media platform X, which he owns.\n\nThe 15% cap is necessary to “ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead”, according to a memorandum from the office of acting NIH director Matthew Memoli announcing the change.\n\nThe attorneys general of the states that sued are Democrats, although Trump, a Republican, won five of those states in last year’s presidential election. The effects of the policy would be “immediate and devastating”, the lawsuit said. “This agency action will result in layoffs, suspension of clinical trials, disruption of ongoing research programs, and laboratory closures.”\n\nJudge Angel Kelley’s orders temporarily prevent the NIH from enacting its policy nationwide; she set a hearing for 21 February to further consider the petitions.\n\n‘Generational restructuring’\n\nBy Monday, some research institutions had already taken precautionary measures in response to the cut. In an e-mail seen by Nature, the University of Florida in Gainesville, which has an indirect-costs rate of 52.5%, told its staff members that new awards and the projects they fund at the 15% rate would be frozen, because its accounting department has not been authorized to charge the agency the lower rate.\n\nThe US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?\n\nResearchers say that the policy would upend the biomedical-research ecosystem. Alondra Nelson, who directed the US Office of Science and Technology Policy for eight months under former US president and Democrat Joe Biden, wrote on the social-media platform Bluesky that the policy would lead to a “generational restructuring” of the US research and development ecosystem.\n\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, was already losing money on federally funded clinical trials, and relied on philanthropy to make up the difference, says Charles Roberts, director of the hospital’s cancer centre. The NIH rate cut would cost the hospital nearly $40 million more each year, he says. “This will likely mean that fewer experimental treatments will get to children,” he adds. “More children will die.”\n\nThe NIH referred Nature to its parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for comments on the lawsuits. It also did not answer questions from Nature about whether it would give more money to researchers for their direct costs to make up for the cap. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said that the agency does not discuss ongoing litigation and declined to answer Nature’s inquiries regarding the lawsuits or scientists’ concerns about the indirect-costs policy.\n\nA question of cost\n\n‘Direct costs’ paid for by research grants help scientists to buy equipment for specific projects and cover the salaries of lab personnel. But research institutions also need to pay for air conditioning, electricity, computing resources, hazardous-waste disposal, administrative personnel and much more to support these projects.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nTo help cover these essential utilities and resources, the federal government has since 1947 been adding ‘indirect costs’ to research grants. These rates ranged from 8% to about 20% until 1965, when individual institutions began negotiating their own rates with the HHS. For example, on a $1.2-million grant, a 20% indirect-costs rate would mean that $200,000 goes to the university to pay for overheads.\n\nThese rates have risen steadily since the 1960s, in part because of an increasing number of regulations governing lab research and how federal funds are spent. The regulations include measures to ensure data privacy; protect animal welfare and human participants in research; and govern international collaborations.",

          "abstract": "Cave-bat fieldwork often looked like a scene from the 1995 film Outbreak.Credit: Warner Bros/AJ Pics/Alamy\n\nFor years, I was a bat ecologist, fully immersed in the grind of data collection and publications. My research on cave-bat conservation took me to remote locations, crawling through caves knee-deep in guano, catching bats. Back then, taking photos felt like a distraction from my research.\n\nBut two years ago, I left the academic world for a career as a science communicator at the GENUS hub at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in South Africa. Today, I work alongside researchers, helping them to bring their science to life through compelling stories. Visuals, particularly photographs, are a key part of this work.\n\nLooking back, I wish I’d captured more of my field experiences. Photos are priceless tools for public engagement, yet many researchers fail to see their value. Now, I understand that science doesn’t just live in publications — it lives in stories, visuals and the personal connections that we create with people.\n\nPics, or it didn’t happen\n\nDuring my postdoctoral position in ecology and viral zoonosis at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, my team and I worked mainly in a rural part of Limpopo, on the northeastern side of South Africa, in a small village called Ga-Mafefe. The landscape was lush and green, dotted with ancient fig trees and alive with the rhythm of daily life.\n\nPhotography: Science on camera\n\nWithin minutes of arriving at the cave site at the base of a steep hill, my team from the Centre for Viral Zoonoses would transform a patch of wilderness into a fully functioning research station, complete with a working centrifuge, powered by portable car batteries. We would dress head-to-toe in white, crinkly Tyvek suits (a type of lightweight, protective, plastic onesie that could shield both us and the bats from contaminants). With respirators humming, we looked like something straight out of the 1995 medical-disaster movie Outbreak.\n\nFor a week every month, this was my reality. I’d catch bats with specialized traps, and then spend hours hunched over folding camping tables carefully measuring the animals and collecting biological samples. Summer nights were sweltering, with sweat pooling in our suits; meanwhile, winters had us shivering, our noses running faster than we could wipe them, although wiping wasn’t exactly an option. It was exhausting, repetitive and, at times, comically miserable — but it was also exhilarating. We were a well-oiled machine, driven by a shared passion and the late-night humour that only a sleep-deprived team in the middle of nowhere could understand.\n\nThen in 2022, I did a three-month science-storytelling fellowship with the Nature, Environment and Wildlife Filmmakers — an organization that aims to build a network of visual storytellers, led by Indigenous African voices, celebrating and protecting Africa’s natural history — and it completely changed my perspective. I rediscovered my creative side and came to understand that scientific exchange can take many forms beyond just research papers. Armed with this newfound inspiration, I started taking photographs of everything during our fieldwork, capturing the beauty and intensity of our work.\n\nMariëtte van der Walt back in her bat-fieldwork days.Credit: Mariette van der Walt\n\nBack home in Johannesburg, my family and friends were captivated by the stories my photos told. Through my lens, they saw breathtaking landscapes, rough conditions and, of course, cute bats. I felt like my work could connect with people in a way data alone never could.\n\nWith this perspective, I realized that as much as I loved my research, my postdoctoral studies weren’t the right place to pursue my newfound passion for storytelling. I decided to leave academia and embrace a career in science communication.\n\nEcologists: don’t lose touch with the joy of fieldwork",

Cross/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nScientists are bracing for major changes in the direction of US biomedical research as Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has promoted vaccine misinformation and public-health conspiracies, gains control over a vast swathe of science policy.\n\nThe Senate voted today to confirm Kennedy as President Donald Trump’s secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which has an annual budget of roughly US$1.7 trillion and includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. Kennedy has embraced some fields of biomedical research. But he has shown hostility to others, and has rejected established science on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the safety of vaccines in general and other topics. (Kennedy told the Senate that he supports vaccines and believes that they have saved lives.)\n\n“The future of America as a superpower in research appears grim,” says Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, who creates new models for studying HIV — which Kennedy has falsely suggested is not the cause of AIDS. “Even on issues he claims he supports, he does not follow scientific evidence. Picking a person like this to lead is like having the wolf guard the sheep.”\n\nFalse dichotomy\n\nDuring his own presidential campaign, Kennedy said that he would prioritize research on chronic diseases and would give infectious-disease research at the NIH “a break” for eight years. Speaking before a Senate committee in January, Kennedy asserted that chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, asthma and some cancers have historically received less attention than infectious diseases, but are mostly responsible for rising health-care costs. (Data from the NIH show that cancer alone receives more federal funding than that allotted to all infectious diseases combined.)\n\nUneven attention hampers the drive to control infectious diseases\n\nEven some researchers who could benefit from an emphasis on chronic disease are wary. Eric Lau, a cancer researcher at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, says that although it would certainly be nice to see more money poured into studying cancer, the federal government should focus on increasing funding for biomedical research in general.\n\nBoth he and Larry Schlesinger, a physician-scientist and chief executive of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio, say that the idea of cutting one field to benefit another creates a false dichotomy between chronic and infectious disease that isn’t rooted in scientific reality.\n\nAs an example of how tightly the two are linked, researchers cite increasing evidence that some chronic conditions stem from infectious diseases: infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), for instance, can cause cancer of the cervix and other tissues. “Prioritizing chronic conditions increasingly means prioritizing infectious diseases,” says Schlesinger, who was himself diagnosed with oral cancer after an infection with HPV decades before. “We are appreciating more and more that infections, and the inflammation they cause, play an important role in these chronic conditions.”\n\nScientists also say that the ongoing outbreak of bird flu, which has made at least 68 people in the United States ill since the start of 2024, makes this an especially bad time to cut research into infectious diseases.\n\nFocus on food\n\nAs part of his ‘Make America Healthy Again’ pledge, Kennedy has repeatedly called for further studies into diet and nutrition, as well as research on the links between environmental pollution and human health. During his January hearing, Kennedy said that scientists “know” that obesity is caused by “an environmental toxin”, and asked why researchers haven’t dedicated themselves to finding and eliminating it.\n\nFood systems: seven priorities to end hunger and protect the planet",

          "abstract": "Artist’s illustration of a nerve cell (pink) surrounded by amyloid plaques (orange), which are associated with Alzheimer’s disease.Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/SPL\n\nA man who seemed genetically destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease while still young has reached his mid-70s without any cognitive decline — in only the third recorded case of such resistance to the disease. The findings, published today in Nature Medicine1, raise questions about the role of the proteins that ravage the brain during the disease and the drugs that target them.\n\nSince 2011, a study called the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) has been following a family in which many members have a mutation in a gene called PSEN2. The mutation causes the brain to produce versions of the amyloid protein that are prone to clumping into the sticky plaques thought to drive neurodegeneration. Family members with the mutation invariably develop Alzheimer’s at around age 50.\n\nThis is how an Alzheimer’s gene ravages the brain\n\nThen, a 61-year-old man from this family showed up at the DIAN study’s clinic with full cognitive function, and the researchers were shocked to discover that he had the fateful PSEN2 mutation. The man’s mother had had the same mutation, as had 11 of her 13 siblings; all had developed dementia around age 50.\n\nThe researchers were even more shocked when scans revealed that his brain looked like that of someone with Alzheimer’s. “His brain was full of amyloid,” says behavioural neurologist and study co-author Jorge Llibre-Guerra at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nWhat the man’s brain didn’t contain, however, were clusters of tau — another protein that forms tangled threads inside neurons. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans revealed that he had a small amount of abnormal tau and that it was only in the occipital lobe, a brain region involved in visual perception that is not usually affected in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nCognitive resilience\n\nOver the course of ten years, Llibre-Guerra and his colleagues ran memory tests and other cognitive assessments to determine whether the man really was resistant to Alzheimer’s. Overall, his test scores were normal and remained constant over the years. Some scores even rose owing to practice.\n\nNext, the researchers looked for genetic explanations for the man’s resilience. Previous research has found protective mutations in two people who carry a gene that invariably causes early-onset Alzheimer’s. But the man in the DIAN study didn’t carry either of these mutations.",

          "authors": "Kaori Hayashi",
          "abstract": "Last year, my colleagues and I displayed a provocative poster across the campus of the University of Tokyo (UTokyo), sparking both delight and dismay among staff and students alike. It featured a large letter ‘Q’ at its centre, for question, and challenged viewers with this enquiry: “Why are there so few women at the University of Tokyo?”\n\nIndeed, some 90% of the university’s full professors, 83% of its associate professors and — perhaps even more shockingly — 77% of its undergraduate students are men. These numbers echo those throughout the country’s higher-education institutions. Many campuses across the world similarly struggle with gender and other imbalances.\n\nJapan can be a science heavyweight once more — if it rethinks funding\n\nAs the executive vice-president of the university, leading its diversity efforts and global affairs, I have spent the past four years struggling with this inequity. The poster was part of a larger effort to improve recognition across the campus community, prompt reflection on such a skewed ratio and promote change. Although Japan’s constitution guarantees women equal rights, men have historically dominated society, including on campuses. This imbalance cannot continue.\n\nThis is why, in 2022, my colleagues and I launched the #WeChangeUTokyo programme, aimed at driving institutional change through five key actions.\n\nFirst, raise awareness among those that make up the majority of UTokyo’s community — Japanese men. Studies show that members of over-represented groups are more likely to not notice a lack of diversity, whether deliberately or not, and do not always welcome diversity, equity and inclusion efforts that they think they don’t benefit from (A. Iyer Soc. Personal. Psychol. Compass 16, e12666; 2022). We introduced initiatives to improve gender awareness, including unconscious-bias training to improve hiring processes and retention. We run courses to familiarize participants with gender stereotypes, and have workshops on consent and dealing with sexual harassment.\n\nSecond, support women in research. We do this through networking opportunities that improve people’s career-development prospects, and provide financial support for travel for those with caring commitments. These funds are available to all, but benefit mostly women, who disproportionately take on caring responsibilities for children, elder family members and others in Japan. And we offer mentorship programmes to help women to navigate their academic and professional journeys.\n\nAre women in research being led up the garden path?\n\nThird, set numerical targets. We aim to increase the proportion of women in faculty from 18% in May 2024 to 25% by the end of the 2027 academic year. Some critics argue that this target is too modest — why not 50%, because women comprise half of humanity? But, on the basis of data from the past 20 years, my colleagues and I think that this would be too big a jump right now. Setting realistic goals instead, then building on those, will be more effective.",

The 3 March meeting comes after more than 1,300 scientists signed an open letter expressing “deep concerns” about the conduct of billionaire Musk, who is a fellow.\n\nMusk is working closely with US President Donald Trump on sweeping government reforms that threaten flagship US research programmes and are causing havoc to scientists in the United States and globally. He is also accused of spreading misinformation on the social media site X, which he owns.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nTwo Royal Society fellows have resigned over the institution’s perceived lack of action over Musk’s behaviour in recent months.\n\n“It is tarnishing their reputation and to some degree devalues the honour of awarding fellowships. Does one want to be associated to a society that does not stand up for its values?” says Stephen Curry, a retired structural biologist at Imperial College London, who wrote the letter and published it on his blog on 11 February.\n\nA spokesperson for the Royal Society says that issues raised about individual fellows are dealt with in confidence and in accordance with its code-of-conduct processes. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPrestigious appointment\n\nMusk became a fellow of the society — the world’s oldest science academy — in 2018 for his companies’ development of technologies such as space rockets, electric cars and brain implants. The society has about living 1,800 fellows and foreign members, considered one of the most prestigious appointments in UK science. They are elected for making a “substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge” through a rigorous competitive process.\n\nTrump appointed Musk, the world’s richest man, to lead an advisory group called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to find cuts to government spending and regulations. So far, the administration has attempted to freeze federal research grants and slash funding by the US National Institutes of Health.\n\nCurry’s letter describes “an assault on scientific research”. “It has sought to impose huge cuts in funding and a regime of censorship (particularly with regard to equity, diversity and inclusion and climate issues) that is a direct threat to freedom of expression and academic freedom”. These actions contravene the society’s code of conduct for fellows, he says.\n\n‘High anxiety moment’: Biden’s NIH chief talks Trump 2.0 and the future of US science\n\nResearchers worldwide have signed the letter, which calls for the society to stand up for the science community and “the values it claims to believe in”.\n\nNature understands that the society has scheduled a meeting of fellows next month to “discuss public pronouncements and behaviours of other fellows”.\n\nIt has been more than 150 years since a fellow has been expelled from the society, according to the spokesperson.",

          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Psychologist Laura Steenbergen speaking at a TEDx event.Credit: TEDx\n\nLaura Steenbergen met her scientific mentor as an undergraduate. In 2009, she began a bachelor’s degree in psychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands and did her undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Lorenza Colzato, a cognitive psychologist with a prolific academic output. Steenbergen soon realized she enjoyed research, and with Colzato’s help, she transitioned into a master’s degree, then a PhD. They made a good team, Steenbergen thought.\n\nSteenbergen says she found it hard at first as a student with hardly any research experience to know whether Colzato’s research practices were unusual. Steenbergen had always appreciated that her mentor worked efficiently. Sometimes, for example, according to Steenbergen, Colzato would say that she had obtained ethics approval from the university for studies involving research participants after just one or two weeks. And once Steenbergen started talking to participants herself to collect data, she noticed that Colzato would report the findings in their papers for substantially fewer people than had actually participated in a research project, without specifying why some people’s results were omitted from the data analysis.\n\nAccording to Steenbergen, Colzato dismissed her concerns and would instead question whether science was an appropriate choice for the PhD student — a painful thing for Steenbergen to hear because she knew she wanted a scientific career.\n\nWhistleblowing in science: this physician faced ostracization after standing up to pharma\n\nEventually, after speaking to another PhD student and a postdoctoral researcher in Colzato’s laboratory, Steenbergen realized that her concerns weren’t all in her head. It wasn’t clear what the junior researchers could do about it, however. The Cognitive Psychology Unit within the Institute of Psychology where they worked was headed by Colzato’s husband, Bernhard Hommel. Because of this, they felt that they had limited recourse to other colleagues, Steenbergen says.\n\nSteenbergen continued to work with Colzato, starting a one-year postdoc position in 2016. She explains that, because she completed her PhD in only two years, she had no time to consider jobs elsewhere.\n\nAfter that, she worked briefly at other universities, including the University of Amsterdam and Ohio State University in Columbus, exposing her to other workplaces and making her realize that Colzato’s research practices were unusual.\n\nData doubt\n\nIn 2018, she returned to Leiden University as an assistant professor. It was at that point that new students working with Colzato asked Steenbergen why data were being deleted, she says.\n\nThis prompted her and a former colleague to report their concerns about research integrity to Sander Nieuwenhuis, the head of the Cognitive Psychology Unit (by this stage, Hommel had moved on from that position). In 2019, Philip Spinhoven, scientific director of the Institute of Psychology, submitted an internal complaint regarding Colzato and a suspected violation of academic integrity, based on what he had been told.\n\nThe university’s Academic Integrity Committee conducted an investigation, considering four allegations in total. In its 27-page ruling in 2019 (in which names are redacted), it stated: “The Defendant has repeatedly selectively omitted research results and has not reported this or given reasons for it. She has thus violated academic integrity.”\n\nThe committee also acknowledged that the group’s young, less experienced researchers were not responsible for the violations.\n\nCollection: Career resources for PhD students\n\nColzato was suspended by the university in 2019 and then resigned. In 2020, a journal article co-authored by her and Steenbergen was retracted1, followed by a second in 20212. Data manipulation was given as the reason in each case. The retractions were a relief to Steenbergen, although she still struggled with anxiety over her decision to report the problems, saying: “It feels like I filed a process against my scientific mother.”\n\nIn Colzato’s response to a 2019 Retraction Watch article about the outcome of the misconduct hearing, she described herself as a scapegoat, and maintained that she had experienced “wonderful” working relationships with Steenbergen and the colleagues who had raised the concerns.\n\nShe admitted obtaining blood from human participants when approval had not been granted by Leiden University’s Medical Ethics Review Committee, but in the Retraction Watch article points out that Steenbergen carried out the procedures.\n\nSteenbergen says that power dynamics were in play around the blood collection, and that “being a PhD student, it feels like you have to do that”.\n\nTaking action\n\nSteenbergen says the case has exacted a personal toll. During the investigation, when all the publications she had co-authored with Colzato came under scrutiny, “I felt frozen in science, because who’s going to take you seriously if everything about your work is suspicious? So I needed things to be open.”\n\nOn returning to work after a period of absence in 2023 and seeing that her PhD dissertation had recently been downloaded by others, she wanted to take action but wasn’t sure how to proceed. There are examples of authors choosing to retract their own papers and of dissertations being retracted against the authors’ wishes. But Steenbergen says she had no model for acknowledging the issues in her own dissertation.\n\nOn talking to other faculty members, she proposed to print “retracted” over the two chapters of her nine-chapter dissertation that had been affected by Colzato’s misconduct, and to write a cover note for the document. “I didn’t want to erase it or change it,” Steenbergen explains. She remembers thinking, “It’s more constructive if I use it.”\n\nSteenbergen says the university was supportive. In October 2024, two months after she made her proposal, the dissertation was corrected with retractions for two chapters and an expression of concern for another chapter on which a journal publication was based.\n\n“This is unprecedented in my experience,” says Dorothy Bishop, a retired developmental neuropsychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who writes about scientific integrity. “It looks like Steenbergen did the right thing, which can’t have been easy for her.”\n\nBishop says that this case illustrates the potentially catastrophic effect of a principal investigator’s research misconduct on an early-career researcher in their lab, adding: “Many leave the field,” which is especially likely when universities do not back whistleblowers.",

The applications of these materials include spray coatings for glass greenhouses that can increase crop yields.\n\nMonica Saavedra, the company’s chief executive, grew up wanting to be an astronaut and first developed a taste for experimental work during her bachelor’s degree in physics, when she did a summer placement at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK, helping researchers to make and test carbon-nanotube-based soft-matter detectors for α-, β- and γ-radiation.\n\nAfter a master’s degree in nanotechnology, she undertook a doctorate in nanomaterials at the UK National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. Alongside describing her own career journey, Saavedra offers advice to early-career researchers who want to move from academia to industry. She also highlights the importance of moving fast in commercial environments, using her company’s pivot from energy to agritech as an example. This month Saavedra won a 2025 Women in Innovation award, run by Innovate UK, the country's innovation agency.\n\nTell us about your career journey as an entrepreneur.\n\nIn 2012, I joined Nexeon, an early-stage company based in Abingdon, UK, developing silicon batteries. The following year, I left for a research-scientist role at Cambridge-based DNA-sequencing developer Base4 Innovation.\n\nFour years later, I joined Solaris Photonics, also based in Cambridge, as its chief technology officer (CTO), developing materials to increase the output of solar cells. Around that time, a colleague and I discussed setting up a company to make solar cells using quantum dots, which would have a bigger output than conventional silicon solar cells. I had had a similar idea around ten years previously, when I was doing my MSc — it was one of those scribbles that you do at the side of the page while the lecturer is speaking.\n\nThe company became Lambda Agri. I was its CTO originally and became chief executive in March last year.\n\nBeing a founder enabled me to wear lots of hats — one day CTO, marketing or human resources, another day chief executive. I especially enjoy hands-on involvement, making things in the laboratory, doing prototyping projects using computer-aided design and 3D printing or advising the scientists on optical physics.\n\nI also like how start-up companies are more agile than the large corporates; they are better enablers for inventiveness. I like the challenge of working fast. Smaller companies can bring more novelty into the practical realms of everyday life and, therefore, be instrumental in saving lives and the planet more quickly.\n\nWhat were the challenges and benefits of switching roles?\n\nSince switching to chief executive, my key focus is the financing and investor-relations side of the business. I was already involved in applying for funding, updating the pitch deck and having conversations with investors, so it was not a complete change. Investors expect the chief executive to be technical at an early-stage company, to increase credibility, so my CTO experience is beneficial.\n\nThe investment environment over recent years has been challenging, and even more so for women. In Europe, for example, start-up companies founded by women raised only 1.8% of the capital invested in start-ups by venture capitalists in 2023.\n\nAfter becoming chief executive, I adopted a range of measures to get it on a firmer financial footing.\n\nFirst, to minimize gender bias, I decided to approach raising funds through diversity-friendly pitch competitions (Santander X and Tech Nation are two examples).\n\nThe competitions and accelerators we participated in deviated from the current venture-capital landscape by having a much stronger female presence as the funding decision makers: approximately 30–40% female. In my experience, typically around 10–20% of venture-capital investors are female.\n\nSecond, I prioritized accelerators with grants that didn’t require match funding (a mechanism in which companies have to invest an equal sum from another source into the grant-funded project). Third, I sought equity-free funding (capital funding that does not transfer ownership of the company to investors).\n\nThese measures help to keep investors happy by minimizing dilution, which is the reduction in the percentage of existing shareholders’ equity that occurs when new shares are issued.\n\nOn one occasion, I attended a national pitch competition when I was heavily pregnant with my second child. Luckily, a representative of a family office (an investment fund managing a family’s private wealth) who was in the audience really enjoyed the pitch, and invested £100,000 (US$124,000).\n\nI live in hope that pitching events will one day be baby-friendly. At the time, I was working days, nights and weekends, with a toddler to look after as well. I have not had a day off, not even on the day my second child was born four months ago. The company has always been the ‘other baby’. I do not necessarily recommend this way of working to others, but it works for me as a mother, and I do have support, which is important.\n\nFundraising requires a focused effort that cannot stop until it’s achieved by a drop-dead deadline. Your employees have families to feed. People you care about have invested money in the business. You have to make it work if you believe in the vision, which we all do.\n\nGetting the funding in place, despite the challenges, has helped me to work on my communication skills, which I always found difficult. Previously, I was much more comfortable with computers than with people. I have had to work hard to understand how to relate better to others and in the male-dominated corporate environment.\n\nHow do you attract talent?\n\nSome scientists are technically brilliant and bold, but lack the commercial or contextual view needed to produce things as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. This is sometimes difficult to deduce before making a new hire. When I’m hiring, I only stop looking once at least one very talented and driven woman has applied.\n\nCurrently, we employ five people and the overall gender balance is 40:60 female to male. We are striving to attain a better one, ideally a 50:50 split, particularly at board level. Just now, it’s me and two white British men, both very knowledgeable angel investors.\n\nI try to ensure that women’s technical skills are being recognized, and I do not let anyone assume that they will be more suited to people-facing roles, for example. Stereotypes about women’s capabilities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics still persist.",

          "abstract": "Outraged: Why We Fight About Morality and Politics and How to Find Common Ground Kurt Gray Pantheon (2025)\n\nSocial psychologist Kurt Gray’s timely book Outraged begins with a dramatic swerve he made on a motorway — a teenage driving mishap, a chase and an escape from the clutches of road rage. That frightening early life experience sparked Gray’s academic exploration of the roots of moral disagreement, which underpins conflicts in politics and media, and even on gridlocked streets.\n\nBy dissecting the rich body of research on how we make judgments about right and wrong, Gray delivers a second swerve — a bold conceptual turn in explaining why people collide over morality and how such collisions can be avoided.\n\nMisinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might think\n\nHe argues that our moral reflexes reveal an innate motivation to protect ourselves and others from harm. Although outrage might seem aggressive — a loud fury hollered across town halls and digital echo-chambers — it is in fact a defensive stance.\n\nOutrage, Gray suggests, can be understood once we recognize that moral anger is often an expression of fear. In many cases, when someone is outraged, it is because they are scared that a vulnerable person will be hurt or mistreated by an action or a policy.\n\nMany liberals and conservatives disagree on climate policies because they focus on different victims. US Democrats lobby for tighter environmental regulations to protect ecosystems, whereas Republicans support plans to ease environmental regulations to prevent job losses in the fossil-fuel industry. Each group is seeking to protect someone from harm.\n\nFor Gray, this dynamic is the source of our divisions, but also a source of hope. If everyone has the same moral impulses and pursues the same moral project, then there is something uniting us. Gray’s pragmatic solution to polarization is simple: share your perspective on who is being harmed by an action, and listen to others’ fears. By doing this, we will all become more sympathetic citizens.\n\nMoral myths\n\nDespite its title, Outraged is a remarkably calm and inoffensive book. Its conversational style mirrors its conciliatory message. In pursuit of relatability, personal anecdotes are woven in along with psychological experiments, recounted with a clarity that renders them fresh and interesting.\n\nGray draws on his own psychological experiments and studies from other psychologists who study morality have sought to explore our intuitions about right and wrong through clever experiments and large surveys. The book aims to debunk three myths: that we are prone to aggression because we evolved as apex predators; that there are harmless wrongs; and that facts can change people’s attitudes and bridge divides.\n\nStructurally, these three sections align with a chronology of the past, present and future of human morality. Starting with our evolutionary heritage, Gray argues that “humans express online outrage for the same reason they expressed outrage in Stone Age tribes: to guard against societal harm and reinforce moral norms”. Same mindset, different era.\n\nHow conspiracies took root in our culture\n\nCrucially, Gray proposes that archaeologists have made a grievous error in their interpretation of the fossil record. Protection, not aggression, is the name of our evolutionary game. He urges us to discard the image of early humans as brutal hunters sharpening their spears for a predatory chase; instead, we should view them as hunted creatures trying to survive amid roving dangers. Evolutionarily, we were not predatory villains, Gray maintains — we were pretty weak prey.\n\nGray cares about this because “the assumption that humans are predators makes our moral opponents seem predatory — cold and calculating — when they do bad things”.\n\nDebunking a myth often entails denying the old narrative and completely reversing it — replacing one story with its opposite. In this case, the temptation is to claim that we were not predators, we were prey. But weren’t we both? In its early sections, the book gets a little stuck between presenting a clear theory and promoting misleading binaries. This is a wider disciplinary challenge for evolutionary psychology; amid sparse evidence and stretched implications, it can fall prey to a rigid retrospective logic that often oversimplifies the complexities of human nature.\n\nThe master key\n\nBut, fortunately, Outraged is a contemporary book concerned mostly with our present predicaments. The second myth it aims to disprove is the idea that our morality is a scattered assemblage of many heterogeneous components and levers. Instead of many moral foundations governing our instincts about good and evil, Gray insists that harm is “the master key of morality” (a recurring refrain).\n\nHe critiques theories that anchor moral concerns beyond harm, especially social psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s The Righteous Mind, whose shadow looms large over moral psychology and how people perceive the field. Outraged thus wishes to refute the notion (disseminated by Haidt) that there are ‘harmless wrongs’ – actions we perceive to be wrong but which we think hurt no one.\n\nMarshalling a range of real and thought experiments, Gray argues that “all moral judgments are psychologically grounded in harm, no matter whether you lean left or right”. Gray’s physiological experiments reveal that when a person is asked to physically imitate an act that is typically harmful, such as holding a realistic toy gun to someone else’s head, their body will be biologically disturbed.",

          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "Limited jobs in academia are deterring students from enroling in doctoral degrees in some countries.Credit: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty\n\nNumbers of people enrolling in PhD programmes have dropped in a handful of countries in the past few years, which policy specialists are calling a worrying trend. From Australia and Japan to Brazil and the United Kingdom, there are concerns that high living costs, low stipends and limited job options after graduation are deterring people from pursuing doctoral degrees.\n\nThese declining numbers should “act as a wake-up call” for those countries, says Cláudia Sarrico, a project lead at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris. “This is a signal you need to reform working conditions and think about diversifying career options — otherwise, you risk a talent drain that will ultimately slow down scientific progress.”\n\nThe most recent figures on this trend, released by Universities Australia and the Australian Council of Graduate Research (ACGR) in January, revealed an 8% reduction in the number of domestic PhD enrolments in Australia from 2018 to 2023, although the population of the country grew by more than 7% over the same period.\n\nPhD poverty\n\nIn many countries, one of the biggest factors deterring students from pursuing doctoral degrees is the high cost of living relative to how much they get paid.\n\nIn Australia, the average PhD stipend is roughly Aus$32,000 (US$20,000). “It is well under the minimum wage,” says Louise Sharpe, president of the ACGR, based in Melbourne, Australia. And although it is just above the poverty line for people who are single, the average doctoral student in the country is in their late thirties — often having come with experience working in different sectors — and have families and other responsibilities, Sharpe adds.\n\nFinancial insecurity is also one of the chief concerns for doctoral students in Japan, where the number of PhD students has been dropping since the early 2000s. In 2023, the number of domestic PhD enrolments was 15,014, compared with a high of 18,232 in 2003. In response to this issue, Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), announced plans last year to provide extra funding for doctoral students.\n\nPeople have also been losing an interest in postgraduate education on the other side of the ocean. Last year, the Brazilian Federal Agency for the Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES) released a report revealing that, in 2022, the country saw its lowest number of domestic PhD entrants in almost a decade. One factor was the COVID-19 pandemic, but that was not the only reason for the drop, says CAPES president Denise Pires de Carvalho, headquartered in Brasilia. The economic crisis in Brazil, along with the government’s unwillingness to increase funding for science and technology were also major contributors, Pires de Carvalho says.\n\nThings are beginning to shift. In 2023, the Brazilian government increased the value of grants for master’s and doctoral students by 40% — the first increase in a decade. This change brought with it a slight increase in enrolments in that same year.\n\nIn Canada, where PhD numbers haven’t yet dropped, a need for more funding to provide a living wage for doctoral students has been a big discussion over the past few years, says Adam Sarty, president-elect of the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies, who is based in Halifax. Last year, the Canadian government responded to this need by increasing graduate-student scholarships for the first time in more than two decades. This has been a welcome change, but Sarty notes that these grants only go to the top students — and extra changes are needed to provide more financial security to those who don’t win these scholarships.\n\nBut many Canadian universities are under financial strain because of a dip in enrolments in professional graduate programmes, such as MBAs, owing to a cap on international students that was put into place in 2024. Countries such as the United Kingdom have seen similar rules put in place in recent years — raising concerns about universities’ abilities to support early-career researchers.\n\nJob precarity",

          "abstract": "NASA’s diverse astronaut corps was an example of the agency’s support for diversity and inclusion.Credit: James Blair/NASA/JSC\n\nIn the corridors of NASA buildings across the United States, Pride flags and pictures celebrating women in science are being taken down. Scientists are adding space-mission stickers to their laptops to cover ones that displayed rainbows and other symbols of LGBT+ support. Employees are stripping pronouns from their e-mail signatures and holding darkly humorous conversations in which they try to avoid saying any pronouns at all.\n\nThese and other changes are rippling through NASA, which is purging programmes involving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) throughout the agency. The directive to do so came from US President Donald Trump, who on 20 January issued an order to eliminate DEI initiatives across the federal government.\n\n“I get a sinking feeling in my stomach when I have to check my [work] email,” says an early-career NASA scientist, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns about their career prospects. “Every time I reload it, it’s like ‘oh god, will there be some new heinous missive in there?’”\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nNature spoke with scientists inside and outside NASA about the impacts of its DEI changes — and heard anger, fear and confusion. Although the orders affect all federal agencies, they are keenly felt at NASA, which has a long history of working towards inclusivity. In 2020, Trump appointee Jim Bridenstine, then head of NASA, added inclusion to the agency’s list of core values, joining safety, integrity, teamwork and excellence. That fifth value has now been removed from many NASA websites.\n\n“How do you go from something being so important that it’s a pillar [of the agency], to being so reviled that it’s off of everything?” asks Julie Rathbun, a planetary scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.\n\n“It feels like a betrayal by NASA,” says Kas Knicely, a planetary geophysicist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. “It’s inefficient, it’s wasteful, and it’s also just messed up.”\n\nIn a statement, NASA said the agency “is committed to engaging the best talent to drive innovation and achieve our mission for the benefit of all. As new guidance comes in, we’re working to adhere to new requirements in a timely manner.”\n\nA changed agency\n\nNASA’s push towards inclusivity is one of the most visible in the US government. In the 1950s and 1960s, all of the agency’s astronauts were white men. By 1978, it had bowed to internal and external pressure and had chosen several women and people of colour to fly to space. Today, NASA’s astronauts, as well as its world-renowned scientific and engineering teams, are measurably diverse.\n\nBut signs of NASA’s efforts to make space for everyone are disappearing. These removals have been triggered both by official edicts — such as the requirement to remove pronouns from employees’ email signatures — and by unofficial notices, such as verbal suggestions to remove flags or other displays from workspaces.\n\n‘Mind-boggling’: US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers\n\nTrump’s changes have also halted projects by employee affinity organizations ― groups ranging from military veterans, to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, to Black employees. Before 20 January, NASA celebrated these groups’ efforts with many glowing, now-deleted web articles.\n\n“The work these groups did was wholesome and good for the agency — things like, discussing how do we publish data in a way that works with screen readers, so people with visual disabilities can get at our content,” says a senior NASA scientist, who requested anonymity to avoid possible reprisals. “Or bringing Star Trek legends in to inspire the workforce.” Pausing the work of these groups “promotes fear”, the scientist says, because employees worry that they might be targeted for participating.\n\nOther cancellations include a programme that paired undergraduates from underrepresented groups with active planetary missions, giving the students a chance to observe scientists at work.\n\nMany NASA employees are angry about the changes to DEI, but are buckling down to work nevertheless. “We believe in the mission, and we know that our work is important,” says the senior scientist. “We know that it matters for the nation.”\n\nGrassroots protest\n\nAs federal workers, NASA employees can’t push back against the changes, no matter how much they personally support DEI efforts, says Knicely, who co-chairs a community working group on best practices for DEI at NASA. But space scientists outside NASA are voicing their frustration with the agency’s rejection of years of progress towards a more diverse community. Several of them wrote an open letter to NASA leadership on 6 February protesting the changes, which has garnered more than 1,000 signatures.",

We merge educational administrative data from Oregon with measures of family income derived from IRS records to document student exposure to economically diverse school and classroom peers. Our findings indicate that affluent children in public schools are relatively isolated from their less affluent peers, while low- and middle-income students experience relatively even peer income distributions. Students from families in the top percentile of the income distribution attend schools where 20 percent of their peers, on average, come from the top five income percentiles. A large majority of the differences in peer exposure that we observe arise from the sorting of students across schools; sorting across classrooms within schools plays a substantially smaller role.",

          "authors": "Miruna Cotet, Wenjia Joyce Zhao, Ian Krajbich",
          "abstract": "A standard assumption in game theory is that decision-makers have preplanned strategies telling them what actions to take for every contingency. In contrast, nonstrategic decisions often involve an on-the-spot comparison process, with longer response times (RT) for choices between more similarly appealing options. If strategic decisions also exhibit these patterns, then RT might betray private information and alter game theory predictions. Here, we examined bargaining behavior to determine whether RT reveals private information in strategic settings. Using preexisting and experimental data from eBay, we show that both buyers and sellers take hours longer to accept bad offers and to reject good offers. We find nearly identical patterns in the two datasets, indicating a causal effect of offer size on RT. However, this relationship is half as strong for rejections as for acceptances, reducing the amount of useful private information revealed by the sellers. Counter to our predictions, buyers are discouraged by slow rejections—they are less likely to counteroffer to slow sellers. We also show that a drift-diffusion model (DDM), traditionally limited to decisions on the order of seconds, can account for decisions on the order of hours, sometimes days. The DDM reveals that more experienced sellers are less cautious and more inclined to accept offers. In summary, strategic decisions are inconsistent with preplanned strategies. This underscores the need for game theory to incorporate RT as a strategic variable and broadens the applicability of the DDM to slow decisions.",

          "abstract": "Based on the seminal minimal group experiment, the widely influential social identity theory has, in the last 45 y, led to the belief that discrimination follows from intergroup relations and social identity. A large body of research evidenced that people discriminate against members of their out versus ingroup, even if groups and identities were assigned on the basis of a quantity estimate, aesthetic judgment, or a chance outcome. But to what extent may unequal resource division be accounted for by ad hoc difference versus sameness, outside of any group division? We show via Bayesian regression analyses in seven preregistered experiments (&gt;1,400 subjects) that unequal resource division strategies persist against a single person that demonstrates a different versus the same quantity estimate, painting preference, or even coin flip (Experiments 1, 2, and 3ab), with 43.1% more money awarded for sameness relative to difference conditions (Experiments 4, 5, and 6). These findings open up the possibility that one key driver of discrimination may exist in a mechanism of interindividual comparison that treats ad hoc difference more negatively than ad hoc sameness. If unequal resource division readily emerges against a single person even after a mere chance difference, discrimination may be more widespread and occur for partly different reasons than is currently assumed. Theoretical implications for understanding cognitive and brain systems of discrimination are discussed.",

Across four multimethod studies ( N = 37,920) spanning both field and lab settings, we demonstrate that a gender debiasing intervention that replaces masculine language in job postings with synonymous gender-neutral language increases application rates among women and men whose self-identities are less aligned with masculinity.

          "abstract": "Samaras are known for their elegant and robust autorotation, a resilience that persists in the adverse conditions imposed by high-speed raindrops. Like flying insects, samaras descending from tall trees are likely to be struck by raindrops in an intense storm. In this study, we detail the collision dynamics for impact regions across the samara body and the drop-shedding mechanisms that samaras exhibit to return to autorotation. Impacts across the samara body can pitch the samara up to 60 degrees and, in some cases, induce spanwise roll. Raindrops may shatter or remain intact upon impact, pushing the undamaged samara downward before autorotation is recovered. Drops that strike near the wingtip elicit the greatest recovery distance, while impacts onto the nutlet mass are the least disruptive to the samara and most likely to cause the drop to induce fragmentation. Faster drops allow for quicker drop shedding and a subsequent rapid return to autorotation in less than 50 ms. Our results indicate that samaras are robust to raindrop impacts and consistently recover autorotation, resulting in a minor reduction in dispersal distance. To recover, the entire drop is shed from the spinning samara over a time closely tied to the shedding mode and ensuing drop rejection forces.",

          "abstract": "We recently reported that microinjection of Xenopus nodal-related ( xnr ) mRNAs into β-catenin-depleted Xenopus embryos rescued a complete dorsal axis. Xnrs mediate the signal of the Nieuwkoop center that induces the Spemann–Mangold organizer in the overlying mesoderm, a process inhibited by the Nodal antagonist Cerberus-short (CerS). However, β-catenin also induces a second signaling center in the dorsal prospective ectoderm, designated the Blastula Chordin and Noggin Expression (BCNE) center, in which the homeobox gene siamois ( sia ) plays a major role. In this study, we asked whether the Xnrs and Sia depend on each other or function on parallel pathways. Expression of both genes induced β-catenin-depleted embryos to form complete axes with heads and eyes via the activation of similar sets of downstream organizer-specific genes. Xnrs did not activate siamois , and, conversely, Sia did not activate xnrs , although both were induced by β-catenin stabilization. Depletion with morpholinos revealed a robust role for the downstream target Chordin. Remarkably, Chordin depletion prevented all ectopic effects resulting from microinjection of the mRNA encoding the maternal cytoplasmic determinant Huluwa , including the radial expansion of brain tissue and the ectopic expression of the ventral gene sizzled . The main conclusion was that the BCNE and Nieuwkoop centers provide a double assurance mechanism for axial formation by independently activating similar downstream transcriptional target gene repertoires. We suggest that Siamois likely evolved from an ancestral Mix-type homeodomain protein called Sebox as a Xenopus -specific adaptation for the rapid differentiation of the anterior neural plate in the ectoderm.",

          "abstract": "COP1 and DET1 are components of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is conserved from plants to humans. Mammalian COP1 binds to DET1 and is a substrate adaptor for the CUL4A-DDB1-RBX1 RING E3 ligase. Transcription factor substrates, including c-Jun, ETV4, and ETV5, are targeted for proteasomal degradation to effect rapid transcriptional changes in response to cues such as growth factor deprivation. Here, we link a homozygous DET1 R26W mutation to lethal developmental abnormalities in humans. Experimental cryo-electron microscopy of the DET1 complex with DDB1 and DDA1, as well as co-immunoprecipitation experiments, revealed that DET1 R26W impairs binding to DDB1, thereby compromising E3 ligase function. Accordingly, human-induced pluripotent stem cells homozygous for DET1 R26W expressed ETV4 and ETV5 highly, and exhibited defective mitochondrial homeostasis and aberrant caspase-dependent cell death when differentiated into neurons. Neuronal cell death was increased further in the presence of Det1 -deficient microglia as compared to WT microglia, indicating that the deleterious effects of the DET1 p.R26W mutation may stem from the dysregulation of multiple cell types. Mice lacking Det1 died during embryogenesis, while Det1 deletion just in neural stem cells elicited hydrocephalus, cerebellar dysplasia, and neonatal lethality. Our findings highlight an important role for DET1 in the neurological development of mice and humans.",

          "abstract": "The discovery of ferroelectric phases in HfO 2 offers insights into ferroelectricity. Its unique fluorite structure and complex polarization switching pathways exhibit distinct characteristics, challenging conventional analysis methods. Combining group theory and first-principles calculations, we identify numerous unconventional electric polarization switching pathways in HfO 2 with energy barriers of 0.32 to 0.57 eV as a function of the different shift in the suboxygen lattices. In total, we identify 47 switching pathways for the orthorhombic phase, corresponding to the left cosets of the F m 3 ¯ m group with P c a 2 1 group. Contrary to the conception that the tetracoordinated oxygen (O IV ) layers are inactive, our result demonstrates that both the tricoordinated oxygen (O III ) and O IV can be displaced, leading to polarization switching along any axial direction. The multiple switching pathways in HfO 2 result in both 180° polarization reversal and the formation of 90° domains observed experimentally. Calculations show that specific switching pathways depend on the orientation of the applied electric field relative to the HfO 2 growth surface. This allows HfO 2 to automatically adjust the in-plane polarization direction under an out-of-plane electric field, thereby maximizing the out-of-plane component and contributing to the wake-up process. These findings redefine the roles of O III and O IV layers, clarify unconventional switching pathways, and enhance our understanding of electric field response mechanisms, wake-up, and fatigue in ferroelectrics.",

          "abstract": "Photosynthesis, the fundamental process using light energy to convert carbon dioxide to organic matter, is vital for life on Earth. It relies on capturing light through light-harvesting complexes (LHC) in photosystem I (PSI) and PSII and on the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Composition and organization of PSI and PSII core complexes are well conserved across evolution. PSII is particularly sensitive to photodamage but benefits from a large diversity of photoprotective mechanisms, finely tuned to handle the dynamic and ever-changing light conditions. Light Harvesting Complex protein family members (LHC and LHC-like families) have acquired a dual function during evolution. Members of the LHC antenna complexes of PS capture light energy, whereas others dissipate excess energy that cannot be harnessed for photosynthesis. This process mainly occurs through nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). In this work, we focus on the Light Harvesting complex-Like 4 (LHL4) protein, a LHC-like protein induced by ultraviolet-B (UV-B) and blue light through UV Resistance locus 8 (UVR8) and phototropin photoreceptor-activated signaling pathways in the model green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . We demonstrate that alongside established NPQ effectors, LHL4 plays a key role in photoprotection, preventing singlet oxygen accumulation in PSII and promoting cell survival upon light stress. LHL4 protective function is distinct from that of NPQ-related proteins, as LHL4 specifically and uniquely binds to the transient monomeric form of the core PSII complex, safeguarding its integrity. LHL4 characterization expands our understanding of the interplay between light harvesting and photoprotection mechanisms upon light stress in photosynthetic microalgae.",

          "abstract": "Systemic infections caused by Cryptococcus claim over 161,000 lives annually, with global mortality rate close to 70% despite antifungal therapies. Currently, no vaccine is available. To develop an effective multivalent vaccine against this free-living opportunistic eukaryotic pathogen, it is critical to identify protective antigens. We previously discovered ZNF2 oe strains elicit protective host immune responses and increase the abundance of antigens present in the capsule, which is required for its immunoprotection. Capsule is a defining feature of Cryptococcus species and composed of polysaccharides and mannoproteins. Here, we found increased levels of exposed mannoproteins in ZNF2 oe cells. As mannoproteins are the primary components recognized by anticryptococcal cell-mediated immune responses and few have been characterized, we systemically screened all 49 predicted GPI-mannoproteins in Cryptococcus neoformans for enhanced host recognition. We identified those highly present in ZNF2 oe cells and found Cig1 to be a protective antigen against cryptococcosis either as a recombinant protein vaccine or an mRNA vaccine. Cig1 is induced by iron limitation and is highly expressed by this fungus in infected mice and in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Remarkably, iron restriction by the host induces cryptococcal cells to express iron-uptake proteins including Cig1, which act as cryptococcal antigens and in turn enhance host detection. Our results highlight an arms race between the pathogen and the host centered on iron competition, and the trade-off between cryptococcal iron acquisition and antigen exposure. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging this host–pathogen interaction for vaccine development.",

Its implication in neurological disorders and inflammation has spurred the development of numerous compounds that enhance channel activation. However, the therapeutic potential of these compounds has been limited by the characteristically fast desensitization of the α7 receptor. Using recent high-resolution structures from cryo-EM, and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations augmented by Markov state modeling, here we explore the mechanism of α7 receptor desensitization and its implication on allosteric modulation. The results provide a precise characterization of the desensitization gate and illuminate the mechanism of ion-pore opening/closing with an agonist bound. In addition, the simulations reveal the existence of a short-lived, open-channel intermediate between the activated and desensitized states that rationalizes the paradoxical pharmacology of the L247T mutant and may be relevant to type-II allosteric modulation. This analysis provides an interpretation of the signal transduction mechanism and its regulation in α7 receptors.",

          "abstract": "The unsupervised and principled diagnosis of multiscale data is a fundamental obstacle in modern scientific problems from, for instance, weather and climate prediction, neurology, epidemiology, and turbulence. Multiscale data are characterized by a combination of processes acting along multiple dimensions simultaneously, spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, nonstationarity, and/or invariances such as translation and rotation. Existing methods are not well-suited to multiscale data, usually requiring supervised strategies such as human intervention, extensive tuning, or selection of ideal time periods. We present the multiresolution coherent spatio-temporal scale separation (mrCOSTS), a hierarchical and automated algorithm for the diagnosis of coherent patterns or modes in multiscale data. mrCOSTS is a variant of dynamic mode decomposition which decomposes data into bands of spatial patterns with shared time dynamics, thereby providing a robust method for analyzing multiscale data. It requires no training but instead takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of multiscale systems. We demonstrate mrCOSTS using complex multiscale datasets that are canonically difficult to analyze: 1) climate patterns of sea surface temperature, 2) electrophysiological observations of neural signals of the motor cortex, and 3) horizontal wind in the mountain boundary layer. With mrCOSTS, we trivially retrieve complex dynamics that were previously difficult to resolve while additionally extracting hitherto unknown patterns of activity embedded in the dynamics, allowing for advancing the understanding of these fields of study. This method is an important advancement for addressing the multiscale data which characterize many of the grand challenges in science and engineering.",

However, whether there is a regulatory and functional relationship between these snoRNAs and GAS5 is unknown. Here, we show that the expression of SNORD80, but not the other snoRNAs, parallels GAS5 expression and is regulated alongside GAS5 in response to cellular stress. The 2′-O-methylation at the A496 site, located within a segment of GAS5 complementing the conserved RNA-binding region on SNORD80, promotes GAS5 stability and consequent upregulation. This methylation requires SNORD80, as it is diminished by knockdown of SNORD80 and increased by SNORD80 overexpression, similar to the effects of manipulating the expression of fibrillarin, the methyltransferase of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle (snoRNP). The upregulation of SNORD80 in response to cellular stress is due to an enhancement in its stability, which is associated with an increase in its interaction with fibrillarin. Collectively, these results identify a role for SNORD80 in guiding 2′-O-methylation to stabilize GAS5. This uncovers a feedforward regulatory loop at the GAS5 gene locus in response to cellular stress and sheds light on posttranscriptional mechanisms governing lncRNA expression.",

          "abstract": "Fluid flows are dominant features of many bacterial environments, and flow can often impact bacterial behaviors in unexpected ways. For example, the most common type of cardiovascular infection is heart valve colonization by gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis (endocarditis). This behavior is counterintuitive because heart valves experience high shear rates that would naively be expected to reduce colonization. To determine whether these bacteria preferentially colonize higher shear rate environments, we developed a microfluidic system to quantify the effect of flow conditions on the colonization of S. aureus and E. faecalis . We find that the preferential colonization in high flow of both species is not specific to heart valves and can be found in simple configurations lacking any host factors. This behavior enables bacteria that are outcompeted in low flow to dominate in high flow. Surprisingly, experimental and computational studies reveal that the two species achieve this behavior via distinct mechanisms. S. aureus grows in cell clusters and produces a dispersal signal whose transport is affected by shear rate. Meanwhile, E. faecalis grows in linear chains whose mechanical properties result in less dispersal in the presence of higher shear force. In addition to establishing two divergent mechanisms by which these bacteria each preferentially colonize high-flow environments, our findings highlight the importance of understanding bacterial behaviors at the level of collective interactions among cells. These results suggest that distinct multicellular nanocolony morphologies have previously unappreciated costs and benefits in different environments, like those introduced by fluid flow.",

It is widely accepted that hemolysis-derived toxic molecules are cleared by macrophages or metabolized in hepatocytes. In zebrafish, we found that scavenger endothelial cells (SECs), a specialized endothelium with remarkable endocytosis capability, engulf both macromolecular hemoglobin (Hb) and small molecular unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), two primary toxic byproducts of hemolysis. These engulfment processes are mediated by the scavenger receptor Stab2. To demonstrate the protective function of SECs during hemolysis, we employed a zebrafish model of erythropoietic porphyria, characterized by excessive protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation due to ferrochelatase mutation, leading to light-sensitive hemolysis and larva death. We found that SECs facilitate the clearance of excess PPIX via Stab2, thereby mitigating PPIX-induced larval mortality. In addition, mouse SECs possess a conserved capability of scavenging Hb/UCB/PPIX. In conclusion, our study identifies SECs as a detoxification system during physiological and pathological hemolysis, shedding light on their protective role against hemolysis-induced damage.",

          "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation is causing the collapse of seed dispersal interactions and ecosystem functioning. When management and conservation strategies aim to sustain ecosystem functioning of fragmented forests, species’ traits and functional performance are critical in guiding decisions. However, to date, we lack a quantitative understanding of the role of frugivores’ body size and dispersal ability in ecosystem sustainability among fragmented forests. Focusing on avian frugivory and seed dispersal in a multi-island setting, we address the data gap by recording more than 20,000 frugivory events in an artificial insular fragmented landscape constructed in 1959 and nearby unfragmented forests on the mainland. We show that large-bodied and dispersal-limited frugivorous birds are largely confined to large islands and the unfragmented mainland, whereas on small islands, small-bodied and highly mobile birds predominantly engage in frugivory interactions. The plant–frugivore meta-network exhibits a distinct compartmentalization, driven by island area and bird mobility. Birds with smaller size and greater mobility have higher topological importance, and the presence of small-bodied birds significantly enhances meta-network robustness. These results suggest that among insular fragmented forests where frugivory interactions are degraded, small-bodied and highly mobile birds disproportionately contribute to meta-community cohesion and ecosystem functioning because of the lack of large-bodied and dispersal-limited birds. We thus advocate for the restoration of landscapes to facilitate seed dispersal and functional connectivity, ensuring the presence of large patches along with small patches as stepping-stones. Meanwhile, we recommend prioritizing conservation on small-bodied and highly mobile birds in fragmented landscapes, a subset of underappreciated species that yet play crucial roles in ecosystem functioning.",

Understanding these collective effects in spatially heterogeneous communities is an ongoing challenge. Here, we investigated the spatial organization that emerges from antibiotic exposure in initially randomly distributed communities containing antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Enterococcus faecalis , an opportunistic pathogen. We identified that a range of complex spatial structures emerged in the population homeland—the inoculated region that microbes inhabit prior to range expansion—which depended on initial colony composition and antibiotic concentration. We found that these arrangements were explained by cooperative interactions between resistant and sensitive subpopulations with a variable spatial scale, the result of dynamic zones of protection afforded to sensitive cells by growing populations of enzyme-producing resistant neighbors. Using a combination of experiments and mathematical models, we explored the complex spatiotemporal interaction dynamics that create these patterns, and predicted spatial arrangements of sensitive and resistant subpopulations under new conditions. We illustrated how spatial population dynamics in the homeland affect subsequent range expansion, both because they modulate the composition of the initial expanding front, and through long-range cooperation between the homeland and the expanding region. Finally, we showed that these spatial constraints resulted in populations whose size and composition differed markedly from matched populations in well-stirred (planktonic) cultures. These findings underscore the importance of spatial structure and cooperation, long-studied features in theoretical ecology, for determining the fate of bacterial communities under antibiotic exposure.",

We show anti-poly-glycine-arginine (a-polyGR) positive aggregates frequently accumulate in sporadic AD autopsy brains (45/80 cases). We hypothesize that these aggregates are caused by one or more polyGR-encoding repeat expansion mutations. We developed a CRISPR/deactivated-Cas9 enrichment strategy to identify candidate GR-encoding repeat expansion mutations directly from genomic DNA isolated from a-polyGR(+) AD cases. Using this approach, we isolated an interrupted (GGGAGA) n intronic expansion within a SINE-VNTR-Alu element in CASP8 ( CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP ). Immunostaining using a-polyGR and locus-specific C-terminal antibodies demonstrate that the CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP expresses hybrid poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n proteins that accumulate in CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP (+) AD brains. In cells, expression of CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP minigenes leads to increased p-Tau (Ser202/Thr205) levels. Consistent with other types of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) proteins, poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n protein levels are increased by stress. Additionally, levels of these stress-induced proteins are reduced by metformin. Association studies show specific aggregate promoting interrupted CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP sequence variants found in ~3.6% of controls and 7.5% AD cases increase AD risk [ CASP8 -GGGAGA-AD-R1; OR 2.2, 95% CI (1.5185 to 3.1896), P = 3.1 × 10 −5 ]. Cells transfected with a high-risk CASP8 -GGGAGA-AD-R1 variant show increased toxicity and increased levels of poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n aggregates. Taken together, these data identify polyGR(+) aggregates as a frequent and unexpected type of brain pathology in AD and CASP8 -GGGAGA-AD-R1 alleles as a relatively common AD risk factor.

We initially describe an engineered biomaterial–based immunological niche (IN) as a surrogate for diseased tissue to investigate immune cell function and phenotype dynamics throughout a chronic progressive mouse model of MS. Using these niches, we identify an array of dysregulated CC chemokine signaling as potential targets. We then develop antigen-loaded nanoparticles that reduce CC chemokine signaling, while delivering antigen. These nanoparticles serve as an antigen-specific treatment, and a single injection reduces disease burden, even if administered after symptomatic disease onset. This report demonstrates proof of principle of a biomaterial scaffold as a diseased tissue surrogate that can monitor immune function, identify potential drug targets, and guide the development of a therapeutic.",

          "abstract": "Immune responses in the intestine are intricately balanced to prevent pathogen entry without inducing immunopathology. The nervous system is well established to interface with the immune system to fine-tune immunity in various organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract. Specialized sensory neurons can detect bacteria, bacterial products, and the resulting inflammation, to coordinate the immune response in the gastrointestinal tract. These sensory neurons release peptide neurotransmitters such as Substance P (SP), to induce both neuronal signaling and localized responses in nonneuronal cells. With this in mind, we assessed the immunoregulatory roles of SP receptor signaling during enteric bacterial infection with the noninvasive pathogen Citrobacter rodentium . Pharmacological antagonism of the SP receptor significantly reduced bacterial burden and prevented colonic crypt hyperplasia. Mice with SP receptor signaling blockade had significantly reduced inflammation and recruitment of T cells in the colon. Reduced colonic T cell recruitment is due to reduced expression of adhesion molecules on colonic endothelial cells in SP receptor antagonist-treated mice. Using SP receptor T cell conditional knockout mice, we further confirmed SP receptor signaling enhanced select aspects of T cell responses. Our data demonstrate that SP receptor signaling can significantly reduce inflammation and prevent host-maladaptive responses without impinging upon host protection.",

Hyperactivation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling are the common signatures in ccRCC. Herein, we employed spontaneous ccRCC model to demonstrate the indispensability of an underappreciated Ser/Thr kinase, CDKL3, in the initiation and progression of ccRCC. Ablation of CDKL3 does not affect normal kidney, but abrogates Akt-mTOR hyperactivity and thoroughly prevents the formation and growth of the HIF-agitated ccRCC in vivo. Remarkable clinical correlations also supported the oncogenic role of CDKL3. Mechanism-wise, cytosolic CDKL3 unexpectedly behaves as the adaptor to physically potentiate mTORC2-dependent Akt activation without functioning through kinase activity. And mTORC2 can phosphorylate and stabilize CDKL3 to form a positive feedback loop to sustain the cancer-favored Akt-mTOR overactivation. Together, we revealed the pathological importance and molecular mechanism of CDKL3-mediated Akt-mTOR axis in ccRCC initiation and progression.",

Yet, real-time prediction of these dynamic structures remains a significant challenge. Two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing protein dynamics. However, translating its complex, low-dimensional signals into detailed three-dimensional structures is a daunting task. In this study, we introduce a machine learning-based approach that accurately predicts dynamic three-dimensional protein structures from 2DIR descriptors. Our method establishes a robust “spectrum-structure” relationship, enabling the recovery of three-dimensional structures across a wide variety of proteins. It demonstrates broad applicability in predicting dynamic structures along different protein folding trajectories, spanning timescales from microseconds to milliseconds. This approach also shows promise in identifying the structures of previously uncharacterized proteins based solely on their spectral descriptors. The integration of AI with 2DIR spectroscopy offers insights and represents a significant advancement in the real-time analysis of dynamic protein structures.",

Among them, thermosalient crystals are particularly favored thanks to their efficient energy conversions and rapid responses. However, the mechanisms for the mechanical responses of thermosalient crystals remain largely unclear. Herein we demonstrate that thermosalient effects of molecular crystals could be driven by thermoelastic twisting behaviors. The crystal, based on a model compound with rigid dibenzothiophene sulfone planes and flexible ethoxy chains, can spontaneously self-heal from mechanical fractures. Upon heating, the crystal undergoes remarkable thermosalient behaviors driven by a distinctive left- or right-handed twisting. This thermoelastic twisting converts thermal energy into elastic potential energy, which is further released as kinetic energy upon untwisting to drive the crystal jump. Our demonstration on thermoelastic twisting–induced crystal jumping offers a different perspective on the origins of thermosalient crystals and could provide inspiration for future engineering and application of dynamic molecular crystals.",

FSH is essential for female fertility because mice lacking FSH ( Fshb KO ) are anestrous and infertile. Although several in vitro cell culture and ex vivo approaches combined with pharmacological hormone treatment were used to identify FSH-regulated genes, how FSH orchestrates ovarian gene networks in vivo has not been investigated. Whether FSH-regulated genes display estrous stage–specific expression changes has also not been studied. Here, we functionally rescued Fshb null mice with a gonadotrope-targeted HFSHB transgene and performed RNA-Seq analysis on ovarian RNAs obtained from FSH-intact ( WT ), FSH-deficient ( Fshb KO ), and FSH-rescue ( HFSHB + rescue) mice. By comparing WT vs. Fshb KO and Fshb KO vs. HFSHB + rescue ovarian gene expression datasets, we identified FSH-responsive genes in vivo. Cross interrogation of these datasets further allowed us to identify several transcription factors (TFs) and RNA-binding proteins specific to FSH-regulated genes. In an independent set of experiments, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on ovarian RNAs from mice in diestrous (DE), proestrous (PE), and estrous (E) and identified estrous stage–specific ovarian gene expression patterns. Interestingly, many of the FSH-regulated TFs themselves were estrous-stage specifically expressed. We found that ESR2 and GATA6, two known FSH-responsive TFs, and their target genes are reciprocally regulated with distinct patterns of expression in estrous stages. Together, our in vivo models and RNA-Seq analyses identify FSH-regulated ovarian genes in specific estrous stages that are under transcriptional and posttranscriptional control.",

Specifically, the disclination leads to Faraday lines of effective magnetic flux that run from the center all the way to the edge of the arrays. Moreover, the geometric deformation, induced by the topological defect, curves the geometry such that these Faraday lines are channeled preferentially by the arrays’ curved geometry.

Careful regulation of these molecules is critical to control apoptosis, pyroptosis, and inflammation. Here, we found a pivotal role of Raver1 as an essential regulator of Ripk1 pre-mRNA splicing, expression, and functionality and the subsequent caspase-8-dependent inflammatory cell death. We show that Raver1 influences mRNA diversity primarily by repressing alternative exon inclusion. Macrophages from Raver1 -deficient mice exhibit altered splicing of Ripk1 . As a result, Raver1 -deficient primary macrophages display diminished cell death and decreased interleukin-18 and interleukin-1ß production, when infected with Yersinia bacteria, or by restraining TGF-ß-activated kinase 1 or IKKβ in the presence of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor family members, or interferon-γ. These responses are accompanied by reduced activation of caspase-8, Gasdermin D and E, and caspase-1 in the absence of Raver1 . Consequently, Raver1 -deficient mice showed heightened susceptibility to Yersinia infection. Raver1 and RIPK1 also controlled the expression and function of the C-type lectin receptor Mincle. Our study underscores the critical regulatory role of Raver1 in modulating innate immune responses and highlights its significance in directing in vivo and in vitro inflammatory processes.",

          "abstract": "All glioblastoma (GBM) molecular subsets share the common trait of accelerated progression following necrosis, which cannot be adequately explained by cellular proliferation arising from accumulated genetic alterations. Counter to dogma that “cancer outgrows its blood supply,” we suggest that development of necrosis is not merely a consequence of aggressive neoplastic growth but could be a contributing force causing tumor microenvironment (TME) restructuring and biologic progression. Mechanisms related to necrotic contributions are poorly understood due to a lack of methods to study necrosis as a primary variable. To reveal spatiotemporal changes related to necrosis directly, we developed a mouse model and methodology designed to induce clinically relevant thrombotic vaso-occlusion within GBMs in an immunocompetent RCAS/tv-a mouse model to study TME restructuring by intravital microscopy and demonstrate its impact on glioma progression. Diffuse high-grade gliomas are generated by introducing RCAS-PDGFB-RFP and RCAS-Cre in a Nestin/tv-a; TP53 fl/fl PTEN fl/fl background mouse. We then photoactivate Rose Bengal in specific, targeted blood vessels within the glioma to induce thrombosis, hypoxia, and necrosis. Following induced necrosis, GBMs undergo rapid TME restructuring and radial expansion, with immunosuppressive bone marrow–derived, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and glioma stem cells (GSCs) increasing dramatically in the perinecrotic niche. Collectively, this model introduces necrosis as the primary variable and captures glioma TME and growth dynamics in a manner that will facilitate therapeutic development to antagonize these mechanisms of progression.",

Our analysis of this record demonstrates many archaeological features previously associated with intentional flake production. This includes hammerstones with substantial percussive damage and a range of flaked and detached pieces. Comparative analyses with other flaked primate and hominin assemblages reveals that, unintentional flake production is a universal component of stone hammer and anvil percussive behaviors, suggesting that similar behaviors by early hominins may have led to stone flake technology and that this record may have been highly variable.

However, less is known about the structure of interaction configurations within species, even though individuals are the actual interacting units in nature. We compiled 46 empirical, individual-based, interaction networks on plant-animal seed dispersal mutualisms, comprising 1,037 plant individuals across 29 species from various regions. We compared the structure of individual-based networks to that of species-based networks and, by extending the niche concept to interaction assemblages, we explored individual plant specialization. Using a Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty derived from sampling, we examined how plant individuals “explore” the interaction niche of their populations. Both individual-based and species-based networks exhibited high variability in network properties, lacking remarkable structural and topological differences between them. Within populations, frugivores’ interaction allocation among plant individuals was highly heterogeneous, with one to three frugivore species dominating interactions. Regardless of species or bioregion, plant individuals displayed a variety of interaction profiles across populations, with a consistently-small percentage of individuals playing a central role and exhibiting high diversity in their interaction assemblage. Plant populations showed variable mid to low levels of niche specialization; and individuals’ interaction niche “breadth” accounted for 70% of the population interaction diversity, on average. Our results highlight how downscaling from species to individual-based networks helps understanding the structuring of interactions within ecological communities and provide an empirical basis for the extension of niche theory to complex mutualistic networks.",

Fluorescent indicators for Ca 2+ ions revolutionized our ability to make rapid, accurate, and highly parallel measurement of Ca 2+ concentrations in living cells. The use of ratio-based imaging with one particular indicator, fura-2, allowed practitioners to correct for a number of experimental confounds, including dye bleaching, variations in sample thickness, and fluctuations in illumination intensity. Ratio-based imaging with fura-2 was the most accurate and reliable method for measuring Ca 2+ concentrations. Two drawbacks to fura-2 exist. First, it requires ultraviolet (UV) excitation, which is more toxic to living cells than visible light. Second, our ability to use fura-2 for accurate, stable, ratio-based determinations of Ca 2+ concentration in living cells is fast becoming a method of the past. This is due, in part, because modern microscopes are phasing out the use of mercury arc lamps that provide the UV excitation needed for fura-2 imaging. To address this problem, we describe the design, synthesis, and cellular application of benzo[ b ]phosphole-based fluorescent Ca 2+ indicators for ratio-based imaging of Ca 2+ in living cells that can be used with modern light emitting diode (LED)-equipped fluorescence microscopes. We report isoCaRed-1Me, a Ca 2+ indicator that enables ratio-based imaging in immortalized cell lines, primary mammalian hippocampal neurons, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes.

SOC storage is significantly higher in both the topsoil and subsoil in systems dominated by obligate mycorrhizal (OM) and facultative mycorrhizal (FM) plants than those dominated by nonmycorrhizal (NM) plants. Also, the relative abundance of OM plants increases at the expense of FM plants as temperature and precipitation increase.

The formation of open burrows may have increased bioirrigation in the uppermost sediment zone, promoting ventilation and generating an ecosystem engineering feedback loop between bioturbation and pore-water oxygenation.

Here, we present seismic evidence from a full-waveform tomographic model that reveals flat subduction of the Indian Plate beneath nearly the entire plateau at ∼ 300 km depth, implying that the slab may have transitioned to positive/neutral buoyancy and is no longer capable of supporting steep-angle deep subduction. The horizontal distance over which the flat slab slides northward increases from west (where it collides with the Tarim lithospheric keel) to east (where it has resided approximately north of the Songpan-Ganzi Fold Belt beyond the Qiangtang Block). The Asian lithosphere is subducting beneath northeastern Tibet without colliding with the Indian slab. The low-velocity zone, with a thickness of 50 to 110 km, sandwiched between the Tibetan crust and Indian slab, is positively correlated with the high-elevation, low-relief topography of Tibet, suggesting partial melting of the uppermost mantle that has facilitated the growth and flatness of the plateau by adding buoyant material to its base. We propose that deep mantle convective currents, traced to the Réunion plume and imaged as large-scale low-velocity anomalies from the upper mantle under the Indian Plate downward toward the uppermost lower mantle under the Baikal-Mongolia Plateau, are the primary force driving the ongoing India–Asia postcollisional convergence.",

However, this progress is impeded by the lack of robust, immunocompetent preclinical animal models due to HBV’s strict species specificity. We previously showed that vector-mediated expression of the HBV entry receptor, human sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP), renders macaques fully susceptible to HBV infection. In this study, we have generated transgenic macaques expressing hNTCP, marking the creation of the first transgenic nonhuman primate model for infectious disease research. We used PiggyBac (PB) transposon technology to insert a liver-specific hNTCP expression cassette into rhesus macaque zygotes and transferred the resulting embryos into surrogate females, resulting in two healthy transgenic offspring. In both animals, hNTCP is highly and selectively expressed in the liver. Most importantly, we show that isolated hepatocytes from these monkeys are susceptible to HBV infection. These findings lay the foundation for the development of a nonhuman primate HBV model, facilitating the advancement and validation of curative HBV therapies.",

Influenza A group 1 cHAs, cH5/1, cH8/1, and cH11/1, comprising an H1 stem attached to either an H5, H8, or H11 globular head, have been used sequentially as vaccine immunogens in human clinical trials and induced high levels of broadly protective antibodies. Using X-ray crystallography and negative-stain electron microscopy, we determined structures of cH5/1, cH8/1, and cH11/1 HAs in their apo (unliganded) and antibody Fab-bound states. Stem-reactive antibodies 3E1 and 31.b.09 recognize their cognate epitopes in cH5/1, cH8/1, and cH11/1 HAs. However, with cH5/1, the head domains are rotated by 35 to 45° around the threefold axis of the HA trimer compared to native HA with a more splayed-open conformation at the stem base. cH11/1 with 3E1 is structurally more native-like but resembles cH5/1 with 31.b.09, whereas cH8/1 with 31.b.09 exhibited a range of closed-to-open stem configurations with some separation of head and stem domains. Furthermore, all of these group 1 cHAs effectively bound a broad head trimer interface antibody and other broad stem antibodies. Thus, the cHAs exhibit structural plasticity without compromising the stem and head trimer interface epitopes for elicitation of influenza A group 1 cross-reactive antibodies.",

          "abstract": "Fungal infections represent a significant global health concern, with a growing prevalence of antifungal drug resistance. Targeting glucosylceramides (GlcCer), which are functionally important glycosphingolipids (GSL) present in fungal membranes, represents a promising strategy for the development of antifungal drugs. GlcCer are associated with the antifungal activity of certain plant and insect defensins. The 44-residue ETD151 peptide, optimized from butterfly defensins, is active against several fungal pathogens. ETD151 has been shown to induce a multifaceted mechanism of action (MOA) in Botrytis cinerea , a multiresistant phytopathogenic fungus. However, the target has yet to be identified. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of GlcCer in membranes determines the susceptibility of Pichia pastoris and Candida albicans toward ETD151. To ascertain whether this is due to direct molecular recognition, we demonstrate that ETD151 selectively recognizes liposomes containing GlcCer from B. cinerea , which reveals a methylated-sphingoid base structure. The dissociation constant was estimated by microscale thermophoresis to be in the µM range. Finally, fluorescence microscopy revealed that ETD151 localizes preferentially at the surface of B. cinerea . Furthermore, the majority of prokaryotic cells do not contain GSL, which explains their resistance to ETD151. We investigated the susceptibility of Novosphingobium capsulatum , one of the rare GSL-containing bacteria, to ETD151. ETD151 demonstrated transient morphological changes and inhibitory growth activity (IC 50 ~75 µM) with an affinity for the cell surface, emphasizing the critical importance of GSL as target. Understanding the MOA of ETD151 could pave the way for new perspectives in human health and crop protection.",

OPN3 was first identified in the brain (and named encephalopsin) and subsequently found to be expressed in other tissues. In adipocytes, OPN3 is necessary for light responses that modulate lipolysis and glucose uptake, while OPN3 in human skin melanocytes regulates pigmentation in a light-independent manner. Despite its initial discovery in the brain, OPN3 functional mechanisms in the brain remain elusive. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of OPN3 function in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. We show that Opn3 is coexpressed with the melanocortin 4 receptor ( Mc4r ) in a population of PVN neurons, where it negatively regulates MC4R-mediated cAMP signaling in a specific and Gα i/o -dependent manner. Under baseline conditions, OPN3 via Gα i/o potentiates the activity of the inward rectifying Kir7.1 channel, previously shown to be closed in response to agonist-mediated activation of MC4R in a Gα s -independent manner. In mice, we found that Opn3 in Mc4r -expressing neurons regulates food consumption. Our results reveal the first mechanistic insight into OPN3 function in the hypothalamus, uncovering a unique mechanism by which OPN3 functions to potentiate Kir7.1 activity and negatively regulate MC4R-mediated cAMP signaling, thereby promoting food intake.",

We employed a imaging method called spatiotemporal optical coherence tomography, which ensures high contrast and phase stability within the strongly scattering photoreceptor– Retinal Pigment Epithelium complex. Using this approach, we recorded nanometer-scale changes in human cones and rods in response to photopic flicker stimulation and observed length changes in rodent rods under scotopic conditions following a single pulse of light, in the absence or presence of sildenafil, which inhibits the catalytic activity of PDE6. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that during phototransduction conformational changes in PDE6 structure, which occur on an angstrom scale, are amplified to the nanometer scale due to the unique structure of the photoreceptor outer segments and sequential stimulation. This finding opens up possibilities for the informed use of photopic flicker optoretinography measurements as a diagnostic tool, as the observed nanometer-scale changes in rod and cone dimensions as a function of light stimulus can now be directly linked to molecular events involved in the phototransduction pathway.",

We previously reported that the functional and molecular profiles of layer 2/3 (L2/3) cell types in the primary visual cortex (V1) are vision-dependent [S. Cheng et al. , Cell 185 , 311–327.e24 (2022)]. Here, we characterize the spatial organization of L2/3 cell types with and without visual experience. Spatial transcriptomic profiling based on 500 genes recapitulates the zonation of L2/3 cell types along the pial–ventricular axis in V1. By applying multitasking theory, we suggest that the spatial zonation of L2/3 cell types is linked to the continuous nature of their gene expression profiles, which can be represented as a 2D manifold bounded by three archetypal cell types. By comparing normally reared and dark reared L2/3 cells, we show that visual deprivation-induced transcriptomic changes comprise two independent gene programs. The first, induced specifically in the visual cortex, includes immediate-early genes and genes associated with metabolic processes. It manifests as a change in cell state that is orthogonal to cell-type-specific gene expression programs. By contrast, the second program impacts L2/3 cell-type identity, regulating a subset of cell-type-specific genes and shifting the distribution of cells within the L2/3 cell-type manifold. Through an integrated analysis of spatial transcriptomics with single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we describe how vision patterns cortical L2/3 cell types during the critical period.",

A printed textile-based strain sensor array responds to strain from 0.1 to 10% with a gauge factor as high as 100 and shows independence to extrinsic motion artifacts via strain-isolating printed pattern design. Through reversible starching treatment, ink penetration depth during direct printing on garments is controlled to achieve batch-to-batch performance variation &lt;10%. Coupled with deep learning, explainable AI, and transfer learning data processing, the smart garment is capable of classifying six sleep states with an accuracy of 98.6%, maintaining excellent explainability (classification with low bias) and generalization (95% accuracy on new users with few-shot learning less than 15 samples per class) in practical applications, paving the way for next-generation daily sleep healthcare management.",

          "abstract": "Despite the rising challenge of antibiotic resistance, current approaches to eradicate nasal pathobionts Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae rely on antibacterials. An alternative is the artificial inoculation of commensal bacteria, i.e., probiotic treatment, supported by the increasing evidence for commensal-mediated inhibition of pathogens. To systematically investigate the potential of this approach, we developed a quantitative framework simulating the nasal microbiome dynamics by combining mathematical modeling with longitudinal microbiota data. By inferring community parameters using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing data and simulating the nasal microbial dynamics of patients colonized with S. aureus , we compared the decolonization performance of probiotic and antibiotic treatments under different assumptions on patients’ community composition and susceptibility profile. To further compare the robustness of these treatments, we simulated an S. aureus challenge and quantified the recolonization probability. Through in vitro experiments using nasal swabs of adults colonized with S. aureus , we confirmed that after antibiotic treatment, recolonization of S. aureus was inhibited in samples treated with a probiotic mixture compared to the nontreated control. Our results suggest that probiotic treatment outperforms antibiotics in terms of decolonization performance, recolonization robustness, and leads to less collateral reduction in the microbiome diversity. Thus, probiotic treatment may provide a promising alternative to combat antibiotic resistance, with the additional advantage of personalized treatment options via using the patient’s own metagenomic data. The combination of an in silico framework with in vitro experiments using clinical samples reported in this work is an important step forward to further investigate this alternative in clinical trials.",

RNA imaging methods for spatiotemporal monitoring of RNA dynamics would facilitate the discovery of unknown functions of RNA, yet improving RNA imaging is challenging because of limitations in methods for directly monitoring native RNA, especially the dynamics of RNA transport and concentration fluctuation. Herein, a label-free and conformation switching–based genetically encoded sensor, termed the Dual-locked RNAtracker (Ducker), that realizes spatiotemporal monitoring of endogenous RNA dynamics in living cells is developed. In this Ducker system, a distinctive strategy is developed by employing one RNA target to initiate an allosteric event that triggers the two locked fluorogenic RNA aptamer (M18 Pepper) to restore the active structure and transmit adequate fluorescence signals. The intracellular circular Ducker (circDucker) realizes high-contrast and unbiased imaging of native mRNA abundance and monitors the fluctuations in RNA concentration. Importantly, it also enables spatiotemporal dynamic tracking of RNA translocation by directly visualizing the process of the mitochondrial lncCyt b undergoing bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic transport, indicating the bidirectional regulatory events in mitochondria and nucleus. Therefore, this highly accessible sensor affords a universal and robust platform for spatiotemporal monitoring of RNA abundance and translocation in complicated dynamic reaction networks in live systems, including mRNA, lncRNA, and microRNA, expanding the current toolbox of RNA research and shedding light on the unknown functions of RNA.",

Recent attempts to reconcile this uncertainty by “Darwinizing” nonreplicating biogeochemical processes subject to persistence-based selection conform with the historicity of the geochemical record but lack mechanistic clarity. Here, we present a theoretical framework showing how: 1) A biogeochemical “cycle-biota-variant” (CBV) can be defined non-arbitrarily as one biologically facilitated pathway for net recycling of an essential element, plus the genotypes driving the relevant interconversion reactions. 2) Distinct CBVs can be individuated if they have climatic or geochemical side effects that feed-back on relative persistence. 3) The separation of spatial/temporal scales between the dynamics of such effects and those of conventional Darwinian evolution can introduce a degree of randomness into the relationship between CBVs and their Earth system impact properties, loosely analogous to that between the biochemical causes and evolutionary effects of genetic mutation. 4) Threshold behavior in climate feedback can accentuate biotic impacts and lead to CBV-level “competitive exclusion”. 5) CBV-level persistence selection is observationally distinguishable from genotype-level selection by strong covariance between “internal” CBV properties (genotypes and reactions) and “external” climatic effects, which we argue is analogous to the covariance between fitness and traits under conventional Darwinian selection. These factors cannot circumvent the basic fact that local natural selection will often favor phenotypes that ultimately destabilize large-scale geochemical/climatic properties. However, we claim that our results nevertheless demonstrate the theoretical coherence of persistence-selection between non-replicating life–environment interaction patterns and therefore have broad biogeochemical applicability.",

In vivo and biochemical analyses, including atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, demonstrated that the SSP adopts two alternative conformations, which can be biased by point mutations and ligand binding. The drastic conformational change upon the ligand binding was directly visualized by high-speed AFM. Furthermore, the balance of the seesaw can be reversibly changed depending on buffer conditions.

Most tomato ripening genes have been studied in pericarp tissue, though recent evidence indicates that locule tissue is a site of early ripening-gene activities. Here, we identified and functionally characterized an Ethylene Response Factor (ERF) gene, SlERF.D6 , by investigating tomato transcriptome data throughout plant development, emphasizing genes elevated in the locule during fruit development and ripening. SlERF.D6 loss-of-function mutants resulting from CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing delayed ripening initiation and carotenoid accumulation in both pericarp and locule tissues. Transcriptome analysis of lines altered in SlERF.D6 expression revealed multiple classes of altered genes including ripening regulators, in addition to carotenoid, cell wall, and ethylene pathway genes, suggesting comprehensive ripening control. Distinct regulatory patterns in pericarp versus locule tissues were observed, indicating tissue-specific activity of this transcription factor (TF). Analysis of SlERF.D6 interaction with target promoters revealed an APETALA 2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) TF ( SlDEAR2 ) as a target of SlERF.D6.

PAHs/PACs are the most dangerous chemicals found in tobacco smoke, and cigarette use during pregnancy can convey these molecules to the developing fetus through the placenta. This exposure is associated with many negative health outcomes, from premature birth to sudden infant death syndrome and adverse neurodevelopmental disorders. This study demonstrates the use of surface-enhanced Raman and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopies for direct detection of PAHs/PACs in human placental tissue. We applied two spectroscopy-informed machine learning algorithms, Characteristic Peak Extraction (CaPE) and Characteristic Peak Similarity (CaPSim), to identify the specific PAHs and PACs present in the placenta of women who smoked tobacco cigarettes in pregnancy compared to spectra of the placenta from self-reported nonsmokers. CaPE and CaPSim analysis enabled a clear distinction between these two groups.

Here, we provide insights into the longstanding controversy regarding the off-centering of transition metal (TM) ions in the archetypal ferroelectric alloy KTa 1 − x Nb x O 3 (KTN). By mapping the full energy ( E ) and wavevector ( Q ) dependence of the dynamical structure factor S ( Q , E ) using neutron scattering, and rationalizing our observations with atomistic simulations leveraging machine learning, we fully resolve the static v s dynamic nature of diffuse scattering sheets, as well as their composition ( x ) and temperature dependence. Our first-principles simulations, extended with machine-learning molecular dynamics, reproduce both inelastic neutron spectra and diffuse features, and establish how dynamically correlated TM off-centerings couple to phonons, unifying local and collective viewpoints. This study sheds light into an exemplary ferroelectric system and shows the importance of mapping the full S ( Q , E ) to reveal critical spatiotemporal correlations of atomic disorder from which functional properties emerge.",

          "abstract": "Male germ cells, which are responsible for producing millions of genetically diverse sperm through meiosis in the testis, rely on lactate as their central energy metabolite. Recent study has revealed that lactate induces epigenetic modification in cells through histone lysine lactylation. Here, we report dynamic histone lactylation at histone H4-lysine 5 (K5), -K8, and -K12 during meiosis prophase I in mouse spermatogenesis. By profiling the genome-wide occupancy of histone H4-K8 lactylation (H4K8la), which peaks at zygotene, our data show that H4K8la mark is observed at the promoters of genes exhibiting active expression with Gene Ontology functions enriched for meiosis. Notably, our data also demonstrate that H4K8la is closely associated with recombination hotspots, where machinery involved in the processing DNA double-stranded breaks, such as SPO11, DMC1, RAD51, and RPA2, is engaged. In addition, H4K8la was also detected at the meiosis-specific cohesion sites (marked by RAD21L and REC8) flanking the recombination hotspots. Functionally, our data show that lactate induces upregulation of key meiotic genes through H4K8la modifications. Additionally, H4K8la shows colocalization and interaction with PRDM9 at recombination hotspots. Finally, our data show that HBO1, a lactyltransferase, is highly expressed in meiotic germ cells. In vitro lactylation assays reveal that HBO1 induces H4K8la, and pharmacological inhibition of HBO1 in mice reduces H4K8la levels and disrupts meiosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that histone lactylation serves as an epigenetic mechanism that is involved in meiotic gene expression and recombination in male germ cells during spermatogenesis.",

In the oral microbiome, the pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans uses quorum-sensing to control the production of bacteriocins. These antimicrobial peptides kill off ecological competitors and allow S. mutans to dominate the microenvironment of dental plaques and form dental caries. One class of bacteriocins produced by S. mutans , the lantibiotic mutacins, are particularly effective at killing due to their broad spectrum of activity. Despite years of study, the regulatory mechanisms governing production of lantibiotic mutacins I, II, and III in S. mutans have never been elucidated. We identified a distinct class of quorum-sensing system, MutRS, that regulates mutacins and is widespread among the streptococci. We demonstrate that MutRS systems are activated by a short peptide pheromone (Mutacin Stimulating Peptide) and show that MutRS controls production of three separate lantibiotic mutacins in three different strains of S. mutans . Finally, we show that paralogous MutRS systems participate in inter- and intrastrain crosstalk, providing further evidence of the interplay between quorum-sensing systems in the oral streptococci.",

Herein, we report a strategy, coined self-assembled proteomimetic (SAP), to mimic such three-helix bundle architecture with a hybridization-enforced two-helix coiled coil that is obtained by templated native chemical ligation (T-NCL) of PNA–peptide conjugates. This SAP strategy stands out by its synthetic accessibility, reducing the length on the longest synthetic peptide to less than 30 amino acids which is readily attainable by standard SPPS methodologies. We show that the T-NCL dramatically accelerates the ligation, enabling this chemistry to proceed in a combinatorial fashion at low micromolar concentrations. We demonstrate that small combinatorial libraries of SAPs can be prepared in one operation and used directly in affinity selections against a target of interest with an LC–MS analysis of the fittest binders. Moreover, we show that the underlying design paradigm is functional for SAPs based on structurally distinct three-helix peptides aimed at different therapeutic targets, namely HER2 and spike’s RBD, reaching picomolar affinities. We further illustrate that the affinity of the SAP can be allosterically regulated using a toehold displacement of the hybridizing PNAs to disrupt the coiled coil stabilization. Finally, we show that an RBD-targeting SAP effectively inhibits viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with an IC 50 of 2.8 nM.",

When the singular band gap closes, the geometric and conventional contributions to the superfluid weight as a function of the superconducting gap exhibit different cross-over behaviors. The scaling behavior of superfluid weight with the band gap is studied in detail, and the effect on the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition temperature is explored. It is found that tuning the singular band gap provides a unique mechanism for enhancing the supercurrent and critical temperature of two-dimensional superconductors.",

          "abstract": "Unlike coffee and cream that homogenize when stirred, growing micro-organisms (e.g., bacteria, baker’s yeast) can actively kill each other and avoid mixing. How do such antagonistic interactions impact the growth and survival of competing strains, while being spatially advected by turbulent flows? By using numerical simulations of a continuum model, we study the dynamics of two antagonistic strains that are dispersed by incompressible turbulent flows in two spatial dimensions. A key parameter is the ratio of the fluid transport time to that of biological reproduction, which determines the winning organism that ultimately takes over the whole population from an initial heterogeneous state, a process known as fixation. By quantifying the probability and mean time for fixation along with the spatial structure of concentration fluctuations, we demonstrate how turbulence raises the threshold for biological nucleation and antagonism suppresses flow-induced mixing by depleting the population at interfaces. Our work highlights the unusual biological consequences of the interplay of turbulent fluid flows with antagonistic population dynamics, with potential implications for marine microbial ecology and origins of biological chirality.",

          "abstract": "Bone is a dynamic organ constantly undergoing remodeling with both bone formation and resorption. Bone formation is mediated by osteoblasts originating from the differentiation of bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (BM-MSPCs). However, how bone cells communicate with BM-MSPCs to coordinate bone formation remains largely elusive. Here, we unveil a key role of osteocyte connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels in regulating the lineage commitment of BM-MSPCs. Two transgenic mouse models expressing dominant negative Cx43 mutants in osteocytes were used: R76W (inhibiting gap junctions) and Δ130 to 136 (inhibiting both hemichannels and gap junctions). BM-MSPCs from Δ130 to 136 mice showed enhanced adipogenic differentiation and reduced osteogenic potential, leading to increased BM adipocytes. Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed shifts in BM-MSPC subsets, less osteogenic-biased MSPCs, and more adipogenic-biased MSPCs in Δ130 to 136 mice. Conversely, R76W, with more functional hemichannels, exhibited effects similar to WT mice or even greater opposite effects than Δ130 to 136 mice. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), released from active Cx43 hemichannels, inhibited adipogenesis and promoted osteogenesis via the PGE 2 receptor EP4 and ERK1/2 signaling. Inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels or EP4 led to increased adipogenic-biased MSPCs. Moreover, administration of a Cx43(M1) antibody, which inhibits hemichannels, substantially increased BM adipocytes, accompanied by increased adipogenic-biased MSPCs, and decreased osteogenic-biased MSPCs. Our study highlights the pivotal role of osteocyte Cx43 hemichannels in BM-MSPC fate decision through PGE 2 release, providing insights into the precise and highly regulated communication between matrix-bound bone cells and BM-MSPCs, which dictates bone formation and remodeling.",

          "abstract": "Urate provides ~50% of the reducing potential in human and primate plasma which is key to detoxifying reactive oxygen by-products of cellular metabolism. Urate is the endpoint of purine metabolism in primates, and its concentration in plasma is a balance between excretion from kidney and intestine, and subsequent reabsorption in and through cells of kidney proximal tubules to maintain a regulated concentration in plasma. SLC2A9 is the primary transporter that returns urate from the basolateral side of kidney tubule cells back to plasma. A shorter splice variant of SLC2A9 is directed to the apical surface where several transporters recapture urate from the tubule back into cells. Too high a concentration in plasma causes hyperuricemia, is linked to gout, and favors kidney stone formation. To understand the molecular basis of uric acid transport and the role of disease-causing mutations in SLC2A9, we determined structures of human SLC2A9 in its apo form, and its urate-bound form by cryo-EM, at resolution of 3.3 Å and 4.1 Å respectively. Both structures are captured in an inward open conformation. Using the inward-facing structure as a template we modeled the outward-facing conformation to understand the alternating access mechanism. Alternative salt bridge pairs on the cytoplasmic side suggest a mechanism that can balance the energetics of the inward open and outward open states. The location of disease-causing mutants suggests their role in impacting function. Our structures elucidate the molecular basis for urate selectivity and transport and provide a platform for future structure-based drug discovery aimed at reducing plasma urate levels in diseases of hyperuricemia and gout.",

The acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) by an ancestral nidovirus enabled crossing of the 20 kb barrier. Other factors constraining genome size variations in nidoviruses remain poorly defined. We assemble 76 genome sequences of invertebrate nidoviruses from &gt;500.000 published transcriptome experiments and triple the number of known nidoviruses with &gt;36 kb genomes, including a 64 kb RNA genome. Many of the identified viral lineages acquired putative enzymatic and other protein domains linked to genome size, host phyla, or virus families. The inserted domains may regulate viral replication and virion formation, or modulate infection otherwise. We classify ExoN-encoding nidoviruses into seven groups and four subgroups, according to canonical and noncanonical modes of viral replicase expression by ribosomes and genomic organization (reModes). The most-represented group employing the canonical reMode comprises invertebrate and vertebrate nidoviruses, including coronaviruses. Six groups with noncanonical reModes include invertebrate nidoviruses with 31-to-64 kb genomes. Among them are viruses with segmented genomes and viruses utilizing dual ribosomal frameshifting that we validate experimentally. Moreover, largest polyprotein length and genome size in nidoviruses show reMode- and host phylum-dependent relationships. We hypothesize that the polyprotein length increase in nidoviruses may be limited by the host-inherent translation fidelity, ultimately setting a nidovirus genome size limit. Thus, expansion of ExoN-encoding RNA virus genomes, the vertebrate/invertebrate host division, the control of viral replicase expression, and translation fidelity are interconnected.",

Plasma separation cards (PSC) collect and preserve a dried specimen, which makes them practical solutions for decentralized sample collection and transport in limited-resource settings. However, physiological variations in hematocrit levels can introduce significant variability in the quality of plasma generated by commercial PSCs and can lead to inaccurate test results and clinical decisions. In addition to hematocrit-dependent sampling, the Roche PSC, a standard for dried plasma collection, is known to induce considerable hemolysis, which further impacts specimen quality, concordance with liquid plasma, and the overall benefit of microsampling. We address these gaps with a patterned dried plasma spot (pDPS) card, which generates plasma with improved hematocrit independence and minimal hemolysis. This study directly compares pDPS cards to the Roche PSC to measure HIV viral load. Analysis of viral load from 75 donors revealed strong agreement in sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and viral load band placement between devices, with quantitative metrics suggesting improved performance for pDPS cards. In reflexive genotyping, remnant dried blood from pDPS cards exhibited greater success than Roche PSC in amplification and sequencing (71% vs. 62%) and detecting drug resistance mutations (63% vs. 42%). Based on this performance, pDPS cards can be versatile across multiple analytical platforms, integrate seamlessly into existing clinical laboratory workflows, and aid clinicians in making accurate treatment decisions.",

Zymocin is encoded by a killer plasmid or virus-like element (VLE), which is a linear DNA molecule located in the cytosol. We hypothesized that a tRNA-cleaving toxin similar to zymocin may have caused the three parallel changes to the nuclear genetic code that occurred during yeast evolution, in which the codon CUG became translated as Ser or Ala instead of Leu. However, zymocin-like toxins are rare — both among species, and among strains within a species —and only four toxins of this type have previously been discovered. Here, we identified 45 zymocin-like toxin genes in Saccharomycotina, the budding yeast subphylum, using a bioinformatics strategy, and verified that many of them are toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae when expressed. Some of the toxin genes are located on cytosolic VLEs, whereas others are on VLE-derived DNA integrated into the nuclear genome. The toxins are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and show evidence of positive selection. Toxin genes were found in five taxonomic orders of budding yeasts, including two of the three orders that reassigned CUG codons, indicating that VLEs have been parasites of yeast species for at least 300 My and that their existence predates the genetic code changes.",

Despite their severe ototoxicity, causing irreversible hearing loss in millions of people annually, no preventive therapy has been approved. We previously reported that GABARAP and several other central autophagy proteins are essential for AG-induced hearing loss. This finding opens avenues for the rational design and development of inhibitors that selectively target proteins in this pathway, thereby mitigating AG ototoxicity. In this study, we generated a mouse model with a targeted deletion of GABARAPL1, a homolog of GABARAP, and another model deficient in both GABARAP and GABARAPL1. We found that normal hearing is unaffected by the depletion of these proteins. Remarkably, both proteins are essential for AG-induced hearing loss, with GABARAP playing a more significant role. To further explore the therapeutic potential, we designed and validated short hairpin RNAs targeting the mouse and human GABARAP gene. By inhibiting GABARAP expression in inner ear hair cells using adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference, we successfully prevented AG-induced hair cell death and subsequent hearing loss. Our findings underscore the critical role of GABARAP in AG ototoxicity and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing AG-induced hearing loss.",

This arms race between proteins encoded by X-linked Slxl1 / Slx and Y-linked Sly gene families can distort offspring sex ratio, but how these proteins compete remains unknown. Here, we report how Slxl1 / Slx and Sly encoded proteins compete in a protein family–specific and dose-dependent manner using yeast. Specifically, SLXL1 competes with SLY1 and SLY2 for binding to the Spindlin SPIN1. Similarly, SLX competes with SLY2 for binding the Spindlin SSTY2. These competitions are driven by the N termini of SLXL1, SLX, SLY1, and SLY2 binding to the third Tudor domains of SPIN1 and SSTY2. SLY1 and SLY2 form homo- and heterodimers, suggesting that the competition is between complex multimers. Residues under positive selection mapping to the interaction domains and rapid exon gain/loss are consistent with competition between the X- and Y-linked gene families. Our findings support a model in which dose-dependent competition of these X- and Y-linked encoded proteins to bind Spindlins occurs in haploid X- and Y-spermatids to influence X- versus Y-sperm fitness and thus sex ratio.",

The average decomposition rates of various litter types ranged from 0.74 to 4.01 y −1 across polar to tropics, showing a large geographical span. Litter substrate and climate directly explained 36 and 30% of the variations in decomposition rates, with the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio identified as the best predictor. In the absence of climate variables, litter substrate can effectively explain the variation, while the model’s predictive capacity decreased significantly after litter substrate was excluded. Our synthesis highlights that a fundamental constraint on litter substrate leads to predictable global-scale patterns of terrestrial litter decomposition rates.

          "abstract": "The immune system exploits a wide range of strategies to combine sensitivity with selectivity for optimal response. We propose a generic physical mechanism that allows tuning the location and steepness of the response threshold of cellular processes activated by multivalent binding. The mechanism is based on the possibility to modulate the attraction between membrane receptors. We use theory and simulations to show how tuning interreceptor attraction can enhance or suppress the binding of multivalent ligand-coated particles to surfaces. The changes in the interreceptor attraction less than the thermal energy k B T can selectively switch the receptor-clustering and activation on or off in an almost step-wise fashion, which we explain by near-critical receptor density fluctuations. We also show that the same mechanism can efficiently regulate the onset of endocytosis for, e.g. , drug delivery vehicles.",

          "abstract": "Modern machine learning has achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacrifices interpretability, a critical consideration in high-stakes domains such as medicine. In such settings, practitioners often use highly interpretable decision tree models, but these suffer from inductive bias against additive structure. To overcome this bias, we propose Fast Interpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (FIGS), which generalizes the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm to simultaneously grow a flexible number of trees in summation. By combining logical rules with addition, FIGS adapts to additive structure while remaining highly interpretable. Experiments on real-world datasets show FIGS achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. To demonstrate the usefulness of FIGS in high-stakes domains, we adapt FIGS to learn clinical decision instruments (CDIs), which are tools for guiding decision-making. Specifically, we introduce a variant of FIGS known as Group Probability-Weighted Tree Sums (G-FIGS) that accounts for heterogeneity in medical data. G-FIGS derives CDIs that reflect domain knowledge and enjoy improved specificity (by up to 20% over CART) without sacrificing sensitivity or interpretability. Theoretically, we prove that FIGS learns components of additive models, a property we refer to as disentanglement. Further, we show (under oracle conditions) that tree-sum models leverage disentanglement to generalize more efficiently than single tree models when fitted to additive regression functions. Finally, to avoid overfitting with an unconstrained number of splits, we develop Bagging-FIGS, an ensemble version of FIGS that borrows the variance reduction techniques of random forests. Bagging-FIGS performs competitively with random forests and XGBoost on real-world datasets.",

          "abstract": "Host antibody responses are key components in the protection of animals against pathogens, yet the defining properties of viral antigens and induction of B cell responses that result in varied protection are still poorly understood. Parvoviruses are simple molecular structures that display 60 repeated motifs on their capsid surface, and rapidly induce strong antibody responses that protect animals from infection. We recently showed that following canine parvovirus infection of its natural host, the polyclonal response in the sera contained only two or three dominant antibodies that bound two epitopes on the capsid. Here, we characterize key antibodies present in that immune response, identifying their sequences, defining their binding properties on the capsid by cryoelectron microscopic (cryoEM) analysis, and testing their effects on viral infectivity. Two antibodies sharing the same heavy chain bound to the side of the capsid threefold spike (B-site), while another distinct antibody bound close to the threefold axis (A-site). The epitopes of these antibodies overlapped the binding site of the host receptor, the transferrin receptor type-1, but to varying degrees. The antibodies varied widely in their neutralization efficiencies as either immunoglobulins (IgGs) or monomeric antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), which was consistent with their ability to compete for the receptor. The monoclonal antibodies characterized here matched the structures from the cryoEM analysis of polyclonal sera, including those present in a different dog than the monoclonal source. This shows that after infection, a focused response to the viral antigen is produced that protects against infection.",

          "abstract": "Enhancing thermoelectric conversion efficiency (TCE) is pivotal for advancing global energy conservation and emission reduction initiatives. Traditional approaches primarily focus on microscopic strategies such as bandgap engineering, chemical potential adjustments, and entropy engineering. However, these methods face substantial limitations in practical applications due to challenging material property requirements. Additionally, the efficiencies achieved remain modest, constrained by the interdependent nature of electrical and thermal conductivities, which typically vary concurrently. Inspired by the thermoregulation mechanisms in biological organisms, we propose here a macroscopic strategy based on an expanded-plane (EP) meta-structure. Such a meta-structure, of the thermal gradient regulator type, exploits the temperature gradient concentrating effect to significantly boost TCE. We prove, both numerically and experimentally, how the proposed device can achieve temperature gradient concentration under diverse conditions. Remarkably, under undistorted temperature background conditions, we measured an striking efficiency enhancement of 59.0 % . This work highlights the EP thermal gradient regulator’s ability to boost thermoelectric efficiency, valuable across domains: aiding efficient chip cooling in microelectronics and powering wearable medical devices.",

          "abstract": "Poststroke inflammation critically influences functional outcomes following ischemic stroke. Arginase-1 (Arg1) is considered a marker for anti-inflammatory macrophages, associated with the resolution of inflammation and promotion of tissue repair in various pathological conditions. However, its specific role in poststroke recovery remains to be elucidated. This study investigates the functional impact of Arg1 expressed in macrophages on poststroke recovery and inflammatory milieu. We observed a time-dependent increase in Arg1 expression, peaking at 7 d after photothrombotic stroke in mice. Cellular mapping analysis revealed that Arg1 was predominantly expressed in LysM-positive infiltrating macrophages. Using a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model, we examined the role of Arg1 expressed in infiltrating macrophages. Contrary to its presumed beneficial effects, Arg1 cKO in LysM-positive macrophages significantly improved skilled forelimb motor function recovery after stroke. Mechanistically, Arg1 cKO attenuated fibrotic scar formation, enhanced peri-infarct remyelination, and increased synaptic density while reducing microglial synaptic elimination in the peri-infarct cortex. Gene expression analysis of fluorescence-activated single cell sorting (FACS)-sorted CD45 low microglia revealed decreased transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and proinflammatory cytokine activity in peri-infarct microglia from Arg1 cKO animals. In vitro coculture experiments demonstrated that Arg1 activity in macrophages modulates microglial synaptic phagocytosis, providing evidence for macrophage–microglia interaction. These findings present unique insights into the function of Arg1 in central nervous system injury and highlight an interaction between infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia in shaping the poststroke inflammatory milieu. Our study identifies Arg1 in macrophages as a potential therapeutic target for modulating poststroke inflammation and improving functional recovery.",

However, there is another, often overlooked side to science communication—how scientists respond when questions arise about the integrity of their research. Often, the tendency has been to stay silent and wait for any controversy to pass or be resolved in professional forums. But in an age of growing, intense attacks on science, silence can be detrimental to both public trust and the careers of scientists who are under scrutiny. For better or worse, journalists, social media professionals, and the public may take a response of “no comment” as a concession that the critics are correct, so forthright communication about research questions is more urgent than ever.",

We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored. On a decadal scale, we find substantial depletion in aquifers below 50-meter depth, with only limited storm-related recovery. Our analysis underscores the need to monitor deep aquifers for a more complete assessment of total water deficits, using high-resolution tools such as seismic sensing.",

We discovered that a small variation in maternal foraging success amplified into larger changes in offspring body mass and enormous variation in first-year survival and recruitment. Worsening oceanographic conditions could shift predator population trajectories from current growth to sharp declines. As ocean integrators, wide-ranging predators could reveal impacts of future anthropogenic change on open ocean ecosystems.",

We find that the median US stream network is five times longer during annual high-flow conditions than during annual low-flow conditions. Stream networks are more dynamic in some regions than in others, driven by regional differences in both hydroclimatology and the networks’ elasticity in response to hydroclimatic forcing.",

We demonstrate global RNAPII elevations in mouse gliomas and assorted human tumors in small clinical samples and discover regional elevations corresponding to de novo HER2 amplifications punctuated by likely selective sweeps. RNAPII occupancy at S-phase-dependent histone genes correlated with WHO grade in meningiomas, accurately predicted rapid recurrence, and corresponded to whole-arm chromosome losses.

Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are principal regulators of satiety because they decrease food intake through excitatory melanocortin neuropeptides. We discovered that POMC neurons not only promote satiety in fed conditions but concomitantly switch on sugar appetite, which drives overconsumption. POMC neuron projections to the paraventricular thalamus selectively inhibited postsynaptic neurons through mu-opioid receptor signaling. This opioid circuit was strongly activated during sugar consumption, which was most notable in satiety states.

          "abstract": "Innovations in the pallium likely facilitated the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities in birds. We therefore scrutinized its cellular composition and evolution using cell type atlases from chicken, mouse, and nonavian reptiles. We found that the avian pallium shares most inhibitory neuron types with other amniotes. Whereas excitatory neuron types in amniote hippocampal regions show evolutionary conservation, those in other pallial regions have diverged. Neurons in the avian mesopallium display gene expression profiles akin to the mammalian claustrum and deep cortical layers, while certain nidopallial cell types resemble neurons in the piriform cortex. Lastly, we observed substantial gene expression convergence between the dorsally located hyperpallium and ventrally located nidopallium during late development, suggesting that topological location does not always dictate gene expression programs determining functional properties in the adult avian pallium.",

          "abstract": "The future deployment of terawatt-scale proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) technology necessitates development of an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst with low cost and long lifetime. Currently, the stability of the most active iridium (Ir) catalysts is impaired by dissolution, redeposition, detachment, and agglomeration of Ir species. Here we present a ripening-induced embedding strategy that securely embeds the Ir catalyst in a cerium oxide support. Cryogenic electron tomography and all-atom kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that synchronizing the growth rate of the support with the nucleation rate of Ir, regulated by sonication, is pivotal for successful synthesis. A PEMWE using this catalyst achieves a cell voltage of 1.72 volts at a current density of 3 amperes per square centimeter with an Ir loading of just 0.3 milligrams per square centimeter and a voltage degradation rate of 1.33 microvolts per hour, as demonstrated by a 6000-hour accelerated aging test.",

How these developmental decisions are made and what mechanisms exist to suppress differentiation toward alternative fates remains unclear. We employed in vivo CRISPR-Cas9–based perturbation sequencing to assess the role of ~40 transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modulators in T cell fate decisions. Unexpectedly, we found that knockout of the TF Klf2 resulted in aberrant differentiation to exhausted-like CD8 T cells during acute infection. KLF2 was required to suppress the exhaustion-promoting TF TOX and to enable the TF TBET to drive effector differentiation. KLF2 was also necessary to maintain a polyfunctional tumor-specific progenitor state. Thus, KLF2 provides effector CD8 T cell lineage fidelity and suppresses the exhaustion program.",

Bi 2 O 3 combusts C 2 H 2 with a first-order rate constant that is 3000 times greater than the rate constant for C 2 H 4 combustion. In successive redox cycles, the lattice O of Bi 2 O 3 can be fully replenished without discernible changes in local Bi coordination or C 2 H 2 combustion selectivity.

By comparing the enzymatic and solution reaction, we identified molecular features that provide catalysis and quantified their energetic contributions to catalysis. Serine proteases precisely position their reactants in destabilized conformers, creating a downhill energetic gradient that selectively favors the motions required for reaction while limiting off-pathway conformational states. The same catalytic features have repeatedly evolved in proteases and additional enzymes across multiple distinct structural folds. Our ensemble-function analyses revealed previously unknown catalytic features, provided quantitative models based on simple physical and chemical principles, and identified motifs recurrent in nature that may inspire enzyme design.",

Deployed on 500 hours from the SEEDLingS dataset, HARMONI generates detailed quantitative measurements of 3D human behavior previously unattainable through manual efforts or 2D methods. HARMONI identifies longitudinal trends in child-caregiver interaction, including child movement, body pose, dyadic touch, visibility, and conversational turns. The integrated visual and audio analysis further reveals multimodal trends, including associations between child conversational turns and movement. Open-sourced for large-scale analysis, HARMONI facilitates advancements in human development research. HARMONI achieves 63 to 80% consistency on key attributes with human annotators on SEEDLingS and 84 to 93% consistency on videos taken from a laboratory setting while achieving &gt;100 times savings in time.",

To investigate this, we used an advanced causal inference method to 16 diverse climatic regions in the Philippines. This method is capable of detecting nonlinear and joint effects of temperature and rainfall to dengue incidence. We found that temperature consistently increased dengue incidence throughout all the regions, while rainfall effects differed depending on the variation in dry season length, a factor previously overlooked. Specifically, our results showed that regions with low variation in dry season length experience a negative impact of rainfall on dengue incidence likely due to strong flushing effect on mosquito habitats, while regions with high variation in dry season length experience a positive impact, likely due to increased mosquito breeding sites. Our findings emphasize the need for tailored prevention strategies based on local climate conditions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.",

Microtubule reorganization supports plant survival in saline-rich soils, but the underlying molecular mechanism in tree species remains unclear. In this study, we identified a salinity stress response mechanism in hybrid poplar seedlings. This mechanism involves regulation of microtubule dynamics by the microtubule-associated protein PLASMA MEMBRANE–ASSOCIATED CATION BINDING PROTEIN 1a (PagPCaP1a). Salinity stress induced PagPCaP1a expression and phase separation of PagPCaP1a protein to form PagPCaP1a condensates in a calcium-dependent manner. The formation of PagPCaP1a condensates was partially driven by the VEEEKK motif within the carboxyl terminus of the protein, which rapidly depolymerizes microtubules under salinity stress. Our study reveals that the liquid-liquid phase separation of PagPCaP1a represents an additional regulatory layer for microtubule depolymerization, and we propose an effective strategy to manipulate the phase separation of PagPCaP1a to improve plant stress tolerance.",

However, the inherent inaccuracies of analog mechanisms create challenges in achieving high-precision solutions while maintaining low-energy consumption. This study introduces a memristive matrix equation solver that considerably accelerates solutions by performing mathematical iterations directly within an analog domain. Our approach facilitates rapid approximate solutions with a scalable circuit topology and expedites the high-precision refinement process by substantially reducing the digital-to-analog conversion overhead. We experimentally validated this methodology using a heterogeneous computing system. We performed simulations of multiple scientific problems on these circuits, including solving the diffusion equation and modeling equilibration in silicon P-N junctions. Notably, our memristive solver, combined with digital refinement, achieved software-equivalent precision (with an error of 10 −12 ). Compared to conventional digital processing units, this approach offered a 128-fold improvement in solution speed and a 160-fold reduction in energy consumption.

          "abstract": "Developing a wearable, active, dynamic face-changing mask for human camouflage and expression is a substantial challenge. Many organisms achieve camouflage and expression through skin deformation and color change. Inspired by this, we report a reprogrammable chemical fluid skin, which achieves deformation through fluids like the skin of a pufferfish and achieves color change function like the skin of a chameleon. Based on the skin, we design a soft mask that allows switching between at least eight human faces at a time. The soft mask is lightweight, thin, and fits the wearer’s head. Its actuation is silent and safe, and can realize facial switching, including facial color and shape. By wearing the soft mask, robots can show facial changes and expression modulation, and humans can change their faces as needed. Our work enables the implementation of transforming a human into other humans in the real world to achieve camouflage and expression, which, to date, exists only in people’s imagination.",

          "abstract": "Endosomes are vital cellular hubs for sorting protein cargoes. Retromer (VPS26/VPS35/VPS29) binds multiple sorting nexin (SNX) proteins on endosomal membranes, but assembly mechanisms of metazoan SNX/Retromer complexes remain elusive. We combine biochemical and biophysical approaches with AlphaFold modeling to identify a previously unidentified direct interaction between SNX27 and VARP. A full biochemical reconstitution system using purified proteins systematically tests how and when coats are recruited to membranes to generate tubules. We demonstrate and measure how specific combinations of Retromer with SNX27, ESCPE-1 (SNX2/SNX6), or both complexes, remodel membranes containing physiological cargo and phospholipids. SNX27, alone and with Retromer, remodels membranes with PI(3)P and PDZbm cargo. ESCPE-1 deforms membranes with bis-phosphoinositides and CI-MPR cargo but surprisingly does not recruit Retromer. VARP co-immunoprecipitates all coat components in cells and is required to reconstitute a proposed endosomal “supercomplex” (SNX27, ESCPE-1, and Retromer) in vitro. These data suggest VARP regulates metazoan endosomal coat assembly to promote cargo sorting out of endosomes.",

To date, model limitations have prevented quantifying climate-lightning-wildfire interactions comprehensively. We exploit advances in Earth System modeling to examine these three-way interactions and their sensitivities to idealized CO 2 forcing in 140-year simulations. Lightning sensitivity to global temperature change (+1.6 ± 0.1% per kelvin) is mitigated by compensating atmospheric effects. Global burned area sensitivity to temperature (+13.8 ± 0.3% per kelvin) is largely driven by intensified fire weather and increased biomass but marginally by lightning changes. We find a universal law characterizing regional-scale modeled fire activity and its CO 2 sensitivity, consistent with basic principles of statistical mechanics. Last, a negative climate feedback through intensified aerosol direct effect from fire emissions reaches an equivalent decrease of 0.91 ± 0.01% in CO 2 radiative forcing. However, this feedback contributes to polar amplification. Our analysis shows that climate-lightning-wildfire interactions involve multiple compensating and amplifying feedbacks, which are sensitive to anthropogenic CO 2 forcing.",

Here, we investigate changes in permafrost under net-zero and negative emissions, based on idealized emission-driven simulations using a state-of-the-art Earth system model. While acting as a net ecosystem carbon sink during most of the positive emission phase, permafrost becomes a net ecosystem carbon source just before reaching net-zero and negative emissions. Permafrost slowly recovers, especially in regions with high organic carbon content, and net ecosystem carbon loss persists until the end of simulations, resulting in a cumulative net ecosystem carbon loss of approximately 14 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in both scenarios. In addition, methane emissions increase under net-zero and negative emissions, due to the irreversibility of the inundated areas. We conclude that the permafrost ecosystem carbon loss may continue under net-zero and negative emissions, which could hinder climate change mitigation efforts.",

Here, we conceive and demonstrate shortcut to adiabatic (STA) braiding of light in three-dimensional silicon photonic chips. Our device comprises trilayer silicon waveguides embedded in the SU-8 polymer, using an STA strategy to expedite the braiding operations, resulting in compact devices that function as photonic quantum X, Y, and Z gates. We further experimentally observed non-Abelian braiding behaviors based on this STA-braiding scheme. Our work represents a compact braiding apparatus with a size reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to previous works.

We implemented a stable external field for each Ising spin as an interaction between a DOPO pulse and a group of ferromagnetically coupled auxiliary pulses. Consequently, the CIM delivered independent sets for dense graphs with up to 40,000 nodes.

Nevertheless, the inverse conjugate addition involving an α-specific nucleophilic addition remains less explored because of the electronic mismatch. In this research, we disclosed an α-specific nucleophilic addition of the nucleophiles including Py·HF, TBACl, HOR, H 2 O, H 2 18 O, RCO 2 H, and pyrazole to conjugate acceptors concurrent with a trifluoromethylation.

We determined that S. aureus evolves antibiotic resistance rapidly in diabetic mice, while resistance did not occur in nondiabetic mice over the course of infection. Diabetes-associated immune cell dysfunction plays a minor role in the emergence of resistance, while hyperglycemia plays a dominant role facilitating the expansion and takeover of resistant mutants in diabetic infections. Furthermore, vancomycin intermediate resistant isolates display a pronounced fitness defect in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice. Together, these data suggest that the diabetic infection environment represents an ideal reservoir for the emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance. Controlling the blood sugar of diabetic mice with insulin resulted in significantly decreased incidence of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus .",

Bgm1 dysregulates eIF6 localization in notochordal cells, affecting nucleocytoplasmic transport. Induced IDD in mice showed elevated nuclear eIF6 expression and reduced Bgm1 in degenerating nucleus pulposus.

Here, we critically reevaluate core assumptions of the hard-steps model through the lens of historical geobiology. Specifically, we propose an alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary singularities required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth’s surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps required for human existence, then the timing of human origins was controlled by the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history.",

Here, we explore somatic nonstop mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 Associated Protein 1 ( BAP1 ) and Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) enriched in renal cell carcinoma. For BAP1 , nonstop mutations generate an extremely long extension. Instead of proteasomal degradation, the extension decreases translation and depletes BAP1 messenger RNA from heavy polysomes. For VHL , the short extension leads to proteasomal degradation. Unexpectedly, the mutation alters the selection of the translational start site shifting VHL isoforms. We identify germline VHL nonstop mutations in patients leading to the early onset of severe disease manifestations. In summary, nonstop extension mutations inhibit the expression of renal tumor suppressor genes with pleiotropic effects on translation and protein stability.",

          "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) often leads to irreversible myocardium dysfunction, while existing therapies are palliatives that transiently alleviate the disease symptoms. Repairing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA) could reverse MIRI, which, however, requires precise drug delivery to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). To this end, we leverage cell-cell “NETwork” of neutrophils to deliver SERCA activator-loaded SR-localized nanoparticles (L-P-NPs) to the damaged myocardial cells, following a hierarchical targeting process: (i) chemotactic neutrophils deliver L-P-NPs to ischemia-reperfused heart, achieving tissue level targeting; (ii) neutrophils produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to transport L-P-NPs to injured myocardial cell, achieving cellular level targeting; (iii) L-P-NPs escort therapeutic payloads to the SR, achieving subcellular targeting. We showed that this platform profoundly restored SERCA activity, augmented cardiac function, and ameliorated adverse heart remodeling. Our study provides insight into the direct restoration of SR for the effective treatment of MIRI and other muscle diseases.",

While they are used for their ability to increase serotonergic signaling in the brain, SSRIs are also known to have a broad range of effects beyond the brain, including immune and metabolic effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are protective in animal models and humans against several infections, including sepsis and COVID-19; however, the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Here, we mechanistically link two previously described effects of the SSRI fluoxetine in mediating protection against sepsis. We show that fluoxetine-mediated protection is independent of peripheral serotonin and instead increases levels of circulating interleukin-10 (IL-10). IL-10 is necessary for protection from sepsis-induced hypertriglyceridemia, preventing cardiac effects including impairment of glucose oxidation, ectopic lipid accumulation, ventricular stretch and possibly cardiac failure. Our work reveals a beneficial “off-target” effect of fluoxetine, and reveals a protective immunometabolic defense mechanism with therapeutic potential.",

Here, we identify various polariton states via electrical bias within a monolayer of n-type MoS 2 . The MoS 2 channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting. Further, we observe a peculiar nonlinearity at intermediate power regime.",

Furthermore, we established a model to explore the role of signals from receiver plants, identifying squalene as a crucial feedback signal enhancing the cold tolerance in emitter plants by up-regulating CsCBF5 expression. Further analysis using yeast one-hybrid analysis coupled with inhibition of brassinosteroid pathways suggested that squalene-induced castasterone (CS) accumulation directly activated CsCBF5 expression modulated by CsBES1/BZR1 .

However, current nanosystems inducing cuproptosis rely on exogenous toxic copper ions, limiting the scope of biomaterials. Developing nanoplatforms that induce cuproptosis without exogenous copper holds substantial promise. Here, we engineered a two-dimensional iron (Fe) single-atom–doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) piezocatalyst (Fe-MoS 2 ) for tumor therapy. Incorporating single Fe atoms enhances MoS 2 piezoelectric polarization via charge redistribution and modulates Fe and Mo oxidation states, enabling multifaceted enzymatic activities, including peroxidase-, glutathione oxidase–, oxidase-, and catalase-like activities. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the Fe-MoS 2 nanocatalyst generates reactive oxygen species and depletes glutathione via synergistic piezocatalytic and enzyocatalytic effects, disrupting copper ion homeostasis and inducing cuproptosis, concurrently triggering ferroptosis and ferritinophagy, which collectively enhances tumor suppression. This study represents the first paradigm to introduce a copper-free piezocatalyst for initiating cuproptosis, substantially advancing the applications of cuproptosis in tumor therapy.",

Here, we construct an Earth System Model that integrates these proposed cooling mechanisms in detail. The model can reproduce the broad geologic record of ice cap expansion, allowing us to infer the primary drivers of long-term climate change. Our results indicate that recent icehouse climates required a combination of different cooling mechanisms acting simultaneously and were not driven by a single known process, potentially explaining why icehouses have been rarer than greenhouses over Earth history.",

We characterized the transcriptional response to chronic GC exposure during neural differentiation and studied the underlying gene regulatory networks by integrating single-cell transcriptomics with chromatin accessibility data. We found lasting cell type–specific changes that included autism risk genes and several transcription factors associated with neurodevelopment.

The EB disruption is accompanied by the alternations in permeability and even the breakdown of tight junctions (TJs), leading to the leakage of albumin; thus, albumin can serve as a biomarker for EB disruption. Herein, we develop an albumin-specific, covalently tagged near-infrared II (NIR-II) dye, with its high selectivity for endogenous albumin, for targeted imaging EB disruption. Our albumin-tagging dye serves as a chromophore to construct NIR-II fluorescent proteins in situ, with substantially improved brightness. Thus, through in situ dye tagging of endogenous albumin as the efficient “targeting agent,” we can precisely image disruptions in various endothelial barriers. Unlike the traditional exogenous targeting agents (e.g., dye-labeled antibodies) with enzymatic degradation or immune system capture issues, in situ albumin tagging demonstrates superhigh performance for targeted imaging.",

We used computational methods to identify 149 sites across the HIV-1 clade B genome under HLA-II–associated selection. Functional assays, including activation-induced intracellular cytokine staining and enzyme-linked immunospot for interferon-γ, revealed diverse mechanisms of HIV-1 adaptation to HLA-II–associated immune pressure, ranging from loss to sustained antigen recognition. T cell receptor and RNA sequencing demonstrated variable clonotype overlap of T cell clones to recognize adapted versus non-adapted peptides, with cells targeting adapted peptides exhibiting a dysfunctional transcriptomic state. Moreover, incorporating HLA-II–associated adaptation strengthened the correlation between Gag-specific viral adaptation and poor disease outcomes.

Simulations for two Cr(V) coordination compounds under this framework show a marked improvement in accuracy and demonstrate that relaxation in spin-1/2 molecules is enabled by virtual transitions to molecular excited states with energy approaching 20,000 cm –1 .

We studied circadian clocks of blind cave spiders and their sighted relatives. In the field, cave spiders exhibit low per expression and maintain constant activity levels. Curiously, their clocks are not permanently lost; exposure to monochromatic blue light restores both circadian gene expression and behavioral rhythms. Conversely, blocking blue light in sighted relatives induces an arrhythmic “cave phenotype.” Our RNA interference experiments suggest that clock genes regulate the rhythmicity of the huddle response, establishing a link between circadian gene networks and this behavioral rhythm. We demonstrate that circadian regulation is readily toggled and may play a latent role, even in constant darkness. Overall, our study expands understanding of circadian clock variations and paves the way for future research on the maintenance of silent phenotypes.",

We show that in Arabidopsis mur1 mutant, CWI defects from compromising dimerization of RG-II pectin, a key component of cell wall, attenuate the expression of auxin response factors ARF7-ARF19 . As a result, polar auxin transport components are misexpressed, disrupting auxin response asymmetry, leading to defective apical hook development. Accordingly, mur1 hook defects are suppressed by enhancing ARF7 expression. In addition, expression of brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes is down-regulated in mur1 mutant, and supplementing brassinosteroid or enhancing brassinosteroid signaling suppresses mur1 hook defects. Intriguingly, brassinosteroid enhances RG-II dimerization, showing hormonal feedback to the cell wall. Our results thus reveal a previously unrecognized link between cell wall defects from reduced RG-II dimerization and growth regulation mediated via modulation of auxin-brassinosteroid pathways in early seedling development.",

Mechanical force and auxiliary binding partners converge to stabilize the cadherin-catenin complex’s inherently weak binding to actin filaments (F-actin) through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that afadin’s coiled-coil (CC) domain and vinculin synergistically enhance the cadherin-catenin complex’s F-actin engagement. The cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of an E-cadherin–β-catenin–αE-catenin–vinculin–afadin-CC supra-complex bound to F-actin reveals that afadin-CC bridges adjacent αE-catenin actin-binding domains along the filament, stabilizing flexible αE-catenin segments implicated in mechanical regulation. These cooperative binding contacts promote the formation of supra-complex clusters along F-actin. Additionally, cryo-EM variability analysis links supra-complex binding along individual F-actin strands to nanoscale filament curvature, a deformation mode associated with cytoskeletal forces. Collectively, this work elucidates a mechanistic framework by which vinculin and afadin tune cadherin-catenin complex–cytoskeleton coupling to support AJ function across varying mechanical regimes.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive immunity is critical in eliminating tumors, but cancer-intrinsic factors can subvert this function. Melanoma antigen-A4 (MAGE-A4), a cancer-testis antigen, is expressed in solid tumors and correlates with poor survival, but its role in tumorigenesis and antitumor immunity remains unclear. We found that expression of MAGE-A4 was highly associated with the loss of PTEN , a tumor suppressor, in human non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Here, we show that constitutive expression of human MAGE-A4 with Pten loss in mouse airway epithelia results in metastatic adenocarcinoma. Tumors showed distinct enrichment in IgA + CD138 + CXCR4 + plasma cells (PCs) and increased expression of CXCL12 in endothelial cells. Consistently, human NSCLC expressing MAGE-A4 showed increased CD138 + IgA + PCs surrounding tumors. Abrogation of PCs decreased tumor burden, increased activated T cell infiltration, and reduced CD163 + CD206 + macrophages in the MAGE-A4–induced lung tumors. These findings suggest MAGE-A4 promotes NSCLC tumorigenesis, in part, through the recruitment and retention of IgA + PCs in the lungs.",

          "abstract": "Regeneration is a unique feature of postembryonic development extensively observed in plants. The capacity to induce regeneration exogenously is limited and usually confined to meristematic-like tissues. We show that bacterial cellulose (BC), but not other structurally similar matrixes, induces postwounding regeneration in nonmeristematic plant tissues via a distinctive route to callus-mediated regenerative programs. The BC-specific program involves cytokinin operating concurrently with strongly activated plant biotic response genes to induce plant regeneration. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, normally associated with defense responses, is sustained upon BC application, involving a network of tightly interconnected transcription factors, where WRKY8, known for regulating stress responses, shows a clustering and hierarchical prevalence. WRKY8 regulates BC-mediated plant regeneration and ROS homeostasis, including superoxide anion accumulation, to potentially promote cell proliferation after wounding. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the cytokinin- and ROS-associated defense responses can be targeted by BC application to promote plant wound regeneration through alternative regenerative programs.",

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of abnormal α-synuclein (α-syn) within dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Despite excessive accumulation of α-syn being key to the pathogenesis of PD, the mechanisms governing its clearance remain elusive. In this study, we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system plays a crucial role in capturing and facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated α-syn. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin was found to promote K27-linked polyubiquitination of α-syn, directing it to the endosome for subsequent degradation. We showed that the deletion of the Listerin gene exacerbates the neurodegenerative progression in a mouse model of PD, whereas the overexpression of Listerin effectively mitigates disease progression in PD mice. Consequently, our study reveals a mechanism for α-syn degradation and identifies Listerin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.",

To elucidate the role of proteases in cancer, it is particularly important to consider single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that affect the active site of proteases, thereby influencing cleavage specificity, substrate processing, and thus cancer cell behavior. To facilitate systematic studies, we here present a targeted approach to determine the impact of cancer-associated protease variants (TACAP). Starting with the semiautomated identification of potential specificity-modulating SNVs, our workflow comprises mass spectrometry–based cleavage specificity profiling and substrate identification, localization, and inhibitor studies, followed by functional analyses investigating cancer cell properties. To demonstrate the feasibility of TACAP, we analyzed the meprin β R238Q variant. This amino acid exchange R238Q leads to a loss of meprin β’s characteristic cleavage preference for acidic amino acids at P1′ position, accompanied with changes in substrate pool and inhibitor affinity compared to meprin β wild type.",

In this study, we established a streamlined and diverse toolbox for methods that predict amino acid probabilities inside the Rosetta software framework that allows for the side-by-side comparison of these models. Subsequently, existing protein fitness landscapes were used to benchmark novel ML methods in realistic protein design settings. We focused on the traditional problems of protein design: sampling and scoring. A major finding of our study is that ML approaches are better at purging the sampling space from deleterious mutations. Nevertheless, scoring resulting mutations without model fine-tuning showed no clear improvement over scoring with Rosetta.

Rituximab in vasculitis exacerbates neutralization deficits over standard immunosuppressive therapy, although impairment resolves over time since dosing. We observed discordance between detectable IgG binding and neutralizing activity specifically in the context of rituximab use, with high proportions of individuals showing reasonable IgG titer but no neutralization. ADCC response was more frequently detectable compared to neutralization in the context of rituximab, indicating that a notable proportion of binding antibodies are non-neutralizing.

Phylogenetics identified the fungus as a previously undescribed species, Serendipita cyanobacteriicola , closely related to endophytes, and the cyanobacterium belongs to the family Coleofasciculaceae, representing a genus and species not yet classified, Symbiothallus taiwanensis . These thalli exhibit nitrogen-fixing activity similar to mosses but lower than cyanolichens. Both symbiotic partners are distinct from known lichen-forming symbionts, uncovering a phylogenetically and morphologically unprecedented thallus-forming fungus-cyanobacterium symbiosis.

Understanding and controlling this phenomenon at the atomic scale, in particular in nanoscale systems, is crucial. In this study, we used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with a nickelocene molecule to sense the spin of a hydrogen-loaded nanoscale Co island grown on Cu(111). Magnetic exchange maps obtained from the molecular tip revealed the presence of a hydrogen superstructure and a 90° rotation of the magnetization compared to the pristine island. Ab initio calculations corroborate these observations, indicating that hydrogen hybridization with Co atoms on the island surface drives the spin reorientation of the island. This reorientation is further reinforced by hydrogen penetration into the island that locates at the Co/Cu interface. However, the subsurface sensitivity of the magnetic exchange maps indicates that this effect is limited.

That IgA may amplify postimmune IgG production is suggested by the impaired IgG response to pneumococcal vaccines in some IgA-deficient patients. Here, we found that antipneumococcal but not total IgG production was impaired in mice with IgA deficiency. The positive effect of gut IgA on antipneumococcal IgG responses started very early in life and could implicate gut bacteria, as these responses were attenuated in germ-free mice recolonized with gut microbes from IgA-deficient donors. IgA could exert this effect by constraining the systemic translocation of gut antigens, which was associated with chronic immune activation, including T cell overexpression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibitory receptor may attenuate antipneumococcal IgG production by causing B cell hyporesponsiveness, which improved upon anti–PD-1 treatment.

Recently demonstrated using phonon polaritons in twisted van der Waals (vdW) layers of α-MoO 3 , it offers unprecedented possibilities for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

In this work, we introduce a previously unexplored canalization phenomenon in a single-thin vdW layer (α-MoO 3 ) interfaced with a substrate exhibiting a given negative permittivity. This enables a proof-of-concept application of polariton canalization: super-resolution nanoimaging (~λ 0 /220). Canalization-based imaging transcends conventional projection constraints, allowing the super-resolution images to be obtained at any desired location in the image plane. This versatility stems from the synergetic manipulation of three key parameters: incident frequency, rotation angle of the thin vdW layer, and thickness.

This tension is illustrated at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where two motor inputs that differ in structural and functional properties coinnervate most muscles to coordinate locomotion. To stabilize NMJ activity, motor neurons augment neurotransmitter release following diminished postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). How these distinct inputs contribute to PHP plasticity remains enigmatic. We have used a botulinum neurotoxin to selectively silence each input and resolve their roles in PHP, demonstrating that PHP is input specific: Chronic (genetic) PHP selectively targets the tonic MN-Ib, where active zone remodeling enhances Ca 2+ influx to promote increased glutamate release. In contrast, acute (pharmacological) PHP selectively increases vesicle pools to potentiate phasic MN-Is. Thus, distinct homeostatic modulations in active zone nanoarchitecture, vesicle pools, and Ca 2+ influx collaborate to enable input-specific PHP expression.",

However, their practical use is limited by the inability to deliver high forces at low voltages, primarily due to a lack of understanding of their mechanics. We introduce a novel deformable body fracture mechanics approach and high-resolution strain field imaging to reveal that nonuniform stress distributions cause EA clutches to fail through delamination and crack propagation. Using this insight, we developed EA clutches sustaining 22 newtons over 1 square centimeter at 100 volts, achieving the highest stress per voltage among similar clutches. This was achieved by incorporating a soft interlayer and peeling stopper for uniform stress distribution and mitigating the failure modes. These EA clutches were integrated into a lightweight ring-based wearable system for finger rehabilitation and haptics. Our findings lay the groundwork for designing low-voltage, high-performance EA clutches for next-generation motion and force control applications.",
