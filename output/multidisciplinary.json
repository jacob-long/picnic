          "abstract": "Microscopy and crystallography are two essential experimental methodologies for advancing modern science. They complement one another, with microscopy typically relying on lenses to image the local structures of samples, and crystallography using diffraction to determine the global atomic structure of crystals. Over the past two decades, computational microscopy, encompassing coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) and ptychography, has advanced rapidly, unifying microscopy and crystallography to overcome their limitations. Here, I review the innovative developments in CDI and ptychography, which achieve exceptional imaging capabilities across nine orders of magnitude in length scales, from resolving atomic structures in materials at sub-ångstrom resolution to quantitative phase imaging of centimetre-sized tissues, using the same principle and similar computational algorithms. These methods have been applied to determine the 3D atomic structures of crystal defects and amorphous materials, visualize oxygen vacancies in high-temperature superconductors and capture ultrafast dynamics. They have also been used for nanoscale imaging of magnetic, quantum and energy materials, nanomaterials, integrated circuits and biological specimens. By harnessing fourth-generation synchrotron radiation, X-ray-free electron lasers, high-harmonic generation, electron microscopes, optical microscopes, cutting-edge detectors and deep learning, CDI and ptychography are poised to make even greater contributions to multidisciplinary sciences in the years to come.",

          "abstract": "The low reduction potentials required for the reduction of dinitrogen (N2) render metal-based nitrogen-fixation catalysts vulnerable to irreversible damage by dioxygen (O2)1,2,3. Such O2 sensitivity represents a major conundrum for the enzyme nitrogenase, as a large fraction of nitrogen-fixing organisms are either obligate aerobes or closely associated with O2-respiring organisms to support the high energy demand of catalytic N2 reduction4. To counter O2 damage to nitrogenase, diazotrophs use O2 scavengers, exploit compartmentalization or maintain high respiration rates to minimize intracellular O2 concentrations4,5,6,7,8. A last line of damage control is provided by the ‘conformational protection’ mechanism9, in which a [2Fe:2S] ferredoxin-family protein termed FeSII (ref. 10) is activated under O2 stress to form an O2-resistant complex with the nitrogenase component proteins11,12. Despite previous insights, the molecular basis for the conformational O2 protection of nitrogenase and the mechanism of FeSII activation are not understood. Here we report the structural characterization of the Azotobacter vinelandii FeSII–nitrogenase complex by cryo-electron microscopy. Our studies reveal a core complex consisting of two molybdenum–iron proteins (MoFePs), two iron proteins (FePs) and one FeSII homodimer, which polymerize into extended filaments. In this three-protein complex, FeSII mediates an extensive network of interactions with MoFeP and FeP to position their iron–sulphur clusters in catalytically inactive but O2-protected states. The architecture of the FeSII–nitrogenase complex is confirmed by solution studies, which further indicate that the activation of FeSII involves an oxidation-induced conformational change.",

          "abstract": "Our understanding of type 2 immunity has undergone a substantial transformation in recent years, revealing previously unknown functions. Beyond its canonical role in defence against parasitic helminth infections, type 2 immunity safeguards the host through additional mechanisms, including the suppression of excessive type 1 immune responses, regulation of tissue repair and maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis. However, unlike type 1 immune responses, type 2 immunity is perceived as a potential promoter of tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence challenges this perspective, painting a more nuanced picture in which type 2 immunity might protect against or even actively suppress tumour growth and progression. In this Review, we explore discoveries that highlight the potential of type 2 immunity in reshaping the landscape of cancer immunotherapies.",

          "authors": "Peter M. Visscher, Christopher Gyngell, Loic Yengo, Julian Savulescu",
          "abstract": "Polygenic genome editing in human embryos and germ cells is predicted to become feasible in the next three decades. Several recent books and academic papers have outlined the ethical concerns raised by germline genome editing and the opportunities that it may present 1–3 . To date, no attempts have been made to predict the consequences of altering specific variants associated with polygenic diseases. In this Analysis, we show that polygenic genome editing could theoretically yield extreme reductions in disease susceptibility. For example, editing a relatively small number of genomic variants could make a substantial difference to an individual’s risk of developing coronary artery disease, Alzheimer’s disease, major depressive disorder, diabetes and schizophrenia. Similarly, large changes in risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure, could, in theory, be achieved by polygenic editing. Although heritable polygenic editing (HPE) is still speculative, we completed calculations to discuss the underlying ethical issues. Our modelling demonstrates how the putatively positive consequences of gene editing at an individual level may deepen health inequalities. Further, as single or multiple gene variants can increase the risk of some diseases while decreasing that of others, HPE raises ethical challenges related to pleiotropy and genetic diversity. We conclude by arguing for a collectivist perspective on the ethical issues raised by HPE, which accounts for its effects on individuals, their families, communities and society 4 .",

          "abstract": "Neurons in the hippocampus are correlated with different variables, including space, time, sensory cues, rewards and actions, in which the extent of tuning depends on ongoing task demands1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or whether a more generic computation can account for these observations9. Here, to disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice in which space, auditory tones, rewards and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans and modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans towards deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.",

          "abstract": "The concept of non-Hermiticity has expanded the understanding of band topology, leading to the emergence of counter-intuitive phenomena. An example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)1,2,3,4,5,6,7, which involves the concentration of eigenstates at the boundary. However, despite the potential insights that can be gained from high-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum systems in areas such as curved space8,9,10, high-order topological phases11,12 and black holes13,14, the realization of this effect in high dimensions remains unexplored. Here we create a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian topological band for ultracold fermions in spin–orbit-coupled optical lattices with tunable dissipation, which exhibits the NHSE. We first experimentally demonstrate pronounced nonzero spectral winding numbers in the complex energy plane with nonzero dissipation, which establishes the existence of 2D skin effect. Furthermore, we observe the real-space dynamical signature of NHSE in real space by monitoring the centre of mass motion of atoms. Finally, we also demonstrate that a pair of exceptional points are created in the momentum space, connected by an open-ended bulk Fermi arc, in contrast to closed loops found in Hermitian systems. The associated exceptional points emerge and shift with increasing dissipation, leading to the formation of the Fermi arc. Our work sets the stage for further investigation into simulating non-Hermitian physics in high dimensions and paves the way for understanding the interplay of quantum statistics with NHSE.",

Recently, Chen et al.2 suggested that KLHL22-dependent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the GATOR1 component DEPDC5 mediates mTORC1 activation by amino acids2. Here we report that the antibody central to the conclusions of Chen et al.2 neither sensitively nor specifically detects endogenous DEPDC5, and we determine, using validated antibodies and endogenously tagged cell lines, that the stability of DEPDC5 is insensitive to amino acid availability, proteasome activity and KLHL22 loss of function. These results call into question the conclusions of Chen et al.2 and indicate that alternative mechanisms convey nutrient availability to mTORC1.",

However, to what extent host responses balance the physiological effects of microbiota-derived metabolites remains unclear9,10. Here, using untargeted metabolomics of mouse tissues, we identified a family of BA–methylcysteamine (BA–MCY) conjugates that are abundant in the intestine and dependent on vanin 1 (VNN1), a pantetheinase highly expressed in intestinal tissues. This host-dependent MCY conjugation inverts BA function in the hepatobiliary system. Whereas microbiota-derived free BAs function as agonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and negatively regulate BA production, BA–MCYs act as potent antagonists of FXR and promote expression of BA biosynthesis genes in vivo. Supplementation with stable-isotope-labelled BA–MCY increased BA production in an FXR-dependent manner, and BA–MCY supplementation in a mouse model of hypercholesteraemia decreased lipid accumulation in the liver, consistent with BA–MCYs acting as intestinal FXR antagonists. The levels of BA–MCY were reduced in microbiota-deficient mice and restored by transplantation of human faecal microbiota. Dietary intervention with inulin fibre further increased levels of both free BAs and BA–MCY levels, indicating that BA–MCY production by the host is regulated by levels of microbiota-derived free BAs. We further show that diverse BA–MCYs are also present in human serum. Together, our results indicate that BA–MCY conjugation by the host balances host-dependent and microbiota-dependent metabolic pathways that regulate FXR-dependent physiology.",

Computational models of transcription lack generalizability to accurately extrapolate to unseen cell types and conditions. Here we introduce GET (general expression transformer), an interpretable foundation model designed to uncover regulatory grammars across 213 human fetal and adult cell types1,2. Relying exclusively on chromatin accessibility data and sequence information, GET achieves experimental-level accuracy in predicting gene expression even in previously unseen cell types3. GET also shows remarkable adaptability across new sequencing platforms and assays, enabling regulatory inference across a broad range of cell types and conditions, and uncovers universal and cell-type-specific transcription factor interaction networks. We evaluated its performance in prediction of regulatory activity, inference of regulatory elements and regulators, and identification of physical interactions between transcription factors and found that it outperforms current models4 in predicting lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay readout5,6. In fetal erythroblasts7, we identified distal (greater than 1 Mbp) regulatory regions that were missed by previous models, and, in B cells, we identified a lymphocyte-specific transcription factor–transcription factor interaction that explains the functional significance of a leukaemia risk predisposing germline mutation8,9,10. In sum, we provide a generalizable and accurate model for transcription together with catalogues of gene regulation and transcription factor interactions, all with cell type specificity.",

To date, comprehensive global assessments of extinction risk have not included any speciose groups primarily living in freshwaters. Consequently, data from predominantly terrestrial tetrapods 4,5 are used to guide environmental policy 6 and conservation prioritization 7 , whereas recent proposals for target setting in freshwaters use abiotic factors 8–13 . However, there is evidence 14–17 that such data are insufficient to represent the needs of freshwater species and achieve biodiversity goals 18,19 . Here we present the results of a multi-taxon global freshwater fauna assessment for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species covering 23,496 decapod crustaceans, fishes and odonates, finding that one-quarter are threatened with extinction. Prevalent threats include pollution, dams and water extraction, agriculture and invasive species, with overharvesting also driving extinctions. We also examined the degree of surrogacy of both threatened tetrapods and freshwater abiotic factors (water stress and nitrogen) for threatened freshwater species. Threatened tetrapods are good surrogates when prioritizing sites to maximize rarity-weighted richness, but poorer when prioritizing based on the most range-restricted species. However, they are much better surrogates than abiotic factors, which perform worse than random. Thus, although global priority regions identified for tetrapod conservation are broadly reflective of those for freshwater faunas, given differences in key threats and habitats, meeting the needs of tetrapods cannot be assumed sufficient to conserve freshwater species at local scales.",

          "authors": "Shahar Gvirtzman, David S. Kammer, Mokhtar Adda-Bedia, Jay Fineberg",
          "abstract": "Frictional motion is mediated by rapidly propagating ruptures that detach the ensemble of contacts forming the frictional interface between contacting bodies1,2,3,4,5,6,7. These ruptures are similar to shear cracks. When this process takes place in natural faults, these rapid ruptures are essentially earthquakes8,9. Although fracture mechanics describe the rapid motion of these singular objects, the nucleation process that creates them is not understood10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Here we fully describe the nucleation process by extending fracture mechanics to explicitly incorporate finite interface widths (which are generally ignored20,21). We show, experimentally and theoretically, that slow steady creep ensues at a well-defined stress threshold. Moreover, as slowly creeping patches approach the interface width, a topological transition takes place in which these creeping patches smoothly transition to the rapid fracture that is described by classical fracture mechanics22,23,24,25,26. Apart from its relevance to fracture and material strength, this new picture of rupture nucleation dynamics is directly relevant to earthquake nucleation dynamics; slow, aseismic rupture must always precede rapid seismic rupture (so long as the initial defect in the interface is localized in both spatial dimensions). The theory may provide a new framework for understanding how and when earthquakes nucleate.",

Here we collected paired single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data from 38 human neocortical samples encompassing both the prefrontal cortex and the primary visual cortex. These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication. This atlas enables us to catalogue cell-type-specific, age-specific and area-specific gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining single-cell profiling, progenitor purification and lineage-tracing experiments, we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis transition. We identified a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype—tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs)—that is responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes. Notably, most glioblastoma cells resemble Tri-IPCs at the transcriptomic level, suggesting that cancer cells hijack developmental processes to enhance growth and heterogeneity. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we created a disease-risk map highlighting enriched risk associated with autism spectrum disorder in second-trimester intratelencephalic neurons.

We describe cell-state-specific gene-regulatory logic that involves transcription factors, putative cis -regulatory elements and target genes associated with disease and immunity. We show that a rare cell population emerges at the nexus of immune-active hotspots, which we designate as primary immune responder (PRIMER) cells. PRIMER cells have non-canonical immune signatures, exemplified by the expression and genome accessibility of a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, GT-3A, which contributes to plant immunity against bacterial pathogens. PRIMER cells are surrounded by another cell state (bystander) that activates genes for long-distance cell-to-cell immune signalling. Together, our findings suggest that interactions between these cell states propagate immune responses across the leaf. Our molecularly defined single-cell spatiotemporal atlas provides functional and regulatory insights into immune cell states in plants.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease whose prognosis and treatment as defined by the expression of three receptors—oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; encoded by ERBB2)—is insufficient to capture the full spectrum of clinical outcomes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Previously, we demonstrated that transcriptional and genomic profiles define eleven integrative subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes, including four ER+ subtypes with increased risk of relapse decades after diagnosis1,2. Here, to determine whether these subtypes reflect distinct evolutionary histories, interactions with the immune system and pathway dependencies, we established a meta-cohort of 1,828 breast tumours spanning pre-invasive, primary invasive and metastatic disease with whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing. We demonstrate that breast tumours fall along a continuum constrained by three genomic archetypes. The ER+ high-risk integrative subgroup is characterized by complex focal amplifications, similar to HER2+ tumours, including cyclic extrachromosomal DNA amplifications induced by ER through R-loop formation and APOBEC3B-editing, which arise in pre-invasive lesions. By contrast, triple-negative tumours exhibit genome-wide instability and tandem duplications and are enriched for homologous repair deficiency-like signatures, whereas ER+ typical-risk tumours are largely genomically stable. These genomic archetypes, which replicate in an independent cohort of 2,659 primary tumours, are established early during tumorigenesis, sculpt the tumour microenvironment and are conserved in metastatic disease. These complex structural alterations contribute to replication stress and immune evasion, and persist throughout tumour evolution, unveiling potential vulnerabilities.",

          "abstract": "Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising for high-energy-density rechargeable batteries1,2,3. However, Li dendrites formed by the reaction between highly active Li and non-aqueous electrolytes lead to safety concerns and rapid capacity decay4,5,6,7. Developing a reliable solid–electrolyte interphase is critical for realizing high-rate and long-life LMBs, but remains technically challenging4,8. Here we demonstrate that adding excess m-Li2ZrF6 (monoclinic) nanoparticles to a commercial LiPF6-containing carbonate electrolyte of LMBs facilitates the release of abundant ZrF62– ions into the electrolyte driven by the applied voltage, converting to t-Li2ZrF6 (trigonal) and creating a stable solid–electrolyte interphase in situ with high Li-ion conductivity. Computational and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the in situ formation of the t-Li2ZrF6-rich solid–electrolyte interphase markedly enhanced Li-ion transfer and suppressed the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, LMBs assembled with LiFePO4 cathodes (areal loading, 1.8/2.2 mAh cm−2), three-dimensional Li–carbon anodes (50-µm-thick Li) and Li2ZrF6-based electrolyte displayed greatly improved cycling stability with high capacity retention (>80.0%) after 3,000 cycles (1C/2C rate). This achievement represents leading performance and, thus, delivers a reliable Li2ZrF6-based electrolyte for durable LMBs under practical high-rate conditions.",

          "abstract": "Piezoelectric materials directly convert between electrical and mechanical energies. They are used as transducers in applications such as nano-positioning and ultrasound imaging. Improving the properties of these devices requires piezoelectric materials capable of delivering a large longitudinal strain on the application of an electric field. A large longitudinal strain of more than 1% is generally anticipated in suitably oriented single crystals of specific compositions of ferroelectric materials1. Polycrystalline piezoceramics typically show a longitudinal strain of approximately 0.2–0.4%. We demonstrate that when the thickness of a polycrystalline piezoceramic is reduced to such an extent that a large fraction of the grains are in the triaxial–biaxal crossover regime, the domain-switching fraction increases considerably. If the positive and the negative surfaces of the piezoceramic respond to electric fields symmetrically, as in the classical PbZrxTixO3, a longitudinal strain of approximately 1% can be achieved in a 0.2 mm disc of the morphotropic phase boundary composition (a 300% increase from a thickness of 0.7 mm). We show that oxygen vacancies in piezoceramics cause asymmetrical switching at the positive and negative surfaces, which causes thin piezoceramics to bend. We expect these findings will encourage further engineering of these mechanisms across different piezoelectric material systems, opening new applications for electromechanical actuation.",

Symmetric ZGNRs typically show antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states1,2. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains11, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the one-dimensional limit3,12, but also establishes a long-sought-after carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics1,2,3,9,13. Here we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs (JGNRs) with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb’s theorem and topological classification theory14,15,16, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introducing a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks the structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin-symmetry breaking. Three Z-shaped precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the ‘defective’ edge. Characterization by scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of JGNRs with a ferromagnetic ground-state localized along the pristine zigzag edge.",

Many advances in this field still require specific directing groups to achieve the necessary activity and selectivity. Developing C–H activation reactions directed by native functional groups is essential for their broad application in synthesis1. Over the past decade, several generations of bifunctional ligands developed have enabled C(sp3)–H activation reactions of free carboxylic acids2, free aliphatic amines3, native amides4,5 and alcohols6. However, an effective catalyst for ketones and carboxylic esters remains to be realized. Here we report diverse methyl β-C−H functionalizations, including intermolecular arylation, hydroxylation and intramolecular C(sp3)–H/C(sp2)–H coupling of ketones and carboxylic esters with a monoprotected amino neutral amide (MPANA) ligand. The in situ generation of cationic Pd(II) complexes by the combination MPANA ligand and HBF4 is crucial for achieving the reactivity. The compatibility of these reactions with cyclic ketones and lactams provides a method to access spirocyclic and fused ring systems. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory studies support the role of cationic Pd complexes with MPANA ligands in enhancing catalyst–substrate affinity and facilitating the C−H cleavage step.",

It forms a complex with a small ferredoxin, FeSII (ref. 2) or the ‘Shethna protein II’3, which acts as an O2 sensor and associates with the two component proteins of nitrogenase when its [2Fe:2S] cluster becomes oxidized4,5. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the protective ternary complex of the catalytic subunit of Mo-nitrogenase, its cognate reductase and the FeSII protein, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The dimeric FeSII protein associates with two copies of each component to assemble a 620 kDa core complex that then polymerizes into large, filamentous structures. This complex is catalytically inactive, but the enzyme components are quickly released and reactivated upon oxygen depletion. The first step in complex formation is the association of FeSII with the more O2-sensitive Fe protein component of nitrogenase during sudden oxidative stress. The action of this small ferredoxin represents a straightforward means of protection from O2 that may be crucial for the maintenance of recombinant nitrogenase in food crops.",

Here we report proximity ferroelectricity in wurtzite ferroelectric heterostructures. In the present case, the non-ferroelectric layers are AlN and ZnO, whereas the ferroelectric layers are Al1−xBxN, Al1−xScxN and Zn1−xMgxO. The layered structures include nitride–nitride, oxide–oxide and nitride–oxide stacks that feature two-layer (asymmetric) and three-layer (symmetric) configurations1,2,3. Ferroelectric switching in both layers is validated by multimodal characterization methods, including polarization hysteresis, anisotropic chemical etching, second harmonic generation, piezo response force microscopy, electromechanical testing and atomic resolution polarization orientation imaging in real space by scanning transmission electron microscopy. We present a physical switching model in which antipolar nuclei originate in the ferroelectric layer and propagate towards the internal non-ferroelectric interface. The domain wall leading edge produces elastic and electric fields that extend beyond the interface at close proximity, reducing the switching barrier in the non-ferroelectric layer, and allowing complete domain propagation without breakdown. Density functional theory calculations of polymorph energies, reversal barriers and domain wall energies support this model. Proximity ferroelectricity enables polarization reversal in wurtzites without the chemical or structural disorder that accompanies elemental substitution, opening new questions and opportunities regarding interface-based ferroelectricity.",

          "abstract": "The abundance and sequence of satellite DNA at and around centromeres is evolving rapidly despite the highly conserved and essential process through which the centromere directs chromosome inheritance1,2,3. The impact of such rapid evolution is unclear. Here we find that sequence-dependent DNA shape dictates packaging of pericentromeric satellites in female meiosis through a conserved DNA-shape-recognizing chromatin architectural protein, high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1)4,5. Pericentromeric heterochromatin in two closely related mouse species, M. musculus and M. spretus, forms on divergent satellites that differ by both density of narrow DNA minor grooves and HMGA1 recruitment. HMGA1 binds preferentially to M. musculus satellites, and depletion in M. musculus oocytes causes massive stretching of pericentromeric satellites, disruption of kinetochore organization and delays in bipolar spindle assembly. In M. musculus × spretus hybrid oocytes, HMGA1 depletion disproportionately impairs M. musculus pericentromeres and microtubule attachment to their kinetochores. Thus, DNA shape affects both pericentromere packaging and the segregation machinery. We propose that rapid evolution of centromere and pericentromere DNA does not disrupt these essential processes when the satellites adopt DNA shapes recognized by conserved architectural proteins (such as HMGA1). By packaging these satellites, architectural proteins become part of the centromeric and pericentromeric chromatin, suggesting an evolutionary strategy that lowers the cost of megabase-scale satellite expansion.",

          "authors": "Sarah Wild",
          "abstract": "Credit: David Attie/Getty\n\nIn 2003, Wendy Dossett chaired an international symposium at a UK university. “I don’t remember chairing it. I know that I did, but I don’t remember anything that happened,” she says.\n\nAt the time, she did not think that she had an alcohol problem. “I thought I could not possibly be an alcoholic — I had a PhD, I was holding down a high-pressure academic job, I didn’t fit the image of what an alcoholic is,” she remembers. It took 2 years for her to seek treatment, and another 14 years before she told her employers at the University of Chester, UK, where she worked in religious studies, that she was in recovery.\n\nScience careers and mental health\n\nDossett is not alone, but academics who struggle with substance-use disorders, or who are recovering from them, are often hidden from view. These conditions affect a person’s brain and behaviour as a result of uncontrolled use of alcohol, prescription medications or illegal drugs (see ‘What is drug or alcohol-use disorder?’).\n\nEvidence shows that substance-use disorders are chronic diseases — involving changes to the brain’s systems for reward, stress and control — rather than a choice (see go.nature.com/4tbcczf).\n\nDependency disorders are present in people of all professions, but academics — who often set their own schedules and work regularly in isolation — are often good at concealing them, or might not realize that they have a problem. Moreover, the competitive environment and concerns about professional reputations, along with a fear of being fired, deter many from disclosing their illness. But some institutions are pioneering programmes to support staff.\n\nWhat is drug or alcohol-use disorder?\n\nEd Day, a clinical psychiatrist and researcher at the University of Birmingham, UK, says that there is a spectrum of drug and alcohol use. With alcohol, for example, at one end of the spectrum are people who do not drink at all, and at the other are those with alcohol-use disorder or dependence. The key features of dependence, he says, are “loss of control of use, strong craving, tolerance [reduced sensitivity to alcohol’s effects], you get withdrawal symptoms and it is starting to cause considerable problems in your life”.\n\nThe World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases and the American Psychiatric Association both use a list of 11 criteria or symptoms to diagnose alcohol- or substance-use disorders, including harmful use, experiencing cravings, increased tolerance or withdrawal symptoms such as shakiness, nausea or restlessness. A diagnosis of mild substance-use disorder requires two to three symptoms from the list.\n\nTim Brennan, vice-president for medical and academic affairs at the American College of Academic Addiction Medicine, who is based in New York City, notes that the spectrum of problematic substance use varies with geography and culture. “Unhealthy drinking in the United States has a different definition than unhealthy drinking in Canada, and a different definition to the United Kingdom,” he says.\n\nNevertheless, says Victoria Burns, who studies homelessness, stigma, addiction and recovery at the University of Calgary in Canada, substance-use disorders affect people everywhere.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with a substance-use disorder, you can find help and resources at these websites.\n\nInternational:\n\nhttps://findahelpline.com/topics/substance-use\n\nUnited States:\n\nhttps://go.nature.com/3vm4txd\n\nhttps://go.nature.com/3dxhkjr\n\nhttps://www.samhsa.gov/find-help\n\nCanada:\n\nhttps://go.nature.com/4raf7c3\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n\nhttps://go.nature.com/4ggtnsu\n\nhttps://go.nature.com/3tzn8zw\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that, in 2024, 400 million people worldwide, or 7% of the global population aged 15 and over, were living with alcohol-use disorder. Meanwhile, a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime states that, in 2022, more than 64 million people had drug-use disorders, and yet only one in 11 were receiving treatment. But there is little information on prevalence among faculty members.\n\nOne reason for this, says Marissa Edwards, an organizational psychology researcher at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, is that universities and academics are uncomfortable talking about these disorders. “Addiction is still one of those last taboo topics that is not really shared or discussed,” she says.\n\n‘No one is talking about it’\n\nWhen Victoria Burns told her dean at the University of Calgary in Canada that she was in recovery from alcohol-use disorder, he said she was only the second staff member to come forward in his 26 years in the position.\n\n“We know that stress leave is on the rise, and substance use is part of that. It’s happening, but no one is talking about it,” says Burns, who studies homelessness, stigma, addiction and recovery.\n\nIn 2021, Burns and her colleagues published one of the few studies looking at substance-use disorders in faculty members (V. F. Burns et al. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 18, 7274; 2021). They interviewed 16 people who were deans or campus mental-health professionals at Canadian universities, with a combined 300 years of service, about instances of faculty members disclosing substance-use disorders. Across all 16, a total of only 3 such disclosures had been made to them during their careers, all regarding alcohol use.\n\n“Every single one of us has seen that professor at the departmental reception who routinely has a few too many,” says Bryan Pitts, a historian at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is in recovery from a substance-use disorder. “I don’t think anyone’s going to be shocked to discover that a colleague is keeping a bottle of whisky in their desk drawer,” but it’s not talked about openly, he says.\n\nVictoria Burns works to establish recovery programmes on campuses across Alberta, Canada.Credit: Victoria Burns\n\nTim Brennan, vice-president for medical and academic affairs at the American College of Academic Addiction Medicine, who is based in New York City, says academics are no more susceptible to substance-use disorders than are those in other professions. “I’ve seen addiction in every occupation, whether it’s people in manual jobs such as building skyscrapers, or in fields that have particularly high mental stress, like people on Wall Street managing millions of dollars,” he adds.\n\nHowever, there is a strong link between substance-use disorders and mental-health conditions — including anxiety and depression, which are common among academic staff. Studies of faculty members, staff and students in the United Kingdom, the United States and continental Europe show that a large proportion are struggling with a range of mental-health issues, including depression and burnout. For instance, 64% of faculty members surveyed at 8 US institutions reported feeling work-related burnout in the 2022–23 academic year (see go.nature.com/4tduwye).\n\nReconsidering the role of alcohol in the scientific workplace\n\nIt’s rare for someone to develop a problem if taking a drug or drinking alcohol is just for pleasure, says Ed Day, a clinical psychiatrist and researcher at the University of Birmingham, UK, who was appointed as the UK government’s national drug-recovery champion in 2019 to develop best practice around addiction recovery. “You tend to develop a problem if it’s an adaptive, rational way of coping with some other issue in your life, such as stress. Then it gets out of control and becomes something of its own,” he says.\n\nPitts thinks he was always prone to substance misuse, starting with alcohol, which was ubiquitous and part of the culture during his university studies more than a decade ago. He remembers a faculty member always arriving at a weekly graduate seminar “with two six-packs in hand” and other regular outings that led him to drink multiple times each week. Today, many institutions are rethinking campus alcohol policies, as are conference organizers. According to a 2022 Nature poll, however, 68% of academics surveyed did not want to see alcohol banned at scientific meetings (see Nature https://doi.org/nw76; 2022).\n\nPitts tried other drugs during his PhD studies, and psychostimulants became his escape. “I would spend days, weeks, months at a time being the perfect little graduate student and drugs were my way to completely check out,” he says. His flexible schedule meant that he could spend days at a time high without anyone noticing.\n\nAt one point, Dossett lived in a “mouldy caravan” for four months and showered on campus, but still her colleagues and superiors did not notice. “I really tried to hide it as much as I could,” she recalls, saying the flexible hours and self-directed academic lifestyle allowed her to disguise her dependency in a way that would have been difficult in a more nine-to-five profession.\n\n‘Sticky’ stigma\n\nStigma prevents many people from accessing help. “There is an assumption that people with addictions are making a choice, that they’re weak, misguided and selfish,” says Dossett. “It’s a particularly sticky stigma and that prevents people from being able to be honest about it.”\n\nAlthough society has begun to realize that “you can’t just tell a depressed person to cheer up, I don’t think that as a society we’re at a point where we recognize addiction as an illness”, says Edwards. “That’s a big part of the stigma.”\n\nThis plays out in several ways. Those with a disorder might internalize the stigma, which can exacerbate their substance-use cycle. They might also be less likely to access help because of how they think they will be perceived, and sometimes managers and institutions develop policies that are not appropriate for dealing with these conditions.\n\n“Even though post-secondary institutions are known to be, in theory, progressive, when it comes to our own struggles as academics, there’s an expectation that we should not show any sign of weakness,” says Burns. Those struggling with a substance-use disorder worry that it will reflect poorly on them and harm their job prospects.\n\nReligious-studies researcher Wendy Dossett says the stigma associated with substance-use disorders is “particularly sticky” and stops academics from disclosing their struggles and recoveries.Credit: Wendy Dossett\n\n“People are scared and they are full of shame” and might not want to admit to having an addiction diagnosis or have it on their record, she says. This is one of the reasons for the lack of data on substance-use disorders among faculty members. If people do access help, their addiction is often included in or masked by a mental-health diagnosis, she says.\n\nFor some, seeking help from their university could result in them losing their jobs. This is what Pitts feared, because one of his previous institutions had required him to sign an affidavit stating that he would not consume illegal drugs during his employment. “It didn’t stop me, but it made it very clear that it would be best to hide [my usage],” he says. By contrast, his current institution is part of the University of California system, which explicitly offers support to staff struggling with substance misuse, something that has helped Pitts in his recovery.\n\nWhen one researcher, who did not wish to name her institution, raised the issue of starting a programme for faculty members affected by substance misuse, she was told that no one at her institution was in recovery from addiction because of a zero-tolerance policy regarding drugs and alcohol. “And I thought, ‘That’s just insane. They need to know there are quite a few of us — among staff, among students — and this zero-tolerance attitude does nothing but feed stigma and prevent people seeking help.”\n\nTwo-thirds of scientists want to keep alcohol at conferences\n\nIn some countries, such as Canada, substance-use disorders qualify as a protected characteristic, which means that a person cannot be discriminated against for having that attribute. Other examples include age, race and gender. But such protection for the disorders is not the case everywhere — in the United States, only those in recovery for substance-use disorders are protected; in the United Kingdom, no such protected status exists.",

          "abstract": "Critics say that strategies to artificially shield Earth from sunlight are a distraction from carbon-cutting. Credit: Tui De Roy/Nature Picture Library\n\nClimate engineering has long been seen as the rogue approach to global warming. Public opposition has stymied field experiments of this strategy, which aims to artificially cool the Earth. Dozens of countries have called for an end to the development of climate-engineering approaches. Critics say that such projects could have disastrous unintended consequences.\n\nEven so, some scientists say that climate-engineering methods, such as lobbing particles into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight, might provide humanity with an eleventh-hour option to avoid global tipping points. For this method to be a viable path forwards, large knowledge gaps must be filled.\n\nDeveloping countries must lead on solar geoengineering research\n\n“We need to know enough about climate intervention that, should it ever be deployed, we know how to do it in a way that has the maximal benefits and the minimal harm,” says Jessica Gurevitch, an ecologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who emphasizes that climate engineering should not replace cutting carbon emissions.\n\nAt the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in Washington DC, in December, scientists discussed the research questions to be answered and the policies that must be put in place for climate engineering to be properly vetted. Here’s what scientists at the meeting and elsewhere say needs to happen.\n\n1. Determine how climate engineering would be done\n\nIn 2024, Earth surpassed 1.5 °C of warming, a critical benchmark in planetary safety. One strategy proposed to cool the Earth focuses on increasing the amount of sunlight reflected into space. Among the most studied approaches is one that calls for shooting reflective particles into the stratosphere, the atmospheric layer extending from roughly 10 to 50 kilometres above Earth’s surface.\n\nThe idea has a natural analogue: the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines belched at least 17 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere and cooled Earth’s surface for about 2 years.\n\nBut modelling studies disagree on how much particulate matter would need to be injected into the stratosphere to achieve a given amount of cooling. Nor is it clear when and where these particles should be deployed, or how they would evolve in the atmosphere over time. It will take many more modelling studies to reduce uncertainty about how the strategy would be used, says Walker Lee, a climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Researchers know even less about other Sun-reflecting strategies, such as blowing ocean salt spray into the air to brighten marine clouds.\n\n2. Understand the dangers\n\nScientists say it’s still unclear which poses a greater risk: global warming or a large-scale technological attempt to reverse it. The way to find out, researchers say, is to study every possible ramification of the proposed climate-engineering strategies and weigh them against the impacts of global warming. But there’s an acute need for more studies assessing how climate engineering could affect biodiversity, human health and weather patterns, Gurevitch says.\n\nThe rise of eco-anxiety: scientists wake up to the mental-health toll of climate change",

Although each cell has the same genome, the epigenetic modifications that control gene expression depend on the context in which the cell exists, such as developmental stage, disease state or tissue environment. Accessibility of chromatin (the packaged form of DNA) is epigenetically regulated and dictates which regulatory regions of the genome can be accessed by transcription factors — the proteins that turn genes on or off or tune their expression levels1. Writing in Nature, Fu et al.2 report the development of a machine-learning model trained on chromatin-accessibility data from more than 200 adult and fetal cell types, with the aim of understanding how different chromatin-accessibility ‘landscapes’ yield different transcriptional states.

          "title": "Who built Europe’s first cities? Clues about the urban revolution emerge",
          "authors": "Emma Marris",
          "abstract": "The vase is tan with abstract designs in black: curved triangles that swoop into circles, a motif with an elegant, organic flow. It looks contemporary, or perhaps like the work of a mid-century artist on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nThis ceramic piece is in a museum, but not in any modern wing. Found as fragments in 2006 at an archaeological site in Poduri, Romania, the vase is the work of an unknown artist from some 6,000 years ago. The restored artefact is on display in a museum in northwestern Romania.\n\nThe potter who created it was a member of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, a pre-Bronze Age society that thrived in what is now Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, where several ‘megasites’ held thousands of homes.\n\nHumanity’s oldest art is flaking away. Can scientists save it?\n\nTo some archaeologists, these giant settlements are among the world’s first cities, whereas others debate whether they qualify as urban centres. In either case, they represent the largest assemblages of people in early Europe and are one of the first experiments in the urban revolution.\n\nResearchers discovered the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture in the late nineteenth century. Yet, because of the location of the sites, the culture is not as well studied as others that are roughly contemporaneous, such as those from Sumer, pre-dynastic Egypt and pre-Minoan Crete. There is now burgeoning interest in the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, which has brought researchers to the field over the past 15 years.\n\nWith the help of improved imaging and dating tools, archaeologists are increasingly able to imagine daily life in these massive communities at the centre of one of the longest-lasting cultures known in human history. Cucuteni–Trypillia has always stood out as something of an anomaly, because its settlements seemed to have been egalitarian societies that were devoid of social hierarchies. That challenged long-held archaeological ideas that large settlements inevitably develop a ruling elite — as was seen in the ancient Mesopotamian city of Uruk, in what is now Iraq.\n\nA vase found in Poduri, Romania, that was made around 6,000 years ago.Credit: Constantin Preoteasa, Cucuteni Culture: Apogee of European Prehistoric Art. Exhibition Catalogue (C. Matasă Publishing House, 2023)\n\nBut some of the latest studies have found hints of social stratification in later Cucuteni–Trypillia settlements — leading to tantalizing suggestions that this stratification could have played a part in the culture’s demise.\n\nThe emerging picture is helping to transform archaeologists’ understanding of why the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture built such unprecedentedly large settlements, and why the inhabitants eventually abandoned them. But since 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shut down many archaeological sites and stalled some studies.\n\n“At the moment, fieldwork for us is not possible. For Ukrainian archaeologists, it is a difficult situation,” says Johannes Müller, an archaeologist at Kiel University in Germany.\n\nNo elites\n\nThe combined name of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture captures the early history of research on these people. Their distinctive pottery was discovered almost simultaneously in two locations in the late nineteenth century: Romania (where the culture was named after a site in Cucuteni) and Ukraine (where the same culture was named Trypillia, also after a community where artefacts were found).\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, archaeologists filled in more details. The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture covered a huge area: at its greatest extent, it stretched east from the Carpathian Mountains to the Black Sea and north to present-day Kyiv on the Dnieper River (see ‘Cryptic culture’). For more than 2,000 years, between about 5050 bc and 2950 bc, the group made pots, hunted and gathered, farmed, raised cattle and lived in settlements where all the houses were the same size. People ate legumes and cereals grown on the rich soils of Ukraine, which were well manured by cattle. Livestock animals were also eaten, although isotope analysis of rare human remains shows that meat made up only roughly 10% of people’s diets1.\n\nSource: Ref. 2\n\nCucuteni–Trypillia settlements were of varying sizes. Many were modest villages, such as the Poduri site in Romania. But some settlements in what is now Ukraine were big — really big. Their true extent was revealed in the 1960s and 1970s, when they were photographed from the air. The largest sites2 included up to 3,000 houses and spanned as much as 320 hectares — about the size of Central Park in New York City.\n\nIn recent decades, aerial photography has been replaced with studies that survey the sites using magnetometers, which can detect buried settlements. Helpfully, the Cucuteni–Trypillia often burnt their houses, perhaps as part of rituals, leaving neat squares of ash that contain magnetic oxides formed by the burning of iron compounds in the clay daub used to finish the walls. Researchers have used magnetometer data to create detailed city plans of many settlements.\n\nSuch maps and the artefacts found in all those identical houses have answered some questions and raised many more.\n\nSocialist utopias?\n\nDespite the organized urban design of Cucuteni–Trypillia megasites, there were no palaces, no grand temples, no signs of centralized administration and no rich or poor houses. There were no special graves for high-ranking people. A bestselling 2021 book by anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow, The Dawn of Everything, brought wider attention to these sites, which the authors describe as “proof that highly egalitarian organization has been possible on an urban scale”.\n\nAt the centre of every Cucuteni–Trypillia megasite is a mysterious void: a large area with no buildings at all. According to Graeber and Wengrow, these could have been used as a place of assembly for debates or instant referendums — an arena for direct democracy. They could equally have been used to pasture cattle. Without any artefacts, it is hard to know.\n\nIt is precisely because there’s no evidence of ruling elites, centralized bureaucracy or special economic structures that some scholars hesitate to call these megasites cities, even though they were undeniably large population centres. Cucuteni–Trypillia villages also have an open central space, just on a smaller scale.\n\nAn artist’s reconstruction of a giant settlement that existed around 3800 bc in Maidanetske, Ukraine.Credit: Susanne Beyer, CAU-Kiel, Institut fur Ur-und Frilhgeschichte\n\nArchaeologist Aleksandr Diachenko at the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv suggests that the megasites grew so large, in part, because they became swollen with climate refugees. He and his team have worked to reconcile older, relative-dating methods based on pottery styles with radiocarbon dates determined using an accelerator mass spectrometer. Diachenko suggests that Cucuteni–Trypillia people from the western forests moved east into larger settlements in the steppe grasslands in response to climate change.\n\n“As the climate became more arid in this area,” says Diachenko, “it became overpopulated and, in order to deal with subsistence issues, these people had to move farther to the east.”\n\n“The megasites actually mark the outcome of these migrations,” he says. Megasites might have been fairly short-lived centres where immigrants landed before spreading out across the steppe.\n\nHints of hierarchy\n\nAt Kiel University, archaeologists have been working on the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture since 2012. Over years of excavations at the Talianki megasite in Ukraine, Kiel archaeologist Mila Shatilo grew familiar with the typical contents of its houses. To Shatilo and other Kiel researchers, the cookie-cutter dwellings are a strong indication that the culture was intentionally egalitarian. “The ornaments of pottery could be different, but you know what to expect from every house; it doesn’t seem that one household was really much richer than another,” says Shatilo.\n\nFirst passages of rolled-up Herculaneum scroll revealed\n\nOne difficulty for archaeologists studying this culture is the general absence of graves, which are usually rich sources of data. No one is entirely sure what these people did with their dead. But the lack of post-mortem hoards for most of their history sheds light on the society’s world view. Instead of being buried with their owners, metal objects might have been melted down and reused, suggest some researchers. By measuring the houses and noting the lack of elite graves, Müller says, “we are detecting that their ritual and spiritual life is not linked to the wish to express social differences”.\n\nHowever, Kiel archaeologists do see subtle signs of possible social hierarchy in what the megasite builders left behind. Data from high-resolution magnetometry surveys have revealed buildings of unusual size, form and position at a 200-hectare megasite in Maidanetske, Ukraine3. Many researchers agree that these ‘megastructures’ — some large, others in prominent locations — were likely to be public buildings. But were they churches, storehouses, senates or feasting halls? Archaeologists have proposed several explanations.\n\nA Cucuteni sculpture from northern Romania shows a seated pregnant figurine alongside other statuettes.Credit: Constantin Preoteasa, Cucuteni Culture: Apogee of European Prehistoric Art. Exhibition Catalogue (C. Matasă Publishing House, 2023)\n\nOne theory is that agglomerations of people from multiple communities banded together at the megasites, either for security or perhaps, as Diachenko argues, as fellow migrants. Communities in different neighbourhood might each have maintained a communal megastructure. Given the artefacts found in them, which include grindstones, storage jars and cattle and pig bones, Shatilo and her colleagues have proposed3 that megastructures were places where people worked together on tasks such as grinding grain and weaving, and where they stored communally owned goods and feasted. Over time, however, there seem to have been fewer of these community-specific centres, as if power was centralizing.\n\nOthers suggest that the megastructures were temples. Raised platforms inside a large building at the Nebelivka megasite in Ukraine have been interpreted as altars. This idea, say researchers, is supported by figurines and animal bones found at this site.\n\nA world of clay\n\nArchaeologist Constantin Preoteasa is the curator of the Cucuteni Museum in Piatra Neamț, Romania, and discovered the vase in Poduri in 2006. “Emotion, pleasure, honour and privilege,” were the feelings he had when he found it. “The first person seeing, touching and admiring such prestigious artefacts after several millennia: I am really lucky, indeed!”\n\nEgypt is building a $1-billion mega-museum. Will it bring Egyptology home?\n\nPreoteasa suggests that the megasites were, by and large, peaceful places. But he thinks that there was probably some hierarchy, based on skills. The potters could have been highly respected and even feared, he says, because of their ability to “transform the raw materials in artefacts using fire”.\n\nCertainly, one can’t help but feel a sense of awe when looking at their pottery. More surprising still is the fact that the gorgeous art pieces on display at the museum were found in everyday homes. They were not reserved for the elite.",

Credit: Getty\n\nThe number of ‘precocious’ scientists — those who become top-cited authors early in their careers — has surged in the past few years, according to an analysis1 of the publishing records of hundreds of thousands of scientists.\n\nMany of these precocious authors publish what the analysis calls an ‘extreme’ number of papers — an average of more than one per week. The analysis also found that these authors often cite their own papers at a rate well above the average. Some level of such ‘self-citation’ is common in scientific papers, but the average rate is around 13%, whereas some of these authors’ rates were 25–50%.\n\nThe citation black market: schemes selling fake references alarm scientists\n\nThe analysis was posted on the bioRxiv preprint server on 15 October and has not yet been peer reviewed. However, another researcher who was not an author of the analysis says its methods seem sound.\n\nSome of the precocious authors show no signs of questionable publishing habits and probably made it on to the list through talent and hard work, says John Ioannidis, the author of the preprint and a physician at Stanford University in California who specializes in meta-research, the study of how research is done.\n\nBut scientists say the trend raises questions about how so many authors have racked up such a large number of citations so quickly.\n\nZach Adelman, an entomologist at Texas A&M University in College Station, says that although there are probably true overachievers in the mix, “I don’t think that we’re all of a sudden mass-producing more geniuses now than we were five years ago.”\n\nEarly achievers\n\nIoannidis used data from the Scopus citation database to compile a list of top-cited researchers on the basis of a metric he calls a “composite citation indicator”, which takes into account the varying levels of contribution by a paper’s co-authors. The index combines data including the total number of citations a researcher’s work has accrued, the scientist’s placement on each paper’s author list and the individual’s h-index, a measurement of research output that includes citation count and number of publications.\n\nIoannidis used the composite index to identify top-cited scientists: those whose citation indices are in the top 2% for their field or in the top 100,000 across all fields. He defined “precocious” scientists as those who reached the top-cited list within eight years of their first publication, and “ultra-precocious” as those who did so within five years. By contrast, the average time from first publication to most-cited status was 36 years.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThe analysis revealed a marked rise in the number of top-cited early-career researchers between 2019 and 2023, the period for which Ioannidis has complete data. During this time, the number of precocious authors increased from 213 to 469, and ultra-precocious authors increased from 28 to 59.\n\nDigging deeper into the data, Ioannidis found that 31% of the ultra-precocious authors cited themselves more often than did 95% of the authors in their field, and that 20% fell off the top-cited list when self-citations were excluded. When Ioannidis included some 2024 data, he found that 17 of the authors who qualified as ultra-precocious had had at least one paper retracted.\n\nThere can be innocent explanations for such findings: authors can retract their own papers after catching honest mistakes, and scientists might cite themselves frequently if they are especially productive. But a large body of retractions or a high rate of self-citation could also be a sign of unusual publishing behaviours, Ioannidis says.\n\nDomingo Docampo, a specialist in statistical signal processing at the University of Vigo in Spain who has used some of the same metrics to investigate citation fraud, says that the methods used in the study are sound. “The indicators are believable and can be useful for anyone doing evaluations of researchers,” he says.\n\nCitation red flags\n\nIoannidis found that some researchers had not only cited themselves heavily but also accrued a relatively large number of citations in a relatively small number of papers. The findings suggest that scientists are engaging in attempts to improve their h-index, Ioannidis says. For instance, some of the precocious authors had published what he calls “sometimes nonsensical papers” that included dozens or even 100 citations to their own papers, he says.",

          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "Earth’s temperature has been climbing for decades.Credit: Mark J. Terrill/AP/Alamy\n\nEarth’s temperature has surged in the past two years, and climate scientists will soon announce that it hit a milestone in 2024: rising to more than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. But is this sudden spike just a blip in the climate data, or an early indicator that the planet is heating up at a faster pace than researchers thought?\n\nGlobal warming is on the cusp of crucial 1.5 °C threshold, suggest ice-core data\n\nThat question has been at the centre of numerous studies, as well as a session at last month’s meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in Washington DC. Some scientists argue that the spike can be mostly explained by two factors. One is the El Niño event that began in mid-2023 — a natural weather pattern in which warm water pools in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, often leading to hotter temperatures and more-turbulent weather. The other is a reduction over the past few years in air pollution, which can cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space and seeding low-lying clouds. Yet neither explanation fully accounts for the temperature surge, other researchers say.\n\nClouds clearly played a part, according to a study published in Science in December, just before the AGU meeting1. A research team identified a reduction in low-lying cloud cover across parts of the Northern Hemisphere and the tropics that, combined with El Niño, was large enough to explain the temperature spike in 2023. But the cause of this decrease — and whether it can be chalked up to normal climate variations — remains a mystery, the authors say. Decreased air pollution alone doesn’t seem to explain it. They suggest that global warming itself could be causing some reduction in cloud coverage, creating a feedback loop that could accelerate the rate of climate change for decades to come.\n\n“I would be very careful about saying this is clear evidence [of acceleration], but there might be something going on,” says co-author Helge Goessling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany.\n\nGlobal temperature spikes have happened before. Why are scientists so worried about this one?\n\nOne reason is that global temperatures were off-the-charts hot in 2023, with an average 1.45 °C of warming above the pre-industrial baseline (see ‘Temperature surge’), shattering previous records. This level of warming is outside the range of what scientists expected on the basis of previous trends and modelling.\n\nSource: Copernicus Climate Change Service/European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\n\nAnother reason is that last year was also much warmer than expected. Scientists projected that early 2024 would be hot owing to El Niño. But they also anticipated that temperatures would fall after the weather pattern subsided and conditions in the equatorial Pacific returned to normal last June.\n\n“That didn’t happen,” says Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a non-profit organization in California that tracks global temperatures. Instead, global temperatures remained elevated, shattering more records and probably making last year the warmest on record by a sizeable margin. “All of us who made projections at the start of the year underestimated just how warm 2024 would be.”\n\nIs there evidence of acceleration?\n\nSome say that the massive temperature spike might end up being a blip in the climate data, owing in large part to new regulations covering air pollution from ocean-going ships. In 2020, the United Nations International Maritime Organisation implemented a rule requiring an 80% reduction in sulfur emissions from ships sailing in international waters. One analysis of satellite imagery, published in August, suggests that there has been a clear reduction in ship tracks2, which are formed when sulfur-containing pollution particles seed low-lying mists. The changes seem to correlate with the broader reduction in cloud cover pinpointed by Goessling’s team.\n\nHow to recover when a climate disaster destroys your city\n\n“It’s almost a smoking gun,” says Andrew Gettelman, a climate scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington. If true, Gettelman says, this would indicate that the recent temperature spike could be a one-time phenomenon driven by short-term changes in pollution and a powerful El Niño.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "On 24 December, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe whizzed through the Sun’s atmosphere, diving closer to our star than any spacecraft ever has. It survived the fiery passage, and on 1 January it reported back to Earth that its scientific instruments had successfully collected data during the journey.\n\nStaring at the Sun — close-up images from space rewrite solar science\n\nThat information should reach Earth in the next few weeks — marking a sunny start to 2025 for solar physicists, who have been waiting for the data since the mission launched six years ago. Among other things, they hope to learn more about the origin of the solar wind, the stream of energized particles that floods outwards from the Sun, and how the Sun’s outer atmosphere, or corona, is heated to millions of degrees — even hotter than the solar surface.\n\n“Parker Solar Probe is opening our eyes on a new reality about our star,” says Nour Rawafi, an astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, and the mission’s project scientist.\n\nFeel the heat\n\nSince its launch, the spacecraft has been looping around the Sun, getting progressively closer. In 2018, it measured part of the solar wind streaming from a small hole in the corona. Three years later, it dipped into the corona for the first time.\n\nThe fly-by on 24 December was its 22nd pass of the Sun, and its closest. The probe passed around 6.1 million kilometres from the solar surface, probably experiencing temperatures around 980 °C.\n\nDeath-defying NASA mission will make humanity’s closest approach to the Sun\n\nBut it’s designed to withstand even hotter conditions. “We knew that this was a very harsh environment,” says Elizabeth Congdon, an engineer at the APL who oversaw development of the probe’s heat shield. “So we over-designed the system.” Researchers have observed that the white protective coating on the heat shield, made of carbon composite and carbon foam, seems to be getting whiter each time it is blasted by solar radiation during a fly-by. That means it is getting even better at reflecting away the Sun’s heat.\n\nAlthough scientists can study the solar wind and corona from afar using more-distant spacecraft and solar telescopes on Earth, the Parker Solar Probe is the only instrument that can make observations where these solar phenomena are born, Rawafi says. For instance, in 2023, scientists confirmed the existence of a relatively dust-free region of space around the Sun using data from the probe1. This region had long been predicted but had never before been observed, because no spacecraft had actually visited the region.",

          "authors": "Brian Owens",
          "abstract": "The University of Toronto in Canada raised its graduate-student stipends last November.Credit: James Wagner/Getty\n\nStipends for biology and physics graduate students at Canadian universities fall well short of a living wage, an analysis reports.\n\n“All of the minimum stipends we found were below the poverty line after tuition, except for the physics department at the University of Toronto,” says Thomas Bailey, a PhD student at the University of Ottawa and an author of the work, which was posted on the bioRxiv preprint server last November and has not yet undergone peer review1. “People who want to study science in Canada have three options: hope for more support from their supervisor, take on big debts or emigrate.”\n\nBailey and his colleagues collected information on the minimum graduate-student stipends, tuition costs and other fees in physics and biology departments across the country. After comparing the stipend — minus tuition and other fees — with the local cost of living, they found that the average minimum stipend for domestic students is around Can$9,500 (US$11,900) below the poverty line, whereas international students fare even worse, falling about Can$16,900 short.\n\nCanadian stipends also lag behind those in other similar countries — the highest Canadian minimum stipend is roughly equivalent to the lowest biology stipend in the United States, and lower than the stipend in the United Kingdom. The authors estimate that Canadian stipends would need to increase by 1.5 times merely to keep pace with the cost of living. (By way of comparison, according to the ‘Big Mac Index’, a whimsical metric of purchasing power, the price of a McDonald’s Big Mac sandwich differs by only about 3% in those three countries.)\n\nMost university departments set a minimum stipend for graduate students, with the money coming from a mix of the supervisor’s grants, departmental funds and salary for teaching assistant posts. Tuition and other fees are deducted from the stipend — on average 34% of the stipend is returned to the university for a local student. (By contrast, tuition is typically waived for graduate students in the United States and United Kingdom.) Students who receive scholarships or other external funding generally have their stipend reduced, although the exact arrangements vary.\n\nFamiliar story\n\nHilary Hennessey, campaigns commissioner for the Canadian Federation of Students’ National Graduate Caucus and a graduate student at Memorial University in Newfoundland, says that the study reflects the federation’s own survey data. More than 70% of graduate students in Canada are living below the poverty line, Hennessey’s survey found, and one-quarter are worried about whether they will have enough money to complete their studies. “High tuition and the cost of living are putting graduate studies out of reach for many,” she says.\n\nSimilarly, a 2021–22 survey of graduate students by the Ottawa Science Policy Network found that roughly 43% of 1,305 respondents reported that they frequently struggled to make ends meet or that their tight finances forced them to make sacrifices to afford necessities, and less than 10% were comfortable with their financial situation2.\n\nUniversities have not been blind to this growing problem, says Ian Wereley, executive director of the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies in Ottawa. “Over the past decade, universities and faculties of graduate studies have realized they need to be more aware of the non-academic struggles of our students,” he says.\n\nThe rising costs of rent and food have led to a huge increase in the number of students using food banks and living in their cars, highlighting the significant need for assistance, he says. The problem is that universities face challenges of their own, with freezes on tuition fees and operating grants, and caps on admissions of international students, whose higher tuition fees have subsidized university operations for years.\n\n“While universities recognize the need and want to take action, they are also faced with restrictions on resources,” says Wereley.\n\nTurning the corner",

Most smiled, those were for the happy days, but some frowned, too.\n\nEvery day Bibi was awake, she made a new star and Mumi always hung it up for her. This made Bibi happy, even on sad days when the rusty old ship was scary and creaked extra loud.\n\nBibi could remember the day for each and every star. Days running in empty greenhouses, her giggles and footsteps bouncing off dusty glass. Days climbing through empty cargo pods, pretending they were metal mountains. Days shouting at the ship’s shaky hull, yelling at the Big Empty outside, but it was always too scared to come in and fight her. And days splashing in the cooling ponds, imagining they were vast oceans like in the crinkly old books. Sometimes she fell in and got wet, but she always kept trying.\n\n“I’m good at not giving up,” Bibi whispered. Mumi always said so, and Mumi knew everything.\n\nSomething below clanged and red lights blinked up through the floor. Bibi peeked down and saw Mumi working with wires and pipes. Mumi’s long body moved smoothly, her hands a blur.\n\n“Mumi?” Bibi called softly.\n\n“Yes, child.” Mumi’s voice click-click-clicked more than usual tonight. She stopped working and tilted her head to listen.\n\n“I can’t sleep,” said Bibi. She twisted a small knot into her covers. “I’m hungry.”\n\nMumi laughed, a sound like tiny kisses. “Surely you’re tired, Bibi Bené. In a few days it’ll be time for a Big Sleep. Tonight is just a little one. Say the words, and sleep will come.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nBibi yawned. “Yes, Mumi.” But she wondered about the Big Sleep. Mumi said she made food during the Big Sleeps. Bibi didn’t know how, but whenever she woke up, there was food.\n\nBibi tried to sleep, but couldn’t. A soft cry came from below. Bibi slipped out of her pod and tiptoed downstairs. The metal floor was cold on her feet.\n\nMumi stood by the blinking lights. A single flower sat in a pot next to her. Mumi said it was the last one. Bibi had never seen Mumi so still before. She looked like a tall flower herself with a dress full of holes. Red light blinked and blipped through the holes, making funny shapes on the walls and wires and pipes.\n\n“Are your stars sad today?” Bibi asked, touching Mumi’s dress. It hummed softly in her fingers.\n\n“Bibi Bené, you’re not asleep,” said Mumi.\n\nBibi giggled. Her fingers found a hole in Mumi’s dress.\n\n“They are …” Mumi’s voice click-click-clicked, “happy stars.”\n\nBibi thought red lights meant something was wrong. She was glad it didn’t.\n\n“This pretty star means you get a surprise. Tonight is a Big Sleep, after all.”\n\nWell, that didn’t sound like fun. Air rustled her hair, tugging it.\n\n“And when you wake up, there will be more surprises.”\n\n“What kind?” Bibi couldn’t imagine.\n\n“Well,” Mumi clicked, “flowers and food and people, too.”\n\nBibi gasped. She spun around with her arms out wide. “People! Like me?”\n\n“Quickly now.”\n\nShe ran back to her pod and jumped in, squeezing her eyes shut so tight the red light leaked through. She had to say the words right away.\n\nNow I lay me down to sleep. I pray the stars my soul to keep. And if I should forget to wake …\n\nBut Bibi couldn’t stop thinking about people. Outside, dust tapped on the ship, louder and louder, and air rustled the paper stars above her pod like crazy.\n\nMumi was by her side very fast, her long arms reaching up to the paper stars to keep them from blowing away. Their shadows moved across Bibi’s face.\n\nBibi felt warmth through the holes in Mumi’s dress.\n\n“Oh!” said Mumi, looking at the red flashing lights through the floor. “We can’t forget the most important part of the day, but you have to hurry.”\n\nBibi got her paper and made a new star. It had the biggest smile ever. One more Big Sleep and when she woke up there would be people.\n\nMumi hung the star higher than all the rest. “It’s time, Bibi Bené.”",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nNASA has again put off deciding how to accomplish one of its highest-profile missions in decades: bringing rocks back from Mars.\n\nAfter years of ballooning cost estimates, the agency promised last April that it would develop a cheaper method for Mars sample return. But during a mission update on 7 January, it kicked the can down the road, saying it would continue to explore two options: one using well-tested NASA technology and the other relying on systems being developed by private aerospace companies.\n\nThe hunt for life on Mars: A visual guide to NASA’s latest mission\n\nThe final decision isn’t expected until next year. The earliest the NASA spacecraft could launch would be 2031, with the samples coming to Earth no earlier than 2035. Costs for both options range from around US$6 billion to $7 billion — less than earlier estimates of up to $11 billion, but still a major challenge for the cash-strapped agency.\n\n“I’m disappointed we don’t have an entirely clear path forward yet,” says Victoria Hamilton, a planetary geologist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who chairs a group that provides NASA with community input on its Mars exploration plans. She notes that Mars sample return has been a top priority for US planetary science for decades and that the community is keen for it to get under way.\n\nChallenging delivery\n\nNo nation has yet delivered Mars samples to Earth, although China is working on plans to do so as early as 2031. Studying Martian rocks in person would allow scientists to conduct analyses much more sophisticated than those that rovers can do on the red planet. Keeping both design options for now “will help us achieve delivering this science for everybody”, said Nicola Fox, NASA’s associate administrator for science, during the media briefing.\n\nNASA’s goal is to bring back 30 of the tubes of Martian rock, dust and air that the agency’s Perseverance rover has collected over the past few years from a variety of geological environments in Jezero Crater, where it landed. The rover has travelled across an ancient river delta and last year left the crater, entering a realm of ancient Martian rocks that have never before been explored.\n\nNASA admits plan to bring Mars rocks to Earth won’t work — and seeks fresh ideas\n\nNASA put its Mars sample-return plans on hold last year while it solicited fresh ideas from businesses and the public about how to do it for less than $11 billion.

Assuming that the finding is confirmed in other animals, “I put all my money that this segregation will also occur in humans”, says György Buzsáki, a systems neuroscientist at New York University in New York City. That’s because memory is an evolutionarily ancient system, says Buzsáki, who was not part of the research team but once supervised the work of some of its members.\n\nThe work was published on Wednesday in Nature1.\n\nWindow on the brain\n\nScientists have long known that, during sleep, the brain ‘replays’ recent experiences: the same neurons that were involved in an experience fire in the same order. This mechanism helps to solidify the experience as a memory and prepare it for long-term storage.\n\nTo study brain function during sleep, the research team exploited a quirk of mice: their eyes are partially open during some stages of slumber. The team monitored one eye in each mouse as it slept. During a deep phase of sleep, the researchers observed the pupils shrink and then return to their original, larger size repeatedly, with each cycle lasting roughly one minute. Neuron recordings showed that most of the brain’s replay of experiences took place when the animals’ pupils were small.\n\nSleep loss impairs memory of smells, worm research shows\n\nThat led the scientists to wonder whether pupil size and memory processing are linked. To find out, they enlisted a technique called optogenetics, which uses light to either trigger or suppress the electrical activity of genetically engineered neurons in the brain. First, they trained engineered mice to find a sweet treat hidden on a platform. Immediately after these lessons, as the mice slept, the authors used optogenetics to reduce bursts of neuronal firing that have been linked to replay. They did so during both the small-pupil and large-pupil stages of sleep.\n\nOnce awakened, the mice had completely forgotten the location of the treat — but only if firing had been reduced during the small-pupil stage. “We wiped out the memory,” says Wenbo Tang, a co-author of the Nature paper and a systems neuroscientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.\n\nBy contrast, when the team reduced bursts of neuronal firing during the large-pupil phase shortly after a lesson, the mice went straight to the treat — making clear that their fresh memories were intact.",

In nature, bacteria called diazotrophs fix nitrogen using nitrogenase enzymes1,2. Isolated nitrogenases are destroyed by oxygen gas in minutes, but in diazotrophs they are shielded from oxygen, in part, by a small protein called FeSII (also referred to as Shethna protein II after its discoverer3).

          "abstract": "The biology underlying the connection between social relationships and health is largely unknown. Here, leveraging data from 42,062 participants across 2,920 plasma proteins in the UK Biobank, we characterized the proteomic signatures of social isolation and loneliness through proteome-wide association study and protein co-expression network analysis. Proteins linked to these constructs were implicated in inflammation, antiviral responses and complement systems. More than half of these proteins were prospectively linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and mortality during a 14 year follow-up. Moreover, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis suggested causal relationships from loneliness to five proteins, with two proteins (ADM and ASGR1) further supported by colocalization. These MR-identified proteins (GFRA1, ADM, FABP4, TNFRSF10A and ASGR1) exhibited broad associations with other blood biomarkers, as well as volumes in brain regions involved in interoception and emotional and social processes. Finally, the MR-identified proteins partly mediated the relationship between loneliness and cardiovascular diseases, stroke and mortality. The exploration of the peripheral physiology through which social relationships influence morbidity and mortality is timely and has potential implications for public health.",

Conventional cognitive control tasks, however, only feature one task and one source of distraction. Therefore, it is unclear how control is allocated in multidimensional environments. To address this question, we developed a multidimensional task-set interference paradigm, in which people need to manage distraction from three independent dimensions. We use this task to test whether people adapt to previous conflict by enhancing task-relevant information or suppressing task-irrelevant information. Three experiments provided strong evidence for the latter hypothesis. Moreover, control adaptation was highly dimension specific. Conflict from a given dimension only affected processing of that same dimension on subsequent trials, with no evidence for generalization. A new neural network model shows that our results can only be simulated when including multiple independent conflict-detector units. Our results call for an update to classic models of cognitive control and their neurocomputational underpinnings.",

A further cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis (96,806 cases and 492,818 controls) including populations from diverse ancestries identified 61 previously unreported risk loci. Systematic variant-level analysis, including fine mapping, functional genomics and expression quantitative trait loci, prioritized potential causal variants. Gene-level analyses, including transcriptome-wide association study, proteome-wide association study and Mendelian randomization, nominated the potential causal genes. By integrating evidence from layers of different analyses, we prioritized the most plausible causal genes for SCZ, such as ACE, CNNM2, SNAP91, ABCB9 and GATAD2A. Finally, drug repurposing showed that ACE, CA14, MAPK3 and MAPT are potential therapeutic targets for SCZ. Our study not only showed the power of cross-ancestry GWAS in deciphering the genetic aetiology of SCZ, but also uncovered new genetic risk loci, potential causal variants and genes and therapeutic targets for SCZ.",

For rare coding variants, we identified 56 significant associations by gene-based collapsing tests, unveiling 7 additional SES-associated genes ( NRN1 , CCDC36 , RHOB , EP400 , NCAM1, TPTEP2-CSNK1E , and LINC02881 ). Exome-wide single common variant analysis revealed nine lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with household income and 34 lead SNPs associated with EduYears, replicating previous GWAS findings. The gene–environment correlations had a substantial impact on the genetic associations with SES, as indicated by the significantly increased P values in several associations after controlling for geographic regions. Furthermore, we observed the pleiotropic effects of SES-associated genetic factors on a wide range of health outcomes, such as cognitive function, psychosocial status, and diabetes.

          "abstract": "Many climate policies adopt improving equity as a key objective. A key challenge is that policies often conceive of equity in terms of individuals but introduce strategies that focus on spatially coarse administrative areas. For example, the Justice40 Initiative in the United States requires 518 diverse federal programs to prioritize funds for “disadvantaged” census tracts. This strategy is largely untested and contrasts with the federal government’s definition of equity as the “consistent and systematic fair, just and impartial treatment of all individuals (Executive Office of the President, Federal Register, 2021).” How well does the Justice40 approach improve equity in climate adaptation outcomes across individuals ? We analyze this question using a case study of a municipality that faces repetitive flooding and struggles to effectively manage these risks due to limited resources and public investment. We find that the way the Federal Emergency Management Agency implements the Justice40 Initiative can be an obstacle to promoting equity in household flood-risk outcomes. For example, in this case study, ensuring the majority of benefits accrue in “Justice40 Communities” does not reduce risk for the most burdened households, does not reduce risk-burden inequality, and produces net costs. In contrast, we design simple funding rules based on household risk burden that cost-effectively target the most burdened households, reduce risk-burden inequality, and accrue large net benefits. Our findings suggest that “disadvantaged community” indicators defined at coarse spatial scales face the risk of poorly capturing many climate risks and can be ineffective for meeting equity promises about climate-related investments.",

In this perspective, we take a “bright spots” approach and highlight successful examples of ecosystem restoration that have helped to nurture a sense of place, foster optimism, and cultivate stronger and more diverse social networks. These three individual- and community-level capacities have the potential to lead to increased psychosocial resilience, which is a key component of community resilience. Our aim is to spark discussion and research to better understand how we can transform restoration from a largely technical endeavor to a practice and process through which human–nature relationships are infused with deliberate meaning and human well-being is improved.

We describe a new method for validating amino-acid conformations: “PhiSiCal ( ϕ ψ χ al) Checkup.” Twenty new joint probability distributions in the form of statistical mixture models explain the empirical distributions of dihedral angles ω , ϕ , ψ , χ 1 , χ 2 , … of canonical amino acids in experimental protein structures. Marginal and conditional probability distributions for subsets of dihedral angles are derived from these joint mixture models. Together, these distributions are employed to measure rapidly the information-theoretic “favorability” of any proposed experimental protein structure. The inferred statistical models and measures overcome several shortcomings and afford improvements over the current state of the art in amino-acid conformation verification. Experimental comparisons are made against current protein conformation verification software. In a number of examples, we pick up outliers that are invisible to current methods. We also calculate, as part of verification, the sensitivity of favorability to small changes in a proposed structure accounting for the precision of coordinates. In some cases a near neighbor of a proposed amino-acid conformation may be either less or more favorable. This raises the question, is the current reliance on fixed “thresholds” for validation a good thing?

No comprehensive global dataset exists on what species are in trade, their geographic origins, and trade’s ultimate impacts, which limits our ability to sustainably manage trade. The United States is one of the world’s largest importers of wildlife, with trade data compiled in the US Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS). The LEMIS provides the most comprehensive publicly accessible wildlife trade database of non-the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) listed species. In total, 21,097 species and over 2.85 billion individuals were traded over the past 22 y (2000-2022). When LEMIS data are combined with CITES records, the United States imported over 29,445 wild species, including over 50% of all globally described species in some taxonomic groups. For most taxa, around half of the individuals are declared as sourced from the wild. Although the LEMIS provides the only means to assess trade volumes for many taxa, without any associated data on most wild populations, it is impossible to assess the impact on biodiversity, sustainability of trade, or any potential risk of pest or pathogen spread. These insights underscore the considerable underestimation of trade and the urgent need for other countries to adopt similar mechanisms to accurately record trade.",

The return of a cache of samples—including of the atmosphere—from separate locations in Jezero Crater and with differing petrogeneses will provide the international community with the opportunity to explore part of the evolutionary history of Mars in great detail. Specifically, measurements of the isotopic compositions of the light elements H, C, N, O, Cl, and S can be used to follow how volatile species cycle through the different martian volatile reservoirs (atmosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere). Measurement of isotopic fractionation enables inference of the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, water/rock ratio) under which fractionation occurred. Knowing the contextual relationship of the materials to their geological settings, coupled with precise compositional measurements will enable a more thorough understanding of martian volatile history and allow a picture to be constructed of water and climate on Mars as represented at Jezero Crater.",

          "abstract": "The TRAMP complex contains two enzymatic activities essential for RNA processing upstream of the nuclear exosome. Within TRAMP, RNA is 3′ polyadenylated by a subcomplex of Trf4/5 and Air1/2 and unwound 3′ to 5′ by Mtr4, a DExH helicase. The molecular mechanisms of TRAMP assembly and RNA shuffling between the two TRAMP catalytic sites are poorly understood. Here, we report solution hydrogen–deuterium exchange data with thermodynamic and functional assays to uncover these mechanisms for yeast TRAMP with Trf4 and Air2 homologs. We show that TRAMP assembly constrains RNA-recognition motifs that are peripheral to catalytic sites. These include the Mtr4 Arch and Air2 zinc knuckles 1, 2, and 3. While the Air2 Arch-interacting motif likely constrains the Mtr4 Arch via transient interactions, these do not fully account for the importance of the Mtr4 Arch in TRAMP assembly. We further show that tRNA binding by single active-site subunits, Mtr4 and Trf4-Air2, differs from the double active-site TRAMP. TRAMP has reduced tRNA binding on the Mtr4 Fist and RecA2 domains, offset by increased tRNA binding on Air2 zinc knuckles 2 and 3. Competition between these RNA-binding sites may drive tRNA transfer between TRAMP subunits. We identify dynamic changes upon TRAMP assembly and RNA-recognition motifs that transfer RNA between TRAMP catalytic sites.",

Yet, the perceptual role of this temporal fine structure (TFS) code is debated. This fundamental gap is attributable to our inability to experimentally manipulate TFS cues without altering other perceptually relevant cues. Here, we circumnavigated this limitation by leveraging individual differences across 200 participants to systematically compare variations in TFS sensitivity to performance in a range of speech perception tasks. TFS sensitivity was assessed through detection of interaural time/phase differences, while speech perception was evaluated by word identification under noise interference. Results suggest that greater TFS sensitivity is not associated with greater masking release from fundamental-frequency or spatial cues but appears to contribute to resilience against the effects of reverberation. We also found that greater TFS sensitivity is associated with faster response times, indicating reduced listening effort. These findings highlight the perceptual significance of TFS coding for everyday hearing.",

          "abstract": "Microbial metabolism is impressively flexible, enabling growth even when available nutrients differ greatly from biomass in redox state. Escherichia coli , for example, rearranges its physiology to grow on reduced and oxidized carbon sources through several forms of fermentation and respiration. To understand the limits on and evolutionary consequences of this metabolic flexibility, we developed a coarse-grained mathematical framework coupling redox chemistry with principles of cellular resource allocation. Our models inherit key qualities from both of their antecedents: i) describing diverse metabolic chemistries and ii) enforcing the simultaneous balancing of atom (e.g., carbon), electron, and energy (adenosine triphosphate) flows, as in redox models, while iii) treating biomass as both the product and catalyst of the growth process, as in resource allocation models. Assembling integrated models of respiration, fermentation, and photosynthesis clarified key microbiological phenomena, including demonstrating that autotrophs grow more slowly than heterotrophs because of constraints imposed by the intracellular production of reduced carbon. Our model further predicted that heterotrophic growth is improved by matching the redox state of biomass to the nutrient environment. Through analysis of ≈ 60,000 genomes and diverse proteomic datasets, we found evidence that proteins indeed accumulate amino acid substitutions promoting redox matching. We therefore propose an unexpected mode of genome evolution where substitutions neutral or even deleterious to the individual biochemical or structural functions of proteins can nonetheless be selected due to a redox-chemical benefit to the population.",

In this work, our results reveal mitochondria as the first organelle to undergo morphological changes through swelling, fission, and fusion in cell necrosis, leading to the rupture of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sheet adhered to the mitochondria. Meanwhile, the ER tubules are then reconstructed by stretching and fusion of autophagosomes. Moreover, APBD allows us to directly visualize spatially resolved distribution of biomembranes vs. water inside single mammalian cells. Our findings show that the renal ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) model results in the increased biomembrane to cytoplasmic water ratio in the tissue. This reveals intracellular water heterogeneity between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during the IRI process.

One idea is that synapses which experienced recent plasticity become resistant to further plasticity, a type of metaplasticity often referred to as saturation. Here, we probe the local dendritic mechanisms that limit plasticity at recently potentiated synapses. We show that recently potentiated individual synapses exhibit a synapse-specific refractory period for further potentiation. We further found that the refractory period is associated with reduced postsynaptic CaMKII signaling; however, stronger synaptic activation fully restored CaMKII signaling but only partially restored the ability for further plasticity. Importantly, the refractory period is released after one hour, a timing that coincides with the enrichment of several postsynaptic proteins to preplasticity levels. Notably, increasing the level of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, PSD95, but not of PSD93, overcomes the refractory period. Our results support a model in which potentiation at a single synapse is sufficient to initiate a synapse-specific refractory period that persists until key postsynaptic proteins regain their steady-state synaptic levels.",

Although lead exposure routes were many and included the use of glazed tablewares, paints, cosmetics, and even intentional ingestion, the most significant for the nonelite, rural majority of the population may have been through background air pollution from mining and smelting of silver and lead ores that underpinned the Roman economy. Here, we determined potential health effects of this air pollution using Arctic ice core measurements of Roman-era lead pollution, atmospheric modeling, and modern epidemiology-based relationships between air concentrations, blood lead levels (BLLs), and cognitive decline. Findings suggest air lead concentrations exceeded 150 ng/m 3 near metallurgical emission sources, with average enhancements of &gt;1.0 ng/m 3 over Europe during the Pax Romana apogee of the Roman Empire. The result was blood lead enhancements in young children of about 2.4 µg/dl above an estimated Neolithic background of 1.0 µg/dl, leading to widespread cognitive decline including a 2.5-to-3 point reduction in intelligence quotient throughout the Roman Empire.",

          "abstract": "From RNA interference to chromatin silencing, diverse genome defense pathways silence selfish genetic elements to safeguard genome integrity. Despite their diversity, different defense pathways share a modular organization, where numerous specificity factors identify diverse targets and common effectors silence them. In the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, target RNAs are first identified by complementary base pairing with piRNAs and then silenced by PIWI-clade nucleases. Such a binary architecture allows the defense systems to be readily adaptable, where new targets can be captured via innovation of specificity factors. Thus, our current understanding of genome defense against lineage-specific selfish genes has been largely limited to specificity factor innovations, while it remains poorly understood whether other types of innovations are required. Here, we describe a new type of innovation, which escalates the genome defense capacity to control a recently expanded selfish gene in Drosophila melanogaster . Through a targeted RNAi screen for repressors of Stellate —a recently evolved meiotic driver—we identified a defense factor, Trailblazer. Trailblazer is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of two PIWI-clade nucleases, Aub and AGO3, to match Stellate in abundance. Recent innovation in the DNA-binding domain of Trailblazer enabled it to elevate Aub and AGO3 expression, thereby escalating the silencing capacity of piRNA pathway to tame expanded Stellate and safeguard fertility. As copy-number expansion is a recurrent feature of diverse selfish genes across the tree of life, we envision that augmenting the defense capacity to quantitatively match selfish genes is a repeatedly employed defense strategy in evolution.",

          "abstract": "High degree of fluorination for ether electrolytes has resulted in improved cycling stability of lithium metal batteries due to stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and good oxidative stability. However, the sluggish ion transport and environmental concerns of high fluorination degree drive the need to develop less fluorinated structures. Here, we depart from the traditional ether backbone and introduce bis(2-fluoroethoxy)methane (F2DEM), featuring monofluorination of the acetal backbone. High coulombic efficiency and stable long-term cycling in Li||Cu half cells can be achieved with F2DEM even under fast Li metal plating conditions. The performance of F2DEM is further compared with diethoxymethane (DEM) and 2-[2-(2,2-difluoroethoxy)ethoxy]-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (F5DEE). A significantly lower overpotential is observed with F2DEM, which improves energy efficiency and enables its application in high-rate conditions. Comparative studies of F2DEM with DEM and F5DEE in anode-free lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4 ) LFP pouch cells and high-loading LFP coin cells further show improved capacity retention of F2DEM electrolyte, demonstrating its practical applicability. More importantly, we also extensively investigate the underlying mechanism for the superior performance of F2DEM through various techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy, focused ion beam, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and titration gas chromatography. Overall, F2DEM facilitates improved Li deposition morphology with reduced amount of dead Li. This enables F2DEM to show superior performance, especially under higher charging and slower discharging rate conditions.",

          "abstract": "Transgenic expression of a double-stranded RNA in plants can induce silencing of homologous mRNAs in fungal pathogens. Although such host-induced gene silencing is well documented, the molecular mechanisms by which RNAs can move from the cytoplasm of plant cells across the plasma membrane of both the host cell and fungal cell are poorly understood. Indirect evidence suggests that this RNA transfer may occur at a very early stage of the infection process, prior to breach of the host cell wall, suggesting that silencing RNAs might be secreted onto leaf surfaces. To assess whether Arabidopsis plants possess a mechanism for secreting RNA onto leaf surfaces, we developed a protocol for isolating leaf surface RNA separately from intercellular (apoplastic) RNA. This protocol yielded abundant leaf surface RNA that displayed an RNA banding pattern distinct from apoplastic RNA, suggesting that it may be secreted directly onto the leaf surface rather than exuded through stomata or hydathodes. Notably, this RNA was not associated with either extracellular vesicles or protein complexes; however, RNA species longer than 100 nucleotides could be pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, pelleting was inhibited by the divalent cation chelator EGTA, suggesting that these RNAs may form condensates on the leaf surface. These leaf surface RNAs are derived almost exclusively from Arabidopsis, but come from diverse genomic sources, including rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, intergenic RNA, microRNAs, and small interfering RNAs, with tRNAs especially enriched. We speculate that endogenous leaf surface RNA plays an important role in the assembly of distinct microbial communities on leaf surfaces.",

This optimization is conducted under realistic constraints, such as limits on the number of available molecules. Remarkably, the optimal networks we derive closely match the architecture and spatial gene expression profiles observed in the real organism. Our framework quantifies the tradeoffs involved in maximizing functional performance and allows for the exploration of alternative network configurations, addressing the question of which features are necessary and which are contingent.

To determine the basis of this mtDNA–cancer association, we analyzed conplastic mice with the C57BL/6J (B6) nucleus but two naturally occurring mtDNA lineages, mtDNA B6 and mtDNA NZB , where mtDNA NZB mitochondria generate more oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-derived reactive oxygen species (mROS). In a cardiac transplant model, mtDNA B6 Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells supported long-term allograft survival, whereas mtDNA NZB Treg cells failed to suppress host T effector (Teff) cells, leading to acute rejection. When challenged with melanoma or colon cancer cells, the mtDNA NZB mice exhibited strikingly impaired tumor growth while mtDNA B6 mice showed Treg-dependent inhibition of Teff cells and allowed rapid tumor growth. Transcriptional analysis showed that activation of mtDNA NZB Teff cells increased mitochondrial gene expression while activation of mtDNA NZB Treg cells impaired mitochondrial gene expression and resulted in mtDNA NZB Treg cell exhaustion. Induction of the mitochondrially targeted catalytic antioxidant, mCAT, in hematopoietic cells normalized mtDNA NZB Treg function in both transplant and tumor models, indicating a key role for mROS in promoting Treg dysfunction. Anti-PD-L1 therapy did not modulate these effects, indicating that modulation of host mitochondrial function provides an independent approach for enhancing tumor cell destruction.",

Supported by multiple independent lines of geological evidence and examined through an iodine mass balance model, we find that elevated marine iodide content prevailed through most of Earth’s history. Since the rise of oxygen ~2.4 billion years ago, high marine iodide concentrations would have led to significant inorganic iodine emissions to the atmosphere, facilitating catalytic ozone destruction and resulting in atmospheric ozone instability with periodic or persistently lower ozone levels. At a global scale, unstable and low ozone levels likely persisted for about two billion years until the early Phanerozoic, roughly 0.5 billion years ago.

Here, we delineate the localization dynamics of three mammalian CORs in the mouse and determine their interdependencies. RNF212, HEI10, and the newest member RNF212B show divergent spatiotemporal dynamics along synapsed chromosomes, including profound differences in spermatocytes and oocytes, that are not easily reconciled by elementary coarsening models. Contrasting mutant phenotypes and genetic requirements indicate that RNF212B, RNF212, and HEI10 play distinct but interdependent functions in regulating meiotic recombination and coordinating the events of meiotic prophase-I by integrating signals from DNA breaks, homolog synapsis, the cell-cycle, and incipient crossover sites.",

This component is expressed as a large patch on the near side of the Moon and a possible smaller patch in the northwest portion of the Moon’s South Pole-Aitken basin on the far side. Thermal models estimate that the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) could have spanned from 10 and 200 My, while studies of radioactive decay systems have yielded inconsistent ages for the completion of LMO crystallization covering over 160 My. Here, we show that the Moon achieved &gt;99% crystallization at 4,429 ± 76 Ma, indicating a lunar formation age of ~4,450 Ma or possibly older. Using the 176 Lu– 176 Hf decay system ( t 1/2 = 37 Gy), we found that the initial 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios of lunar zircons with varied U–Pb ages are consistent with their crystallization from a KREEP-rich reservoir with a consistently low 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratio of 0.0167 that emerged ~140 My after solar system formation. The previously proposed younger model age of ~4.33 Ga for the source of mare basalts (240 My after solar system formation) might reflect the timing of a large impact. Our results demonstrate that lunar magma ocean crystallization took place while the Moon was still battered by planetary embryos and planetesimals leftover from the main stage of planetary accretion. The study of Lu–Hf model ages for samples brought back from the South Pole-Aitken basin will help to assess the lateral continuity of KREEP and further understand its significance in the early history of the Moon.",

For over 50 y, the high organic content of Archean (&gt;2.5 Ga) mudrocks has puzzled geologists and evolutionary biologists, because high biological primary productivity was unexpected for the nascent biosphere before the rise of O 2 . Here, we took a different approach to resolve this apparent paradox, by studying the accumulation rates of Archean organic-rich mudrocks. We evaluated the sedimentation rates of three sections of the Mount McRae Shale and Jeerinah Formation (2.68 to 2.48 Ga, Pilbara Craton, Australia) with new and recently published U–Pb zircon ages from intraformational ash beds. For comparison, we compiled Phanerozoic (&lt;500 Ma) data from comparable depositional settings and developed an idealized model that considers the sedimentation rates for predicting rock organic content. We found that organic-rich Archean mudrocks were deposited under exceptionally low sedimentation rates (~1 m/Ma), in sharp contrast to organic-rich rocks from the Phanerozoic Eon (10 to 100 m/Ma). Constrained by observations, model results indicated that the Archean data reflect low primary productivity (~100-fold lower than during the Phanerozoic) and enhanced preservation under anoxic conditions, with the principal control on organic carbon content provided by dilution with inorganic sediment. Thus, the high organic carbon content which is typically attributed to high productivity instead reflects slow accumulation, high preservation, and minimal inorganic dilution—reconciling the geological evidence with a slow carbon cycle cadence during Archean time.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the structure of real data is paramount in advancing modern deep-learning methodologies. Natural data such as images are believed to be composed of features organized in a hierarchical and combinatorial manner, which neural networks capture during learning. Recent advancements show that diffusion models can generate high-quality images, hinting at their ability to capture this underlying compositional structure. We study this phenomenon in a hierarchical generative model of data. We find that the backward diffusion process acting after a time t is governed by a phase transition at some threshold time, where the probability of reconstructing high-level features, like the class of an image, suddenly drops. Instead, the reconstruction of low-level features, such as specific details of an image, evolves smoothly across the whole diffusion process. This result implies that at times beyond the transition, the class has changed, but the generated sample may still be composed of low-level elements of the initial image. We validate these theoretical insights through numerical experiments on class-unconditional ImageNet diffusion models. Our analysis characterizes the relationship between time and scale in diffusion models and puts forward generative models as powerful tools to model combinatorial data properties.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) has greatly diminished the neutralizing activity of previously FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including that of antibody cocktails and of first-generation broadly neutralizing antibodies such as S309 (Sotrovimab). In contrast, antibodies targeting cryptic conformational epitopes of the receptor binding domain (RBD) have demonstrated broad activity against emerging variants, but exert only moderate neutralizing activity, which has so far hindered clinical development. Here, we utilize in vitro display technology to identify and affinity-mature antibodies targeting the cryptic class 6 epitope, accessible only in the “up” conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer. Increasing antibody affinity into the low picomolar range endowed potent neutralization of VOCs and protection of hACE2 mice from viral challenge. Cryoelectron microscopy and crystal structures of two affinity-matured antibodies (4C12-B12 and 4G1-C2) in complex with RBD highlighted binding modes and epitopes distal from mutational hotspots commonly overserved in VOCs, providing direct structural insights into the observed mutational resistance. Moreover, we further demonstrate that antibodies targeting the class 6 epitope, rather than being an artifact of in vitro selection, are common in the IgG1 + memory B cell repertoire of convalescent patients and can be induced in human antibody V-gene transgenic mice through immunization. Our results highlight the importance of very high (picomolar) affinity in the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines and suggest an affinity threshold in the provision of broad and long-lasting immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",

          "abstract": "Myosin-VIIA (MYO7A) is an unconventional myosin responsible for syndromic (Usher 1B) or nonsyndromic forms of deafness in humans when mutated. In the cochlea, MYO7A is expressed in hair cells, where it is believed to act as the motor protein tensioning the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels, thus setting their resting open probability ( P o ). However, direct evidence for this unique role for an unconventional myosin in mature hair cells is lacking. Here, we show that MYO7A has a distinct role in hair cells, being crucial for the structural integrity of hair bundles. Postnatal deletion of Myo7a leads to 87 to 96% reduction in MYO7A from hair cells by postnatal day 20 (P20), without affecting hearing function. During the following week, mice showed progressive decline in both hearing function and MET current amplitude in hair cells without affecting the resting P o and calcium sensitivity of the MET channel. Hair-bundle stiffness was normal at P20 but halved at P30, despite it having a normal staircase morphology and tip links. The reduction of MYO7A in the stereocilia (&gt;87%) increased their vulnerability to sound-induced damage, with significantly more hearing loss and hair bundle deterioration than in control mice. RNA-sequencing identified a downregulation of several stereociliary genes in the Myo7a -deficient cochlea, indicating the presence of indirect compensatory mechanisms. This study reveals that mature hair cells seem to use a MYO7A-independent mechanism to maintain the resting P o of the MET channels. Instead, MYO7A is essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the hair bundles.",

          "abstract": "Sleep spindles are cortical electrical oscillations considered critical for memory consolidation and sleep stability. The timing and pattern of sleep spindles are likely to be important in driving synaptic plasticity during sleep as well as preventing disruption of sleep by sensory and internal stimuli. However, the relative importance of factors such as sleep depth, cortical up/down-state, and temporal clustering in governing sleep spindle dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze sleep data from 1,025 participants, statistically modeling the simultaneous influences of multiple factors on moment-to-moment spindle production using a point process-generalized linear model framework. Results reveal fingerprint-like timing patterns, characterized by a refractory period followed by a period of increased spindle activity, which are highly individualized yet consistent night-to-night, with increased variability with age. Strikingly, short-term (&lt;15 s) temporal patterns of past spindle history are the main determinant of spindle timing, accounting for over 70% of the statistical deviance—surpassing the contribution of factors such as cortical up/down-state (slow oscillation phase), sleep depth, and long-term history (15 to 90 s, including ~50 s infraslow activity). Short-term history has a statistically significant influence in over 98% of the population, suggesting it is a near-universal feature of spindle activity. Short-term history and slow oscillation phase exert independent effects on spindle timing. Our results establish a robust statistical framework to examine abnormalities in sleep spindle timing observed in neurological disorders and aging, as well as the relationship between individualized sleep spindle timing, cognition, and sleep stability.",

          "abstract": "Physical materials from planetary bodies are crucial for understanding fundamental processes that constrain the evolution of the solar system, as samples can be analyzed at high precision and accuracy in Earth-based laboratories. Mars is the only planet outside of Earth from which we possess samples in the form of meteorites. Martian meteorites (n &gt; 350) have enabled constraints to be placed on various aspects of the red planet’s formation and evolution, notably: that Mars accreted and differentiated rapidly; that the planet has a complex volatile element evolution; and that it has always been volcanically active with a rich and diverse magmatic history. Meteorites have limitations, however, with lack of field context, restricted lithological diversity compared to the martian surface, and with no sampling of a major portion of Mars’ history between 4.1 and 2.4 billion years ago. Returned samples from Mars have the potential to fill these gaps and answer many open questions driven by the study of meteorites, as well as reveal new fundamental research questions. Key questions that Mars Sample Return is likely to answer regard the basic evolution of the martian interior and surface, its potential for habitability and the possibility of past life, and calibration of age dating of the martian surface. Samples of various lithologies and different ages collected at Jezero crater by the Perseverance rover will aid in better understanding our own planet and will answer outstanding questions regarding Mars’ future geological evolution and habitability.",

          "abstract": "The radiogenic isotopic compositions of basaltic Martian meteorites (shergottites) and clinopyroxene/olivine cumulate meteorites (nakhlite/chassignites) are used to define the global evolution of Mars. However, the two main groups of meteorites demonstrate that their sources underwent divergent styles of magmatic evolution. The shergottites portray a planet that differentiated ~4.52 billion years ago via solidification of a magma ocean, producing incompatible element-depleted and -enriched reservoirs that remained isolated until melt production. In contrast, the reservoir from which the nakhlite/chassignites derive may have formed earlier, produced melts that fractionated Sm/Nd and Hf/W differently, was compositionally less variable, and experienced a significantly more complex history following primordial differentiation than the shergottite sources. The disparate histories recorded by these two groups of meteorites elucidate important questions that could be addressed by acquiring additional samples. Obtaining samples that shared the isotopic systematics of the shergottites would provide confidence that extrapolating the primordial differentiation history of Mars from shergottite radiogenic isotope systematics is reasonable. Returned samples from Mars will also constrain the physical locations of the meteorite source regions, providing insights into the general structure of the Martian mantle. In addition, they will help constrain the phases present in the martian mantle during melting and the conditions under which they are stable. Finally, identifying an evolved lithology that satisfies the geochemical and isotopic constraints placed on the incompatible element-enriched endmember observed in the shergottites would define the nature of magmatic evolution on Mars and whether it is more akin to processes on the Earth or the Moon.",

          "abstract": "To achieve replicative immortality, cancer cells must activate telomere maintenance mechanisms. In 10 to 15% of cancers, this is enabled by recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres pathways (ALT). ALT cells display several hallmarks including heterogeneous telomere length, extrachromosomal telomeric repeats, and ALT-associated PML bodies. ALT cells also have high telomeric replication stress (RS) enhanced by fork-stalling structures (R-loops and G4s) and altered chromatin states. In ALT cells, telomeric RS promotes telomere elongation but above a certain threshold becomes detrimental to cell survival. Manipulating RS at telomeres has thus been proposed as a therapeutic strategy against ALT cancers. Through analysis of genome-wide CRISPR fitness screens, we identified ALT-specific vulnerabilities and describe here our characterization of the roles of SUB1, a ssDNA-binding protein, in telomere stability. SUB1 depletion increases RS at ALT telomeres, profoundly impairing ALT cell growth without impacting telomerase-positive cells. During RS, SUB1 is recruited to stalled forks and ALT telomeres via its ssDNA-binding domain. This recruitment is potentiated by RPA depletion, suggesting that these factors may compete for ssDNA. The viability of ALT cells and their resilience toward RS also requires ssDNA binding by SUB1. SUB1 depletion accelerates cell death induced by FANCM depletion, triggering unsustainable levels of telomeric damage in ALT cells. Finally, combining SUB1 depletion with RS-inducing drugs rapidly induces replication catastrophe in ALT cells. Altogether, our work identifies SUB1 as an ALT susceptibility with roles in the mitigation of RS at ALT telomeres and suggests advanced therapeutic strategies for a host of still poorly managed cancers.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a time-energy uncertainty relation within the context of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. Our uncertainty relation has also been validated through remote experiments conducted on an International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) quantum computer. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.",

However, the existence of endogenous stem cells with multiple lineage potentials in the adult spinal cord remains a compelling area of research. In this study, we present a cross-species investigation that extends from development to injury. We used single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing and genetic lineage tracing to characterize neural cells in the spinal cord. Our findings show that ciliated ependymal cells lose neural progenitor gene signatures and proliferation ability following the differentiation of NPCs within the ventricular zone. By combining single-nucleus transcriptome datasets from the rhesus macaque spinal cord injury (SCI) model with developmental human spinal cord datasets, we revealed that ciliated ependymal cells respond minimally to injury and cannot revert to a developmental progenitor state. Intriguingly, we observed astrocytes transdifferentiating into mature oligodendrocytes postinjury through lineage tracing experiments. Further analysis identifies an intermediate-state glial cell population expressing both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte feature genes in adult spinal cords. The transition ratio from astrocytes into oligodendrocytes increased after remodeling injury microenvironment by functional scaffolds. Overall, our results highlight the remarkable multilineage potential of astrocytes in the adult spinal cord.",

In contrast, little is known about the chemosensory world of spiders and nothing about how they perform olfaction despite their important ecological role. The orb-weaving spider Argiope bruennichi lends itself to an in-depth study on olfaction as it is one of the few spider species whose volatile sex pheromone, emitted by females to attract males, is known. We combined ultrastructural and electrophysiological analyses and found that previously overlooked sensilla with wall pores are abundant on all walking legs of A. bruennichi males. We compared the ultrastructure of these wall-pore sensilla with those known to perform olfaction in insects, exploring similarities and differences. Electrophysiological single sensillum recordings demonstrated that the wall-pore sensilla in A. bruennichi respond highly sensitive and in a concentration-dependent manner to the sex pheromone. Our study demonstrates male-specific sensilla for detecting signaling females, whereas females and subadult males are devoid of wall pore sensilla. In a preliminary comparative morphological analysis using 19 species from 16 spider families, we found that wall-pore sensilla occur in male spiders from most, but not in basally branching clades or in Salticids, suggesting that wall-pore sensilla evolved at least once within spiders and were lost at least once. This research significantly expands our knowledge of the sensory ecology of spiders, will stimulate studies on the diversity and function of sensilla, as well as studies on the evolution of olfaction in arthropods.",

Highly diagnostic markers of past life are biomarkers, organic molecules whose architecture can be attributed to once living organisms. Similar organic molecular structures can also be used to identify the prebiotic steps that preceded any emergence of life. The style of modification or degradation of such organic structures indicates their agents of change, including oxidants, radiation, heating, water, and pressure. For biomarker analysis, sample return provides enhanced opportunities for sample preparation and analyte isolation. The augmentation of biomarker data with spatial information provides the opportunity for confirmatory data but is a multistep and multitechnique process best achieved here on Earth.

Large language models (LLMs) can select relevant literature, but their quality and efficacy are still being determined compared to humans.

In the three SRs, 185/4,662, 122/1,741, and 45/66 articles have been selected and considered for full-text screening by two independent reviewers. Due to technical variations and the inability of the LLMs to classify all records, the LLM’s considered sample sizes were smaller. However, on average, the 18 LLMs classified 4,294 (min 4,130; max 4,329), 1,539 (min 1,449; max 1,574), and 27 (min 22; max 37) of the titles and abstracts correctly as either included or excluded for the three SRs, respectively. Additional analysis revealed that the definitions of the inclusion criteria and conceptual designs significantly influenced the LLM performances. In conclusion, LLMs can reduce one reviewer´s workload between 33% and 93% during title and abstract screening.

          "abstract": "Ataxia–telangiectasia (A-T) is a pleiotropic genome instability syndrome resulting from the loss of the homeostatic protein kinase ATM. The complex phenotype of A-T includes progressive cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, gonadal atrophy, interstitial lung disease, cancer predisposition, endocrine abnormalities, chromosomal instability, radiosensitivity, and segmental premature aging. Cultured skin fibroblasts from A-T patients exhibit premature senescence, highlighting the association between genome instability, cellular senescence, and aging. We found that lung fibroblasts derived from ATM-deficient mice provide a versatile experimental system to explore the mechanisms driving the premature senescence of primary fibroblasts lacking ATM. Atm −/− fibroblasts failed to proliferate under ambient oxygen conditions (21%). Although they initially proliferated under physiological oxygen levels (3%), they rapidly entered senescence. In contrast, wild-type (WT) lung fibroblasts did not senesce under 3% oxygen and eventually underwent immortalization and neoplastic transformation. However, rapid senescence could be induced in WT cells either by Atm gene ablation or persistent chemical inhibition of ATM kinase activity, with senescence induced by ATM inhibition being reversible upon inhibitor removal. Moreover, the concomitant loss of ATM and p53 led to senescence evasion, vigorous growth, rampant genome instability, and subsequent immortalization and transformation. Our findings reveal that the rapid senescence of Atm −/− lung fibroblasts is driven by the collaborative action of the cGAS–STING, p38 MAPK, and p53 pathways in response to persistent DNA damage, ultimately leading to the induction of interferon-α1 and downstream interferon-stimulated genes. We propose that accelerated cellular senescence may exacerbate specific A-T symptoms, particularly contributing to the progressive, life-threatening interstitial lung disease often observed in A-T patients during adulthood.",

However, whether mosquito populations could maintain their warm edges through evolutionary adaptation remains unknown. Here, we investigate the potential for thermal adaptation in Aedes sierrensis , a congener of the major disease vector species that experiences large thermal gradients in its native range, by assaying tolerance to prolonged and acute heat exposure, and its genetic basis in a diverse, field-derived population. We found pervasive evidence of heritable genetic variation in mosquito heat tolerance, and phenotypic trade-offs in tolerance to prolonged versus acute heat exposure. Further, we found genomic variation associated with prolonged heat tolerance was clustered in several regions of the genome, suggesting the presence of larger structural variants such as chromosomal inversions. A simple evolutionary model based on our data estimates that the maximum rate of evolutionary adaptation in mosquito heat tolerance will exceed the projected rate of climate warming, implying the potential for mosquitoes to track warming via genetic adaptation.",

          "abstract": "CAG/CTG repeats are prone to expansion, causing several inherited human diseases. The initiating sources of DNA damage which lead to inaccurate repair of the repeat tract to cause expansions are not fully understood. Expansion-prone CAG/CTG repeats are actively transcribed and prone to forming stable R-loops with hairpin structures forming on the displaced single-stranded DNA (S-loops). We previously determined that damage by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytosine deaminase, Fcy1, was required for both fragility and instability of CAG/CTG tracts engaged in R-loops. To determine whether this mechanism is more universal, we expressed human cytidine deaminases APOBEC3A (A3A), APOBEC3B (A3B), or activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in our yeast system. We show that mutagenic activity of Apolipoprotein B messenger RNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptides causes CAG/CTG fragility and instability, with A3A having the greatest effect followed by A3B and least from AID. A3A-induced repeat fragility was exacerbated by enrichment of R-loops at the repeat site. A3A and A3B-induced instability was dependent on the MutLγ nuclease and to a lesser extent, base excision repair factors. Deaminase activity assays on hairpin substrates containing CTG and GTC triplet sequences revealed that A3A prefers cytidines within the hairpin loop, and bulges in the hairpin stem alter preferred locations. Analysis of RNA expression levels in human cortex samples revealed that A3A is expressed in brain tissue that exhibits CAG/CTG repeat expansions and its expression is elevated in Huntington’s disease (HD) patient samples. These results implicate cytidine deamination by A3A as a potential source of repeat expansions in HD and other CAG/CTG repeat expansion disorders.",

We report a set of simple iron porphyrins with pendant thiol group can catalyze the reduction of CO 2 to ethane (C 2 H 6 ) with H 2 O as the proton source with a Faradaic yield &gt;40% the rest being CO. The mechanism involves a CO 2 -derived methyl group transfer to the pendant thiol akin to the proposal forwarded for methyl transferases and a follow-up C–C bond formation of the thioether thus formed and a Fe(II)–CH 3 species generated by the reduction of a second molecule of CO 2 . The availability of a “parking space” in the molecular framework for the first reduced C 1 product from CO 2 reduction allows C–C bond formation resulting in a unique case where a component of natural gas can be generated from direct electrochemical reduction of CO 2 .",

          "abstract": "A fundamental topological principle is that the container always shapes the content. In neuroscience, this translates into how the brain anatomy shapes brain dynamics. From neuroanatomy, the topology of the mammalian brain can be approximated by local connectivity, accurately described by an exponential distance rule (EDR). The compact, folded geometry of the cortex is shaped by this local connectivity, and the geometric harmonic modes can reconstruct much of the functional dynamics. However, this ignores the fundamental role of the rare long-range (LR) cortical connections, crucial for improving information processing in the mammalian brain, but not captured by local cortical folding and geometry. Here, we show the superiority of harmonic modes combining rare LR connectivity with EDR (EDR+LR) in capturing functional dynamics (specifically LR functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity) compared to geometry and EDR representations. Importantly, the orchestration of dynamics is carried out by a more efficient manifold made up of a low number of fundamental EDR+LR modes. Our results show the importance of rare LR connectivity for capturing the complexity of functional brain activity through a low-dimensional manifold shaped by fundamental EDR+LR modes.",

          "abstract": "ASXL transcriptional regulator 1 (ASXL1) is one of the three most frequently mutated genes in age-related clonal hematopoiesis (CH), alongside DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) and Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 ( TET2) . CH can progress to myeloid malignancies including chronic monomyelocytic leukemia (CMML) and is also strongly associated with inflammatory cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in humans. DNMT3A and TET2 regulate DNA methylation and demethylation pathways, respectively, and loss-of-function mutations in these genes reduce DNA methylation in heterochromatin, allowing derepression of silenced elements in heterochromatin. In contrast, the mechanisms that connect mutant ASXL1 and CH are not yet fully understood. CH/CMML-associated ASXL1 mutations encode C-terminally truncated proteins that enhance the deubiquitinase activity of the ASXL-BAP1 “PR-DUB” deubiquitinase complex, which removes monoubiquitin from H2AK119Ub. Here, we show that ASXL1 mutant proteins interact with the euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferases 1 and 2 (EHMT1–EHMT2) complex, which generates H3K9me1 and me2, the latter a repressive modification in constitutive heterochromatin. Compared to cells from age-matched wild-type mice, we found that expanded myeloid cells from old (≥18-mo-old) Asxl1tm/+ mice, a heterozygous knock-in mouse model of CH, display genome-wide decreases of H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H2AK119Ub as well as an associated increase in expression of transposable elements (TEs) and satellite repeats. Increased TE expression was also observed in monocytes from ASXL1 -mutant CMML patients compared to monocytes from healthy controls. Our data suggest that mutant ASXL1 proteins compromise the integrity of both constitutive and facultative heterochromatin in an age-dependent manner by reducing the levels of H3K9me2/3 and H2AK119Ub. This increase in TE expression correlated with increased expression of nearby genes, including many interferon-inducible (inflammation-associated) genes (ISGs).",

It is presumed to also have a mitochondrial function because EndoG deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which EndoG regulates mitochondrial function is not known. Fat accumulation in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is more common in men, is caused in part by mitochondrial dysfunction. EndoG expression is reduced in MASLD liver, and EndoG deficiency causes MASLD in an obesity-independent manner but only in males. EndoG promotes mitochondrial respiration by resolving mitochondrial tRNA/DNA hybrids formed during mtDNA transcription by recruiting RNA helicase DHX30 to unwind them. EndoG also cleaves off the 3′-end of the H-strand transcript that can prevent mt-tRNA Thr precursor cloverleaf-folding, and processing, which increases mt-tRNA Thr production and mitochondrial translation. Using fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy technology to visualize oxygen consumption at the individual mitochondrion level, we found that EndoG deficiency leads to the selective loss of a mitochondrial subpopulation with high-oxygen consumption. This defect was reversed with mt-tRNA Thr supplementation. Thus, EndoG promotes mitochondrial respiration by selectively regulating the production of mt-tRNA Thr in male mice.",

The Mars Sample Return (MSR) Campaign, a joint effort between NASA and ESA, aims to bring the Perseverance collection back to Earth for intense scientific investigation. As the first return of samples from a habitable world, there are important challenges to overcome for the successful implementation of the MSR Campaign from the point of sample collection on Mars to the long-term curation of the samples on Earth. In particular, the successful execution of planetary protection protocols adds well-warranted complexity to every step of the process from the two MSR Program flight elements to the ground element at the sample receiving facility (SRF). In this contribution, we describe the architecture of the MSR Campaign, with a focus on infrastructure needs for the curation (i.e., the clean storage, processing, and allocation) of pristine Martian samples. Curation is a science-enabling and planetary protection-enabling activity, and the curation practices described in this contribution for the SRF and any long-term curation facility will enable the sample safety assessment, initial scientific investigations of the samples, and establish the MSR collection as a scientific resource that will enable generations of science and discovery through studies of the returned Mars samples. The planetary protection and curation processes established for MSR will provide critical insights into potential future sample return missions from other habitable worlds like Enceladus and Europa.",

          "abstract": "Induced earthquakes are manifestations of highly heterogeneous distributions of effective stress changes imparted by anthropogenic activities such as hydraulic fracturing and wastewater injection. It is critical to disentangle the mechanisms behind these earthquakes to better assess seismic risk. Here, a clustering methodology is applied to a catalog of 21,536 induced earthquakes detected during a 36-d hydraulic stimulation program in Western Canada. The results reveal that clustered events nucleate at short recurrence times generally less than 6 min. Notably, the clustered events are not characterized by short interevent distances as seen in regional-scale studies. Numerical modeling reveals that earthquakes cluster preferentially in regions of significantly lower pore pressure change ( Δ P ). Furthermore, clustered earthquakes exhibit significantly more chain-like topologies with decreasing Δ P , in agreement with laboratory studies showing that fault materials transition to rate-strengthening behavior with increasing Δ P . Proxy estimates for pore pressure change suggest these observations are consistent across Western Canada, and highlight the potential for significant temporal segmentation of induced earthquake processes.",

However, the nature and history of the dynamo and crustal magnetization are poorly understood given the lack of well-preserved, oriented, ancient samples with geologic context available for laboratory study. Here, we describe how magnetic measurements of returned samples could transform our understanding of six key unknowns about Mars’ planetary evolution and habitability. Such measurements could i) determine the history of the Martian dynamo field’s intensity; ii) determine the history of the Martian dynamo field’s direction; iii) test the hypothesis that Mars experienced plate tectonics or true polar wander; iv) constrain the thermal and aqueous alteration history of the samples; v) identify sources of Martian crustal magnetization and vi) characterize sedimentary and magmatic processes on Mars.

The PFAS family includes thousands of potential chemical structures containing organofluorine moieties. Exposures to a few well-studied PFAS, mainly perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA), have been associated with increased risk of many adverse health outcomes, prompting federal drinking water regulations for six compounds in 2024. Here, we find that the six regulated PFAS (mean = 7 to 8%) and 18 measured PFAA (mean = 11 to 21%) make up only a small fraction of the extractable organofluorine (EOF) in influent and effluent from eight large municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Most of the EOF in influent (75%) and effluent (62%) consists of mono- and polyfluorinated pharmaceuticals. The treatment technology and sizes of the treatment facilities in this study are similar to those serving 70% of the US population. Despite advanced treatment technologies, the maximum EOF removal efficiency among facilities in this work was &lt;25%. Extrapolating our measurements to other large facilities across the United States results in a nationwide EOF discharge estimate of 1.0 to 2.8 million moles F y −1 . Using a national model that simulates connections between wastewater discharges and downstream drinking water intakes, we estimate that the sources of drinking water for up to 23 million Americans could be contaminated above regulatory thresholds by wastewater-derived PFAS alone. These results emphasize the importance of further curbing ongoing PFAS sources and additional evaluations of the fate and toxicity of fluorinated pharmaceuticals.",

The United States is now planning for human missions to Mars, a planet where dust can also be expected to be ubiquitous for many or most landing sites. For these missions, the design and operations of key hardware systems must take this dust into account, especially when related to crew health and safety. Improved understanding of Martian dust characteristics can inform its potential to also perform transport of microorganisms, both those inadvertently brought to Mars by the astronauts, or, if Martian microorganisms exist, the potential for their inadvertent return to Earth with the astronauts. Careful planning and design are needed to assure that future missions do not violate the United Nations Outer Space Treaty (1967) signed by all spacefaring nations. In this paper, we review the impact of lunar dust on the Apollo missions and identify several questions about dust in the atmosphere of Mars that may be answered by the curated samples that would be returned by the planned Mars Sample Return (MSR) Campaign.

          "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation signaling networks have a central role in how cells sense and respond to their environment. We engineered artificial phosphorylation networks in which reversible enzymatic phosphorylation cycles were assembled from modular protein domain parts and wired together to create synthetic phosphorylation circuits in human cells. Our design scheme enabled model-guided tuning of circuit function and the ability to make diverse network connections; synthetic phosphorylation circuits can be coupled to upstream cell surface receptors to enable fast-timescale sensing of extracellular ligands, and downstream connections can regulate gene expression. We engineered cell-based cytokine controllers that dynamically sense and suppress activated T cells. Our work introduces a generalizable approach that allows the design of signaling circuits that enable user-defined sense-and-respond function for diverse biosensing and therapeutic applications.",

In this work, we identified a previously unrecognized hormone-releasing mechanism in the pituitary of the Japanese rice fish (medaka) induced by light. Ca 2+ imaging analysis revealed that melanotrophs, a type of pituitary endocrine cell that secretes melanocyte-stimulating hormone, robustly increase the concentration of intracellular Ca 2+ during short-wavelength light exposure. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule that drives this response. Knocking out opn5m attenuated melanogenesis by reducing tyrosinase expression in the skin. Our findings suggest a mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary melanotrophs triggers a pathway that might contribute to protection from ultraviolet radiation in medaka.",

In this work, we examined germline structural variants (SVs) as risk factors for pediatric extracranial solid tumors using germline genome sequencing of 1765 affected children, their 943 unaffected parents, and 6665 adult controls. We discovered a sex-biased association between very large (&gt;1 megabase) germline chromosomal abnormalities and increased risk of solid tumors in male children. The overall impact of germline SVs was greatest in neuroblastoma, where we uncovered burdens of ultrarare SVs that cause loss of function of highly expressed, mutationally constrained genes, as well as noncoding SVs predicted to disrupt chromatin domain boundaries. Collectively, we estimate that rare germline SVs explain 1.1 to 5.6% of pediatric cancer liability, establishing them as an important component of disease predisposition.",

          "abstract": "The electrical resistivity of conventional metals such as copper is known to increase in thin films as a result of electron-surface scattering, thus limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we find an unusual reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in niobium phosphide (NbP) semimetal deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400°C. In films thinner than 5 nanometers, the room temperature resistivity (~34 microhm centimeters for 1.5-nanometer-thick NbP) is up to six times lower than the resistivity of our bulk NbP films, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness (typically about 100 microhm centimeters). The NbP films are not crystalline but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower effective resistivity is caused by conduction through surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics beyond the limitations of conventional metals.",

We used well-defined extended surface models to identify that RuO 2 undergoes structure-dependent corrosion that causes Ru dissolution. Tantalum (Ta) doping effectively stabilized RuO 2 against such corrosion and enhanced the intrinsic activity of RuO 2 . In an industrial demonstration, Ta-RuO 2 electrocatalyst exhibited stability near that of IrO 2 and had a performance decay rate of ~14 microvolts per hour in a 2800-hour test. At current densities of 1 ampere per square centimeter, it had an overpotential 330 millivolts less than that of IrO 2 .",

Over 3 years, 71 bats migrated tens to hundreds of kilometers per night, predominantly with incoming warm fronts, which provided them with wind support. Bats also showed unexpected flexibility in their ability to migrate across a wide range of conditions if needed. However, females leaving toward the end of the season showed higher total activity per distance traveled, a possible cost for their flexible migration timing.",

Multiple hermaphroditic genera in Juglandaceae, including walnuts ( Juglans ) and hickories ( Carya ), show a 1:1 genetic dimorphism for male versus female flowering order (heterodichogamy). We map two distinct Mendelian inheritance mechanisms to ancient (&gt;37 million years old) genus-wide structural DNA polymorphisms. The dominant haplotype for female-first flowering in Juglans contains tandem repeats of the 3′ untranslated region of a gene putatively involved in trehalose-6-phosphate metabolism and is associated with increased cis gene expression in developing male flowers, possibly mediated by small RNAs. The Carya locus contains ~20 syntenic genes and shows molecular signatures of sex chromosome–like evolution. Inheritance mechanisms for heterodichogamy are deeply conserved, yet may occasionally turn over, as in sex determination.",

We introduce organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) as a new family of BC materials. OIPCs display subambient transition temperatures, so-called “colossal” entropy changes (92 to 240 joules per kilogram per kelvin), and a high sensitivity to pressure, up to 23.7 kelvin per kilobar. The BC responses achieved with these prototype OIPC-BCs are tunable through structural modification of the ions; this wide matrix of possible combinations of structure and function indicates the scope of OIPCs as a new class of material for efficient and sustainable cooling technologies.",

Often the largest and most experienced, old individuals are most valued by humans and make important contributions to reproduction, information acquisition and cultural transmission, trophic dynamics, and resistance and resilience to natural and anthropogenic disturbance. These observations contrast with the senescence-focused paradigm of old age that has dominated the literature for more than a century yet are consistent with findings from behavioral ecology and life history theory. In this work, we review why the global loss of old individuals can be particularly detrimental to long-lived animals with indeterminate growth; those with increasing reproductive output with age; and those dependent on migration, sociality, and cultural transmission for survival. Longevity conservation is needed to protect the important ecological roles and ecosystem services provided by old animals.",

          "abstract": "In 2023, the global mean temperature soared to almost 1.5 kelvin above the preindustrial level, surpassing the previous record by about 0.17 kelvin. Previous best-guess estimates of known drivers, including anthropogenic warming and the El Niño onset, fall short by about 0.2 kelvin in explaining the temperature rise. Using satellite and reanalysis data, we identified a record-low planetary albedo as the primary factor bridging this gap. The decline is apparently caused largely by a reduced low-cloud cover in the northern mid-latitudes and tropics, in continuation of a multiannual trend. Further exploring the low-cloud trend and understanding how much of it is due to internal variability, reduced aerosol concentrations, or a possibly emerging low-cloud feedback will be crucial for assessing the present and expected future warming.",

Characterizing the diversity of cross-feeding pathways in ocean microbes illuminates evolutionary forces driving self-organization of ocean ecosystems.

The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus exudes both compound classes, which metabolic reconstructions suggest follows synchronous daily genome replication. Co-occurring heterotrophs differentiate into purine- and pyrimidine-using generalists or specialists that use compounds for different purposes. The most abundant heterotroph, SAR11, is a specialist that uses purines as sources of energy, carbon, and/or nitrogen, with subgroups differentiating along ocean-scale gradients in the supply of energy and nitrogen, in turn producing putative cryptic nitrogen cycles that link many microbes. Last, in an SAR11 subgroup that dominates where Prochlorococcus is abundant, adenine additions to cultures inhibit DNA synthesis, poising cells for replication. We argue that this subgroup uses inferred daily adenine pulses from Prochlorococcus to synchronize to the daily photosynthate supply from surrounding phytoplankton.",

Combined with a publicly available database on EC transcriptomic responses to drug treatments, this approach inferred a regulatory network controlling EC states and made several notable predictions. Particularly, inhibiting cell cycle–dependent kinase (CDK) 2 was predicted to initiate inward remodeling and promote atherogenesis. In vitro, PSS activated CDK2 and induced late G 1 cell cycle arrest. In mice, EC deletion of CDK2 triggered inward artery remodeling, pulmonary and systemic hypertension, and accelerated atherosclerosis.

More than one-third of patients with RA could not be accurately diagnosed because of lacking biomarkers. Our recent study reported that scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) is a biomarker for RA, especially for anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP)–negative RA. Here, we further identified the B cell autoantigenic epitopes of SR-A. By a large-scale multicenter study including one training and three validation cohorts of 1954 participants, we showed that anticitrullinated SR-A peptide antibody (anti-CSP) was exclusively elevated in RA as a biomarker, particularly useful for seronegative RA. Combination of anti-CSP with anti-CCP demonstrated superior diagnostic value for RA, with sensitivity of 84.83% and specificity of 92.43%. Moreover, RA anti-CSP revealed distinct glycosylation patterns, capable of provoking inflammation in cartilage organoids and exacerbating disease progression in experimental arthritis. Together, these data identify anti-CSP as an RA autoantibody clinically applicable and actively involved in disease pathogenesis.",

Herein, we propose an electronic descriptor χ S v (electronegativity χ and valence-electron number S v ) to quantify the bonding strength of constituents on the basis of the tight-binding model, which allows us to build analytical models to achieve the site-to-site quantification of E f and E b . The descriptor χ S v reflects the d-band occupation, indicating the dominant role of the electronic interactions in the vacancy formation and migration of HEAs. As a size effect, local lattice distortion plays a more important role in vacancy migration than in vacancy formation. Our model establishes a universal physical picture of vacancy formation and migration, which helps to understand the radiation resistance and mechanical properties of HEAs, thereby accelerating the design of high-performance HEAs.",

These DN3s are organized into 12 clusters with unusual gene expression features compared to the more well-studied clock neurons. We further show that previously uncharacterized DN3 subtypes promote sleep through a G protein–coupled receptor, TrissinR .

Observed deposition rates downwind of large-scale unconventional oil operations reached up to 100 tC hour −1 , with fluxes exceeding 0.1 gC m −2 hour −1 . The observed deposition lifetimes (τ dep ) were short enough (i.e., 4 ± 2 hours) to compete with chemical oxidation processes and affect the fate of atmospheric reactive carbon. Yet, much of this deposited organic carbon cannot be accounted for using traditional gas-phase deposition algorithms used in regional air quality models, signifying underrepresented, but influential, chemical-physical surface properties and processes. Furthermore, these fluxes represent a major unaccounted contribution of reactive carbon to downwind freshwater ecosystems that outweigh terrestrial sources, necessitating the inclusion of dry deposition in aquatic carbon balances and models.",

Although TR transcription is crucial in their life cycle, its regulation remains poorly understood. This study identifies the Mediator complex, E2F1-Dp, and Scalloped/dTEAD as key regulators of TR transcription. Reducing the activity of the Mediator or Sd/dTEAD increases TR expression and telomere length, while overexpressing E2F1-Dp or depleting Rbf1 stimulates TR transcription. The Mediator and Sd/dTEAD regulate this process through E2F1-Dp. CUT&amp;RUN (Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease) analysis shows direct binding of CDK8, Dp, and Sd/dTEAD to telomeric repeats, with motif enrichment revealing E2F- and TEAD-binding sites. These findings uncover the Mediator complex’s role in controlling TR transcription and telomere length through E2F1-Dp and Sd, coupling the transcriptional regulation of the TR life cycle with host cell-cycle machinery to protect chromosome ends in Drosophila .",

Charge transport in sliding charge density waves (CDW) differs from all others in that the atomic lattice is directly involved in the transport process. To obtain an overall picture of the structural changes associated to the collective transport, the large coherent x-ray beam generated by an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) source was used. The CDW phase can be retrieved over the entire sample from diffracted intensities using a genetic algorithm. For currents below threshold, increasing shear deformation is observed in the central part of the sample while longitudinal deformation appears above threshold when shear relaxes. Shear thus precedes longitudinal deformation, with relaxation of one leading to the appearance of the other. Moreover, strain accumulates on surface steps in the sliding regime, demonstrating the strong pinning character of these surface discontinuities. The sliding process of nanometric CDW involves macroscopic sample dimensions.",

In these settings, male mice spontaneously form social networks, with individuals occupying diverse positions. We show that a rewarded group member’s scent affects the ability of conspecifics to search for rewards in familiar and novel environments. The scent’s impact depends on the animal’s social position. Furthermore, disruption of neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex (PL) disrupts the social networks and animals’ interest in social information related to rewards; only the latter is blocked by the acute PL inhibition.

A folic acid (FA)–modified ultrasound-responsive gene/drug delivery system, assembled from DOTAP, DSPE-PEG2000-FA, cholesterol, and perfluorohexane (PFH)—termed FA-PNBs—was developed to codeliver small interfering RNA of STAT1 (siSTAT1) and the small-molecule nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO 2 ) into CD86-positive macrophages.

Although this complex transformation has been structurally well studied, the reaction pathway and the resulting temporal evolution have remained elusive. We used an integrated biophysical approach to monitor prepore-to-pore transition and found a reaction time of ~30 hours for a complete transition. We show two asynchronous general steps of the process, shell opening and channel ejection, with the overall reaction pathway being a slow multistep process involving three intermediates. Liposomes, an increasingly high pH, or receptors facilitate shell opening, which is directly correlated with an increased rate of the prepore-to-pore transition. Channel ejection is a near-instantaneous process which occurs with a transition time of &lt;60 milliseconds. Understanding the mechanism of action of Tc toxins and unveiling modulators of the kinetics are key steps toward their application as biomedical devices or biopesticides.",

HCN channel activation contributes to pain perception, and propofol, a widely used anesthetic, acts as an analgesic by inhibiting the voltage-dependent activity of HCN channels. However, the molecular determinants of propofol action on HCN channels remain unknown. Here, we use a propofol-analog photoaffinity labeling reagent to identify propofol binding sites in the human HCN1 isoform. Mass spectrometry analyses combined with molecular dynamics simulations show that a binding pocket is formed by extracellularly facing residues in the S3 and S4 transmembrane segments in the resting voltage-sensor conformation. Mutations of residues within the putative binding pocket mitigate or eliminate voltage-dependent modulation of HCN1 currents by propofol. Together, these findings reveal a conformation-specific propofol binding site that underlies voltage-dependent inhibition of HCN currents and provides a framework for identifying highly specific modulators of HCN channel gating.",

Deletion of IRF2BP2 in human adipocytes increases lipolysis without affecting glucose uptake, whereas IRF2BP2 overexpression decreases lipolysis. RNA sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses show that IRF2BP2 represses lipolysis-related genes, including LIPE , which encodes hormone sensitive lipase, the rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis. Adipocyte-selective deletion of Irf2bp2 in mice increases Lipe expression and free fatty acid levels, resulting in adipose tissue inflammation and glucose intolerance.

Here, we comprehensively characterized the landscape of ncRNAs and PTM events in 1460 samples across six brain regions sourced from the Mount Sinai/JJ Peters VA Medical Center Brain Bank Study and Mayo cohorts, encompassing 33,321 long ncRNAs, 92,897 enhancer RNAs, 53,763 alternative polyadenylation events, and 900,221 A-to-I RNA editing events. We additionally identified 25,351 aberrantly expressed ncRNAs and altered PTM events associated with AD traits and further identified the corresponding protein-coding genes to construct regulatory networks. Furthermore, we developed a user-friendly data portal, ADatlas, facilitating users in exploring our results. Our study aims to establish a comprehensive data platform for ncRNAs and PTMs in AD to advance related research.",

However, stable compound searches remain highly expensive because of the enormous search space and the cost of DFT calculations. To aid these searches, recommendation engines have been developed. We conduct a systematic comparison of the performance of previously developed recommendation engines, specifically ones based on elemental substitution, data mining, and neural network prediction of formation enthalpy. After identifying ways to improve the recommendation engines, we find the neural network to be superior at recommending stable Heusler compounds. Armed with improved recommendation engines, we identify tens of thousands of compounds that are stable at zero temperature and pressure, now available in the Open Quantum Materials Database. We summarize this diverse pool of compounds, including the elusive mixed anion compounds, and two of their many applications: thermoelectricity and solar thermochemical fuel production.",

Here, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model organism, we demonstrate that the kinesin-14 motor Klp2 interacts with the J-domain Hsp70/Ssa1 cochaperone Rsp1, an inhibitory factor of microtubule assembly, and that Klp2 is required for the proper localization of Rsp1 to microtubules. In addition, we demonstrate that Klp2 is not required for the localization of Mto1, a factor promoting microtubule assembly, to microtubules. Moreover, Rsp1-Ssa1 inhibits the interaction of Mto1-Mto2 with the gamma-tubulin small complex. The absence of Klp2 reduces the colocalization of Rsp1 and Mto1 foci on preexisting microtubules, resulting in an increased microtubule-dependent microtubule assembly. Our results suggest that Klp2 regulates the activity of noncentrosomal MTOCs by targeting Rsp1 to the sites of Mto1 activity and reveal a mechanism for the inhibition of noncentrosomal microtubule assembly by a kinesin-14 motor.",

We demonstrate that spin current driven by thermal gradients sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. Spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space induces the superconducting spin Seebeck effect, where a spin current is generated along thermal gradients without a thermoelectric charge current. Notably, the nonvanishing superconducting spin Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity because it reflects the spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. At the same time, the spin chirality of the condensate induces the spin Nernst effect, where a spin current is generated perpendicular to thermal gradients in nonunitary superconductors.

OsCSN5 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the E3 ligase OsPUB45. Overexpression of OsPUB45 increased resistance against M. oryzae and Xoo , while dysfunction of OsPUB45 decreased resistance. In addition, OsCSN5 stabilized OsCUL3a to promote the degradation of a positive regulator OsNPR1. Overexpression of OsPUB45 compromised accumulation of OsCUL3a, leading to stabilization of OsNPR1, whereas mutations in OsPUB45 destabilized OsNPR1. These findings suggest that OsCSN5 stabilizes OsCUL3a to facilitate the degradation of OsNPR1, preventing its constitutive activation without infection.

CL synthase (ClsA) flips its catalytic cytoplasmic domain upon depletion of PE to supply nonbilayer-prone CL in the periplasmic leaflet of the IM for cell viability. In the presence of a physiological amount of PE, osmotic down-shock induces a topological inversion of ClsA, establishing the biological relevance of membrane protein reorientations in wild-type cells.

We observed a higher incidence of spontaneous leukemogenesis in recipients transplanted with heterozygous Polg HPCs and a lower incidence of NMyc-driven leukemia in those with homozygous Polg HPCs compared to controls. Although mtDNA mutations in heterozygous and homozygous HPCs caused similar baseline impairments in mitochondrial function, only heterozygous HPCs responded to and supported altered metabolic demands associated with NMyc overexpression. Homozygous HPCs showed altered glucose utilization with pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition due to increased phosphorylation, exacerbated by NMyc overexpression. The impaired growth of NMyc-expressing homozygous HPCs was partially rescued by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, highlighting a relationship between mtDNA mutation burden and metabolic plasticity in leukemogenesis.",

This review is aimed as a tutorial for those entering the area of statistical modeling in chemistry. We provide case studies to highlight the considerations and approaches that can be used to successfully analyze datasets in low data regimes, a common situation encountered given the experimental demands of organic chemistry. Statistical modeling hinges on the data (what is being modeled), descriptors (how data are represented), and algorithms (how data are modeled). Herein, we focus on how various reaction outputs (e.g., yield, rate, selectivity, solubility, stability, and turnover number) and data structures (e.g., binned, heavily skewed, and distributed) influence the choice of algorithm used for constructing predictive and chemically insightful statistical models.",

We describe a human skin explant model and demonstrate that EBOV infection of human skin via basal media increases in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. In the dermis, cells of myeloid, endothelial, and fibroblast origin were EBOV antigen–positive whereas keratinocytes harbored virus in the epidermis. Infectious virus was detected on the apical epidermal surface within 3 days, indicating that virus propagates and traffics through the explants. Purified human fibroblasts and keratinocytes supported EBOV infection ex vivo and both cell types required the phosphatidylserine receptor, AXL, and the endosomal protein, NPC1, for virus entry. This platform identified susceptible cell types and demonstrated dynamic trafficking of EBOV virions. These findings may explain person-to-person transmission via skin contact.",

Through rigorous analysis, APLP1 + EVs from human sera were unequivocally determined to be of cerebral origin. This assertion was corroborated by distinctive small RNA expression patterns of APLP1 + EVs. The miRNAs’ putative targets within these EVs manifested pronounced expression in the brain, fortifying their neurospecific provenance. We subjected our findings to stringent validation using Thy-1 GFP M line mice, transgenic models wherein GFP expression is confined to hippocampal neurons. An amalgamation of these results with an exhaustive data analysis accentuates the potential of APLP1 + EVs as cerebrally originated biomarkers. Synthesizing our findings, APLP1 + EVs are postulated not merely as diagnostic markers but as seminal entities shaping the future trajectory of neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.",

Our spatial transcriptomics–based “mechanomics” platform facilitates spatially resolved analysis of the molecular profiles of cells with respect to their local in vivo mechanical environment by integrating time-lapsed in vivo micro–computed tomography, spatial transcriptomics, and micro–finite element analysis. We investigate the transcriptomic responses of cells as a function of the local strain magnitude by identifying the differential expression of genes in regions of high and low strain within a fracture site.

This observational study found that ATHL show higher insulin sensitivity, muscle mitochondrial content, and capacity, but lower activation of novel protein kinase C (nPKC) isoforms, despite higher diacylglycerol concentrations. Notably, sedentary but insulin sensitive OVWE feature lower plasma membrane-to-mitochondria sn -1,2-diacylglycerol ratios. In ATHL, calpain-2, which cleaves nPKC, negatively associates with PKCε activation and positively with insulin sensitivity along with higher GLUT4 and hexokinase II content. These findings contribute to explaining the athletes’ paradox by demonstrating lower nPKC activation, increased calpain, and mitochondrial partitioning of bioactive diacylglycerols, the latter further identifying an obesity subtype with increased insulin sensitivity (NCT03314714).",

A challenge with autonomous accelerator tuning remains that the most capable algorithms require experts in optimization and machine learning to implement them for every new tuning task. Here, we propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to tune particle accelerators. We demonstrate on a proof-of-principle example the ability of LLMs to tune an accelerator subsystem based on only a natural language prompt from the operator, and compare their performance to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning–trained optimization. In doing so, we also show how LLMs can perform numerical optimization of a nonlinear real-world objective. Ultimately, this work represents another complex task that LLMs can solve and promises to help accelerate the deployment of autonomous tuning algorithms to day-to-day particle accelerator operations.",

Here, we examined the roles of prefrontal vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)–expressing neurons and their D1 receptors (D1Rs) in working memory using a delayed match-to-sample task in mice. VIP neurons conveyed robust working-memory signals, and their inactivation impaired behavioral performance. Moreover, selective knockdown of D1Rs in VIP neurons also resulted in impaired performance, indicating the critical role of VIP neurons and their D1Rs in supporting working memory. Additionally, we found that dopamine release dynamics during the delay period varied depending on the target location. Furthermore, dopaminergic terminal stimulation induced a contralateral response bias and enhanced neuronal target selectivity in a laterality-dependent manner. These results suggest that prefrontal dopamine modulates behavioral responses and delay-period activity based on laterality. Overall, these findings shed light on dopamine-modulated prefrontal neural processes underlying higher-order cognitive functions.",

Using transient reflection spectroscopy, we quantified an ultrafast hole extraction time of 310 femtoseconds and a photocarrier lifetime of 259 picoseconds. Suppressed exciton formation in diffusion measurement validated ultrafast hole extraction. We further revealed a short photocarrier lifetime of ~8.7 picoseconds in deposited contact and negligible hole extraction in unintimate contact with space gap at the interface. We unraveled the hot electron transfer process from Au to MoS 2 in different contact interfaces.

We exploit this insight to grow ultrathin Nd 6 Ni 5 O 16 heterostructures and conduct in situ studies of topotactic reduction, finding that formation of the square-planar phase occurs rapidly and is highly sensitive to reduction temperature, with small deviations from the optimum condition leading to inhomogeneity and the loss of superconductivity.

While CenH3-containing nucleosomes are distributed in a monocentric fashion on autosomes and bind tandem repeat sequences specific to individual or groups of chromosomes, they show a longitudinal distribution and broad intergenic binding on the X chromosome, which partially recapitulates phenotypes known from holocentric species. Despite this variable CenH3 distribution among chromosomes, all chromosomes are functionally monocentric, marking the first instance of a monocentric species with chromosome-wide CenH3 deposition.

Ir140 , a foreleg-enriched member of the ionotropic receptor (IR) superfamily of sensory receptors, is up-regulated in Orco mutant legs. Ir140 , Orco double mutants do not show the enhanced heat seeking seen in Orco single mutants, suggesting that up-regulation of Ir140 in the foreleg is a key mechanism underlying sensory compensation in Orco mutants. Because Orco expression is sparse in legs, this sensory compensation requires an indirect, long-range mechanism.

These CMSSCs are marked by interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) and are specifically located around the periosteum of the jawbone and frontal bone. Additionally, these CMSSCs exhibit strong self-renewal and osteogenic differentiation capacities but lower chondrogenic differentiation potency, mediating intramembranous bone formation without cartilage formation. IFITM5 + cells are also observed in the adult jawbone and exhibit functions similar to those of embryonic CMSSCs.

Our findings reveal that high-dose intravenous BCG induces an influx of polyfunctional T cells and macrophages in the airways, with alveolar macrophages from high-dose intravenous BCG displaying a basal activation state in the absence of purified protein derivative stimulation, defined in part by interferon signaling. Enhanced intercellular immune signaling and stronger T helper 1–T helper 17 transcriptional responses were observed following purified protein derivative stimulation.

          "abstract": "The human brain continuously integrates information across its two hemispheres to construct a coherent representation of the perceptual world. Characterizing how visual information is represented in each hemisphere over time is crucial for understanding how hemispheric transfer contributes to perception. Here, we investigated information processing within each hemisphere over time and the degree to which it is distinct or duplicated across hemispheres. We presented participants with object images lateralized to the left or right visual fields while measuring their brain activity with electroencephalography. Stimulus coding was more robust and emerged earlier in the contralateral than the ipsilateral hemisphere. Presentation of two stimuli, one to each hemifield, reduced the fidelity of representations in both hemispheres relative to one stimulus alone, signifying hemispheric interference. Last, we found that processing within the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, hemisphere was biased to image-related over concept-related information. Together, these results suggest that hemispheric transfer operates to filter irrelevant information and efficiently prioritize processing of meaning.",

          "abstract": "The observation of spin-dependent transmission of electrons through chiral molecules has led to the discovery of chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). The remarkably high efficiency of the spin polarizing effect has recently gained substantial interest due to the high potential for future sustainable hybrid chiral molecule magnetic applications. However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the chiral-induced phenomena remain to be understood fully. In this work, we explore the impact of chirality on spin angular momentum in hybrid metal/chiral molecule thin-film heterostructures. For this, we inject a pure spin current via spin pumping and investigate the spin-to-charge conversion at the hybrid chiral interface. Notably, we observe a chiral-induced unidirectionality in the conversion. Furthermore, angle-dependent measurements reveal that the spin selectivity is maximum when the spin angular momentum is aligned with the molecular chiral axis. Our findings validate the central role of spin angular momentum for the CISS effect, paving the path toward three-dimensional functionalization of hybrid molecule-metal devices via chirality.",

          "abstract": "Thermal switches, which electrically turn heat flow on and off, have attracted attention as thermal management devices. Electrochemical reduction/oxidation switches the thermal conductivity (κ) of active metal oxide films. The performance of the previously proposed electrochemical thermal switches is low; the on/off κ-ratio is mostly less than 5, and the κ-switching width is less than 5 watts per meter kelvin. We used a CeO 2 thin film as the active layer deposited on a solid electrolyte YSZ substrate. When the CeO 2 thin film was reduced once (off-state) and then oxidized (on-state), κ was about 2.2 watts per meter kelvin in the most reduced state, and κ increased with oxidation to 12.5 watts per meter kelvin (on-state). This reduction (off-state)/oxidation (on-state) cycle was repeated 100 times, and the on/off κ-ratio was 5.8, and the κ-switching width was 10.3 watts per meter kelvin. The CeO 2 -based solid-state electrochemical thermal switches would be potential devices for thermal shutters and thermal displays.",

          "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm) is essential for brain development and function and potentially mediates the effects of genetic risk variants underlying brain disorders. We present INTERACT, a transformer-based deep learning model to predict regulatory variants affecting DNAm levels in specific brain cell types, leveraging existing single-nucleus DNAm data from the human brain. We show that INTERACT accurately predicts cell type–specific DNAm profiles, achieving an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99 across cell types. Furthermore, INTERACT predicts cell type–specific DNAm regulatory variants, which reflect cellular context and enrich the heritability of brain-related traits in relevant cell types. We demonstrate that incorporating predicted variant effects and DNAm levels of CpG sites enhances the fine mapping for three brain disorders—schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease—and facilitates mapping causal genes to particular cell types. Our study highlights the power of deep learning in identifying cell type–specific regulatory variants, which will enhance our understanding of the genetics of complex traits.",

The mid-to-late-stage evolution of the lunar magnetic field is poorly constrained, and thus, the existence of a long-lived lunar dynamo remains controversial. The Chang’e-5 mission returned the heretofore youngest mare basalts from Oceanus Procellarum uniquely positioned at midlatitude. We recovered weak paleointensities of ~2 to 4 microtesla from the Chang’e-5 basalt clasts at 2 billion years ago, attesting to the longevity of the lunar dynamo until at least the Moon’s midstage. This paleomagnetic result implies the existence of thermal convection in the lunar deep interior at the lunar midstage, which may have supplied mantle heat flux for young volcanism.",

          "abstract": "Infradian mood and sleep-wake rhythms with periods of 48 hours and beyond have been observed in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which even persist in the absence of exogenous timing cues, indicating an endogenous origin. Here, we show that mice exposed to methamphetamine in drinking water develop infradian locomotor rhythms with periods of 48 hours and beyond which extend to sleep length and manic state–associated behaviors in support of a model for cycling in BD. The cycling capacity is abrogated upon genetic disruption of dopamine (DA) production in DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or ablation of nucleus accumbens projecting DA neurons. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of VTA DA neurons including those that project to the nucleus accumbens led to locomotor period lengthening in circadian clock–deficient mice, which was counteracted by antipsychotic treatment. Together, our findings argue that BD cycling relies on infradian rhythm generation that depends on mesolimbic DA neurons.",

          "abstract": "The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) dominates the transfer of heat, salt, and tracers around the Southern Ocean (SO), driving the upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters around Antarctica. Paleoclimate reconstructions reveal marked variability in SO circulation; however, few records exist coupling quantitative reconstructions of ACC flow with tracers of SO upwelling spanning multiple Pleistocene glacial cycles. Here, we reconstruct near-bottom flow speed variability in the SO south of Africa, revealing systematic glacial-interglacial variations in the strength and/or proximity of ACC jets. These are superimposed by warmer-than-present “super-interglacials,” whereby extreme slowdown in the midlatitude ACC (41°S) is opposed by faster flow at higher latitudes (&gt;54°S), implying poleward strengthening of the ACC. Coupled with reconstructions of the subsurface-deep stable carbon isotope gradient, we show that the reorganization of ACC coincides with the upwelling of isotopically light deep waters around Antarctica, likely contributing to the interglacial rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels.",

          "abstract": "Deciphering how genes interpret information from transcription factor (TF) concentrations within the cell nucleus remains a fundamental question in gene regulation. Recent advancements have revealed the heterogeneous distribution of TF molecules, posing challenges to precisely decoding concentration signals. Using high-resolution single-cell imaging of the fluorescently tagged TF Bicoid in living Drosophila embryos, we show that Bicoid accumulation in submicrometer clusters preserves the spatial information of the maternal Bicoid gradient. These clusters provide precise spatial cues through intensity, size, and frequency. We further discover that Bicoid target genes colocalize with these clusters in an enhancer-binding affinity-dependent manner. Our modeling suggests that clustering offers a faster sensing mechanism for global nuclear concentrations than freely diffusing TF molecules detected by simple enhancers.",

          "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) respond to mechanical stimuli, including stiffness and viscoelasticity. To date, it is unknown how extracellular fluid viscosity affects hMSC function on substrates of different stiffness and viscoelasticity. While hMSCs assume an adipogenic phenotype on gels of low stiffness and prescribed stress relaxation times, elevated fluid viscosity is sufficient to bias hMSCs toward an osteogenic phenotype. Elevated viscosity induces Arp2/3-dependent actin remodeling, enhances NHE1 activity, and promotes hMSC spreading via up-regulation of integrin-linked kinase. The resulting increase in membrane tension triggers the activation of transient receptor potential cation vanilloid 4 to facilitate calcium influx, thereby stimulating RhoA/ROCK and driving YAP-dependent RUNX2 translocation to the nucleus, leading to osteogenic differentiation. hMSCs on soft gels at elevated relative to basal viscosity favor an M2 macrophage phenotype. This study establishes fluid viscosity as a key physical cue that imprints osteogenic memory in hMSCs and promotes an immunosuppressive phenotype.",

          "abstract": "Photonic design is a process of mathematical optimization of a desired objective (beam formation, mode conversion, etc.) subject to the constraint of Maxwell’s equations. Finding the optimal design is challenging: Generically, these problems are highly nonconvex and finding global optima is NP hard. Here, we show that the associated optimization problem can be transformed to a sparse-matrix, quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). Sparse QCQPs can be tackled with convex optimization techniques (such as semidefinite programming) that have thrived for identifying global bounds and high-performance designs in many areas of science and engineering but seemed inapplicable to the design problems of wave physics. We apply our formulation to prototypical photonic design problems, showing the possibility to compute fundamental limits for large-area metasurfaces, as well as the identification of designs approaching global optimality. Our approach appears directly extensible to any design problem whose governing dynamics are bilinear differential equations, as arise in structural optimization, fluid dynamics, and quantum control.",
