          "abstract": "Stop Chasing Happiness\n\nFrank Martela Allen & Unwin (2025)\n\nIn 2025, Nature searched for the world’s happiest PhD students, anticipating that they might be in Finland. The Nordic nation of long winters and, apparently, the most heavy-metal bands per capita globally is consistently crowned the world’s happiest country, according to the University of Oxford’s Wellbeing Research Centre, UK. Happiness researcher Frank Martela explores what distinguishes the “land of quiet satisfaction” from others. Martela, based at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland, says his fellow Finns “accept life as it is, not making a fuss about what is bad or good” and shunning overt displays of wealth and success. His mantra is “energized contentment”, pursuing chosen projects but not chasing specific job titles or awards. A research career enables him to indulge a love of writing and to be part of a community that embraces discussions with the brightest minds.\n\nMartela urges us to stop caring what others think (being disliked by some, he says, proves “that you are exercising your freedom to be you”), expose ourselves to different viewpoints, not be ruled by our emotions and let go of our egos. Chasing success is also pointless. He quotes Iikka Kokko, a Finnish mathematics prodigy who started university at age 16. When asked what he wanted to accomplish, Kokko said that he would be happy with the life of an average researcher — for him, doing maths was an end in itself.\n\nNavigating the P.I.V.O.T.\n\nGertrude Nonterah Gertrude Nonterah (2025)\n\nIn 2018, Gertrude Nonterah lost a postdoctoral position after her laboratory leader’s research funding ran out. Later that year, the Ghanaian researcher landed a role at a biotechnology company, but she was laid off two months later. Losing two jobs in a year left the then 35-year-old despondent. But Nonterah turned what felt like a failure into a career opportunity. As an international researcher in the United States, her focus had been climbing the academic career ladder, gaining a second degree, then a PhD in microbiology and immunology. But having multiple degrees didn’t guarantee her anything.\n\nShe now works in medical communications and career counselling through the Bold PhD, a consultancy set up in 2021, and a podcast, which she launched in 2025. Nonterah helps researchers to step off the academic hamster wheel and seek opportunities beyond their specialty.\n\nThe first half of the book addresses “mindset” — avoiding the trap of thinking that your career is all about your degree. The second half focuses on the practical: how to network, learn industry language and build a portfolio that showcases your talents and skills.\n\nOne story she shares is that of Mary, who, after gaining a PhD in social psychology, realized that she did not want to stay in academia. As a lover of Japanese animation, she decided to apply for a data-analysis job for the California-based company Crunchyroll, one of the biggest streamers of anime. Although the role is a long way from her PhD, the research skills she learnt during her postgraduate study helped her to get the job.\n\nJust F**king Say It\n\nSusie Ashfield Elliott & Thompson (2025)\n\nLondon-based speech coach Susie Ashfield is lauded for transforming stuffy business executives into “TED Talk–style rockstars” and her first book aims to convince nervous public speakers that “speaking well, in any style, format or environment can be learnt, regardless of how unpleasant it might feel”. Ashfield boils the art of public speaking down to two words: care less. This mantra applies to making a fool of yourself, going red, saying the wrong thing — or whatever it is that stops you making yourself heard. The book’s 19 chapters each cover a type of storytelling, including job interviews (build rapport, remember the interviewers are on your side, ask questions and don’t be self-deprecating, is her advice), pay negotiations, networking events and panel talks. The book also covers how to disagree and communicate with difficult colleagues.\n\nAshfield’s two rules for delivering effective presentations are: know why you are speaking and sum everything up into a single sentence. Her example is a group of scientists seeking investment for their gene-testing kit. What’s their one-line take-home message? It’s simple, says Ashfield: this test will save lives. So don’t get bogged down explaining the underlying technology, but focus on its life-saving potential instead.\n\nConference-panel hosts need to remember that “this is not about you” and panellists are warned not to talk over the other guests. And if you don’t know the answer in a Q&A session, be honest. Ask the audience instead.\n\nThe Four Paths of Assertiveness\n\nScott Cooper & Naoki Yoshinaga Johns Hopkins University Press (2025)\n\nThis comprehensive manual includes advice on dealing with manipulative colleagues, standing up for yourself and advocating for what’s right. Its authors — Scott Cooper, a youth advocate in San Francisco, California, and Naoki Yoshinaga, a psychologist at the University of Miyazaki in Japan — break down assertiveness into: social, behavioural, emotional and mental assertiveness.\n\nSocial assertiveness, they say, is expressing what you want and how you feel but without steamrollering others. They offer tips on how to say no, seek a pay rise and tackle shyness and social anxiety. Sometimes, shrugging off a setback or taking responsibility for a mistake is needed, they add.\n\nThe behavioural assertiveness section recommends a daily to-do list, always including some that are enjoyable, and breaking down difficult tasks into smaller ones.\n\nPrioritizing personal values, such as helping others and pursuing hobbies, can help readers, the authors say. Rejecting values imposed by others, as Isaac Newton did when he chose physics even though his mother wanted him to be a farmer, proves that we are the ultimate judge of what’s right for us.\n\nThe emotional assertiveness section quotes happiness researcher Barbara Fredrickson, who says that people are more likely to perform well with a minimum three-to-one ratio of positive to negative communication. Finally, mental assertiveness is an acceptance of life’s ups and downs. If you’ve just made an error, don’t dwell on it but tell yourself: “Mistakes are part of life. I’ll learn from them and move on.”\n\nThe Not To-Do List\n\nRolf Dobelli Allen & Unwin (2025)\n\nSwiss entrepreneur Rolf Dobelli turns the self-help book into a manual for self-sabotage. Instead of telling you how to live a happy and successful life, his tongue-in-cheek tome lists actions that will make your life harder. The 52 pithy chapters include headings ranging from ‘Be Unreliable’ to ‘Trade Your Reputation for Money’ and ‘Cultivate a Victim Mentality’. ‘Be An Asshole’ recommends feeding your colossal ego by flaunting photographs of yourself on your office wall, to “be your own biggest fan — that way, you can be sure there’ll always be someone who likes you”.\n\nDobelli doesn’t claim to be the first business writer to use reverse psychology, but he says that we can learn much more from dissecting failure than success. In a chapter entitled ‘Get Stuck in Your Career’ he writes: “If you want a life devoid of prospects: choose your very first job as your lifelong career. Then stay in the industry for better or worse, even if it’s dying.” And in ‘Never Be Playful’, he recommends being sombre, uptight and joyless — cautionary figures include US theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, who played bongo drums in his spare time.\n\nThe ‘Spin Multiple Plates’ chapter urges readers to start lots of projects and tasks but do them all badly because there’s too much going on. Dobelli namechecks the US computer scientist Cal Newport, author of the 2024 book Slow Productivity, who in an interview with Nature highlighted how the barrage of e-mails and Slack notifications many of us face hampers our effectiveness and contributes to feelings of burnout.\n\nPatriarchy Inc\n\nCordelia Fine Atlantic Books London (2025)\n\nMen still earn more, work fewer hours in the home and have more leisure time than women, says Cordelia Fine, a psychologist and workplace gender-equity researcher at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Fine cautions against thinking (in richer Western countries at least) that the battle for equal rights has been won. Why, she asks, are 81% of film screenwriters male, when it is “a job seemingly custom-built for stereotypical feminine skills” and interests, such as language and people — an even steeper gender imbalance than that seen in PhD graduates in computer science and maths?\n\nFine highlights a study looking at bias against women in university science careers — the researchers found such a bias in only two metrics out of six and even a bias against men in one. “Institutions should get credit for the progress they have made,” the researchers said. But Fine points out that some criteria are hard to measure, such as invitations to speak on panels, opportunities to contribute to journals or work on editorial boards. These depend on relationships with senior scientists. People are biased towards others similar to them, so if senior scientists tend to be male, they are more likely to offer a leg-up to other men, she says. Fine concludes by calling for a society that rejects gendered job roles; accepts that all workers will have caring responsibilities at some point; and is alert to the “deeply embedded” gender system in childhood. She equates gender-specific toys to unequal division of labour at home.\n\nThe Twentysomething Treatment\n\nMeg Jay Simon & Schuster (2025)\n\nEighty per cent of life’s defining moments take place by the time a person is 35, says Meg Jay, a clinical psychologist in Charlottesville, Virginia. Her 20-something clients are living in a world of “peak uncertainty”, she adds, a sentiment that will doubtless resonate with early-career researchers worldwide. Jay cites the threat of climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of social media as factors contributing to this instability. Her book explains how “situational stressors” (such as exam preparation and relationship break-ups) often result in unhelpful diagnoses of depression. She encouraged one of her clients to talk to his professor after failing a class; the professor convinced him that a single academic setback didn’t make him a failure.\n\nHer remedy includes jumping into life and not talking yourself into depression or anxiety. Work, says Jay, “forces growth and change in a way that few of us can accomplish on our own” and your twenties are the key time to acquire skills and to learn from older, more experienced colleagues. Also, gaining skills can help in other aspects of life, from love to friendships.\n\nJay outlines how today’s 20-somethings are faced with a dizzying array of choices. To make sense of this, she advises the use of heuristics: “mental shortcuts that allow us to make decisions without considering all the information”. She adds: “Rather than trying to factor everything in, we use a smaller number of variables to make up our minds.”\n\nThriving as an International Scientist",

          "title": "Why academics should do more consulting — and how to make it work",
          "authors": "Louise J. Slater, Weston B. Struwe, Christopher R. Vogel, Emma Walker, Regent Lee",
          "abstract": "Universities have three core missions: research, teaching and societal impact. The third is increasingly defined in commercial terms. The number of intellectual property licences has increased and more spin-out companies are being formed. This shift is supported by an independent review of spin-out practices1, standardized investment guidance2 and the professionalization of university technology-transfer offices3.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nBy contrast, academic consulting work, one of the most direct and scalable means by which academics can shape industry, government and civil society, remains underdeveloped (see ‘Consulting gap’).\n\nConsulting work and other routes for exchanging knowledge are often treated as administrative functions. Such activities are defined and measured inconsistently and receive limited recognition in evaluations of research-related innovation. At a time when universities are struggling financially and academic research is often seen as distant from people’s everyday concerns, that must change.\n\nHere, we call for universities to make it easier for academics to carry out consulting work. If the work is properly supported, it can diversify income, build enduring partnerships and ensure that research delivers a tangible impact.\n\nWhy consulting work matters\n\nThere are widespread benefits to academics offering their advice to outside organizations for a fee. For higher-education institutions, consulting work can provide a flexible stream of income at a time of financial strain. It can foster partnerships with industry and government that generate collaborative research, joint ventures and fresh sources of funding.\n\nIt reinforces universities’ reputation as engines of applied knowledge and economic and societal impact. For example, one small software team at the University of Southampton, UK, turned open-source verification tools into more than £600,000 (US$799,000) of consulting income by advising on safety-critical railway systems between 2014 and 2021 (see go.nature.com/44ueoch).\n\nFor academics, consulting also offers professional development, wider networks, financial reward and real-world experience. It creates career porosity between academia, industry and policy, opening routes into leadership roles. For example, consulting can underpin the spin-out-company model: an academic who created intellectual property might be engaged as a ‘fractional executive’ through a consulting contract, allowing them to contribute to the company and develop leadership skills. Consulting work also enriches the research culture of higher-education institutions, giving academics direct feedback on how their work is used in practice, informing grant proposals and strengthening career progression.\n\nSources: Value of consulting market, Office for National Statistics; Academic consulting, IP and spin-out data, Higher Education Statistics Agency\n\nFor society, consulting accelerates the application of knowledge to national priorities, such as clean energy, health and social policy. It provides a mechanism for organizations to benefit from publicly funded research. It also ensures university expertise is applied beyond the campus walls, and can feed back into teaching with real-world case studies that better prepare graduates for the workforce.\n\nHigher-education institutions could embed modules that simulate the practice of consulting engagements to enhance students’ understanding of work. In one example, industry-led consulting projects were developed at Henley Business School, UK, to give master’s students hands-on experience.\n\nConsulting, therefore, is one of the most immediate channels through which universities can deliver societal impact. These projects are typically shorter in duration and easier to set up than other routes to impact, such as spin-out companies. Yet, across most institutions, consulting receives limited attention.\n\nLost opportunity\n\nUsing data from the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency on the number of consultancy contracts and academic staff at nine universities, we found that less than 10% of academic staff, on average, engaged in consulting work. Academic consulting is worth roughly £500–600 million per year (£566 million in 2023–24). That’s equivalent to 0.6% of the UK management consulting market value (£92 billion according to the Office for National Statistics), or 2.8% of the sector, based on the definition of the London-based Management Consultancies Association (£20.4 billion).\n\nOver the past decade, the number of academic consulting contracts has fallen by 38% from around 99,000 in 2014–15 to fewer than 62,000 in 2023–24. Higher average values of contracts have driven some growth, with the linear trend in total academic consultancy income rising by 31% from 2014–15 to 2023–24. But that falls short of the trend in the UK management consulting sector, which was 51% over that period.\n\nSome institutions have demonstrated what is possible. In 2023–24, 17 UK universities earned more than £10 million annually from consulting work across a vast range of disciplines and industries, including drug-development advice, advanced materials testing, digital health evaluation, engineering analysis, and policy and socio-economic consulting.\n\nMedical parasitology consultant Wellington Oyibo reports on anti-malaria strategies.Credit: Adekunle Ajayi/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nData are less available for institutions in other countries; limited information (including personal communications with US technology-transfer offices) suggests that consulting income typically does not make up a large share of institutional turnover. This suggests a global underutilization of academic expertise through consulting, even among the world’s most research-intensive universities — and a lost revenue stream for higher education. Management consulting alone in the United States was valued at $407 billion in 2025, according to market research firm IBIS World.\n\nPrivate consultancy firms are increasingly moving into this underexploited market, capturing opportunities that universities neglect. Small-scale (under £5,000), fast-turnaround, one-off projects are commonly sidelined by university contract offices because they represent too small an income for strained institutional resources, creating space for contract-research organizations and technical consultancies with the agility to capture this demand. If universities do not act, global professional services firms will continue to dominate the space in which academic insight could deliver direct societal benefit.\n\nPolicy patchwork\n\nWeak institutional policies on consulting are one reason for this missed opportunity. We examined policies at 30 universities hosting at least 5 UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellows — a 7-year fellowship programme designed to develop research and innovation leaders in academia and business — supplemented by surveys of 76 fellows and interviews with technology-transfer staff at the same universities. Our analysis reflects practices across a subset of research-intensive institutions, including our own, and is intended to inform sector-wide discussion rather than prescribe a single model.\n\nGreat science happens in great teams — research assessments must try to capture that\n\nThe results reveal a fragmented system. Two-thirds of the universities we surveyed have publicly available policies, two of which prohibit private consulting. Permitted university-contracted time for consulting ranges from unlimited to 30 days or fewer per year, or to personal time only. Institutional charges range from 10–40% of consulting fees.\n\nWhen we conducted interviews with staff who manage academic consulting services across multiple UK universities, administrative delays and inconsistent incentives or recognition of consulting were often cited as common issues. The result is a patchwork of practice, in which opportunities depend less on expertise and more on institutional flexibility.\n\nThe financial outcomes for academics vary widely, from flexible fees agreed between client and academic to university-set day rates. Some academics choose to put their consulting income into research accounts at their institution to support their group or department, but whether this is permitted, and on what terms, varies between universities and even across departments in the same institution. At some organizations, up to 50% of an individual’s earnings can be diverted into institutional research funds.\n\nServices to support academic consulting also differ between universities and within them, with some departments or technology-transfer offices providing insurance, contracting and negotiation support, and other institutions providing none. Contract approvals range from a 24-hour turnaround to months of negotiations. Faced with these obstacles, some academics turn to private consulting conducted outside their employment contracts, often without legal cover and sometimes in breach of institutional terms.",

We follow strict rules to protect the wildlife, including wearing a protective suit. We also try to keep a distance from penguins and any other wildlife, such as the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) that I’m pictured with, but some animals are naturally curious and difficult to avoid.\n\nMy university in Istanbul runs research trips to this site every year, coordinated by the Turkish government and Marmara Research Center in Gebze, Turkey. It’s a long journey from Istanbul — around 16,000 kilometres and ten days of travel. We first fly to Brazil, then to northern Chile, then down to Patagonia; finally we take a flight to South Georgia, from where we travel by boat.",

Here we compare the ability of humans (N = 9,198) and large language models (LLMs, N = 215,542 observations) to generate novel ideas in an established creativity task. We present three key results. First, human creativity on average is slightly higher than that of LLMs. Second, creativity differences are pronounced at the extremes of the distribution, with humans exhibiting greater variability and higher levels of creativity in the right-hand tail of the distribution. Third, attempts to increase the creativity of LLMs through instructing LLMs to take on genius personas or different demographic roles lifted performance up to a threshold beyond which the output became opposite real-life patterns, whereas strategic prompt-engineering efforts yielded mixed to negative results. We discuss the implications of our findings for human–machine collaboration and problem solving.",

          "abstract": "Despite advances in applying cognitive load theory to instructional design, its principles have not yet been fully integrated into the design of physical learning environments. Recent work has synthesized embodied cognition with cognitive load theory, and suggests that learning emerges as a sum of mental operations and the physical context in which they occur1. However, the way in which classrooms are designed around the world — including in Brazil, where I work — remains largely disconnected from these cognitive principles. In many of the classrooms I visit, walls are often overloaded with colourful posters, unrelated visual materials and competing information, a practice that is culturally perceived as enriching but is potentially counterproductive from a cognitive perspective.\n\nIn schools, the persistent use of classrooms with colourful decorations and walls filled with posters, charts and unrelated visual material may inadvertently impair children’s cognitive performance. Research has shown that excessive visual stimulation increases extraneous cognitive load, and consumes working memory resources that should be allocated to learning tasks2,3.",

Here we show that despite increasing globalization, the proportion of foreign-educated academy members has declined, while scholars from underrepresented regions—Western China and developing countries (or the Global South)—have benefited from preferential inclusive policies. Some elite-level returnee academics experience research underperformance upon returning. These trends reflect a broader shift towards academic indigenization and have wider implications for meritocracy, mobility and the sustainability of China’s talent strategies.

          "abstract": "Do humans learn like transformers? We trained both humans ( n = 530) and transformer networks on a rule learning task where they had to respond to a query in a sequence. At test, we measured ‘in-context’ learning (generalize the rule to novel queries) and ‘in-weights’ learning (recall past experiences from memory). Manipulating the diversity and redundancy of examples in the training distribution, we found that humans and transformer networks respond in very similar ways. In both types of learner, redundancy and diversity trade off in driving in-weights and in-context learning, respectively, whereas a composite distribution with a balanced mix of redundancy and diversity allows the two strategies to be used in tandem. However, we also found that while humans benefit from dynamic training schedules that emphasize diverse examples early, transformers do not. So, while the same data-distributional properties promote learning in humans and transformer networks, only people benefit from curricula.",

          "abstract": "Organisms in nature and humans in socioeconomic systems alike face tradeoffs between selfish consumption of resources and investment in the welfare of their offspring. Previous work across the disciplines of biology and economics has sought to elucidate this process, develop a theoretical framework to solve for the optimal life history strategy, and deduce implications of these microscopic interactions for the distribution of resources at the macroscopic level. Such theory, however, has failed to account for heterogeneous conditions that various individuals and groupings of kin enjoy, like growth rate advantages for those with greater resource abundance. Furthermore, such emergent trends at the macroeconomic scale lack reconciliation with observations of power law distributions of wealth and income in vivo. We modify and extend an analytical framework here to allow for heterogeneity, and consider the long-term consequences for resource distributions with Pareto initial values. We find that power law phenomena are robust to such processes and, due to sensitivity to the form of the utility curve, higher-order uncertainty may not affect the optimal tradeoff. This stresses the impact of mechanistic choices when translating sociological findings to ecological and economic theory, and suggests future work must consider how social norms and other microscopic complexity can explain emergent patterns or disrupt trends of inequality at the macrolevel.",

However, mainstream global efforts to combat desertification prioritize short-term vegetation greening over addressing resource constraints and local livelihoods, posing hidden challenges to long-term Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) attainment. Here, we evaluated the socioeconomic trade-offs of China’s long-standing desertification reversal strategies and explored the potential benefits of innovative agricultural practices using high-resolution suitability models for major crops and cultivated pasture. Compared with a no-intervention baseline, continuing the Grain-for-Green Program and grazing exclusion under projected 2023–2050 warming and wetting trends would lead to reductions of up to 54 to 55% in grain output, 81% in livestock production, and 61% in agricultural income. Conversely, strategies emphasizing pasture cultivation and crop switching could substantially lower national expenditures on combating desertification while restoring ecosystems, enhancing agricultural productivity and incomes, and conserving water resources. These benefits would contribute 0.7%, 9.8%, and 3.8% toward global progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), respectively, while exhibiting trade-offs across multiple SDGs. This study provides a reimagined strategy framework for combating global desertification and promoting sustainable development in vulnerable arid regions worldwide.",

Our results reveal the progress of the SDGs across the world varies depending on the initial SDG scores of the indicators in 2015. For indicators with low scores (0 to 50%), the proportion of countries showing advancement is greater than that demonstrating regression (25 vs. 16%). Countries that foster scientific research and promote manufacturing industry (SDG9) have the best performances. For indicators with high scores (70 to 90%), the proportion showing regression is greater than that with advancement (16 vs.10%). The increased coverage of immunization vaccines and prevention of infectious diseases (SDG3) have the worst performances. For indicators with moderate scores (50 to 70%), the proportion showing regression is slightly greater than that showing advancement (11 vs. 9%). When the score was low and high, the impact of the pandemic was significantly greater than that for moderate scores. By 2030, the global SDG score will reach approximately 63%, with a SD of 8%. Overall, 78 countries will reach the moderate score (60 to 70%), and 12 countries will remain with a low score (40 to 50%).

While reversible phosphorylation of the BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) is critical for BR signaling, much remains to be learned about the dephosphorylation mechanisms of BRI1. Here, we demonstrate that the D-clade type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2C-Ds) negatively regulate BR signaling by dephosphorylating key residues in the kinase activation loop of BRI1. The phosphatase activity of PP2C-D2 and D5 is activated through homo- or heterodimerization, a process antagonized by BR-induced BRI1 phosphorylation or SMALL AUXIN UP RNA15 (SAUR15) binding. BL treatment, BRI1-mediated phosphorylation, or SAUR15 binding disrupts dimerization, returning PPC2C-Ds to a monomeric, inactive state. These data not only reveal another phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade regulating BR signaling but also decode unrecognized regulatory mechanisms of PP2C-Ds in plants.",

Mitigating productivity loss from interactions between these global change drivers requires a mechanistic understanding of the forces generating productivity benefits from species richness (i.e., overyielding). Progress has been limited by two challenges: i) individual mechanisms can be highly context-dependent, yet multiple mechanisms can produce similar responses to functional diversity loss or altered climate, and ii) most experiments test short-term weather events rather than sustained changes in precipitation. We address these limitations using direct tests of multiple mechanisms within a sustained, full factorial manipulation of plant richness, composition, and precipitation within experimental grasslands. Precipitation consistently increased overyielding, as yield declined in monocultures and increased in polycultures, consistent with greater specialist pathogen accumulation in mesic conditions. Resource partitioning and specialist pathogen dilution—estimated from physiochemical trait dissimilarity and soil pathogen dissimilarity—were positive predictors of overyielding, relationships that strengthened over time. Moreover, overyielding was best explained by the joint influence of resource acquisition traits and pathogen dissimilarities, indicating that multiple mechanisms generated productivity responses to richness. These two mechanisms can explain the robust findings across systems that productivity increases with plant biodiversity. Our findings predict that biodiversity loss will be most damaging in wetter climates, where pathogen dilution amplifies the benefits of diversity.",

          "abstract": "Wild foods are critical to the food security of billions of people worldwide, yet the ecological mechanisms that promote wild food system stability remain poorly understood. Within complex food webs, ecological theory predicts that nonhuman consumers can maintain more stable consumption rates by foraging on multiple resources that vary asynchronously in their availability across space and time. These so-called portfolio effects may also sustain more stable harvest rates by humans in wild food systems. We analyzed wild food harvest patterns for 46 isolated rural communities in southern coastal Alaska that harvest a diversity of wild foods (96 taxa) across terrestrial, freshwater, intertidal, and marine habitats. We show that access to diverse wild foods across this heterogeneous landscape dampened variability in harvest through time and increased robustness to species declines by allowing communities to harness seasonal and interannual asynchronies in wild food availability. These results demonstrate how ecological mechanisms that stabilize ecosystems may also underpin the stability of human wild food systems. Managing landscapes to maintain access to diverse wild foods and adopting flexible governance that allows communities to adjust harvest as patterns of wild food availability shift through time are crucial to sustaining resilient wild food systems in a changing world.",

          "abstract": "Anelloviridae is a family of single-stranded DNA viruses that are thought to be nonpathogenic and commensal. Despite their ubiquitous presence in human populations, little is known about the anellovirus mechanism of replication in host cells. We identified the protein coded by ORF2/3 as necessary and sufficient to initiate replication from the minimal origin of replication for viruses of both the Beta- and Alphatorquevirus genera. Supporting this observation, we identified components of the polymerase alpha and BTR (Bloom’s syndrome helicase (BLM), topoisomerase IIIα, RMI1, and RMI2) complexes as interacting with the viral replication initiation protein (Rip) during DNA replication, suggesting a recombination-dependent mechanism of replication that uses host cell machinery to mediate dissolution of replication intermediates. Furthermore, we mapped a 92-bp minimal origin of replication sequence for the Betatorquevirus genus composed of an adenine and thymine (AT)-rich stretch and a portion of the guanine and cytosine (GC)-rich region. Altogether, this study provides insight into the mechanism by which anelloviruses manipulate host cell machinery to facilitate viral genome replication and represents a significant step forward in understanding the complex processes underlying anellovirus replication and persistent infection of these important commensal viruses.",

Despite their clinical importance, the molecular principles underlying multidrug promiscuity and energy efficiency remain poorly understood. Using multiparametric deep mutational scanning across eight substrates and two energy conditions, we deconvolute the contributions of substrate recognition, energetic coupling, and protein stability, providing an integrated, high-resolution view of multidrug transport. We find that substrate specificity arises from a distributed network of residues extending beyond the binding site, with mutations that reshape binding, coupling, conformational flexibility, and membrane interactions. Further, we apply a pH-based selection scheme to measure the effect of mutation on pH-dependent transport efficiency. By integrating these data, we reveal a fundamental relationship between efficiency and promiscuity: Highly efficient variants exhibit broad substrate profiles, while inefficient variants are narrower. These findings establish a direct link between energy coupling and polyspecificity, uncovering the biochemical logic underlying multidrug transport.",

          "abstract": "The ability to synthesize essential molecules is sometimes lost in evolution. A classic example is ascorbate (vitamin C), which is synthesized in most animals by L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), an enzyme lost multiple independent times in animal evolution. This event is thought to be evolutionarily neutral; however, GULO- deficient animals including humans need to obtain ascorbate from their diet and are prone to ascorbate deficiency and scurvy. We therefore hypothesized that this disadvantage of GULO loss is offset by physiological benefits. Here, we show that ascorbate deficiency benefits mice infected with schistosome parasites, which cause schistosomiasis, a debilitating parasitic disease that afflicts 250 million people. Schistosoma mansoni worms required host ascorbate to produce eggs in vivo. Consequently, ascorbate-deficient mice were protected from schistosomiasis pathologies and transmission. Intermittent ascorbate deficiency protected Gulo -deficient mice from both scurvy and schistosomiasis mortality. The effects of ascorbate on schistosome reproduction were mediated by ascorbate-dependent histone demethylation which promoted vitellocyte development in female schistosomes. We propose that vitamin deficiencies are not always detrimental but can protect animals from pathogens which need to obtain vitamins from their host.",

          "abstract": "The β-barrel assembly machine (BAM) is an essential protein complex that folds and inserts outer membrane β-barrel proteins (OMPs) into the bacterial outer membrane. The BAM complex contains the essential BamA OMP with five soluble polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains, which scaffold the essential BamD lipoprotein and the nonessential lipoproteins BamB/C/E. The importance of each BAM component has been investigated primarily using cell-based phenotypic assays, and structural data have revealed insights into the role of the BamA β-barrel in OMP folding. However, in vitro quantitative analysis for the function of each BAM component has been challenging. We describe the development of a fluorescent reporter of OMP folding, bOmpA-A488, which we use to obtain single-turnover kinetic parameters for wild-type BAM complex in vitro. We observe a k fold of 0.78 ± 0.15 min −1 and approximate substrate affinity of 3.1 ± 1.1 µM consistent with estimates of in vivo requirements. Furthermore, we find that while BamA alone is inactive in Escherichia coli lipid liposomes, BamAB and BamAD subcomplexes have activities similar to that of the holoBAM complex. This suggests that OMP folding and insertion is catalyzed by BamA while the accessory lipoproteins maintain BamA in a catalytically competent conformation. We also find that, contrary to prevailing models, POTRA domain deletions that include POTRA3, which is essential in cells, do not drastically impact activity. This indicates that the first three POTRA domains do not play a major role in binding or folding OMPs under single-turnover conditions, suggesting a different role in cells.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is distributed across multiple cortical areas, suggesting that behaviors relying on WM arise from interactions between these regions. In a recent study, we found that during delayed comparison tasks, the first stimulus is not represented veridically in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but instead is encoded in a systematically warped manner–biased toward the mean of the stimulus distribution. This neural distortion, which emerges already during the stimulus presentation and persists throughout the delay period, closely mirrors a contraction bias observed in behavior. Furthermore, the behavioral responses could be explained by a Bayesian observer model, in which the observer integrates prior expectations with noisy sensory inputs. These results suggest that the geometry of PFC neural trajectories embodies Bayesian estimates that underlie biased decisions. Here, we investigate whether the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2)–a lower-level sensory area also implicated in tactile WM–exhibits a similar encoding structure. Our analyses reveal that although WM-related signals in S2 are less robust than in PFC, the neural state space in S2 shares key geometric features with that of PFC, including a similarly warped representation of stimulus values. These findings suggest that perceptual biases may originate early in the cortical processing stream and are not exclusively shaped by higher-order associative areas. More broadly, our results support a distributed organization of representational warping, in which even sensory areas contribute to the formation of bias-prone representations that guide behavior.",

Despite their biological and chemical significance, the bacterial enzymes responsible for urolithin production remain largely unidentified. Here, we use differential gene expression analysis, anaerobic protein production, and enzyme assays to identify members of two distinct molybdenum enzyme families (the DMSO reductase family and the xanthine oxidase family) capable of regioselective dehydroxylation and urolithin generation. These two enzyme families have distinct substrate requirements, suggesting they employ different catalytic mechanisms for phenol dehydroxylation. Multiomics analysis of a human cohort uncovers decreased levels of urolithin A and genes encoding urolithin A-producing enzymes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), implying reduced health effects of EA consumption in this setting. Together, this study elucidates the molecular basis of urolithin production, expands the known enzymatic repertoire of the human gut microbiome, and suggests a potential link between gut bacterial urolithin production and reduced host inflammation.",

However, the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana , a natural fungal parasite of these beetles, detoxifies stilbene and flavonoid aglucones by forming methylglucoside derivatives. A two-step pathway involving a UDP-glycosyltransferase and an O -methyltransferase produces phenolic O -methylglucosides that are no longer toxic to B. bassiana and are stable to β-glucosidase action. Compared to wild-type strains of B. bassiana , mutant strains knocked out in the genes of this pathway exhibited decreased methylglucoside formation, slower growth on medium containing phenolic compounds, and reduced virulence toward bark beetles. Hence, methylglucosylation of plant-derived phenolics is a detoxification process that significantly increases the ability of B. bassiana to parasitize host insects consuming plant tissue high in phenolics, such as conifer phloem. This is one of the few examples of an entomopathogen that is able to resist the plant-derived defenses of an insect host.",

          "abstract": "Dormant bacterial spores germinate to become vegetative cells upon germinant exposure. Despite many germinants being energy sources, bioenergetic processes have been overlooked as germination can proceed, albeit slowly, without exogenous energy sources. Here, we apply remission spectroscopy to noninvasively measure energization of the electron transport chain (ETC) in germinating spores. In Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis , energization of cytoplasmic metabolism and the ETC occurs early in germination, before or alongside water ingress and bulk CaDPA efflux. The aa 3 -type oxidases (Qox, Cta) accumulate nonradical ferryl intermediates of their catalytic cycle, slowed by a high membrane potential. The Yth isoform of the bd oxidase, present in spores, allows rapid electron transfer to O 2 when the aa 3 -type oxidases are hindered, establishing a role for this enzyme. Deletion of Yth slows the initiation of “absorbance”/attenuance loss, directly linking bioenergetic processes to germination. We propose a powered germination model, where the Ger-mediated signaling cascade and bioenergetic processes occur in parallel and are mutually influenced by each other. This model explains why germination on energy-rich molecules (e.g., glucose) is often much faster than on energy-poor ones (e.g., KBr).",

          "abstract": "Rabies, caused by the neurotropic lyssavirus rabies virus (RABV), is nearly 100% fatal after symptom onset. A fundamental challenge for rabies therapy is that the blood–brain barrier (BBB) prevents peripherally administered neutralizing antibodies from entering the central nervous system (CNS) to clear the infection. In this study, we initially generated four human–mouse chimeric antibodies with preserved neutralizing potency against RABV to increase its translational potential. To achieve brain antibody delivery, we conjugated a lead chimeric antibody (7A3-H) to different cell-penetrating peptides with potential BBB-penetrating capacity (RVG, TGN, THR, and SynB1). In vivo fluorescence imaging revealed that SynB1 conjugation significantly outperformed conjugation with the other peptides in terms of BBB penetration for brain antibody delivery. Furthermore, a triple-antibody cocktail (targeting epitopes II/III/IV of RABV-G) conjugated to SynB1 resulted in 80% survival in mice infected with lethal challenge virus standard (CVS) or dog-originated rabies virus (DRV) strains when it was administered at 5 dpi (when CNS invasion and symptoms were evident). In contrast, the unconjugated cocktail provided only 20% (CVS) or 0% (DRV) survival. Together, these data demonstrated that SynB1-mediated BBB penetration dramatically improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti-RABV antibodies, enabling post-symptom rescue of rabies. This antibody–peptide conjugation strategy provides a proof of concept for advancing rabies therapy, specifically by leveraging peptide-mediated enhancement of BBB penetration.",

          "abstract": "Primate societies rely on the production and interpretation of social signals, in particular those displayed by the face. Facial movements are controlled, according to the dominant neuropsychological schema, by two separate circuits, one originating in medial frontal cortex controlling emotional expressions, and a second one originating in lateral motor and premotor areas controlling voluntary facial movements. Despite this functional dichotomy, cortical anatomy suggests that medial and lateral areas are directly connected and may thus operate as a single network. Here, we test these contrasting hypotheses through structural and functional MRI (fMRI) guided electrical stimulation and simultaneous multichannel recordings from key facial motor areas in the macaque monkey brain. These areas include medial facial motor area M3 (located in the anterior cingulate cortex); two lateral face-related motor areas: M1 (primary motor) and PMv (ventrolateral premotor); and S1 (primary somatosensory cortex). Cortical responses evoked by intracortical stimulation revealed that medial and lateral areas can exert significant functional impact on each other. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials in all facial motor areas further confirm that during facial expressions, medial and lateral facial motor areas significantly interact, primarily in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, whereas during voluntary chewing, coupling occurs at lower frequencies. These functional interactions varied across facial movement types. Thus, at the cortical level, the control of facial movements is not mediated through independent (medial/lateral) functional streams, but results from an interacting sensorimotor network.",

Additionally, we observed unexpected spatial variation in gene expression within several types along the dorso–ventral axis or within vs. outside the ART, independent of RGC density profiles.

The receptors colocalize widely at inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord and in the brainstem due to their interaction with an overlapping binding site of the synaptic scaffold protein gephyrin, pointing to a direct competition between the different receptor types. We have put this hypothesis to the test using single-molecule approaches to measure receptor–gephyrin interactions in cells and in vitro. We explored the effects of receptor competition at inhibitory synapses in living neurons by measuring the change in the accumulation and effective stabilization energy of glycine receptors in the presence of interfering GABA receptor complexes through single-molecule tracking and diffusion analysis. Second, using molecular tweezers, we quantified the thermodynamic properties of receptor–gephyrin binding, demonstrating direct and reversible competition through the addition of interacting peptides in solution. The relatively low affinity of GABA receptor subunits for gephyrin compared to the glycine receptor raises interesting questions about the role of this competition in synaptic plasticity. We hypothesize that GABA and glycine receptor competition constitutes a molecular system designed to reconcile synapse stability and plasticity at mixed inhibitory synapses.",

          "abstract": "Cereal crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize, and barley) constituted the major component of global human diet and fundamentally changed human society since the dawn of agriculture around 12,000 y ago. Originated and domesticated in different continents and environments, cereal crops vary significantly in their salt tolerance. The High-Affinity K + Transporter1;5s (HKT1;5s) predominately regulate Na + accumulation and salt tolerance in salt-sensitive cereal crops by mediating shoot-to-root Na + exclusion. However, HvHKT1;5 paradoxically promotes root-to-shoot Na + translocation in salt-tolerant barley. Therefore, unravelling the regulatory mechanisms of HvHKT1;5 is critical to understanding the molecular basis of salt tolerance in barley. Here, we demonstrated that a microRNA164d-HvNAC92-HvHKT1;5 module improves salt tolerance via reduced shoot Na + accumulation and increased K + retention in barley, whereas miR164d suppresses HvNAC92 transcription factor to directly downregulate HvHKT1;5 expression. Under salinity condition, the MIR164d -OE, Hvnac92 , and Hvhkt1;5 lines showed significantly reduced root-to-shoot Na + translocation and shoot Na + content compared with the wild-type. In conclusion, we resolve the species-specific function of HKT1;5s in cereal crops by establishing miRNA-guided Na + and K + transport regulation as a regulatory framework for engineering salt-tolerant crops.",

          "abstract": "Neuromodulatory systems play an essential role in regulating brain states and functions. The canonical view is that the release of monoamines including norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) is high during wakefulness and attenuated during sleep, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas the cholinergic system is active during both wakefulness and REM sleep and quiescent during non–REM (NREM) sleep. Recent studies have revealed a slow and rhythmic release pattern of neuromodulators during NREM sleep that drives infraslow oscillation (ISO) (0.02 to 0.03 Hz) in the brain. A key question is whether/how the release of different neuromodulators during sleep is coordinated. In this study, we combined 2-site fiber photometry with electroencephalogram/electromyography recording to monitor the release of NE, 5-HT, and acetylcholine in the cortex and hippocampus during sleep and wake cycles. We found that the ISO of these neuromodulators is synchronized during NREM sleep. The synchrony between neuromodulatory systems increases in the oscillatory cycles leading to arousal. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of either the 5-HT or NE system eliminates the oscillation of other neuromodulators during NREM sleep. Optogenetic activation of 5-HT or NE neurons during NREM sleep induces the release of other neuromodulators in the absence of sleep-to-wake transitions. These results suggest that the rhythmic neuromodulator releases are highly coordinated in the brain. The synchrony among multiple neuromodulatory systems across brain regions provides a powerful neural mechanism to orchestrate sleep architecture and sleep-related neural processes.",

While some inflammatory responses may originate from mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), nonimmune cells vastly outnumber MNPs and may be an important source of inflammation. Here, we demonstrated that highly virulent EBOV induced a high and sustained pro-inflammatory response compared to less virulent ebolaviruses in non-MNPs through TLR4-independent NF-κB activation. We identified the EBOV matrix protein VP40 as a potent activator of NF-κB in non-MNPs, whose intrinsic inflammatory activation ability is higher than VP40 proteins from less virulent ebolaviruses. This suggests that VP40 is a virulence determinant inducing distinct degrees of pro-inflammatory responses among ebolaviruses. Mechanistically, VP40 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, primarily via TNFR1 using a ligand-independent mechanism. These findings reveal mechanisms that may drive systemic inflammation and promote EBOV pathogenesis, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate immune dysregulation in severe EBOV infections.",

Environmental changes associated with alternating wet/dry cycles during this critical interval in hominin evolution are recorded in isotopic profiles from lake sediments from Olduvai Gorge. The Olduvai Gorge Coring Project targeted the depocenter of Paleolake Olduvai, recovering a stratigraphic succession between the Bed I Basalt (~1.90 Ma) and Tuff IF (~1.80 Ma) datums that span hominin fossil horizons in nearby outcrops. Lacustrine claystones from the lower part of this interval are characterized by high C org (avg. 2.5 %). They display variations in δ 13 C org reflecting temporal changes in organic matter (OM) sources. Stratigraphic profiles for n -alkane δ 13 C values derived from plant waxes are consistent throughout wet/dry cycles indicating stability in savanna vegetation, refuting evidence for increased C 4 grasses during drier intervals. δ 13 C values for n -alkanes derived from aquatic macrophytes and for algal biomarkers increase during drier episodes, reflecting use of bicarbonate as a carbon source triggered by enhanced lake alkalinity. δ 13 C org profiles reflect variations in inputs of terrestrial vs. aquatic OM during wet/dry cycles, which are mirrored by δ 13 C values for hop-17(21)-ene derived from heterotrophic bacteria utilizing sedimentary OM. The δ 13 C records from Paleolake Olduvai sediments show temporal changes in OM sources rather than shifts in the proportion of C 3 and C 4 vegetation, indicating that precession-driven climate cycles primarily affected lake environments and associated aquatic resources. Thus, intervals of high climate variability did not necessarily cause changes in savanna vegetation affecting hominin habitats.",

The viral T antigen promoter requires the activity of the cellular coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 for its expression. Inhibition of CBP/p300 with two distinct small-molecule inhibitors suppresses T antigen expression, leading to cell cycle arrest and upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 . This shift promotes neuronal differentiation, associated with neurite outgrowth in MCC cells. RNA sequencing revealed downregulation of genes involved in E2F, Myc, mTORC1 oncogenic signaling, as well as markers of the Merkel cell lineage including Sox2 and Atoh1. Notably, a rare MCC case exhibiting a mixed cellular composition, with loss of T antigen expression and neuroblastic phenotype, showed a transcriptomic profile resembling that of MCC cells treated with CBP/p300 inhibitors.

The regulation of metamorphosis has been well studied in model insects but determining the cue that initiates the physiological shift toward metamorphosis in other insects has been challenging. In most insects, the critical weight is a cue to initiate metamorphosis. Our goal was to determine the cue for metamorphosis in the solitary bee Megachile rotundata and to characterize the physiological mechanisms initiated by this cue. Larval bees were fed ad libitum (also termed “fed”) or had all food removed (also termed “starved”). We measured the time to initiate metamorphosis, juvenile hormone (JH) titers, and the abundance of transcripts involved in the endocrine response to metamorphosis. We experimentally manipulated JH by topically applying precocene, which interrupts JH production. We found that M. rotundata does not have a critical weight and that starvation through the removal of food triggered the initiation of metamorphosis. Food removal was associated with low JH titers, and the application of precocene mimicked the response to food absence. Food removal decreased transcripts associated with JH production, and increased transcripts involved in ecdysone synthesis and insulin/TOR signaling. Food absence is an ecologically relevant cue for a M. rotundata larva, which is provisioned a finite amount of food and is unable to forage for additional food. Despite having food removal as a cue for metamorphosis, the physiological mechanisms associated with metamorphosis are similar to those found in other insects.",

We propose a genomics-informed update to an existing framework enabling a more precise assessment of outbreeding depression risk and genetic rescue feasibility. We apply this approach to a butterfly species—the marsh fritillary ( Euphydryas aurinia )—which has faced severe range contractions and near-extinction in Denmark. We identify substantial inbreeding in the investigated populations (F ROH approaching 40%), historical gene flow, recent divergence times between populations, and low likelihood of local adaptation. Together, these results provide an example where genetic rescue could be undertaken successfully by transplanting individuals across populations with minimal outbreeding depression risks. Despite working with a scaffold-level assembly and moderate sample sizes, our analyses provide robust insights into population dynamics, demography, and local adaptation, demonstrating that even imperfect genomic data can inform conservation strategies. By refining an existing framework, we illustrate how genomics can enhance genetic rescue efforts and guide decision-making for threatened species. Our approach provides a scalable model for integrating genomic data into conservation management, advancing the use of evolutionary and conservation genetics principles in mitigating biodiversity loss.",

          "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of cardiac failure among individuals under 35. Many genetic mutations that cause HCM seem to enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for β-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to wild type (WT). This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin•ADP fivefold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase V max twofold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosin’s off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation.",

          "abstract": "Herbivory is destructive for crop production in many regions worldwide. The induced plant response to herbivores promotes resistance; therefore, characterizing the mechanisms underlying natural host resistance is highly important. However, the genetic components of resistance to herbivores in the staple food crop soybean remain elusive. Here, a key defense gene, GmMYC3 , was identified via joint linkage and association mapping in soybean. GmMYC3 encodes an MYC2 transcription factor that is rapidly activated after jasmonic acid treatment or herbivore attack and confers resistance to a major pest, the common cutworm (CCW), in soybean. GmMYC3 positively regulates multiple biotic stress-related genes, among which GmMYC3 triggers high expression of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors alongside its homolog GmMYC1 and downstream GmWRKY56 . GmMYC3 overexpression results in massive accumulation of trypsin inhibitors in soybean leaves, interferes with the protein digestion and absorption function in larvae that are fed these leaves, and retards larval and pupal development of the CCW. The results of the field tests of the transgenic plants corroborate the defense role of GmMYC3 . Evolutionary and population genetic analyses suggest that the elite haplotype of GmMYC3 contributes to resistance against the CCW without significant reduction in seed yield and quality. Notably, this haplotype appears at a low frequency in domesticated germplasms.

          "abstract": "Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a fundamental principle of protein organization in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and biomaterials, yet the residue-level interactions that link condensation to structural ordering remain poorly defined. In spider dragline silk, LLPS is believed to initiate the transition from soluble spidroin dope into β-sheet–rich fibers that provide exceptional toughness, yet how sequence-specific motifs govern this process has been unclear. Here, we combine isotope-edited solution NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)–enhanced solid-state NMR, molecular dynamics simulations, and AlphaFold3 modeling to define the molecular role of arginine and tyrosine in Latrodectus hesperus dragline silk. Phosphate triggers LLPS while preserving intrinsic disorder, with arginine exhibiting the largest chemical shift perturbations. Simulations reveal that phosphate displaces hydration water to promote Arg–Tyr cation–π interactions and weaken Arg–poly(Ala) contacts. Solid-state NMR directly detects Arg–Tyr contacts in spun fibers, demonstrating that arginine is partially incorporated into β-sheet interfaces while tyrosine frequently adopts β-turn conformations. AlphaFold3 models corroborate these interfacial geometries and reproduce experimental chemical shifts, supporting persistent Arg–Tyr interactions at structured–unstructured boundaries. Together, these results identify Arg–Tyr contacts as critical “sticker” interactions that mediate condensation, nucleate local order, and stabilize fiber architecture. More broadly, this work establishes a mechanistic link between residue-specific chemistry, LLPS, and hierarchical assembly in a structural protein. These insights highlight how weak multivalent interactions bridge disordered and ordered states, providing a general framework for condensate-driven assembly in biology and guiding biomimetic material design.",

The cytoskeleton is known to play a critical role in gravitropism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis kinesins KCH3 and KCH7 (KCH3/7) are expressed and functionally active in the root stele. The kch3 kch7 ( kch37 ) double mutant exhibits delayed gravitropic responses, while stele-specific expression of either KCH3 or KCH7 rescues this defect. Both the calponin homology (CH) and motor domains of KCH3/7 are essential for mediating gravitropism. In vitro and in vivo assays reveal that KCH3/7 promotes actin filament (F-actin) bundling and its turnover in the root stele. Mutation of KCH3/7 results in altered PIN protein abundance and polarity in the root stele, leading to impaired acropetal auxin transport within the stele and reduced auxin accumulation in the root tip’s columella cells. This ultimately causes defective auxin redistribution during gravistimulation. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics in the root stele for maintaining the auxin gradient in the root tip and for gravistimulation-induced auxin asymmetry.",

Despite their clinical significance, the molecular mechanisms underlying VLU remain poorly defined. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptional atlas of VLUs, unveiling a widespread immunosuppressive microenvironment within the lesions. Specifically, stromal cells exhibited attenuated inflammatory responses coupled with enhanced fibrotic activity. Keratinocytes and endothelial cells demonstrated increased proliferative and angiogenic activity, respectively, yet both cell types showed markedly reduced antigen-presenting capacity. Immune cell compartments displayed profound dysfunction characterized by marked reductions and impaired functionality of dendritic cells, polarization of macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, and enrichment of T cell exhaustion signatures. Notably, cell–cell communication analysis revealed diminished crosstalk between immune and structural cell populations. Mechanistically, we identified NAMPT-mediated signaling as a critical regulator of myeloid-stromal crosstalk. Targeted depletion of NAMPT in macrophages disrupted fibroblast-mediated inflammatory responses and impaired wound healing, whereas exogenous NAMPT administration reactivated immune responses and promoted tissue repair in chronic wounds. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive molecular framework for understanding immune–stromal dysfunction in VLUs and position NAMPT as a central immune regulator and promising therapeutic target for chronic wound treatment.",

However, precise control of gap junctions remains elusive.

The vertebrate CarGAP (i.e., Cx-CarGAP), created by genetically fusing connexins with CarH C in mammalian cells, can efficiently block the gap junction channels through AdoB 12 -induced protein oligomerization and subsequently reinstate them via green light–induced protein disassembly. We further introduced the CarGAP system (i.e., Inx-CarGAP) to the Drosophila ovary, enabling reversible control over the heterotypic gap junctions formed by innexin2 (Inx2) and innexin4 (Inx4, also known as zero population growth, Zpg), thereby uncovering the roles of gap junctions in stem cell–niche interactions. This study illustrates CarGAP as a generalizable chemo-optogenetic tool for interrogating the functions of gap junctions in various biological contexts.",

          "abstract": "The Niemann-Pick type 1 and 2 proteins (NPC1 and NPC2) coordinate cholesterol egress from late endosomes-lysosomes (LE/LY). Proper folding, trafficking, and localization of both NPC proteins are essential for normal LE/LY cholesterol handling. Accordingly, mutations in NPC genes cause Niemann–Pick type C (NPC) disease, a progressive neurodegenerative lysosomal cholesterol storage disorder. The routes by which NPC1 reaches the LE/LY compartment in mammalian cells are not fully elucidated. Therefore, to interrogate NPC1 trafficking, we developed genome-engineered HeLa cells expressing endogenous NPC1 mNeon . We demonstrate that endogenous NPC1 localizes to the LE/LY compartment and by using protein proximity-based approaches that NPC1 resides in the same membranes as Vacuolar Protein Sorting-associated protein 41 (VPS41), one of the two unique subunits of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex. Loss of VPS41 increases NPC1 and Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) abundance. Paradoxically, this results in marked accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol and induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein signaling. Mechanistically, using immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy imaging in combination with a VPS41-dependent ectopic recruitment assay, we demonstrate that this is due to a shift in the localization of NPC1 and LAMP1 from LE/LY to biosynthetic vesicles called LAMP carriers. These vesicles have been recently described to transport lysosomal-destined cargo directly from the trans- Golgi (TGN) network to LE/LY. In conclusion, we identify NPC1 as a cargo for VPS41-dependent LAMP carriers that are instrumental for the delivery of NPC1 to LE/LY and maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis.",

Although several formation mechanisms have been proposed, a general thermodynamic driving force remains elusive. Here, we investigate a well-defined system in which the human transcription factor p53 and nonspecific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) form biomolecule-rich condensates. Introduction of dsDNA containing p53-binding motifs induces a morphological transition to hollow structures, accompanied by a material state transition from liquid-like to gel-like. In vitro assays indicate that the formation of hollow condensates is driven by p21 DNA–induced localized gelation at the condensate periphery. Guided by these findings, we developed a three-component phase-field model that quantitatively recapitulates the formation of hollow condensates. Simulations show that peripheral gelation leads to gradual depletion of protein and Random DNA from the condensate core, triggering spinodal decomposition and lumen formation inside condensates. Together, these results offer mechanistic insights into multicomponent hollow condensates.",

In the case of PdCrO 2 , this arises in a triangular-lattice antiferromagnet, creating a unique opportunity to study frustrated magnetism in a very clean metal. Here, we combine a chemical vapor transport crystal growth approach with magnetic, thermodynamic, magnetotransport, and neutron scattering measurements to elucidate the striking anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiferromagnetic PdCrO 2 . The unconventional AHE (with anomalous Hall conductivity ~10 5 Ω −1 cm −1 ) and a large positive magnetoresistance effect (&gt;1,000%) are shown to exhibit complex temperature dependencies, persisting to almost seven times the Néel temperature (~250 K). These effects are directly compared to elastic neutron scattering, inelastic neutron scattering, and neutron magnetic pair distribution function data, establishing unambiguous links between anomalous magnetotransport properties and directly probed short-range spin fluctuations. The latter occur over a notably broad temperature range due to geometrical magnetic frustration. Connecting to recent experimental and theoretical developments, these findings are discussed in terms of a temperature-dependent interplay between chiral spin order and chiral spin fluctuations, significantly elucidating the high-temperature anomalous magnetotransport in such compounds.",

          "abstract": "With approximately 4% of the world’s population using cannabis, there is a need to better understand its physiological effects. Cannabis consumption acutely promotes food intake (“the munchies”) via delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-mediated activation of cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1R); however, these appetitive effects have not been well characterized. We examined effects of cannabis vapor inhalation on energy and macronutrient intake patterns in human participants and then validated these findings in a translational rat model through which we explored behavioral and physiological mechanisms subserving this response. Vaporized cannabis acutely and robustly increased energy intake. In humans, this occurred in the first 30 min of snack and beverage access, irrespective of dose or gender. In rats, these effects were observed in the first 60 min of food access, irrespective of macronutrient content, satiation, or sex, and were a result of cannabis vapor reducing latency to eat and increasing feeding bout number. Also, cannabis vapor did not change the proportion of macronutrients consumed by human participants and abolished preexisting macronutrient-specific food preferences in rats. Our rat data indicate that cannabis vapor may override homeostatic appetite regulation by increasing motivation to eat and reducing food reward devaluation to promote energy intake. Finally, cannabis vapor did not alter circulating appetite-associated hormones, and these feeding effects were mediated by central, but not peripheral, CB1Rs. This study complements and builds upon previous literature to characterize the appetitive effects of vaporized cannabis and uses a translational approach to examine cannabis-driven energy and macronutrient intake patterns in humans and rodents.",

Different maturation states (mature and immature forms) of flavivirus particles have been observed to be released from infected cells and are infectious. To understand how an ultrapotent human antibody (HMAb) A9E can neutralize these Zika particles, we determined the cryoEM structures of the A9E Fab fragment complexed with mature (mZIKV) and immature (immZIKV) ZIKV to 2.8Å and 7.5Å, respectively. A9E binds to an epitope spanning Domain I (EDI), EDIII, and their linker in an E protein protomer in both immZIKV and mZIKV particles. A9E generally inhibited prior to or during virus attachment to cells, via virus aggregation, distortion of virus particles and inhibition of receptor binding. ImmZIKV is particularly sensitive to structural distortion by Fab A9E. The primary mode of infection used by ImmZIKV is via antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE)—the formation of virus complex with nonneutralizing or subneutralizing concentrations of antibodies, that leads to enhanced infection of Fcγ positive myeloid cells. IgG A9E, by itself displays poor ADE activity. When IgG LALA mutant or Fab A9E is added to other enhancing antibody (DV62.5):virus complexes, they can strongly reduce the overall ADE activity. This is likely due to their ability to distort virus particle structure, suggesting that HMAb A9E could be a potential prophylactic and therapeutic candidate against all maturation states of ZIKV.",

Functional connectivity analyses revealed decreased long-range interareal connectivity during MB, compared to both ON and MW states. Event-related potentials with source reconstruction and temporal decoding techniques indicated a significant disruption in visual processing during MB, starting from 200 ms post stimulus and echoing into the late-stage of visual processing, suggesting a disruption of conscious access to sensory information during MB. Electroencephalogram-derived markers allowed the prediction of mental states at the trial level, offering a finer view of conscious dynamics than subjective reports alone. Overall, these findings challenge the notion of the wakeful conscious mind as inherently content-oriented, suggesting that MB reflects genuine gaps in the stream of conscious thoughts, arising from disruptions in the generation or accessibility of thought content.",

Due to evolved resistance, last-resort antibiotics such as the lipooligosaccharide (LOS)-targeting colistin are increasingly used to treat multidrug-resistant isolates. To track the evolution of colistin resistance within a host, we performed sequential oropharyngeal infections in immunocompetent or immune-depleted mice in the presence of inhaled colistin. Both resistant and heteroresistant A. baumannii strains emerged with pmrB mutations that efficiently competed with the susceptible parent in the presence of colistin. These pmrB mutants had a fitness cost in the absence of colistin treatment but retained their ability to colonize the host. In contrast, LOS-deficient A. baumannii mutants removed the target of colistin, but such mutants were unable to colonize the lung. The two pathogenic pmrB mutants showed clear evidence of LOS modification, which was linked to increased transcription of LOS modification enzymes, including the product of the cryptic eptA gene. Spontaneous insertion mutations that caused hyperexpression of eptA allowed the heteroresistant mutant to develop clinically significant colistin resistance. Insertion mutations upstream of the eptA gene or those disrupting hns , which encodes a small histone-like protein, resulted in increased eptA transcript, linking expression of this protein to clinically significant resistance. A resistant variant derived from the heteroresistant parent was stable in the absence of drug, but continued passaging selected for colistin-resensitized pseudorevertants that were largely due to disruption of the LOS modification enzymes. Therefore, colistin heteroresistance is an early stage in the stepwise acquisition of stable colistin resistance in A. baumannii .",

Integration of these inputs poses a computational challenge: How is temporally unfolding, predictive information integrated into a stable representation, while preserving the discriminability and flexibility to map individual stimuli to competing context-specific actions? Using large-scale human intracranial electroencephalography, we assessed how neural population activity integrates behaviorally relevant information across multiple sensory events that sequentially unfold over time and jointly determine the current context. The results uncover that the population geometry supports the emergence of conjunctive coding subspaces that integrate prior information with current sensory evidence and jointly define the temporal context that mediates behavioral benefits. Evidence accumulation diversifies the population responses distributed across the cortex, increasing the representational space that embeds context-dependent stimulus-action mappings. Hence, context-dependent sensory coding might constitute the neural basis underlying adaptive human behavior. In sum, these results demonstrate how neural population activity balances integrating predictive information with preserving stimulus discriminability to enable flexibility, while minimizing interference.",

          "abstract": "Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is critical for advancing our understanding of gene regulation. While single-cell CRISPR perturbation assays such as Perturb-seq provide direct measurements of gene function, the scale of these experiments is limited by cost and feasibility. This motivates the development of computational approaches that can accurately infer responses to unmeasured perturbations from related experimental data. We introduce dbDiffusion, a generative framework that integrates diffusion models with classifier-free guidance derived from perturbation information, operating in latent space through a variational autoencoder. Diffusion models are probabilistic generative models that approximate data distributions by reversing a Markovian diffusion process, progressively denoising Gaussian noise into structured outputs. By exploiting biological similarities in gene expression profiles and relationships among perturbations, dbDiffusion enables the conditional generation of gene expressions for previously unobserved perturbations. In contrast to competing approaches, dbDiffusion does not rely on Large Language Model or foundation models, which have been found to yield unsatisfactory results. Rather, it leverages embeddings derived from measured perturbations to generalize to unseen perturbations, effectively transferring information across related experimental conditions. In benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods on Perturb-seq datasets, dbDiffusion demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting perturbation responses. A methodological innovation of dbDiffusion is the integration of prediction-powered inference, which corrects for biases inherent in generative models and enables statistically rigorous downstream tasks, including the identification of differentially expressed genes. By combining deep generative modeling with principled inference, dbDiffusion establishes a scalable computational framework for predicting and analyzing transcriptomic perturbation responses, significantly extending the utility of Perturb-seq experiments.",

Conventional methods often provide static conformations that inadequately capture protein flexibility. We present PackDock, a framework that integrates deep learning and physics-based modeling to represent protein–ligand interactions. PackDock’s core, PackPocket, uses diffusion models to sample diverse binding pocket conformations and predict ligand-induced changes. We validate PackDock through side-chain packing, redocking, and cross-docking experiments, demonstrating its ability to address protein flexibility challenges. In a real-world application, PackDock identified nanomolar affinity compounds with unreported scaffolds for the protein of interest. Additionally, it revealed key amino acid conformational changes, offering insights into protein–ligand interactions. By accurately predicting complex conformations in various scenarios, PackDock enhances our understanding of protein dynamics and provides perspectives for both basic biological research and drug discovery efforts.",

          "abstract": "Brain capillaries are sensors of neural activity. When a brain region is active, capillary endothelial cells (ECs) sense neuron-derived mediators and elicit a local increase in blood flow (functional hyperemia) to support the rise in metabolic needs. This hyperemic response involves a rapid electrical component and a slower chemical component that involves Gαq PCR (G q PCR) activation by agonists released from neurons. The intravascular forces associated with hyperemia engage mechanosensitive Piezo1-mediated signaling that serves a mechano-feedback control function to facilitate the return of elevated blood flow to basal levels. Whether G q PCR activity influences Piezo1 mechanosensitive signaling has not been explored, despite the potential significant implications of such crosstalk. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology and freshly isolated brain capillary ECs, we demonstrate that prostanoid or muscarinic G q PCR activation facilitates Piezo1 activity. Pharmacological studies revealed the involvement of Gαq and phospholipase C stimulation, as well as downstream phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) hydrolysis in Piezo1 activation, but not signaling triggered by metabolites of PIP 2 hydrolysis. Exogenous application of nanomolar-to-micromolar PIP 2 suppressed Piezo1 open probability. Brain capillary ECs from mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral small vessel disease, or Piezo1 gain-of-function mutation exhibited higher Piezo1 activity, that was corrected by exogenous ex vivo PIP 2 application. We finally tested in vivo the hypothesis that systemic PIP 2 administration restores functional hyperemia in EC-specific Piezo1 gain-of-function mutant mice suffering impaired blood flow. Our findings provide insights into Piezo1 channel regulation and how it affects neurovascular coupling and cerebral blood flow.",
