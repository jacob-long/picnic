          "abstract": "Sustainable development is an imperative worldwide1,2,3 but metrics and data on poverty and quality of life have remained too coarse and abstract to characterize challenges adequately and guide practical progress4,5. Nowhere is this challenge greater than in Africa4,5,6, where we still know little about the spatial details of development3,7,8,9. Here we leverage a comprehensive, high-precision dataset of building footprints to identify infrastructure deficits and infer informal settlements down to the street block level10,11,12 everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa. We identify a general pattern of informality with cities showing, on average, greater access to infrastructure and services than rural and peri-urban areas. We show that such patterns of informality are characterized by consistent statistical distributions reflecting uneven local development2,13,14. We also show that these physical measures of informality are systematically associated with many indicators of human deprivation, which form a single principal component co-varying predictably with specific changes in street access to buildings. These results demonstrate that the localization of sustainable development is possible down to the street level at a continental scale and provide a general distributed strategy for accelerating progress in infrastructure and service expansion that taps local innovations in systematic, equitable and context-appropriate ways7,11,12,15.",

          "abstract": "The nine human herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus, present a significant burden to global public health 1 . Their envelopes contain at least ten different glycoproteins, which are necessary for host cell tropism, attachment and entry 2 . The best conserved among them, glycoprotein B (gB), is essential as it performs membrane fusion by undergoing extensive rearrangements from a prefusion to postfusion conformation. At present, there are no antiviral drugs targeting gB or neutralizing antibodies directed against its prefusion form, because of the difficulty in structurally determining and using this metastable conformation. Here we show the isolation of prefusion-specific nanobodies, one of which exhibits strong neutralizing and cross-species activity. By mutational stabilization we solved the herpes simplex virus 1 gB full-length prefusion structure, which allowed the bound epitope to be determined. Our analyses show the membrane-embedded regions of gB and previously unresolved structural features 3,4 , including a new fusion loop arrangement, providing insights into the initial conformational changes required for membrane fusion. Binding an epitope spanning three domains, proximal only in the prefusion state, the nanobody keeps wild-type HSV-2 gB in this conformation and enabled its native prefusion structure to be determined. This also indicates the mode of neutralization and an attractive avenue for antiviral interventions.",

          "abstract": "Within 20 pc of the Sun, there are currently 29 known cold brown dwarfs—sources with measured distances and an estimated effective temperature between that of Jupiter (170 K) and approximately 500 K (ref. 1). These sources are almost all isolated and are the closest laboratories we have for detailed atmospheric studies of giant planets formed outside the Solar System. Here we report JWST observations of one such source, WISEA J153429.75-104303.3 (W1534), which we confirm is a substellar mass member of the Galactic halo with a metallicity of less than 0.01 times solar. Its spectrum reveals methane (CH4), water (H2O) and silane (SiH4) gas. Although SiH4 is expected to serve as a key reservoir for the cloud-forming element Si in gas giant worlds, it has remained undetected until now because it is removed from observable atmospheres by the formation of silicate clouds at depth. These condensates are favoured with increasing metallicity, explaining why SiH4 remains undetected on well-studied metal-rich Solar System worlds such as Jupiter and Saturn2. On the metal-poor world W1534, we detect a clear signature of SiH4 centred at about 4.55 μm with an abundance of 19 ± 2 parts per billion. Our chemical modelling suggests that this SiH4 abundance may be quenched at approximately kilobar levels just above the silicate cloud layers, in which vertical atmospheric mixing can transport SiH4 to the observable photosphere. The formation and detection of SiH4 demonstrates key coupled relationships between composition, cloud formation and atmospheric mixing in cold brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres.",

          "abstract": "The second half of the first millennium ce in Central and Eastern Europe was accompanied by fundamental cultural and political transformations. This period of change is commonly associated with the appearance of the Slavs, which is supported by textual evidence 1,2 and coincides with the emergence of similar archaeological horizons 3–6 . However, so far there has been no consensus on whether this archaeological horizon spread by migration, Slavicisation or a combination of both. Genetic data remain sparse, especially owing to the widespread practice of cremation in the early phase of the Slavic settlement. Here we present genome-wide data from 555 ancient individuals, including 359 samples from Slavic contexts from as early as the seventh century ce . Our data demonstrate large-scale population movement from Eastern Europe during the sixth to eighth centuries, replacing more than 80% of the local gene pool in Eastern Germany, Poland and Croatia. Yet, we also show substantial regional heterogeneity as well as a lack of sex-biased admixture, indicating varying degrees of cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations. Comparing archaeological and genetic evidence, we find that the change in ancestry in Eastern Germany coincided with a change in social organization, characterized by an intensification of inter- and intra-site genetic relatedness and patrilocality. On the European scale, it appears plausible that the changes in material culture and language between the sixth and eighth centuries were connected to these large-scale population movements.",

          "abstract": "Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it stabilizes electron transport chain protein complexes1. The final step in CL biosynthesis relates to its remodelling: the exchange of nascent acyl chains with longer, unsaturated chains1. However, the enzyme responsible for cleaving nascent CL (nCL) has remained elusive. Here, we describe ABHD18 as a candidate deacylase in the CL biosynthesis pathway. Accordingly, ABHD18 converts CL into monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) in vitro, and its inactivation in cells and mice results in a shift to nCL in serum and tissues. Notably, ABHD18 deactivation rescues the mitochondrial defects in cells and the morbidity and mortality in mice associated with Barth syndrome. This rare genetic disease is characterized by the build-up of MLCL resulting from inactivating mutations in TAFAZZIN (TAZ), which encodes the final enzyme in the CL-remodelling cascade1. We also identified a selective, covalent, small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD18 that rescues TAZ mutant phenotypes in fibroblasts from human patients and in fish embryos. This study highlights a striking example of genetic suppression of a monogenic disease revealing a canonical enzyme in the CL biosynthesis pathway.",

          "abstract": "Physical neural networks (PNNs) are a class of neural-like networks that make use of analogue physical systems to perform computations. Although at present confined to small-scale laboratory demonstrations, PNNs could one day transform how artificial intelligence (AI) calculations are performed. Could we train AI models many orders of magnitude larger than present ones? Could we perform model inference locally and privately on edge devices? Research over the past few years has shown that the answer to these questions is probably “yes, with enough research”. Because PNNs can make use of analogue physical computations more directly, flexibly and opportunistically than traditional computing hardware, they could change what is possible and practical for AI systems. To do this, however, will require notable progress, rethinking both how AI models work and how they are trained—primarily by considering the problems through the constraints of the underlying hardware physics. To train PNNs, backpropagation-based and backpropagation-free approaches are now being explored. These methods have various trade-offs and, so far, no method has been shown to scale to large models with the same performance as the backpropagation algorithm widely used in deep learning today. However, this challenge has been rapidly changing and a diverse ecosystem of training techniques provides clues for how PNNs may one day be used to create both more efficient and larger-scale realizations of present-scale AI models.",

          "abstract": "The brain avidly consumes glucose to fuel neurophysiology1. Cancers of the brain, such as glioblastoma, relinquish physiological integrity and gain the ability to proliferate and invade healthy tissue2. How brain cancers rewire glucose use to drive aggressive growth remains unclear. Here we infused 13C-labelled glucose into patients and mice with brain cancer, coupled with quantitative metabolic flux analysis, to map the fates of glucose-derived carbon in tumour versus cortex. Through direct and comprehensive measurements of carbon and nitrogen labelling in both cortex and glioma tissues, we identify profound metabolic transformations. In the human cortex, glucose carbons fuel essential physiological processes, including tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidation and neurotransmitter synthesis. Conversely, gliomas downregulate these processes and scavenge alternative carbon sources such as amino acids from the environment, repurposing glucose-derived carbons to generate molecules needed for proliferation and invasion. Targeting this metabolic rewiring in mice through dietary amino acid modulation selectively alters glioblastoma metabolism, slows tumour growth and augments the efficacy of standard-of-care treatments. These findings illuminate how aggressive brain tumours exploit glucose to suppress normal physiological activity in favour of malignant expansion and offer potential therapeutic strategies to enhance treatment outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Enteric pathogens engage in complex interactions with the host and the resident microbiota to establish gut colonization 1–3 . Although mechanistic interactions between enteric pathogens and bacterial commensals have been extensively studied, whether and how commensal fungi affect enteric infections remain largely unknown 1 . Here we show that colonization with the common human gut commensal fungus Candida albicans worsened infections with the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The presence of C. albicans in the mouse gut increased Salmonella caecal colonization and systemic dissemination. We investigated the underlying mechanism and found that Salmonella binds to C. albicans via type 1 fimbriae and uses its type 3 secretion system to deliver effector proteins into C. albicans . A specific effector, SopB, was sufficient to manipulate C. albicans metabolism and trigger the release of millimolar amounts of arginine into the extracellular environment. The released arginine, in turn, induced expression of the type 3 secretion system in Salmonella , increasing its invasion of epithelial cells. C. albicans deficient in arginine production was unable to increase Salmonella virulence. Arginine-producing C. albicans also dampened the inflammatory response during Salmonella infection. Arginine supplementation in the absence of C. albicans increased the systemic spread of Salmonella and decreased the inflammatory response, phenocopying the presence of C. albicans . In summary, we identified C. albicans colonization as a susceptibility factor for disseminated Salmonella infection and arginine as a central metabolite in the cross-kingdom interaction between fungi, bacteria and host.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and combinatorial optimization drive applications across science and industry, but their increasing energy demands challenge the sustainability of digital computing. Most unconventional computing systems 1–7 target either AI or optimization workloads and rely on frequent, energy-intensive digital conversions, limiting efficiency. These systems also face application-hardware mismatches, whether handling memory-bottlenecked neural models, mapping real-world optimization problems or contending with inherent analog noise. Here we introduce an analog optical computer (AOC) that combines analog electronics and three-dimensional optics to accelerate AI inference and combinatorial optimization in a single platform. This dual-domain capability is enabled by a rapid fixed-point search, which avoids digital conversions and enhances noise robustness. With this fixed-point abstraction, the AOC implements emerging compute-bound neural models with recursive reasoning potential and realizes an advanced gradient-descent approach for expressive optimization. We demonstrate the benefits of co-designing the hardware and abstraction, echoing the co-evolution of digital accelerators and deep learning models, through four case studies: image classification, nonlinear regression, medical image reconstruction and financial transaction settlement. Built with scalable, consumer-grade technologies, the AOC paves a promising path for faster and sustainable computing. Its native support for iterative, compute-intensive models offers a scalable analog platform for fostering future innovation in AI and optimization.",

Myofibroblasts transition into several late fibroblast states, including lymphocyte-interactive fibroblasts. Interruption of the early myofibroblast state exacerbated sub-acute brain injury, tissue loss and secondary neuroinflammation, with increased mortality in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model. Disruption of late lymphocyte–fibroblast niches via selective loss of fibroblast chemokine CXCL12 led to late brain-specific innate inflammation and lymphocyte dispersal with increased IFNγ production.

          "abstract": "Nuclease–helicase DNA2 is a multifunctional genome caretaker that is essential for cell proliferation in a range of organisms, from yeast to human 1–4 . Bi-allelic DNA2 mutations that reduce DNA2 concentrations cause a spectrum of primordial dwarfism disorders, including Seckel and Rothmund–Thomson-related syndromes 5–7 . By contrast, cancer cells frequently express high concentrations of DNA2 (refs. 8–11 ). The mechanism that precludes cell proliferation in the absence of DNA2 and the molecular aetiology of DNA2 -linked diseases remain elusive. Here we used yeast and human cells to demonstrate that DNA2 suppresses homologous recombination-restarted replication and checkpoint activation at stalled DNA replication forks. Loss of this control mechanism upon degradation of DNA2 in human cells causes recombination-dependent DNA synthesis and build-up of RPA-bound single-stranded DNA in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Consequently, DNA2 deprivation triggers the DNA damage checkpoint and invariably leads to ATR–p21-dependent cell-cycle exit before mitosis. These findings explain why DNA2 is essential for cell proliferation and reveal that replication fork processing to restrict recombination is indispensable for avoiding cellular senescence. Stochastic entry into senescence stifles the proliferative potential of cells following the expression of a Seckel syndrome patient-derived DNA2 hypomorph or partial degradation of DNA2, providing a conceptual framework to explain global growth failure in DNA2 -linked primordial dwarfism disorders.",

          "abstract": "The neural representations of prior information about the state of the world are poorly understood 1 . Here, to investigate them, we examined brain-wide Neuropixels recordings and widefield calcium imaging collected by the International Brain Laboratory. Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with a prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions that, notably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex) to motor regions (secondary and primary motor cortex and gigantocellular reticular nucleus) and high-level cortical regions (the dorsal anterior cingulate area and ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision-making areas. This study offers a brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large-scale recordings on a single standardized task.",

          "abstract": "For rocky planets, the presence of a solid inner core has notable implications on the composition and thermal evolution of the core and on the magnetic history of the planet 1–3 . On Mars, geophysical observations have confirmed that the core is at least partially liquid 4–7 , but it is unknown whether any part of the core is solid. Here we present an analysis of seismic data acquired by the InSight mission, demonstrating that Mars has a solid inner core. We identify two seismic phases, the deep core-transiting phase, PKKP, and the inner core boundary reflecting phase, PKiKP, indicative of the inner core. Our inversions constrain the radius of the Martian inner core to about 613 ± 67 km, with a compressional velocity jump of around 30% across the inner core boundary, supported by additional inner-core-related seismic phases. These properties imply a concentration of distinct light elements in the inner core, segregated from the outer core through core crystallization. This finding provides an anchor point for understanding the thermal and chemical state of Mars. Moreover, the relationship between inner core formation and the Martian magnetic field evolution could provide insights into dynamo generation across planetary bodies.",

In the human brain, the prefrontal cortex undergoes age-related changes that can affect cognitive functioning later in life2. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) and spatial transcriptomics, we identify gene-expression and genomic changes in the human prefrontal cortex across lifespan, from infancy to centenarian. snRNA-seq identified infant-specific cell clusters enriched for the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, as well as an age-associated common downregulation of cell-essential homeostatic genes that function in ribosomes, transport and metabolism across cell types. Conversely, the expression of neuron-specific genes generally remains stable throughout life. These findings were validated with spatial transcriptomics. scWGS identified two age-associated mutational signatures that correlate with gene transcription and gene repression, respectively, and revealed gene length- and expression-level-dependent rates of somatic mutation in neurons that correlate with the transcriptomic landscape of the aged human brain. Our results provide insight into crucial aspects of human brain development and ageing, and shed light on transcriptomic and genomic dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Prokaryotes create adaptive immune memories by acquiring foreign DNA snippets, known as spacers, into the CRISPR array1. In type II CRISPR-Cas systems, the RNA-guided effector Cas9 also assists the acquisition machinery by selecting spacers from protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-flanked DNA2,3. Here, we uncover the first biological role for Cas9 that is independent of its dual RNA partners. Following depletion of crRNA and/or tracrRNA, Neisseria apoCas9 stimulates spacer acquisition efficiency. Physiologically, Cas9 senses low levels of crRNA in cells with short CRISPR arrays – such as those undergoing array neogenesis or natural array contractions – and dynamically upregulates acquisition to quickly expand the small immune memory banks. As the CRISPR array expands, rising crRNA abundance in turn reduces apoCas9 availability, thereby dampening acquisition to mitigate autoimmunity risks associate with elevated acquisition. While apoCas9’s nuclease lobe alone suffices for stimulating acquisition, only full-length Cas9 responses to crRNA levels to boost acquisition in cells with low immunity depth. Finally, we show that this activity is evolutionarily conserved across multiple type II-C Cas9 orthologs. Altogether, we establish an auto-replenishing feedback mechanism in which apoCas9 safeguards CRISPR immunity depth by acting as both a crRNA sensor and a regulator of spacer acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Metazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures 1,2 . In the early embryo, these processes occur concurrently such that forces generated in neighbouring tissues can impose mechanical stresses on each other 3–5 , potentially disrupting development and consequently decreasing fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to mitigate inter-tissue mechanical conflicts remains unclear. Here, we combined phylogenetic survey, quantitative live imaging and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate mechanical stress management during gastrulation across the insect order of flies (Diptera). We identify two distinct cellular mechanisms that prevent tissue collision between the expanding head and trunk. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic subgroup including Drosophila melanogaster , active out-of-plane deformation of a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow, acts as a mechanical sink to pre-empt head–trunk collision. Genetic and optogenetic ablation of the cephalic furrow leads to accumulation of compressive stress, tissue buckling at the head–trunk boundary and late-stage embryonic defects in the head and nervous system. By contrast, the non-cyclorrhaphan Chironomus riparius lacks cephalic furrow formation and instead undergoes widespread out-of-plane division that reduces the duration and spatial extent of head expansion. Re-orienting head mitosis from in-plane to out-of-plane in Drosophila partially suppresses tissue buckling, showing that it can function as an alternative mechanical sink. Our data suggest that mechanisms of mechanical stress management emerge and diverge in response to inter-tissue conflicts during early embryonic development.",

Here we show that acute stress activates medial amygdala (MeA) neurons that innervate the ventromedial hypothalamus (MeAVMH neurons), which precipitates hyperglycaemia and hypophagia. The glycaemic actions of MeAVMH neurons occur independently of adrenal or pancreatic glucoregulatory hormones. Using whole-body virus tracing, we identify a polysynaptic connection from MeA to the liver that promotes the rapid synthesis of glucose by hepatic gluconeogenesis. Repeated stress exposure disrupts MeA control of blood glucose, resulting in diabetes-like dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. Our findings reveal an amygdala–liver axis that regulates rapid glycaemic adaptations to stress and links recurrent stress to metabolic dysfunction.",

The last three of these applications typically use traditional machining to customize macroscopic 3D Paul traps8, whereas quantum information processing experiments usually rely on photolithographic techniques to miniaturize the traps and meet scalability requirements9,10. Using photolithography, however, it is challenging to fabricate the complex 3D electrode structures required for optimal confinement. Here we demonstrate a high-resolution 3D printing technology based on two-photon polymerization (2PP)11 that is capable of fabricating large arrays of high-performance miniaturized 3D traps. We show that 3D-printed ion traps combine the advantages, such as strong radial confinement, of traditionally machined 3D traps with on-chip miniaturization. We trap calcium ions in 3D-printed ion traps with radial trap frequencies ranging from 2 MHz to 24 MHz. The tight confinement eases ion cooling requirements and allows us to implement high-quality Rabi oscillations with Doppler cooling only. Also, we demonstrate a two-qubit gate with a Bell-state fidelity of 0.978 ± 0.012. With 3D printing technology, the design freedom is greatly expanded without sacrificing scalability and precision, so that ion trap geometries can be optimized for higher performance and better functionality.",

Here we show that an evolutionary novelty of fly embryos—the patterned embryonic invagination known as the cephalic furrow 5–7 —has a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we demonstrate that the head–trunk boundary of the embryo is under increased compressive stress due to the concurrent formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension and that the cephalic furrow counteracts these stresses, preventing mechanical instabilities during gastrulation. Then, by comparing the genetic patterning of species with and without the cephalic furrow, we find evidence that changes in the expression of the transcription factor buttonhead are associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. These results suggest that the cephalic furrow may have evolved through the genetic stabilization of morphogenesis in response to the mechanical challenges of dipteran gastrulation. Together, our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.",

Here, using our approach for identifying functional GWAS risk variants showing allele-specific open chromatin, we systematically identified putative causal LOAD-risk variants in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived neurons, astrocytes and microglia, and linked a PICALM LOAD-risk allele to a microglial-specific role of PICALM in lipid droplet (LD) accumulation. Allele-specific open-chromatin mapping revealed functional risk variants for 26 LOAD-risk loci, mostly specific to microglia. At the microglial-specific PICALM locus, the LOAD-risk allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10792832 reduced transcription factor (PU.1) binding and PICALM expression, impairing the uptake of amyloid beta (Aβ) and myelin debris. Notably, microglia carrying the PICALM risk allele showed transcriptional enrichment of pathways for cholesterol synthesis and LD formation. Genetic and pharmacological perturbations of microglia further established a causal link between reduced PICALM expression, LD accumulation and phagocytosis deficits. Our work elucidates the selective LOAD vulnerability in microglia at the PICALM locus through detrimental LD accumulation, providing a neurobiological basis that can be exploited for developing clinical interventions.",

Here we uncover and characterize the fundamental secondary resistance mechanisms that allow steel truss bridges to withstand the initial failure of any main component. These mechanisms differ substantially from the primary resistance mechanisms considered during the design of (undamaged) bridges. After testing a scaled-down specimen of a real bridge and using validated numerical models to simulate the failure of all main bridge components, we show how secondary resistance mechanisms interact to redistribute the loads supported by failed components to other parts of the structure. By studying the evolution of these mechanisms under increasing loads up to global failure, we are able to describe the conditions that enable their effective development.

Understanding learning principles in engineered molecular systems could enable us to endow non-living physical systems with similar capabilities. Inspired by how the brain processes information, the principles of neural computation have been developed over the past 80 years1, forming the foundation of modern machine learning. More than four decades ago, connections between neural computation and physical systems were established2. More recently, synthetic molecular systems, including nucleic acid and protein circuits, have been investigated for their abilities to implement neural computation3,4,5,6,7. However, in these systems, learning of molecular parameters such as concentrations and reaction rates was performed in silico to generate desired input–output functions. Here we show that DNA molecules can be programmed to autonomously carry out supervised learning in vitro, with the system learning to perform pattern classification from molecular examples of inputs and desired responses. We demonstrate a DNA neural network trained to classify three different sets of 100-bit patterns, integrating training data directly into memories of molecular concentrations and using these memories to process subsequent test data. Our work suggests that molecular circuits can learn tasks more complex than simple adaptive behaviours. This opens the door to molecular machines capable of embedded learning and decision-making in a wide range of physical systems, from biomedicine to soft materials.",

High-throughput in vitro technologies, such as protein-binding microarrays1,2,3,4,5,6 and HT-SELEX (high-throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment)7,8, have revealed the DNA-binding specificities of hundreds of TFs. However, they have limited ability to reliably identify lower-affinity DNA binding sites, which are increasingly recognized as important for precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Here, to address this limitation, we developed protein affinity to DNA by in vitro transcription and RNA sequencing (PADIT-seq), with which we comprehensively assayed the binding preferences of six TFs to all possible ten-base-pair DNA sequences, detecting hundreds of novel, lower-affinity binding sites. The expanded repertoire of lower-affinity binding sites revealed that nucleotides flanking high-affinity DNA binding sites create overlapping lower-affinity sites that together modulate TF genomic occupancy in vivo. We propose a model in which TF binding is not determined by individual binding sites, but rather by the sum of multiple, overlapping binding sites. The overlapping binding model explains how competition between paralogous TFs for shared high-affinity binding sites is determined by flanking nucleotides that create differential numbers of overlapping, lower-affinity binding sites. Critically, the model transforms our understanding of noncoding-variant effects, revealing how single nucleotide changes simultaneously alter multiple overlapping sites to additively influence gene expression and human traits, including diseases.",

However, little is known about how internal states and external cues are integrated to release appropriate behaviours at the correct moment during a social interaction, such as the transition from the appetitive to the consummatory phases of mating1,2. Here we identify a neural circuit in male mice that gates the onset of consummatory reproductive behaviours on contact with a mating partner. Stimulating MPOAEsr1∩Vgat hypothalamic neurons promotes mounting of conspecifics and three-dimensional dummy objects3. We find that such mounting depends on mechanosensory but not visual cues. Through a large-scale electrophysiological screen, we identify neurons in the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus that nonlinearly integrate medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus (MPOA) and mechanosensory input to encode contact with a potential mate. Circuit tracing and perturbations demonstrated that this conjunctive coding occurs by means of convergent disinhibition from MPOA and excitation from the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Functional manipulations and calcium recordings showed these social-contact neurons, marked by parathyroid hormone 2, were essential for and able to promote mounting. These data indicate that subparafascicular thalamic nucleus-parathyroid hormone 2 neurons integrate internal drive with social touch to trigger mounting at opportune moments during mating. More generally, our findings uncover a brain mechanism whereby an internal state can attribute a social quality to a generic touch to initiate purposeful reproductive actions.",

          "abstract": "The planet’s capacity to store carbon-dioxide emissions in rock formations is much smaller than previous estimates suggest, and it could run out as early as 2200, according to a study1 published in Nature today.\n\nTo meet the goal of the 2015 Paris agreement — limiting global warming to 1.5–2 °C above pre-industrial temperatures — vast amounts of CO2 will need to be removed from the atmosphere. One way to do that is to capture CO2 produced by industry and store it deep underground.\n\nResearchers report that Earth can safely store around 1,460 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (GtCO₂) — a number much lower than the 10,000–40,000 GtCO₂ often cited in previous studies2.\n\nAt present, carbon capture and storage technologies remove only 49 million tonnes of CO₂ annually, with a further 416 million tonnes per year in planned capacity, say the authors of the study. But to stay within the Paris target, annual carbon storage would need to rise to 8.7 GtCO₂ by mid-century — a 175-fold increase over the next three decades.\n\nLow-risk storage\n\nTo estimate Earth’s storage capacity, the study — led by scientists at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria — calculated that the planet has a physical storage reserve of 11,800 GtCO2. But, when the researchers estimated how much of those reserves can be used practically without the risk of carbon leakage triggered by earthquakes, or without access being blocked owing to political decisions, the capacity dropped to 1,460 GtCO₂.\n\nThe study focused on the storage capacity of stable sedimentary basins, in which most prospective CO2 storage sites are being considered.\n\nEven if the 1,460 GtCO₂ capacity was used exclusively for removing carbon from the atmosphere, the effort would reverse global warming by only 0.7 °C. Current trends suggest that global warming will increase by up to 3 °C this century, even if all the identified geological storage for reversing climate change is used, it would not reverse warming back to 2 °C, says Joeri Rogelj, a co-author of the study and a climate scientist at Imperial College London.\n\nThe researchers suggest that if stored CO₂ escapes to the surface, it could lead to the formation of carbonic acid in groundwater. Acidic conditions can dissolve metal-containing minerals, releasing toxic metals that could harm humans and the environment.\n\nWinners and losers",

It examined the proportion of people in those couples who had one of nine psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance-use disorder and anorexia nervosa.\n\nScientists lack a definitive understanding of what causes people to develop psychiatric disorders — but genetics and environmental factors are both thought to play a part.\n\nThe team found that when one partner was diagnosed with one of the nine conditions, the other was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same or another psychiatric condition. Spouses were more likely to have the same conditions than to have different ones, says co-author Chun Chieh Fan, a population and genetics researcher at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\n“The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations,” Fan says. Even changes in psychiatric care over the past 50 years have not shifted the trend, he notes.\n\nOnly OCD, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa showed different patterns around the world. For instance, in Taiwan, married couples were more likely to share OCD than were couples in Nordic countries.\n\nThe study separated people into birth cohorts, from the 1930s to the 1990s, spanning ten-year intervals. For most disorders, the chances of partners sharing a diagnosis increased slightly with each decade, particularly for those with disorders related to substance use.\n\nWhat’s behind the trend?\n\nAlthough the study did not investigate what causes the phenomenon, Fan says three theories could help to explain it. First, people might be attracted to those who resemble them. “Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering, so they attract each other,” he says.\n\nSecond, a shared environment could make partners more alike — a process known as convergence. And third, the societal stigma of having a psychiatric disorder narrows a person’s choice of spouse.\n\nJan Fullerton, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that social and environmental stressors could contribute to a new diagnosis in a previously unaffected partner, particularly if they had milder, undiagnosed symptoms.",

Further research could provide insights into how microbes might have helped ancient animals to adapt to varied environments, and whether they might have been involved in the extinction of these species.\n\nPathogenic microbes\n\nPrevious research on ancient remains has focused mainly on the DNA of humans and human-associated microorganisms, and few studies have looked at microbe–host interactions in prehistoric animals.\n\nTo investigate the relationship between mammoths and microorganisms, the researchers analysed ancient microbial DNA from samples of teeth, skulls and skin from 483 mammoths. The specimens encompass a range of geographical locations, from North America and Britain to Siberia, and date from the Early Pleistocene — around one million years ago — to the extinction of the last mammoths on Wrangel Island (a remote island off the coast of Siberia) during the Holocene, 4,000 years ago.\n\nAncient mammoth teeth, pictured here, contained DNA from 310 different species of bacteria.Credit: Love Dalén\n\nThe researchers identified 310 microbial species that were associated with the mammoth tissues. Many of these were environmental microorganisms that would have colonized the tissues after death, so the team first filtered out the DNA sequences of these post-mortem bacteria. This allowed them to focus on the bacteria that lived inside the mammoths when they were alive.\n\nUsing metagenomic screening — a technique for sequencing genetic material in samples that contain genomes from a mixture of organisms — the researchers analysed the DNA present in the mammoth specimens. They then used phylogenetic inference to identify the bacterial genera, by comparing the ancient microbial sequences with those of modern bacteria.\n\nThe analysis found six microbial groups associated with the hosts, some of which might have caused diseases in the mammoths. These included a strain similar to Actinobacillus, which has previously been isolated from pig (Sus domesticus) faeces and is thought to be part of the mammoth oral microbiome. They also identified Pasteurella, a bacterial genus closely related to a pathogen that has been linked to the deaths of several African elephants in Botswana and Zimbabwe in 2020. The pathogen infected the mouths of the elephants, then made its way to the bloodstream, causing fatal septicaemia.\n\nThe team also reconstructed genomes of a family of bacteria called Erysipelothrix from samples from four woolly mammoths and from a 1.1-million-year-old steppe mammoth, which is the oldest host-associated microbial DNA yet discovered. Unlike the other bacterial groups, which were associated only with teeth cells, this microorganism was, in the case of the woolly mammal specimens, found in bone tissue.\n\nAncient microbiomes\n\nThe exact effects that these bacterial colonies had on the health of mammoths is difficult to elucidate from this genetic analysis, but the researchers say their study provides a first look at the microbes of ancient animals.",

          "abstract": "The salt spray of the Pacific Ocean is in my blood; I grew up watching the tides shape the shores of the islands of Tuvalu. But now, those tides are rising relentlessly, eroding lands, swallowing homes, decimating livelihoods and washing away the futures of communities. Entire islands are sinking. One-third of Tuvalu’s citizens are seeking ‘climate refuge’ in Australia.\n\nClimate change is not a distant threat; it is our daily reality.\n\nBut there is hope. At the end of July, in The Hague, the Netherlands, I bore witness to a historic moment. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivered the advisory opinion that states have a legal duty to prevent climate harm and, importantly, that they can be held accountable for the consequences of their actions, through financial compensation or other forms of restitution.\n\nA message from island leaders: protect the Pacific Ocean from deep-sea mining\n\nThe ruling means that climate justice is no longer simply a moral obligation, but a matter of international law. This feels like a seismic shift. The relentless cries from front-line communities across the Pacific, who have long borne the brunt of a crisis we did not create, have been heard.\n\nThe ICJ offered clarity on fossil fuels in particular: producing, licensing and subsidizing them could constitute an “internationally wrongful act” for which states can be held liable under international law. Nations have a duty to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions — and the court highlighted the legal liability that could arise from expanding fossil-fuel infrastructure in the face of clear scientific warnings.\n\nIt is especially powerful that this legal breakthrough stems from the efforts of small island nations, launched by courageous Pacific youth in 2019, initially in Vanuatu then through cross-border collaborations. It is a reminder that those most affected by the climate crisis are also among the most determined in addressing it. Through efforts ranging from grassroots movements to international diplomacy, Pacific island nations have charted a path that places justice at the centre of climate governance. This is a powerful example of vulnerable voices driving transformative change at the highest levels of international law.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nThe ICJ also emphasized that cooperation between states is central to meaningful climate action, and identified treaties as a crucial tool for coordinated implementation. This gives wind to the sails of emerging legal instruments. A fossil-fuel non-proliferation treaty has been proposed, for example, that would provide legal grounding for states to pursue coordinated, binding action on a fossil-fuel phase-out and a just transition to renewable energy. It is currently supported by 17 nations, including Tuvalu, that are shaping the treaty proposal and discussing how to involve others and initiate a formal negotiation process. A high-level ministerial meeting in Belém, Brazil, in November, has been planned alongside the COP30 climate talks to move the process forward.",

          "abstract": "For academics, working with industry’s vast sources of proprietary data and innovative tools can be enticing. But tensions, including competing interests, might make these collaborations daunting.\n\nOver the past few decades, I have seen how challenging such partnerships can be. But I’ve also seen how following best practices can make them work. In 2014, I co-authored Organized Innovation, analysing the US Engineering Research Centers programme — supporting hubs hosted in universities and funded by the US National Science Foundation that engage productively with corporations. We learnt that successful collaborations not only acknowledge that conflicts can arise, but also commit to creating formal procedures for resolving them.\n\nJapan can be a science heavyweight once more — if it rethinks funding\n\nThe stakes are high today. The ‘magnificent seven’ technology firms — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — and newcomers such as OpenAI have research and development (R&D) budgets that dwarf spending available to most academic laboratories. In 2022, Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and Microsoft spent tens of billions of dollars on R&D. In 2024, Meta alone spent nearly US$44 billion, or 27% of its annual revenues, on R&D.\n\nMany tech investments have shifted from the development to the research side. Last year, Demis Hassabis, co-founder of the artificial intelligence (AI) start-up firm DeepMind, acquired by Google in 2014, received jointly with his colleague John Jumper half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing AlphaFold, an AI model that predicts protein structures.\n\nYet, many academics remain wary of working with ‘big tech’, whose approaches can be controversial. These firms’ technologies connect people globally, increase productivity, foster economic growth and advance AI. But those same tools can also host and spread misinformation as well as exacerbate social biases and inequities. Corporate affiliations with the defence sector can raise ethical questions. Meta, for example, allows its large language model Llama to be used for military purposes. One way for companies to minimize such problems is through internal review boards.\n\nWant to speed up scientific progress? First understand how science policy works\n\nFor academics, engaging with big tech can also come with real or perceived conflicts of financial interest (when money unduly influences research), commitment (prioritizing commercial over academic activities) or loyalty (prioritizing the company’s interests over those of an academic institution). These risks can be mitigated by committees that adjudicate conflicts.\n\nConcerns about monopolies and a market concentration of leading tech firms — which can limit innovation and consumer choice — can make collaboration off-putting to academics. Government regulators and courts are stepping in. For example, in April, a US district judge in Alexandria, Virginia, ruled in favour of the US Department of Justice’s suit alleging Google’s illegal monopolizing of the advertising market.",

That’s according to researchers who found that beer drinkers tasting a series of lagers fall into two distinct categories: those who prefer strong-flavoured chemicals and those who prefer mellow ones.\n\nThe team reported its findings on 18 August at the American Chemical Society meeting in Washington DC.\n\nHow we taste sweetness: long-sought structure of human receptor mapped at last\n\nWhen taste-testing a new beer, researchers tend to rely on trained panelists who can pick out citrus or floral notes in the same way a sommelier can with wine. Devin Peterson, a food scientist at the Ohio State University in Columbus, wanted to go beyond the professionals, to learn what the average beer enthusiast is drawn to, for a better “understanding of what’s driving consumer behaviour”, he told Nature.\n\nSo he and his colleagues tasked about 135 self-proclaimed beer enthusiasts with trying 18 different lagers across 3 tasting sessions and rating them. To level the playing field, the team ensured that the competing beers contained similar percentages of alcohol and had somewhat similar levels of bitterness. Participants evaluated characteristics such as the beers’ sweetness and aroma intensity, and the researchers used mass spectrometry to determine each beer’s predominant flavour chemicals.\n\nThe tasters split into two factions on the basis of their beer rankings, the team found. For the group that preferred stronger flavours, brands such as Samuel Adams and Brooklyn were at the top of the list, and Budweiser was near the bottom. Those who enjoyed a mellower-tasting beer placed the same brands in nearly opposite spots. The two groups are “polar opposites in how they’re responding to the product”, Peterson said during the presentation.",

The reasons lie partly in the lack of definitive observational phenomenology to guide us and partly in the character of gravity, which makes quantum gravity different from all other physical theories.\n\nIn this article I diagnose, in Albert Einstein’s words, “where the shoe pinches” in quantum gravity and describe one way forward based on physicist Richard Feynman’s alternative vision for quantum mechanics.\n\nQuantum foundations\n\nA good place to start is Werner Heisenberg’s famous 1925 breakthrough on the Danish island of Heligoland. In retrospect, the truly fresh and startling concept introduced by Heisenberg is that of transitions of the atom from one quantum state to another, transitions that do not occur in the familiar three dimensions of physical space. That breakthrough set up a conflict between the new rules of quantum prediction and the familiar, historically successful conceptual framework of physical goings-on occurring in real 3D space.\n\nThe question of where atomic transitions occur, if not in 3D space, was not raised explicitly by Heisenberg in 1925 but was answered soon afterwards. The whereabouts of these transitions was identified and formalized mathematically by Paul Dirac and others as being the ‘Hilbert space’ of the quantum system, which comprises all conceivable quantum states of the system. In mathematics, the Hilbert space takes the form of a ‘vector space’: think of the quantum state as an arrow pointing in a particular direction in a space with many, many dimensions.\n\nPhysicists should revel in the diversity of ways to understand quantum mechanics\n\nThe transitions in Hilbert space from one quantum-state vector to another affect and are affected by what occurs in physical 3D space by means of special interactions between the quantum system and instruments that exist in 3D space. Such interactions are known as measurements, and the standard quantum rules make predictions about the outcomes of measurements registered by the instruments in 3D space.\n\nTo make these predictions, the goings-on in Hilbert space must be coordinated with the goings-on in 3D space, and this coordination is achieved using a concept of synchronized time. As time passes in Hilbert space, the vector arrow of the state of the quantum system changes. Its motion in Hilbert space is governed by a law of quantum physics, the Schrödinger equation, and is a type of rotation: the angle through which the quantum-state vector rotates in Hilbert space is proportional to the time that passes.\n\nTime also passes for the measuring instruments, and physicists, in physical 3D space. The situation is like a round in the long-running British comedy radio show, I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue, in which each celebrity contestant has to sing along with a recording of a song, then continue to sing while the recording is muted. When the recording is unmuted again, the contestant wins points if they are still singing in synch with the recording. Seriously, it’s funnier than it sounds.\n\nIn this analogy, the song playing is like the quantum state evolving in Hilbert space, and the singer is like the measuring instrument in 3D space. The period during which the singer cannot hear the recording is like the period during which the measuring instrument is not making a measurement. The moment of unmuting is like the moment of measurement.\n\nIn the game, the singer can get out of synch with the recording, but in quantum mechanics, the synchronization is always perfect. The time that has passed in 3D space for the measuring instrument is always in perfect synch with the time that has passed in Hilbert space, marked by the angle the state vector has rotated through.\n\nThis perfect synchronization is so fundamental to quantum mechanics that, when working in the theory, the same symbol t is used for time in 3D physical space and for time in Hilbert space.\n\nBy means of this concept of synchronized time, Heisenberg and his colleagues in Copenhagen established a scientifically successful détente between the two notions of the whereabouts of physical goings-on. Although the evolution of the state of the quantum system occurs in Hilbert space, scientific predictions are about instances in which the instrument measures something, which occur in physical 3D space.\n\nThe past 100 years have proven that a quantum physicist can become extremely successful by accepting and working with the Copenhagen group’s strange ‘duality of location’. When the quantum system is gravity, however, the Copenhagen view cannot hold.\n\nGravity’s exceptionalism\n\nGravity is not like other physical systems. Our best theory of gravity is the general theory of relativity, which was published by Einstein in 1915. In general relativity, the physical entity that is the subject of the theory is space-time. Space-time is a physical 4D fabric with geometrical structure that bends, warps, ripples, carries energy and has its own laws of motion, which are as precise and experimentally successful as Newton’s laws of mechanics.\n\n‘Shut up and calculate’: how Einstein lost the battle to explain quantum reality\n\nIn general relativity, space-time graduates from being a fixed stage on which what happens happens, to being both the stage and a dynamical actor in reality’s play in its own right. Gravity’s physical status is different from those of other systems. If particles, for example, are absent from a region of space-time, there can still be physical goings-on in that region, including warping or rippling of space-time itself. But if space-time is absent, there cannot be any particles, any electromagnetic radiation or anything else — because there’s nowhere and no-when for them to be.\n\nNothing is external to space-time: every physical thing that exists in general relativity either is space-time or is in space-time. The Copenhagen requirement for a physical measuring instrument in physical space external to the quantum system is incompatible with the quantum system being space-time.\n\nAlso, the character of physical time in general relativity stymies the synchronization that the Copenhagen détente requires. In general relativity, physical time passes individually for each particle, body or measuring instrument along its own unique, individual path, or ‘worldline’, in space-time. These individual physical worldline times cannot even be synchronized with each other and so cannot be synchronized with the time that passes in Hilbert space, as demanded by the Copenhagen rules. For quantum gravity, Heisenberg’s détente collapses, and an alternative approach is needed.\n\nFeynman’s alternative\n\nIn 1985, Feynman gave a series of public lectures about quantum electrodynamics1, the theory unifying quantum mechanics and electromagnetism, for which he shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics. In the lectures, he set out an alternative approach to quantum theory, in which there is no strange duality of location — quantum states evolving in Hilbert space were simply left out.\n\nInstead, Feynman based his explanations of quantum phenomena on events and histories in space-time, concepts that are also fundamental in general relativity. Starting in the 1980s, physicists James Hartle and Rafael Sorkin, independently, sought to build on Feynman’s approach and develop it into an alternative foundation for a quantum theory suitable for describing gravity. Here’s how the Feynmanian approach works.\n\nAn event is something that can happen. It’s useful to have concrete examples in mind, so think of rain on a particular date in Bengaluru, India. An event has a space-time location, and it either happens or it doesn’t. Beforehand, it is uncertain whether a given event will or will not occur, but afterwards, there is no uncertainty: it either rained or it did not.",

          "abstract": "The Wolbito do Brasil factory is breeding Wolbachia-modified mosquitoes, and the eggs will be shipped to Brazilian cities to help reduce disease rates.Credit: Wolbito do Brasil\n\nCuritiba, Brazil\n\nWhen biologist Antonio Brandão tells people that he works at a mosquito factory, they are often baffled. “Why would you make more mosquitoes?”, he recalls people asking. “We have enough of them.” But once he explains that the laboratory-raised insects can help to stop the spread of dengue — which strikes hundreds of thousands in Brazil each year and causes fever, headache and bone pain — they come around.\n\nDengue rates drop after release of modified mosquitoes in Colombia\n\nBrandão is the production manager at not just any mosquito factory, but the world’s largest, located in the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba. Launched in July, the facility is expected to produce 100 million eggs a week from the mosquito Aedes aegypti. However, unlike wild A. aegypti, the main transmitter of dengue virus, those churned out by the factory carry a harmless Wolbachia bacterium that curbs the insects’ ability to spread viruses including dengue and Zika. The idea is to release the modified mosquitoes, which researchers call wolbitos, into cities in Brazil, where they will mate with their wild counterparts and the females will pass the bacterium on to their offspring, gradually converting the local population.\n\nThe wolbito strategy, which is being spearheaded by the non-profit World Mosquito Program (WMP), has already shown success in Colombia, Indonesia and at home: in the Brazilian city of Niterói in the southeast, dengue cases dropped by 69% in areas where Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes were released, compared with areas where they weren’t1. Brazil’s federal government has adopted the approach to fight dengue infections — which surged to a record 6.5 million confirmed cases in the country last year — alongside other preventive measures such as vaccines.\n\nWhen will dengue strike? Outbreaks sync with heat and rain\n\nHowever, researchers at the factory have discovered that raising millions of the mosquitoes is surprisingly tricky, especially because the insects are fussy about temperature and other factors. Nature visited the Wolbito do Brasil facility — run by a firm formed by the WMP, the Molecular Biology Institute of Paraná and Fiocruz, a research institute affiliated with Brazil’s health ministry — to hear first-hand about the lessons learnt by staff members before they released the factory’s first mosquitoes in late August.\n\nTheir hard-won knowledge will inform other efforts to rein in mosquito-borne illnesses around the world, says Gabriela Paz-Bailey, an epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who is based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. “There will be plenty of lessons learned from the Brazilian government involvement in this strategy.”\n\nA factory abuzz with activity\n\nFemale A. aegypti mosquitoes need only a small amount of water — a puddle inside an abandoned tyre or bottle cap, for instance — to lay their eggs. This makes it difficult to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in urban areas, but it can also be used to the factory’s advantage. The facility has engineered small, dissolvable capsules, similar to those used for holding medicines, to store around 500 mosquito eggs each. These can be shipped to locations where they are needed, then easily dissolved in small amounts of water for hatching. Fish food is included in the capsules to nourish larvae.\n\nTo produce such a large number of eggs in the first place, the factory relies on millions of adult mosquitoes mating and laying eggs around the clock. Researchers ensure that the insects carry a strain of Wolbachia, which can be passed from female mosquitoes to their offspring.\n\nStep inside Wolbito do Brasil with reporter Mariana Lenharo as she learns how the factory breeds and cares for its modified mosquitoes.\n\nIn one of the most impressive rooms at the facility, 66 mesh cages big enough for a human to stand inside hold roughly 10 million mosquitoes in total. Females lay their eggs on strips of paper placed at the bottom of each cage. The tiny black eggs, no bigger than a grain of sand, are collected, and either put into capsules or held for hatching at the facility, to replenish the insects in the cages.\n\nGetting mosquitoes hatched from the eggs to develop inside the controlled facility has been a challenge, however. At each stage of their life cycle, A. aegypti have specific temperature and humidity requirements. Researchers store eggs in a cool but humid room to prevent them from drying out. Larvae, however, require warmer conditions, meaning that the facility needs to shuffle insects to other climate-controlled areas as they develop. “They are very delicate. If you vary some parameters of humidity and temperature, this affects them and impacts their productivity,” says Marlene Salazar, a biologist at the facility.\n\nA demand for blood",

          "authors": "Elena Hoffer",
          "abstract": "The professional-networking site LinkedIn can be useful for finding like-minded people around the globe.Credit: Yalcin Sonat/Alamy\n\nWhen I started my PhD in 2018, I thought LinkedIn was for only business people — dry, corporate and dominated by people bragging about their latest achievement. I couldn’t imagine spending time on it. But by the end of my PhD in 2023, the networking site had opened doors I didn’t even know existed. So what changed?\n\nDuring my doctorate at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, I helped to organize careers events for PhD students, inviting speakers who had transitioned into jobs outside academia.\n\nI did this because I had seen so many brilliant scientists leave academia not because they weren’t good enough, but because they were exhausted or felt unsupported. But when they tried to leave, there was no guidance or roadmap.\n\nI realized that, if I cared so much about this issue, maybe I should do something about it, so I founded a company to provide a better support system.\n\nBuilding a company means building connections, and I had been told repeatedly: ‘Without a network, you won’t get anywhere.’ So I started looking for one — and that’s how I ended up on LinkedIn.\n\nIt felt a little scary at first — a global platform with one billion users, but with an open structure in which technically anyone can interact with anyone. I started using LinkedIn to find other company founders and like-minded people. One of these was Angela Priest, a hiring manager with two decades of experience building high-performing teams in industry. We met online and both knew right away that we were a great match. We shared professional values, drive and a deep desire to make things better.\n\nWe co-founded Alma.Me in 2024. Our mission is to provide early-career researchers with the tools and knowledge they need to quickly land a job in industry. We do this mainly through suggesting improvements to industry CVs, interview preparation and one-to-one coaching, guiding PhD graduates on how to effectively market themselves to a business audience.\n\nFounding Alma.Me opened the next door. It brought me back to the Karolinska Institute and to its head of doctoral education, Robert (Bob) Harris, who had placed my doctor’s hat on my head during the PhD graduation ceremony six months earlier — a monumental moment for me. I remember thinking: ‘This is the man I need to talk to.’ He’s in charge of doctoral education, so I knew I needed to get him to understand how important career preparation is for new graduates.\n\nBut how do you reach someone like him once you’ve left the university? The answer was through LinkedIn. I started by commenting on a few of his posts, and eventually suggested meeting up for a chat over coffee.\n\nThat conversation changed everything. Bob agreed with Alma.Me’s mission. He truly cares about students. Thanks to him, Alma.Me now offers a career-development course — accredited by the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System —at the Karolinska, something I had never imagined would be possible.\n\nAt that point, I had already achieved some important goals: launching a business with Angela, providing services to help PhD students to transition into careers and getting our course included at a prominent medical university.\n\nBut I didn’t stop there. Bob and I shared a vision for something bigger. Career development was one piece of the puzzle, but we both knew there was more to improve. The question was: how can one or two voices make a difference? We imagined a global collective of people who wanted to rethink the academic ecosystem. So we turned to our networks — especially LinkedIn — and, almost magically, we started finding them.\n\nThat’s how the Academic Think Tank (TATT) was born earlier this year. TATT brings together a select group of researchers, educators and entrepreneurs from all corners of the world with a shared vision of rethinking what academia 2.0 could look like: inclusive, sustainable and human.\n\nWe met five of our ten TATT members through LinkedIn. Our one selection criterion was simple: you have to care. You have to want to improve things and deeply want to make a difference for the people in the system. Our members span the globe — from Texas to Osaka, Japan. I would never have met these people in real life, but LinkedIn made it easy.\n\nElena Hoffer used LinkedIn to help build her business Alma.Me.Credit: Angela Priest",

The findings1 were published in PLoS Biology this week.\n\nThe worm (Paralvinella hessleri) is the only creature to inhabit the hottest part of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Okinawa Trough in the western Pacific Ocean.

The AI-enabled device also allowed the man to perform screen-based tasks four times better than when he used the device on its own.\n\nBrain–computer interfaces (BCIs) capture electrical signals from the brain, then analyse them to determine what the person wants to do and translate the signals into commands. Some BCIs are surgically implanted and record signals directly from the brain, which typically makes them more accurate than non-invasive devices that are attached to the scalp.\n\nJonathan Kao, who studies AI and BCIs at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues wanted to improve the performance of non-invasive BCIs. The results of their work are published in Nature Machine Intelligence this week.\n\nFirst, the team tested its BCI by tasking four people — one with paralysis and three without — with moving a computer cursor to a particular spot on a screen. All four were able to complete the task the majority of the time.\n\nWhen the authors added an AI co-pilot to the device, the participants completed the task more quickly and had a higher success rate. The device with the co-pilot doesn’t need to decode as much brain activity because the AI can infer what the user wants to do, says Kao. “These co-pilots are essentially collaborating with the BCI user and trying to infer the goals that the BCI user is wishing to achieve, and then helps to complete those actions,” he adds.\n\nThe researchers also trained an AI co-pilot to control a robotic arm. The participants were required to use the robotic arm to pick up coloured blocks and move them to marked spots on a table. The person with paralysis could not complete the task using the conventional, non-invasive BCI, but was successful 93% of the time using the BCI with an AI co-pilot. Those without paralysis also completed the task more quickly when using the co-pilot.\n\nImproved quality of life",

The scientists fed mice with certain kinds of glioblastoma a diet that lacked serine and found that the rodents’ tumours, unable to get their fix the usual way, grew more slowly. The animals also lived longer.\n\nThe paper “represents a big advance in the field”, says Sheila Singh, a neurosurgeon–scientist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, who was not involved with the work. “They’ve actually found a metabolic vulnerability of glioblastoma that can be exploited with a therapeutic strategy.”\n\nThe work was published on 3 September in Nature.\n\nRuthless disease\n\nGlioblastomas invade brain tissue with lightning speed and almost always regrow after treatment, which typically involves surgery and a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.

During surgery, physicians infused the participants with sugar molecules that were labelled with a particular carbon isotope.

          "title": "Are ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says",
          "authors": "Nic Fleming",
          "abstract": "In the early 2000s, Brazilian nutrition researcher Carlos Monteiro made a puzzling discovery that led to an epiphany. While trawling survey data on household spending to try to understand why rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes were rising so rapidly in his home country, he was surprised to note that people were buying smaller quantities of sugar, salt and other ingredients generally associated with these conditions than they had in previous decades.\n\nOnly when Monteiro and his colleagues dug deeper did they find the culprit. People were buying less sugar to prepare cakes and desserts, but eating more of it in pre-made pastries and breakfast cereal. They were buying less salt, but consuming more of it in frozen pizzas, chicken nuggets and dehydrated packet soups. “We realized the problem was our traditional dietary patterns were being replaced by foods that are processed so many times that they can no longer be recognized in the final products. We called them ultra-processed foods.”\n\nUltra-processed foods — it’s time for an improved definition\n\nMonteiro, a nutrition and public-health researcher at the University of São Paulo, first used the term ultra-processed food (UPF) in a paper in 2009, arguing that people interested in promoting healthy diets should focus more on the degree, extent and purpose of processing than on nutrient profiles1. It was a radical idea that caught the attention of other researchers, who, over the next decade or so, published dozens of papers linking UPFs with obesity and a range of other health problems.\n\nGovernments took notice, too. In 2014, Brazil began advising people to avoid UPFs. Other countries, including France, Belgium and Israel, followed suit. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been a critic of UPFs, saying in January that they are “poisoning the American people”. In May, the US government announced plans for a research agenda to support nutrition policy and improve people’s diets, in part by improving understanding of the impacts of UPFs on health.\n\nAlthough there’s good evidence that diets high in UPFs are associated with poor health, some scientists are sceptical that the UPF category is useful for research or as the basis for dietary advice, arguing that it is too broad and ill-defined. It makes little sense, they say, to lump together foods as diverse as shop-bought yogurts and wholegrain breads with doughnuts and potato crisps. And they wonder whether UPFs are largely linked to poor health just because they tend to be high in fat and sugar, and low in fibre and vitamins. Questions remain, but recent research findings can provide some guidance for people trying to make healthy choices.\n\nChanging diets\n\nFor hundreds of thousands of years, humans have been processing food by cooking it. The fermentation, milling, salting, pickling and smoking of food also have long histories. Canning, pasteurization and the use of additives, such as artificial sweeteners and colouring agents, date back to the nineteenth century. Today, many foods undergo multiple forms of advanced processing, such as fractionation into constituent sugars, oils and fibres; hydrogenation to alter physical properties; and extrusion, which subjects ingredients to high temperature, pressure, shear forces and rapid expansion. These foods are generally classified as UPFs.\n\nUPF consumption has grown since the 1950s, initially in high-income countries and, since the 1990s, in low- and middle-income countries2. Surveys suggest that UPFs make up almost 60% of calorie intake in the United States and United Kingdom, 48% in Canada and 42% in Australia (see ‘Ultra-processed intake’). Traditional eating patterns have proved more enduring in Romania (15% of calorie intake), Italy (18%), Brazil (22%) and France (31%).\n\nSource: Adapted from ref. 2\n\nResearch suggests that the rise in UPF consumption might be contributing to the increased prevalence of a range of health problems in many countries. Dozens of studies have linked diets high in UPFs with increased risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, cancer, asthma, depression and anxiety3–5.\n\nIn a study published last year, for example, epidemiologist Mingyang Song and his colleagues at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, analysed data on the diets and health of more than 110,000 US adults, who were tracked over a median period of more than 30 years. Song found that those with the highest proportion of calories from UPFs were 4% more likely to die of any cause during the study than were those with the lowest intake. Higher UPF consumption was associated with increased mortality from neurodegenerative diseases, but not from cardiovascular or respiratory disease or from cancer4. Diets that included more processed meat, poultry, seafood and sugary drinks were associated with higher risks after researchers controlled for factors such as body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption and family health history.\n\nHow to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes\n\nThe study also suggested that nutritional quality could be a big factor in why diets high in UPFs might be unhealthy. The increase in risk was much lower for those with diets that, although high in UPFs, were still defined as healthy according to a diet-scoring system called the Alternative Healthy Eating Index. Those diets included a lot of vegetables and nuts, and limited the intake of sugary drinks, red and processed meats, salt and trans fats. “The association between UPF consumption and mortality was much weaker once we accounted for dietary quality,” says Song.\n\nStill, other research indicates that nutritional composition is not the whole story. When Samuel Dicken, a clinical scientist at University College London, reviewed 37 studies that reported health outcomes linked with UPFs, he found that almost all of the associations remained after researchers controlled for nutritional composition6.\n\nDicken and his colleagues subsequently ran a trial in which adults who were overweight or obese were asked to follow one of two diets defined as healthy according to the UK Eatwell Guide (see go.nature.com/4fpdeen), and then switched to the other diet. One of the diets was made up mostly of UPFs and the other mostly of minimally processed foods, but the two diets were matched for levels of protein, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, sodium and sugar. Participants lost twice as much weight (an average of 2 kilograms versus 1 kg) on the minimally processed diet compared with the UPF diet7. The findings, published in August, suggest that the increased prevalence of health problems linked to a UPF diet in other studies cannot be fully explained by poor nutritional composition. So what other mechanisms might be involved?\n\nBeyond processing\n\nDicken’s study is one of only a handful of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on UPFs. Unlike retrospective and observational studies, RCTs can demonstrate causal links and so might offer a clearer picture, researchers say.\n\nThe first RCT on UPFs was carried out by a team led by integrative physiologist Kevin Hall, who until April was at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the HHS. For more than a decade, Hall has sought to overcome some of the limitations of nutrition research by confining study participants to a research hospital, so that their diets can be precisely recorded.\n\nIn 2015, he was approached by two Brazilian researchers at a meeting after he presented the results of one such study, comparing a low-carbohydrate, animal-product-based diet with a low-fat vegan diet. “They told me they had enjoyed my talk, but that my focus on nutrients was very twentieth century and that really, I should be thinking about the extent and purpose of processing food,” says Hall, who had not then heard of UPFs. He was sceptical but intrigued enough that he devised a trial in which 20 adults stayed at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and consumed a diet high in either UPFs or unprocessed food for two weeks before swapping diets.\n\nBreaded chicken nuggets are inspected before being packaged at a factory near Orléans in France.Credit: Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty\n\nLike many other researchers, Hall defined UPFs using a system developed by Monteiro. Known as NOVA, it classifies food into four groups according to the extent, type and purpose of processing8. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as vegetables and pasta, are at one end of the scale. At the other end are UPFs, which undergo multiple industrial processes and usually contain substances rarely used in home kitchens, such as high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils and additives, including colouring and emulsifiers.\n\nParticipants in Hall’s RCT could eat as much as they liked, but the food presented to them was matched for nutrient groups. To Hall’s surprise, the results, published in 2019, showed that participants consumed around 500 calories more per day on average while on the UPF diet — and gained an average of 0.9 kg over the two weeks9. They lost that same amount of weight while on the unprocessed diet.\n\nWhen Hall dug further into the results to try to understand why people on some diets, including those high in UPFs, eat more calories, he and his colleagues found that people consumed more if they ate quicker10. Participants also consumed more calories when the foods were energy dense (containing more calories per gram) and “hyper-palatable” — containing ingredients high in combinations of fat, carbohydrates, sugar and salt, which, some researchers say, activate reward signals and circumvent satiety mechanisms in the brain11. Energy-dense foods provide more calories in less time than those with fewer calories per gram because they are easier to eat, and many UPFs are energy dense because their water content has been removed.\n\nHow a junk-food splurge can change your brain activity\n\nBut questions remained about what might be driving the extra intake, so Hall set up another trial, this time involving 36 people who spent a week each eating a minimally processed diet and three UPF diets: one was energy dense and hyper-palatable; another was energy dense but not hyper-palatable; and the last was neither energy dense nor hyper-palatable.\n\nThe study is ongoing, but early findings show that participants ate more and gained more weight while on the energy-dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet compared with the minimally processed diet. Most of the increases in consumption and body weight that occurred on the energy dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet also occurred on the energy dense diet low in hyper-palatable foods, suggesting that energy density could be the more important factor to health.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that eating more slowly and eating diets with low energy density are associated with lower calorie consumption — and that various factors, including food texture, can affect eating speed12.\n\nIn one study, Ciarán Forde, a nutrition researcher at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands, asked 50 adults to eat as much as they liked during four lunches. He found that they ate much less when presented with hard-textured foods, such as potato waffle fries, than when given soft-textured foods such as mashed potato, regardless of whether the foods were UPFs13. “What we saw was that the speed of eating and the texture properties of meals drive consumption, not the degree of processing,” he says.\n\nForde’s team went on to ask 41 adults to follow, for 14 days, either a UPF diet consisting of foods with harder textures associated with slow eating, or a UPF diet made up of softer foods linked to faster eating, and then swap over. The meals presented were matched for energy density, and, Forde says, the energy density of foods that participants actually consumed turned out to be the same as well. Although the full results are yet to be published, participants consumed 369 fewer calories per day, on average, when their diet consisted of slowly consumed foods than when it contained those linked to faster consumption, according to initial results Forde presented at a meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando, Florida, in June.\n\nMaybe a combination of energy density and food texture explains why people eat more, says Forde, who has received funding from multinational food companies. “Maybe it’s not something magic in ultra-processed foods that we don’t understand. Rather it’s just about factors we’ve long known, about how foods are eaten and how they drive meal size.”",

          "title": "Air taxis will soon be in our skies — if batteries can be made safer",
          "authors": "Liqiang Mai, Xiaocong Tian, Yunlong Zhao",
          "abstract": "Batteries are already powering electric vehicles (EVs) on our roads. But they are yet to transform aviation. Although some electric passenger planes are being prototyped, commercial uses are a decade away. The low-altitude economy is, however, an emerging test bed for electric propulsion flight technologies, which must operate in conditions and to safety standards that are very different from those on land.\n\nDrones operating at altitudes below 1,000 metres are eyed as affordable ways to transport small quantities of goods and speed up logistics. Larger electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft promise to transform how people travel around cities. The global market for eVTOL aircraft could reach US$30 billion by 2030, analysts project, driven by applications in emergency response, logistics, air taxis and tourism (see ‘Low-altitude aircraft on the rise’).\n\nBattery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?\n\nChina has included the low-altitude economy in its 2024 government work report and tasked a department to support the development of it (see go.nature.com/3jbwywr). Uncrewed drone deliveries now operate in the city of Shenzhen, China, and designs for autonomous air taxis are being tested. For example, in February last year, an uncrewed passenger eVTOL aircraft successfully flew 50 kilometres between Shenzhen and Zhuhai in 20 minutes — a journey that would have taken 3 hours by car. The air taxi, developed by electric-aircraft company AutoFlight based in Shanghai, China, and Augsburg, Germany, has a maximum take-off weight of 2.4 tonnes and can carry five passengers. Companies in North America, Europe, Japan and beyond are also developing low-altitude aircraft.\n\nIt is an exciting time in this nascent field, which is exploring how best to combine state-of-the-art energy supplies, motors, chips and avionics. But, as more low-altitude craft take to our skies, careful management and regulation of these systems will be crucial, to ensure their safety as well as public trust. Here we outline the challenges and regulatory needs for energy supplies for low-altitude aircraft.\n\nSource: go.nature.com/422EN3U\nChallenges of battery technology\n\nTo avoid contributing to climate change, the low-altitude economy must develop in tandem with the low-carbon economy. Just as the goal for clean-energy road transport could be achieved by powering EVs with renewable electricity, eVTOL taxis might similarly run on power from solar and wind sources.\n\nBut, so far, only a few prototypes have been realized1,2. Solar-powered drones, such as AtlantikSolar developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, have managed to optimize the energy balance between solar panels and batteries to achieve several days of continuous flying1. By covering big wings with solar cells, large solar-powered aircraft have flown for weeks at a time in the stratosphere.\n\nThe small-drone revolution is coming — scientists need to ensure it will be safe\n\nTo do more, reliable and robust sources of electrical energy are needed. EVs have driven remarkable advancements in the development of lithium-ion batteries over the past decade3. Yet the transition from roads to skies is far from straightforward.\n\nAirborne operations impose radically different constraints: greater sensitivity to weight, the need for rapid bursts of power during take-off, landing and manoeuvring, and an uncompromising need for tolerating faults. A failure on the ground might be an inconvenience. A failure in the air can be fatal.\n\nEV batteries, although reliable for terrestrial use, are too heavy, low-powered and frail for aviation. Safety is the most unforgiving requirement4. To power flight safely, batteries must meet standards that exceed those of EVs and even some space missions. Civil aviation demands zero tolerance for in-service failures. Uncontrollable overheating of a battery, and a potential fire or explosion, in mid-air is not survivable.\n\nAviation-grade batteries must therefore be designed with multilayer containment, real-time fault detection and thermal isolation. Unlike EVs, which rely on relatively stable discharge rates, aerial platforms demand quick boosts of power that can exceed the battery’s rated output, and that must be sustained without degradation or thermal instability.\n\nMeeting such demands under tight weight and volume constraints requires advanced cell chemistry and battery-management systems that are capable of running analytics and balancing loads in milliseconds. Promising examples include an aviation battery (which achieves 500 watt-hours per kilogram) from Chinese battery manufacturer CATL, which announced a partnership with AutoFlight for eVTOL flights. It is currently in the development and certification stage. Adaptive battery-management systems dynamically adjust operational parameters according to the flight conditions5.\n\nA cleaner future for flight — aviation needs a radical redesign\n\nLessons can be drawn from EV battery designs6. For example, solid- and semi-solid-state batteries offer higher energy density and enhanced safety compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries and might be suitable choices for aircraft7. Nanostructured materials (such as nanowires) might offer improved energy density and charging and discharging rates8. Hydrogen fuel cells are another option9, although they remain in the early stages of commercialization.\n\nAlthough all-electric drones are already in operation at some drone-delivery companies, scaling up to passenger aircraft remains a long way off. In the short term, hybrid-electric systems that combine conventional engines for cruising with electric motors for high-power phases, such as take-off, landing and climbing, are emerging as a practical way to bridge the gap. Examples include an aircraft called Electric EEL, developed by aerospace company Ampaire in Long Beach, California, which is currently in flight trials for commuter routes, and the ES-30 made by aviation manufacturer Heart Aerospace in El Segundo, California, which is planned to enter service in 2028.\n\nIn pursuit of improving energy-storage capacity and reducing weight, fresh aircraft concepts are exploring structural batteries, in which energy storage is embedded directly into the airframe, such as in the wings or fuselage panels. This approach blurs the conventional separation between aero-structures and energy systems, meaning that a crash or repair could affect both at once, and the usual design rules and maintenance practices no longer apply. Proving that such designs are safe will require tests in materials science, structural dynamics and airworthiness.\n\nEnergy regulatory considerations",

Credit: Matteo Della Torre/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nPosts about research on Bluesky receive substantially more attention than similar posts on X, formerly called Twitter, according to the first large-scale analysis of science content on Bluesky1. The results suggest that Bluesky users engage with posts more than do users of X.\n\nBluesky has more than 38 million users and shares many features with X, which fell out of favour with some scientists when it was bought by entrepreneur Elon Musk in October 2022. A survey of Nature readers earlier this year suggested that many prefer Bluesky over X to discuss and disseminate their work.\n\nA team of researchers from the United Kingdom and China analysed 2.6 million Bluesky posts published from January 2023 to July 2025. Together, these referenced 532,000 academic articles. The results were posted as a preprint on arXiv last month and have not been peer reviewed.\n\n‘A place of joy’: why scientists are joining the rush to Bluesky\n\nThe team found that almost half of the posts about science on Bluesky garnered at least ten likes, and that one-third were reposted ten or more times. Previous research on X has shown that the proportion of science posts receiving at least ten likes varied between 4% and 7.5%, and that the proportion receiving ten or more reposts ranged from 1.4% to 4.4%2. Interactions on Bluesky were an order of magnitude higher than on X, the researchers said. Quotes — whereby users share posts and add their own text — and replies were nearly two orders of magnitude greater on Bluesky than on X, they said.\n\nThe team also reported that nearly half of Bluesky posts summarized academic articles and that only 6.3% simply mentioned the article name and journal. By contrast, 92% of original X posts about life and earth sciences and 17% of those in engineering and physical sciences referred to little more than the study title, according to a 2018 study in the Journal of Infometrics3. This suggests that research content on Bluesky is more original, says Er-Te Zheng, the latest study’s first author and a PhD student at the University of Sheffield, UK. “While X has primarily served as a dissemination tool, Bluesky may support a more interpretive, reflective mode of science communication.”",

          "abstract": "Typical optical fibres consist of thin, solid glass wires. Tweaking the design could allow them to carry more data over longer distances.Credit: Phillip Hayson/Science Photo Library\n\nA new type of hollow optical fibre promises to boost the amount of data that can be carried in each glass strand, and to do so over longer distances. This could help to make telecommunications systems faster and more efficient.\n\nThe design, described in Nature Photonics on 1 September1, replaces the hair-thin wire of solid glass that typical fibres are made from with a system of glass ‘straws’, in which five small cylinders, each containing two nested cylinders, are attached to the inside rim of one main cylinder. The diameter of each tube is finely tuned in such a way that that the space can accommodate light of only certain wavelengths. This means that when a light pulse of an appropriate wavelength is sent down the hollow central gap, it will stay there, rather than escaping.\n\n“We really think this could be transformative,” says co-author Francesco Poletti, a photonics and materials-science researcher at the University of Southampton, UK.\n\n“If the new fibre can be manufactured and installed easily and proves to be durable, the result might be a faster, better classical Internet,” says Rod Van Meter, a quantum network engineer at Keio University in Tokyo.\n\nFibres that contain hollow glass tubes nested inside one another can prevent light from escaping.Credit: Prof Francesco Poletti and Dr Greg Jasion, University of Southampton\n\nThe fibres will be produced by a start-up company called Lumenisity, a spin-off from Southampton that was bought by Microsoft in 2022. A typical glass fibre is made by melting a piece of glass, then stretching it to produce a strand of the desired thickness. To manufacture their hollow fibres, the researchers start with a larger version of their design — measuring about 20 centimetres in diameter. The hollows are pressurized during stretching, so that the configuration stays the same as the whole structure becomes around 100 micrometres wide.\n\nMaking connections\n\nHollow optical fibres of various designs already exist and have found niche applications: for example, in connecting the many computing units in data centres, where speed is of the essence (light travels 45% faster through hollow, air-filled tubes than through solid glass). Van Meter calls the increase in speed “a dramatic change that people will pay a lot of money for”.",

          "authors": "Felice Frankel",
          "abstract": "Flashes of Brilliance: The Genius of Early Photography and How It Transformed Art, Science, and History Anika Burgess W. W. Norton (2025)\n\nAs someone who has spent a career visualizing science, Flashes of Brilliance felt like reading a love letter to the power of the photographic image. This beautifully written book, by writer and photo editor Anika Burgess, is a thoughtful, personal and witty meditation on how imagery does much more than just document a scene.\n\nWill AI jeopardize science photography? There’s still time to create an ethical code of conduct\n\nAlong with fascinating examples of early efforts to capture images of society, the book captures well the dual role of the scientific image — as both a tool for discovery and a medium of communication. A reader begins to understand that photography in general, and especially in science, is not just illustrative, it is investigative. And sometimes, as Burgess clearly describes, it is revelatory.\n\nThrough a series of compelling stories and visual examples, the author reminds us that an image can crystallize a complex idea in a way that no string of words ever can. It’s a celebration of ‘aha’ moments made visible. Those photographs wake us up to social issues and phenomena we never even knew existed.\n\nJacob Riis’ images of the squalid conditions of people living in tenements in New York City’s Lower East Side around 1889 say so much more than any text describing the situation. By using flash powder to add light to the exposure, he could reveal details of these ordinarily gloomy spaces and those inhabiting them.\n\nJacob Riis captured the poor conditions of people living in New York City around 1900, such as these children sleeping on a steam grate for warmth.Credit: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/Alamy\nManipulating reality\n\nBurgess doesn’t shy away from the challenges, either — acknowledging how easily images can mislead or manipulate. Even from the beginning, some photographers used a technique to combine negatives in the printing process to create unreal scenarios. In the early 1870s, Édouard Buguet used this method to insert a translucent ‘spirit’ above the people in his portraits to advance the idea that the dead could communicate from beyond the grave. Many viewers thought that the spirit was real; only in 1875 did Buguet admit that the images were fake.\n\nHow AI is expanding art history\n\nThe balance between clarity and accuracy is something I’ve grappled with throughout my career, and it’s refreshing to see this issue addressed so directly. These days, at least in science, any manipulation must be considered carefully and reported.\n\nAnother example came as a surprise. I never tire of studying Eadweard Muybridge’s beautiful sequences of still images showing horses in motion. His photographs from the late 1870s clearly show that at various moments in a trot, all four horse hooves leave the ground at the same time — a fact that wasn’t known until then. What was new for me was to read how “he substituted, or missed out and renumbered, certain sets of images, which naturally calls into question their scientific utility”. As historian Marta Braun argues in her 1992 book Picturing Time: “under the guise of offering us scientific truth”, Muybridge has “like any artist made a selection and arranged his selection into his own personal truth”.\n\nCraig and George Falconer produced several ‘spirit’ photographs in the 1920s.Credit: Dan Moss/Alamy\n\nFor those of us in science communication, this warning is essential. Just because an image is beautiful doesn’t mean it tells the whole story. However, I don’t want to completely discount his contribution to this ‘aha’ moment in science. Informing us of his process (just as NASA scientists do when they colour astronomical images) and why he did what he did would have helped us to consider the study as an authentic scientific investigation.\n\nAlthough Burgess emphasizes the early years of picture making, I was compelled to compare some of her thinking with writer Susan Sontag’s discussion in On Photography (1977). Sontag famously argued that “to photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed” — these images have allowed our minds to consider whatever we are seeing as reality. And this idea resonates with many of the moments in Flashes of Brilliance in which early image makers were not only documenting the world but transforming it into something permanent, collectible and possible.\n\nWhether it is Cecil Shadbolt’s aerial photographs of London from a balloon or Louis Boutan’s captures of life beneath the sea, such images aren’t neutral — they shape what we think is true about the world and what we consider worth looking at.",

          "title": "Is this the future of food? 'Sexless' seeds that could transform farming",
          "authors": "Dyani Lewis",
          "abstract": "As early as next month, a trial crop of hardy sorghum could start sprouting under a mesh containment canopy in eastern Australia. The plants might seem ordinary, but there’s something revolutionary hiding in their genes.\n\nIf the trial is a success, each plant will bypass sexual reproduction and will set seed to thousands of clones in each flower head.\n\nThe Hy-Gain sorghum trial is the culmination of decades of work for plant physiologist Anna Koltunow at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, who began research to make ‘sexless seeds’ in the early 1990s. The technology exploits a quirk of nature — known as apomixis. More than 300 species of flowering plant naturally produce clonal seeds through apomixis, but none are important grains. Researchers say that the quest to bring apomixis to plants such as sorghum, rice and maize (corn) is now on the brink of transforming agriculture.\n\nHow to climate-proof crops: scientists say the secret’s in the dirt\n\n“It definitely will lead to a revolution,” says Kejian Wang, a geneticist at the China National Rice Research Institute in Hangzhou, who is working on separate apomixis experiments.\n\nKoltunow says her work promises to give smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa access to affordable high-yielding sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) crops. Those farmers could save the clonal seeds to sow for several years, further reducing costs. These are some of the reasons that Koltunow’s research is supported by the Gates Foundation, a charity in Seattle, Washington.\n\nAnother collaborator in the Hy-Gain project is the multinational seed company Corteva Agriscience, based in Indianapolis, Indiana. That’s because apomictic plants are a potential boon for seed companies selling to large-scale agriculture markets across the world. Apomixis could slash the time needed to create new varieties, and fix desirable traits in plants that produce their own clones. “The decrease in cost [could be] huge,” for those companies, says Koltunow.\n\nMarket-ready clonal seed production is within reach in a handful of species, including rice — a staple grain that feeds more than half of the world’s population. There has been a flurry of patent applications in the past few years for a variety of apomictic crop plants. Yet researchers say that some key hurdles remain before these advances can truly take root. “Now that we’ve gotten it to work as a concept, we need to fine tune things,” says Venkatesan Sundaresan, a plant reproductive biologist at the University of California, Davis.\n\nFixing vigour\n\nThe arrival of sexless seeds for growing crops could transform much of agriculture, foremost the production of hybrid seeds. For some of the main crops grown across the world, such as maize, rice and tomatoes, farmers have been sowing hybrid seed for generations.\n\nWhen two parent varieties are crossed through sexual reproduction, the resulting hybrid offspring typically outperform both of their parents — a phenomenon known as hybrid vigour. Between 1930 and the mid-1990s, yields from maize crops in the United States increased sevenfold, partly because farmers adopted the practice of sowing hybrid seeds to produce row after row of uniformly robust plants.\n\nBut making hybrids is laborious, time-consuming and expensive, and hybrid seeds must be created — and purchased — anew each year. That’s because if hybrids are left to self-pollinate, they produce a mish-mash crop of plants of varying quality, the result of sexual reproduction mixing and matching the plant’s genes into new combinations (see ‘Creating cloned crops’).\n\nSource: Wang, Y. & Underwood, C. J. Curr. Biol. 33, R293–R295 (2023)\n\nWith apomixis, hybrid vigour would be ‘fixed’ in place, because the hybrids would clone themselves, providing breeders — and farmers — with an endless supply of high-quality, identical plants. This could also help in the production of crops such as wheat and soya bean, for which it has proven too difficult to produce hybrids. Apomixis would make it possible to develop elite varieties of these crops in which traits are fixed from one generation to the next.\n\nBy the 1940s, researchers had worked out that apomixis had a genetic basis. But it wasn’t until the 1990s that Koltunow and others recognized that the trait doesn’t override sexual reproduction. Rather, it is “a kind of altered sexual pathway”, says Ueli Grossniklaus, a plant geneticist at the University of Zürich, Switzerland. In that pathway, two innovations are necessary: the cell divisions during the formation of egg and sperm cells need to be disrupted; and an embryo needs to form independently of fertilization. Grossniklaus’s team conducted several experiments in which plants were deliberately mutated to see whether any mutants exhibited these changes.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2009 that researchers successfully disrupted the sexual cell-division process, known as meiosis, to mimic what occurs in natural apomicts1. Raphael Mercier, a plant geneticist then at the National Institute for Agricultural Research in Versaille, France, was trying to understand how mitosis — the simple process in which a cell divides into two identical cells — evolved into the more complex cellular dance of meiosis, a key part of sexual reproduction. Meiosis involves two cell divisions instead of one, and the resulting egg and sperm cells contain half the usual number of chromosomes, so that when combined during fertilization, the full complement of chromosomes is restored.\n\nUsing Arabidopsis thaliana, a small cabbage relative that has become the workhorse of plant genetics laboratories, Mercier identified a gene involved in one of the three crucial innovations that turned mitosis into meiosis during evolution. He then disrupted that gene, along with genes that are crucial for the other two pillars of meiosis, to see whether meiosis could be turned back into mitosis.\n\nHow farming could become the ultimate climate-change tool\n\n“It worked just [as] expected,” says Mercier, now at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany. In flowers of the resulting triple mutant — dubbed MiMe, for mitosis instead of meiosis — sperm and egg cells contained the same set of chromosomes as their parent, having been made through the simpler cell division of mitosis rather than the more complex meiosis1. Mercier says that he immediately recognized the potential of MiMe for engineering apomixis in plants. He and his colleagues followed up with MiMe rice2 in 2016, and MiMe tomatoes3 in 2024. The plants could reproduce, but because the egg and sperm cells contained twice the normal number of chromosomes, the progeny also received a double dose of chromosomes, leading to decreasing fertility in each generation. It was a step in the right direction but only half of the apomixis puzzle.\n\nGrossniklaus and his team discovered an alternative to MiMe in maize. A screen of 60,000 mutants turned up a single gene, called non-reductive in female4 (nrf4), that, when disrupted, causes about one-third of egg cells to be formed through mitosis instead of meiosis. This work, including the formation of the first clonal seed in a crop species using the nrf4 mutant, is covered by a patent4.\n\nVirgin birth\n\nThe second essential component of apomixis is parthenogenesis, by which an embryo forms directly from an unfertilized egg cell — no male required. In 2006, Peggy Ozias-Akins, a molecular geneticist at the University of Georgia in Tifton, and her colleagues focused on fountain grass (Cenchrus squamulatus) — a natural apomict — which looked like a good candidate for containing an apomixis gene5. The gene they identified was similar to BABY BOOM, which can provoke plant tissue to spontaneously form embryos. But it took Ozias-Akins’s group almost a decade to confirm their hunch about the gene’s role in apomixis. They introduced the fountain grass gene into pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) — which reproduces sexually — and discovered that embryos spontaneously developed without fertilization6. “That was pretty exciting,” says Ozias-Akins.\n\nAn international team of researchers has created a type of sorghum that can reproduce asexually and will be testing it soon in a field trial in Australia.Credit: Getty\n\nMeanwhile, Sundaresan was zeroing in on BABY BOOM from an entirely different direction. “My lab really was not working on apomixis at all,” he says. Instead, his group was looking for genes that are active during the crucial transition from an unfertilized egg cell to a fertilized one that can develop into an embryo.\n\nWorking with rice, Sundaresan’s team extracted RNA — the read-out product of active genes — from individual egg cells in the hours immediately following pollination. They found that BABY BOOM RNA was abundant. Sundaresan’s group went on to show that BABY BOOM was acting as a trigger for embryogenesis, and the active copy of the gene was delivered to the egg cell by the sperm7. Next, Sundaresan and his colleague Imtiyaz Khanday, an agronomist at the University of California, Davis, showed that the sperm wasn’t required at all. They inserted a copy of the BABY BOOM gene with instructions to switch on in the egg cell — where its own copy of the gene is silenced. With this technique, the team set embryogenesis in motion8.\n\nPutting it all together\n\nAfter Sundaresan learnt about the MiMe rice work in 2016, he contacted Mercier to collaborate on combining MiMe and BABY BOOM. They edited the MiMe genes in rice containing egg-cell-active BABY BOOM. In doing so, they achieved the long-sought goal of the field: an apomictic plant that propagates clones of itself8. Although the efficiency was poor — only 10–30% of seeds were clonal — the work provided a proof-of-concept for combining the two essential elements of apomixis in a valuable crop species.\n\nFungi bacon and insect burgers: a guide to the proteins of the future",

          "title": "Why scientists are flocking to Substack",
          "authors": "Hannah Docter-Loeb",
          "abstract": "Adapted from Filo/Getty\n\nLike many epidemiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic, Katelyn Jetelina turned to social media to help keep people informed. It was the spring of 2020, and Jetelina, then at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, frequently posted content on viral transmission and vaccines to her Facebook and Instagram pages. That is, until she was hacked.\n\nIn February 2021, a group of anti-vaccine activists found a way into both accounts, using her platform to post and promote a different rhetoric. They even asked her followers to upload their COVID-19 vaccination cards for a chance to win US$1,000, in a bid to gain personal information. It was at this point that Jetelina decided she had to make a change. “It was heartbreaking to me: I had lost all of my content, and all of the blood, sweat and tears I had put into it,” she recalled. “I decided to move on to a platform where I had a whole lot more ownership.”\n\nScientists are falling victim to deepfake AI video scams — here’s how to fight back\n\nThe most obvious choice for her was Substack, an independent writing and e-mailing platform. It’s lauded for its newsletter features — sending posts into the inboxes of subscribers — but content is also available on the site, as with a standard blog. One feature she especially liked, given her past experiences, was that her data was transferable: if you decide to leave, or have to leave, you can take a list of subscriber e-mails with you. On 8 February 2021, Jetelina started putting more energy into her Substack publication, which she calls Your Local Epidemiologist.\n\nAlthough she eventually regained control of her social-media accounts, and her team still posts infographics and videos there, Jetelina says Substack enables her to connect with followers in a different way. As she explains it, the e-mail newsletter platform is more conducive to longer-form and more-nuanced discussions, which aren’t always possible on other forms of social media. Readers subscribe to her specifically, and content goes directly to their inbox, fostering more intimate and close-knit interactions. She says she’s come to know the readers well. “I can now have a two-way relationship with the audience, engaging with them through the comment and chat sections.”\n\nOver the past few years, the newsletter has garnered a strong following and now has more than 400,000 subscribers. What was once a one-woman show is now run by a team of copy editors, social-media creators, administrative assistants and other contributors. It’s also now Jetelina’s main job, she says. And as the pandemic public-health emergency has “faded into the rear-view mirror”, her content has had to change. Jetelina now aims to show the community that public health goes beyond a pandemic and infectious diseases, and writes about topics such as reproductive health, gun violence and mental health. “I’m really trying to focus on how to equip people with the tools to live an evidence-based life,” she says.\n\nKatelyn Jetelina switched to Substack after a group of anti-vaccine activists hacked her Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nFounded in 2017, Substack is meant to give a platform to independent writers, and provides a means for them to monetize their work through paywalls and donations. It’s grown rapidly and now has tens of millions of subscribers, and more than five million paid subscribers. The platform also raised $100 million to expand operations, giving the company a value of $1.1 billion. And it’s not exclusively for scientists: many other academics, as well as journalists and even novelists, have built up a community on the platform.\n\n“Substack is home to a growing number of respected academics and researchers who use the platform to share evidence-based work directly with the public,” a spokesperson told Nature. “For many, it’s a way to reach people more quickly and openly, while still maintaining depth and rigour.”\n\nNot every scientist has a following as large as that of Your Local Epidemiologist, which currently ranks number one on the list of paid science newsletters on Substacks. But other academics and scientists across various disciplines have gravitated towards the platform as a way to promote research and connect with the public.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nNonetheless, the site has its drawbacks. It can take a while to build a following, and making a profit can be hard work. Not only that, but many of the platform’s top science and health-politics newsletters promote anti-vaccine ideology or pseudoscience. “It’s the wild, wild west being on Substack, but right now this is the same on any sort of social-media platform,” says Jetelina. (A Substack spokesperson said that it would be inaccurate to characterize “a majority” of the top science writers as anti-vax.)\n\nStacking up\n\nSubstack and other subscription-based content services — such as Ghost, Mailchimp, Patreon, Beehiiv and Medium — market themselves as being more effective at reaching people than are conventional social media. This is partially backed by marketing data. According to Mailchimp, a US e-mail marketing platform, about 35% of users open e-mails from companies in the education and training sector; for other industries, the proportion is 30–40%. In a recent thread on Substack, writers shared the rates at which their subscribers opened their newsletters, and the proportions ranged from 30% to 70%.\n\nKimberly Nicholas, a sustainability researcher at Lund University, Sweden, whose Substack publication We Can Fix It approaches the climate crisis “with facts, feelings, and action”, says her e-mail newsletters are clicked on and opened more than her social-media posts.\n\nThe site also helps to foster an environment of community engagement. For Jonathan Tonkin, an ecologist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, the social-media platform X “was a really useful tool for scientists to communicate with other scientists, but in terms of reaching the public it wasn’t happening, to be honest”. Tonkin now authors a Substack publication called Predirections. “It’s good, I think, for reaching people who are interested in science and are not scientists,” he says.\n\nJonathan Tonkin found that Substack was much more effective than the social-media platform X as a means of engaging with interested non-scientists.Credit: Prime Minister’s Science Prizes Secretariat\n\nAccording to Similarweb, a traffic-analytics website, Substack’s audience is pretty evenly split between men and women. It skews a bit towards younger readers: the largest group consists of those aged 25–34. Users also tend to be based in the United States, with with about 62% of traffic coming from there in July 2025.\n\n“Scientific subjects are nuanced, and trying to distill that into 140 characters doesn't work very well, or leaves people confused,” adds Hannah Ritchie, a data scientist at the University of Oxford, UK. Ritchie’s Substack publication, Sustainability by Numbers, looks at potential routes to sustainability through an evidence-based lens. Putting together an e-mail, she says, “gives scientists a bit more room to describe the nuances”.\n\nHannah Ritchie points out that Substack frees writers from the constraints associated with more-formal means of publication, such as journals.Credit: Angela Catlin\n\nThen there’s the potential for monetization. Most of the scientists Nature spoke to emphasized that their content is free, but the site gives writers the ability to set up paywalls. According to Jetelina, 7% of her subscribers pay for her content. Although the platform takes a cut, she’s been able to generate enough revenue to quit her full-time job and focus mainly on the newsletter. (Jetelina did not want to share her earnings with Nature, but in 2022, the monthly magazine Vanity Fair reported that she made about $300,000 in the publication’s first nine months).\n\nScientists also highlight that Substack offers more freedom than do other modes of publishing science — in journals, for example, or through guest contributions to online publications such The Conversation. As Ritchie explains, there’s often a lengthy editorial process in these more-formal systems, and writers can be constrained by the requirements of the publication. “The timeline is massively extended compared to what you can do on Substack, where you can have your own audience: you can say what you want, when you want to say it.”",

          "abstract": "President Trump has signed two executive orders that could fundamentally shift oversight of science integrity by federal researchers.Credit: Samuel Corum/Sipa/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nUS science agencies have begun releasing their plans to comply with US President Donald Trump’s call for ‘gold-standard science’. The plans mainly detail efforts towards achieving widely supported science goals, such as data accessibility and reproducibility. But researchers and science-policy specialists tell Nature that elements of the plans leave the door open to political interference in science.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for instance, would put a Trump-appointed official in charge of implementing the new policies, including protocols for reporting research-integrity violations. In the past, responsibility for such tasks at federal agencies was generally held by career civil servants, who were often scientists hired for their expertise.\n\nTrump’s call for ‘gold standard science’ has prompted an outcry: here’s why\n\nThe new policies are the agencies’ first response to two White House executive orders that directed agencies to put political appointees in charge of decisions about science funding and integrity. The policies could shape the work of the nearly 300,000 scientists and engineers who work for federal agencies and the almost US$200 billion of science funded by the US government.\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature say the overhaul is not in good faith, pointing to the Trump administration’s language around the policy. The most recent executive order, issued on 7 August, claimed science grants went to scientists who “promoted Marxism, class warfare propaganda, and other anti-American ideologies”. “The overall strategy is attacking scientific findings in order to diminish the public’s trust,” says David Michaels, an epidemiologist at George Washington University in Washington DC who held public-health positions under previous administrations. A government scientist who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said that the language around gold-standard science was being used to justify the sweeping cuts to science proposed by the White House this year.\n\nNeither the White House nor its Office of Science and Technology Policy responded to requests for comment from Nature. But Department of Energy spokesperson Ben Dietderich responded to accusations that the Trump administration is using the gold-standard policies to undermine US science. “Unlike previous administrations that abused the scientific process to advance their radical political agenda, the Trump administration is returning the United States to a gold standard of science that fosters more open, fact-based conversations and will allow for the United States to be the global leader in scientific innovation,” Dietderich said in a statement.\n\nWarring policies\n\nDuring Trump’s first term (2017–21), his administration censored government scientists on issues such as COVID-19, altered scientific information in government reports and barred some researchers from science advisory boards. During the subsequent presidency of Joe Biden, federal agencies crafted scientific-integrity policies to protect scientists and prevent political manipulation of science.\n\nAfter Trump, US researchers urge Biden to block political meddling in science\n\nThis May, four months into his second term, Trump issued an executive order that repealed the Biden-era scientific-integrity policies, citing a “loss of trust” in science. The order also called for reforms that would ensure that science is “transparent, rigorous and impactful”. The 7 August executive order focused on the federal grant-making process, which is the main method of allocating federal funds to US science. Both orders called for presidential appointees to take charge of the reforms, which would shift power away from career civil servants and scientists.\n\nPolicies published by the FDA, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) centre on widely embraced goals and ideas for improving science. Many of their recommendations echo existing efforts meant to ensure reproducibility and transparency.\n\nThe NSF’s plan, for instance, includes a table showing that 14 of 23 activities proposed to implement Trump’s orders are already ongoing. The NIH document describes many initiatives that began before the second Trump administration, such as a call for comments from the scientific community on ways to encourage publishing null and negative findings.\n\nPolitical infiltration\n\nBut some staff members at scientific agencies do not trust that the response to the president’s orders will strengthen US science. “I expect it will be used to further politicize science by labelling research the administration doesn’t like as ‘not gold-standard’,” says an NIH staff member, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.\n\nTrump’s chief science adviser faces a storm of criticism: what's next?",

          "abstract": "A common type of ant in Europe breaks a fundamental rule in biology: its queens can produce male offspring that are a whole different species. These queen Iberian harvester ants (Messor ibericus) are sexual parasites that rely on the sperm of males of the ant species Messor structor. They use this sperm to breed an army of robust worker ants, which are hybrids of the two species.\n\nData now show that, in the absence of nearby M. structor colonies, M. ibericus queens can clone male M. structor ants by laying eggs that contain only M. structor DNA in their nuclei.

Genetic analyses confirmed that the colonies contained both M. ibericus and M. structor, despite the lack of M. structor populations on the island.\n\nFurther analyses solved the mystery: Iberian harvester queens clone M. structor ants to maintain a supply of their sperm.

          "authors": "Laura Woodrow",
          "abstract": "Research budgets have not kept pace with inflation in the United Kingdom.Credit: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty\n\nThe proportion of research and innovation awards granted by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the United Kingdom’s national funding agency, has nearly halved over the past seven financial years, as application rates surged by more than 80%, new data show.\n\nThe UKRI data, published last month, show that between 2017–18 and 2024–25, the number of applications to the national funding agency increased from 16,355 to 29,927. Meanwhile, the number of awards granted per year increased by only 3% over the same period, to 5,667 in 2024–25 (see ‘Diminishing returns’). A substantial bump in applications was seen in 2020–21, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a similar, but smaller, bump was seen in awards, which levelled out over the following years.\n\nThe increase in applications is mostly due to applications to Innovate UK — which supports industry-driven research and now accounts for more than 56% of the assessed applications. The award rate for these applications was 14% in 2024–25.\n\nFor academic and research-led grants from UKRI, applications and award rates vary between research councils — the subject-specific bodies that allocate funding in areas such as engineering, medical research and social sciences — but many have seen a fall in award rates over the past financial year. Overall, the proportion of awards granted per year — including research and innovation, fellowships and training grants — fell from 36% in 2017–18 to 19% in 2024–25, the lowest in the decade. The total number of active awards has remained fairly stable, and is now around 21,000.\n\nPrice of progress\n\nDespite the stagnation in the number of awards, the value of UKRI grants steadily increased from around £3 billion (US$4 billion) to more than £6 billion between 2015–16 and 2023–24, before falling to £4.5 billion this financial year.\n\nOver the past few years, laboratories and universities have reckoned with the consequences of significant inflation. In October 2022, the UK consumer price index hit 11.1%, a 41-year high. According to the UKRI data, over the past three years, the average amount awarded for a successful application exceeded £800,000. In 2015–16, the average value of a grant was just more than £450,000.\n\nEleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh and a member of the UKRI’s Medical Research Council (who spoke to Nature in a personal capacity), says that research budgets have barely kept pace with inflation. A lack of investment from the country’s government is mostly to blame, she adds. A research and development analysis, published this year by the Campaign for Science and Engineering, an advocacy group in London, showed that government spending in real terms — when adjusted for inflation — plateaued in 2019 owing to high inflation.\n\nThe activities of other funders, including US-based research institutes affected by funding cuts from President Donald Trump’s administration, might have also affected UKRI application volume, with more researchers in the United States looking outside the country to secure funding.\n\nDemand management\n\nIn 2022, the Technopolis Group — an international research and consulting organization — published a review of the UKRI’s response to the substantial bump in applications and the expedited review timelines in the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, UKRI staff and reviewers faced widespread burnout, according to the report, and more than one-third of awardees had experienced delays while waiting for a decision.\n\nA number of UKRI councils have adopted demand-management policies to reduce pressure on their peer-review systems as applications increase. In 2015, the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) implemented a demand-management policy limiting the number of applications from individual institutions on the basis of success rate: those with a low success rate were subjected to a cap on the number of applications they could submit. Although this is not the only way to reduce pressure on peer-review and grant systems, it tends to lead to more-robust applications, says Riley. She says other councils could follow suit.",

          "title": "Do social-media bans benefit young people? These data could offer clues",
          "authors": "Helen Christensen, Andrew Mackinnon",
          "abstract": "In December, the Australian government will bring the Online Safety Amendment Act into force. The law will prevent people under 16 years of age from having accounts for a range of social-media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. The legislation, introduced in response to concerns over children’s online safety and well-being1, provides a golden opportunity for researchers to investigate how social-media use might affect mental health among adolescents — a complex issue that has been the subject of heated debate.\n\nSocial-media bans won’t work — there are better ways to keep kids safe\n\nThere’s little time to plan and set up the ideal experiment. Assessing the mental-health status and Internet usage of tens of thousands of teenagers in Australia and comparator countries over time, before and after the legislation comes into force, is no mean feat. It would require substantial organization in schools, the recruitment of research staff, agreement about the research measures used and fast ethical review and parental consent, all of which takes many months. Nevertheless, there are more-feasible approaches that could provide valuable information if researchers act promptly.\n\nAn as-yet-unnamed advisory committee and research partner have been established by the government to review the effect of the act, but to our knowledge there have been no official announcements about the responsibilities, leadership or research strategies they will adopt. We urge the committee to consider implementing each of the following three approaches.\n\nTrack official records\n\nHospital admissions records and coroners’ reports can track the incidence of serious self-harm and suicides among adolescents before and after the introduction of legislation. The benefits of this approach are that it is possible to gather data for the whole country, rather than studying a subset of teens, and that many years of retrospective data are available. Data from other nations can also be used to help determine whether any changes to mental health in Australia can be ascribed to the bans or whether they simply reflect broader trends.\n\nOn the downside, it takes time for official data to become available. Figures on suicide are linked to time-consuming coroners’ investigations, so data sets are often not finalized for years. Routinely collected data do not reveal anything about individual mental-health trajectories and social-media use, making it hard to determine whether social media contributed to peoples’ actions. These records also do not allow investigation of the many instances of anxiety and depression that do not lead to self-harm or suicide. This is because these conditions often go untreated or are addressed through primary health-care services or private psychologists, from which data are not easily collated.\n\nLaunch national surveys\n\nThe government could commission surveys of the health and well-being of young people aged under 16 before and after the legislation is brought in. Two national surveys have been run in Australia in the past, the latest in 2013–142. Starting one survey in the coming months and another in four years’ time would enable comparisons with previous cohorts.\n\nThese surveys typically involve a representative sample of the population. To study the social-media ban, they might instead oversample at-risk subgroups — teens from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQIA+) or those with pre-existing mental health conditions, for instance. The surveys could be used to probe risk factors for anxiety and depression, including online bullying, and could ask detailed questions about mental ill-health and social-media use on various platforms, going beyond generic measures such as screen time. They could also include measurements of lifestyle and any activities or hobbies taken up to fill the time previously spent on social media. Analyses would help to answer questions about which individuals are protected by social-media bans, and what online activities are associated with improved well-being.\n\nYoung people might adopt different lifestyle interests when Australia’s social-media ban begins — a trend that researchers could study.Credit: Vlad Sokhin/Panos Pictures\n\nThe drawback of these surveys is that the proposed first cohort (to be evaluated in the coming months) would have a different social-media environment and different stressors from the second group, which would be assessed in four years’ time. This would make any comparisons complex and challenging. A gap of four years between surveys would make the data coarse with respect to any trajectories of change — but narrowing that gap to, say, two years is probably both financially and politically unfeasible.\n\nPiggyback existing studies\n\nResearchers could take advantage of ongoing longitudinal studies of young people to recruit new cohorts and follow them up over time. These studies have the advantage of individual retrospective data. Australia has several such studies that include mental-health measures. The Future Proofing Study, for instance, began in 2019 and is examining the onset and trajectory of mental-health conditions in 6,000 adolescents from age 13 onwards3. It is scheduled to finish this year, but could be funded to include a new cohort running from now until 2030.\n\nHow social media affects teen mental health: a missing link\n\nTrials evaluating public-health interventions could also be used, if their timespan encompasses the social-media ban (the control groups in such trials are essentially longitudinal observational studies). One example is the Health4Life trial4, which is investigating the effect of six lifestyle interventions on the mental health of 11- to 13-year-olds in three Australian states. It could continue its follow-up assessments for longer than the current limit of 36 months.\n\nAn audit of existing trials and longitudinal studies, both in Australia and in potential comparator countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States, should be high on the priority list for the ban’s advisory committee and researchers. But comparisons are likely to be complex, owing to probable differences in sample demographics, risk assessments, age in the cohorts and outcome measurements. It might also be tough to achieve safe and ethical access to these cohorts — teenagers and their parents might not have consented to have their data used beyond the original investigation.",

          "abstract": "Like a spider web that flexes to compensate for a broken strand1,2, steel truss bridges, which are built from a framework of connected elements, can sometimes withstand the failure of a load-bearing component by activating hidden structural responses. However, predicting whether a truss bridge will survive damage depends on many interacting factors, from geometry to the way in which the elements are bolted together and the choice of materials. How a bridge has been used — or overused — and maintained during its lifetime also has an important role. Writing in Nature, Reyes-Suárez et al.3 report six ‘secondary resistance mechanisms’ that might enable these bridges to avoid collapse. By combining physical experiments on a scaled-down railway bridge with simulations, the authors show that a combination of flexing and twisting can safely redistribute the forces acting on a truss bridge after it loses a load-bearing element. The researchers’ findings offer a framework for designing robust bridges in an era of ageing infrastructure and environmental pressures.",

          "authors": "Chris Simms",
          "abstract": "A huge analysis of DNA methylation in human tissue has revealed new anti-ageing targets.Credit: Lawrence Lawry/SPL\n\nThe visible effects of ageing on our body are in part linked to invisible changes in gene activity. The epigenetic process of DNA methylation — the addition or removal of tags called methyl groups — becomes less precise as we age. The result is changes to gene expression that are linked to reduced organ function and increased susceptibility to disease as people age.\n\nNow, a meta-analysis of epigenetic changes in 17 types of human tissue throughout the entire adult lifespan provides the most comprehensive picture to date of how ageing modifies our genes.\n\nThe study assessed DNA methylation patterns in human tissue samples and revealed that some tissues seem to age faster than others. The retina and stomach, for example, accumulate more ageing-related DNA methylation changes than do the cervix or skin. The analysis also found universal epigenetic markers of ageing across different organs. This ‘epigenetic atlas’ might help researchers to study the link between DNA methylation and ageing and could aid the identification of molecular targets for anti-ageing treatments.\n\n“I think this is a great resource” to understand ageing, says Joao Pedro Magalhaes, a molecular biologist at the University of Birmingham, UK. “This meta-analysis of methylation data across organs is, to my knowledge, the largest such resource assembled to date. I am sure that it will be valuable to researchers.”\n\nThe work is reported on the preprint server Research Square1 and has not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nEpigenetic atlas of ageing\n\nResearchers can already analyse DNA methylation patterns in people’s genomes to create ageing clocks — tools that measure biological age. However, there are unresolved fundamental questions about whether these signatures of ageing are shared across tissue types.\n\nTo elucidate how methylation relates to ageing, Nir Eynon at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and his colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of more than 15,000 samples from 17 human tissues taken from adults of different ages. They mapped out methylation changes across 900,000 potential sites in the DNA, then created an open-access atlas. “We had examples from people from 18 years old till 100 or so,” says Eynon, so we can look at the epigenetic markers and how they change across the human lifespan.\n\nWhat is ageing? Even the field’s researchers can’t agree\n\nOverall, the researchers found that the mean amount of methylation varies greatly between tissues, ranging from 35% in the cervix, through to 48% in skin, 51% in muscle, 53% in the heart, 57% in the stomach and up to 63% in the retina.\n\nStudy co-author Macsue Jacques, also at Monash University, says almost all tissues have increased DNA methylation as they age. The exceptions are skeletal muscle and lung, “which has more of a loss of methylation with age”. Their analysis also found that different organs have distinct ageing patterns of DNA methylation. “Each tissue has a different shift that happens,” Jacques says.\n\nAgeing methylation targets\n\nAs well as examining differences between tissues, the researchers screened individual gene sites throughout each tissue genome. “We wanted to find a common ageing mechanism that goes across all the tissue types,” says Jacques.\n\nThey found several genes that had methylation changes were strong biological markers of ageing across several tissues. These included the developmental regulators HDAC4 and HOX, which are related to senescence and age-related decline, and MEST, which has been associated with diabetes and obesity, two known accelerators of ageing2.\n\nThe researchers identified high methylation of the protocadherin gamma (PCDHG) gene family as a driver of the ageing process in multiple different organs. Other studies have shown that hypermethylation in the PCDHG gene family is linked to reduced white matter in the brain, a marker of accelerated cognitive decline3.",

          "abstract": "An AI tool can screen thousands of journals, and identify ones that violate quality standards.Credit: PaulPaladin/Alamy\n\nResearchers have identified more than 1,000 potentially problematic open-access journals using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that screened around 15,000 titles for signs of dubious publishing practices.\n\nThe approach, described in Science Advances on 27 August1, could be used to help tackle the rise in what the study authors call “questionable open-access journals” — those that charge fees to publish papers without doing rigorous peer review or quality checks.\n\nPredatory publishers’ latest scam: bootlegged and rebranded papers\n\nNone of the journals flagged by the tool has previously been on any kind of watchlist, and some titles are owned by large, reputable publishers. Together, the journals have published hundreds of thousands of research papers that have received millions of citations.\n\nThe study suggests that “there’s a whole group of problematic journals in plain sight that are functioning as supposedly respected journals that really don’t deserve that qualification”, says Jennifer Byrne, a research-integrity sleuth and cancer researcher at the University of Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe tool is available online in a closed beta version, and organizations that index journals, or publishers, can use it to review their portfolios, says study co-author Daniel Acuña, a computer scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. But, he adds, the AI sometimes makes mistakes, and is not designed to replace detailed evaluations of journals and individual publications that might result in a title being removed from an index. “A human expert should be part of the vetting process” before any action is taken, he says.\n\nScreening journals\n\nThe AI tool can analyse a vast amount of information from journals’ websites and the papers they publish, and search for red flags — such as short turnaround times for publishing articles and high rates of self-citation. It also assesses whether members of a journal’s editorial board are affiliated with well-known, reputable research institutions, and checks how transparent publications are about licensing and fees. Several of the criteria used to train the tool come from best-practice guidance developed by the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), an index of open-access journals run by the non-profit DOAJ Foundation in Roskilde, Denmark.\n\nCenyu Shen, the DOAJ’s deputy head of editorial quality, who is based in Helsinki, says that the number of problematic journals is rising, and that their “tactics are becoming more sophisticated”. “We are observing more instances where questionable publishers acquire legitimate journals, or where paper mills purchase journals to publish low-quality work,” she adds. (Paper mills are businesses that sell fake papers and authorships.)\n\nI’m worried I’ve been contacted by a predatory publisher — how do I find out?\n\nThe DOAJ’s own quality checks on journals are done mostly manually and are initiated only after receiving complaints. In 2024, the directory investigated 473 journals, a rise of 40% compared with 2021. “The time our team spent on these investigations also grew significantly by nearly 30%, to 837 hours,” says Shen.\n\nAI tools could help to speed up some of these assessments, Acuña says. He and his colleagues trained their model on 12,869 journals that are currently indexed in the DOAJ as legitimate, as well as 2,536 that the directory had flagged as violating its quality standards.\n\nWhen the researchers asked the AI to evaluate 15,191 open-access journals listed in the public database Unpaywall, it identified 1,437 journals as questionable. The team estimated that some 345 of these were mistakenly flagged: they included discontinued titles, book series and journals from small, learned-society publishers. The researchers also found that the tool had failed to flag a further 1,782 questionable journals, based on estimates of error rates.",

Although digital interventions show promise, their comparative efficacy across methodological frameworks and technology types remains unclear. Here we assessed digital interventions versus standard care via frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis of 152 randomized controlled trials (48.8% USA, 7.5% China). Interventions were categorized by methodology and technology type, with cross-matched subgroup analyses. Results showed that personalized interventions significantly improved smoking cessation rates compared with standard care (relative risk (RR) 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54–2.24), while group-customized interventions were more effective (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.30–2.86) compared with standard digital interventions (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.31–1.72). Among the various technology types, text message-based interventions were the most effective (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.38–1.92). Intervention effectiveness was also influenced by age, with middle-aged individuals benefitting more than younger individuals. Short- and medium-term interventions were more effective than long-term interventions. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed these low-to-moderate findings. However, this study has some limitations, including methodological heterogeneity, potential bias and inconsistent definitions of numerical interventions. In addition, long-term follow-up data remain limited. Future studies require large-scale trials to assess long-term sustainability and population-specific responses, as well as standardization of methods and integration of data at the individual level.",

Here, to fill this gap, we conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism across the lifespan and developed a web platform to disseminate the generated results. Five databases were searched (up to 31 December 2023) for systematic reviews with meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism. Independent pairs of investigators identified eligible papers and extracted relevant data. Included meta-analyses were reestimated using a consistent statistical approach, and their methodological quality was assessed with AMSTAR-2. The certainty of evidence generated by each meta-analysis was appraised using an algorithmic version of the GRADE framework. This process led to the identification of 53 meta-analytic reports, enabling us to conduct 248 meta-analyses exploring the effects of 19 CAIMs in autism. We found no high-quality evidence to support the efficacy of any CAIM for core or associated symptoms of autism. Although several CAIMs showed promising results, they were supported by very low-quality evidence. The safety of CAIMs has rarely been evaluated, making it a crucial area for future research. To support evidence-based consideration of CAIM interventions for autism, we developed an interactive platform that facilitates access to and interpretation of the present results ( https://ebiact-database.com ).",

          "abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising neuroimaging method owing to its non-invasive nature and adaptability to real-world settings. However, fNIRS signal quality is sensitive to individual differences in biophysical factors such as hair and skin characteristics, which can considerably impact the absorption and scattering of near-infrared light. If not properly addressed, these factors risk biasing fNIRS research by disproportionately affecting signal quality across diverse populations. Here we quantify the impact of hair properties and skin pigmentation, as well as head size, sex and age, on signal quality in n = 115 individuals. We provide recommendations for fNIRS researchers, including a suggested metadata table and guidance for cap and optode configurations, hair management techniques and strategies to optimize data collection across varied participants. This research will help to guide future hardware advances and methodological standards to overcome barriers to inclusivity in fNIRS studies.",

          "abstract": "Driven by access to large volumes of movement data, the study of human mobility has grown rapidly over the past few decades. The field has shown that human mobility is scale-free, proposed models to generate scale-free moving distance distributions and explained how the scale-free distribution arises. It has not, however, explicitly addressed how mobility is structured by geographical constraints, such as how mobility relates to the outlines of landmasses, lakes and rivers and the placement of buildings, roadways and cities. On the basis of millions of moves, we show how separating the effect of geography from mobility choices reveals a power law spanning five orders of magnitude. To do so, we incorporate geography via the pair distribution function, which encapsulates the structure of locations on which mobility occurs. By showing how the spatial distribution of human settlements shapes human mobility, our approach bridges the gap between distance- and opportunity-based models of human mobility.",

          "abstract": "Social media are often said to exacerbate polarization by platforming hostility between groups. However, positive social emotions like ingroup solidarity may also drive social media engagement, particularly after major threats such as military invasions or terror attacks. In this preregistered study, we examine the socioemotional drivers of engagement following group threats in the context of the US 2024 presidential campaign trail, where both major political parties faced crises in July of 2024. We test how ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility predicted social media users’ engagement with 62,118 posts by 484 US partisan accounts before and after the first Trump assassination attempt (July 13) and Biden’s re-election campaign suspension (July 21). We find that, while outgroup hostility is typically the dominant predictor of engagement, interactions with ingroup solidarity surged among Republicans after the Trump shooting and among Democrats after Biden’s withdrawal. We show that negativity toward other groups is not always key to going viral. Rather, positive ingroup emotions appear to play a leading role in times of crisis.",

The analysis is based on known-item searches for 875 target documents in chemistry, materials science, cardiology, public health, economics, education, and psychology. Overall, Google Scholar, OpenAlex, and the ILS are the most comprehensive sources of bibliographic records. Google Scholar’s coverage rate is higher than that of all the Manhattan University databases combined, and Scopus—the most comprehensive multidisciplinary library database—has a lower bibliographic coverage rate than Google Scholar, both of the web-based scholarly databases, one of the two ASNs, and one of the two pirate sites. In terms of full-text coverage, the best multidisciplinary options are the ILS, Google Scholar, and the two pirate sites. Although several of the alternative discovery/access mechanisms are deficient in terms of their user interfaces, search capabilities, and metadata, they nonetheless provide excellent bibliographic and full-text coverage of the scholarly literature. In contrast, many single-subject library databases provide very incomplete coverage of their own subject areas. These findings have implications for scholars and students as well as system-wide implications for the use, development, and evaluation of information resources.",

          "abstract": "Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data are available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our minimal hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation–integration transition even with memory-less agents. While residential segregation is a multifactorial phenomenon, this physics analogy suggests a simple mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood’s population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract spaces.",

By analyzing which prompts elicit which behaviors, we can categorize and compare different strategic situations, which can also help provide insight into what different economic scenarios might induce people to think about. We discuss how this provides a step toward a nonstandard method of inferring (deciphering) the motivations behind the human behaviors. We also show how this deciphering process can be used to categorize differences in the behavioral tendencies of different populations.",

          "abstract": "Glucose metabolism impacts the innate immune response against viral infection. However, the key enzymes or the natural products and mechanisms involved are not well elucidated. Here, we found that arrestin domain containing 4 (ARRDC4), a critical regulator of glucose metabolism, senses influenza A virus (IAV) infection by interacting with viral PA protein. Upregulated ARRDC4 increases the enzymatic activity of phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFKM) via binding its His298 site to promote the production of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Consequently, FBP inhibits the K48-linked ubiquitination degradation of HSP90β, subsequently enhances its interaction with IKKβ and IKKε, and enhances NF-κB- and IRF7-mediated antiviral innate immunity, respectively. Importantly, FBP supplementation enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight a unique immunometabolic regulatory mechanism in which ARRDC4 senses IAV infection and regulates antiviral innate immunity through the PFKM-FBP metabolic axis and provide a strategy for manipulating FBP-related metabolism to treat viral infection.",

          "abstract": "Understanding host factors driving asymptomatic versus severe disease outcomes is of key importance if we are to control emerging and re-emerging viral infections. HLA-B*15:01 has been associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhospitalized individuals of European ancestry, with protective immunity attributed to preexisting cross-reactive CD8 + T-cells directed against HLA-B*15:01-restricted Spike-derived S 919-927 peptide (B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells). However, fundamental questions remained on the abundance and clonotypic nature of CD8 + T-cell responses in HLA-B*15:01-positive patients who succumbed to life-threatening COVID-19. Here, we analyzed B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell responses in COVID-19 patients from independent HLA-typed COVID-19 patient cohorts across three continents, Australia, Asia and Europe. We assessed B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells in COVID-19 patients across disease outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to hospitalized critical illness. We found that severe/critical COVID-19 patients mounted B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell responses lacking a highly expanded key public B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell receptor (TCR; TRAV9-2/TRBV7-2) which recurred across multiple individuals in COVID-19 patients with a mild disease. Instead, B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell responses in life-threatening disease had a prevalence of an alternate TCR clonotypic motif (TRAV38-2/DV8/TRBV20-1), potentially contributing, at least in part, to why B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients were less protective. Interestingly, the frequency, memory phenotype, and activation profiles of circulating B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells did not differ across disease severity. Moreover, B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells were better maintained into convalescence compared to other SARS-CoV-2-specificities. Our study thus provides evidence on the differential nature of the TCR clonal repertoire in 22.37% of HLA-B*15:01-positive COVID-19 patients who developed severe or critical disease in our cohorts, comparing to HLA-B*15:01-expressing individuals with mild COVID-19.",

          "authors": "Ueli Schibler, Flore Sinturel, Felix Naef, Alan Gerber, David Gatfield",
          "abstract": "In mammals, a hierarchically organized circadian timing system orchestrates daily rhythms of nearly all physiology. A master pacemaker in the brain’s suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes subsidiary clocks in most peripheral organs. By driving anabolic and catabolic cycles of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates and by detoxifying endo- and xenobiotic components, the liver plays an important role in adapting the metabolic needs to rest-activity rhythms. In keeping with these functions, the liver expresses many clock-controlled genes that are required for these processes. Remarkably, however, this organ also fluctuates in size and morphological parameters. In mice, the mass of the liver increases and decreases by 30 to 40% during the 24-h day. The oscillation in liver mass is accompanied by daily rhythms of similar amplitudes in hepatocyte cell size and global RNA and protein accumulation. The number of ribosomes, which parallels the ups and downs of liver size, appears to be the rate-limiting factor in driving the diurnal rhythms of overall protein synthesis. Obviously, the rapid increase in hepatocyte size within the liver engenders mechanical stress, which must be dealt with by increasing the physical robustness of cells. Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton of hepatocytes undergoes dramatic polymerization cycles. Thus, massive intracellular and subcortical F-actin bundles are assembled during the night, at which the liver reaches its maximal size. In turn, the oscillation in actin polymerization elicits rhythms in myocardin-related transcription factors-serum response factor signaling, which participate in the circadian transcription of the core clock gene Per2 and thereby contribute to the synchronization of hepatocyte clocks.",

However, the relative influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors in animal body size evolution, and the coevolution of wild and domestic species remain poorly understood. In the Northwestern Mediterranean, abundant archaeozoological data from well-contextualized sites and reliable paleoenvironmental reconstructions provide a unique opportunity to explore long-term morphological changes and their drivers over time. This study analyzes 81,211 biometric measurements from 311 archaeological sites in Mediterranean France, spanning the past 8,000 y. It examines body size evolution in key wild (red deer, red fox, brown hare, rabbit) and domestic (sheep, goat, cattle, pig, chicken) species alongside vegetation, climate, and human activity changes. Our analyses reveal a long-standing synchrony between wild and domestic species until the last millennium, both influenced by a complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. From the Early Neolithic to the Roman period, environmental conditions exerted comparable effects on wild and domestic species, though the magnitude and timing of changes varied, reflecting species-specific interactions with humans. From the Middle Ages onward, evolutionary trajectories diverged. Domestic species experienced intensified human selection, while human activities increasingly impacted wild populations and their habitat. These findings highlight the dynamic and interwoven roles of environmental and anthropogenic factors in shaping animal morphological evolution, emphasizing the importance of environmental factors in the evolution of domestic species, and illustrating the growing impact of human activities on wild populations.",

          "abstract": "Circadian clocks allow organisms to anticipate daily fluctuations in light and temperature, but how this anticipatory role promotes adaptation to different environments remains poorly understood. Here, we subjected the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to a long-term evolution experiment under high light, high temperature, and elevated CO 2 levels. After 1,200 generations, we obtained a strain exhibiting a 600% increase in growth rate. Whole-genome sequencing revealed three mutations fixed in the evolved population, two of which were sufficient to recapitulate the fast-growing phenotype in the wild type. A mutation in the promoter of the shikimate kinase aroK led to its overexpression, while a mutation in the central circadian regulator sasA disrupted both the phase and amplitude of the circadian rhythm. Changes in circadian control led to widespread perturbations in the transcriptome and metabolome. These included major shifts in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle and glycogen storage dynamics. While these changes increased fitness under the experimental conditions, they caused maladaptation when light or CO 2 levels were altered, revealing a trade-off between fitness and environmental flexibility. Our results demonstrate that mutations in circadian control can drive fast adaptation by modulating central metabolism, underscoring the circadian cycle as a cornerstone of cellular plasticity. Thus, targeting the circadian cycle could be key to engineering cyanobacterial strains optimized for carbon fixation and biomass production.",

Here, we introduce a protein design strategy that yields de novo designed proteins capable of stabilizing the key amyloidogenic region of TDP-43 in its native helical conformation with nanomolar binding affinity. The binding mechanism was further characterized by the NMR and mutagenesis study. More importantly, we demonstrated that our designed protein binders efficiently reduced TDP-43 amyloid aggregation both in vitro and in cells. Our work provides a strategy for designing protein stabilizer of the native conformation of pathological proteins for preventing its amyloid aggregation, shedding light on the development of potential therapeutic approaches for ALS, FTLD, and other protein aggregation-associated diseases.",

Although many of these substrates are believed to promote M.tb virulence, most remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a complete locus deletion strain of ESX-5 in M.tb to examine the molecular changes caused by a broad loss in ESX-5 secretory substrates. We confirmed the selective loss of PE/PPE proteins secreted by ESX-5 into both the culture filtrate (CF) and outer mycomembrane (OMM) fractions of the M.tb ∆esx5 mutant. In examining other ESX systems, we found that ESX-1 substrate levels were increased in both the CF and OMM fractions of the ∆esx5 mutant. Conversely, the ESX-3 locus was transcriptionally repressed upon ESX-5 deletion. We noted that the ∆esx5 mutant had altered morphology in the form of wrinkled distortions of the bacterial surface. Likewise, we identified increased susceptibility of the ∆esx5 mutant to a variety of large (molecular weight &gt;550 g/mol) antimicrobial compounds, suggesting that an intact ESX-5 system is required for M.tb to exclude such molecules. Our findings suggest that removing the ESX-5 system from M.tb fundamentally alters the properties of the mycobacterial OMM and impacts the expression and secretion activity of other ESX systems.",

Here, we uncover a role for type IIA procollagen (IIA), an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein encoded by an alternatively spliced Col2a1 transcript, encoding a N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, as a critical regulator in a cardiac gene regulatory feedback loop. The cysteine-rich domain of IIA protein was previously reported to interact with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and transforming growth factors-beta (TGFβ) in in vitro binding assays and acts as a BMP antagonist in amphibian embryo assays. We show that the Col2a1 gene in mice is activated in the developing heart by core cardiogenic factors (NKX2-5, GATA4, MEF2, and SRF) via cis-regulatory enhancer elements. IIA loss (ΔIIA) in mice results in depletion of Isl1- and Nkx2-5-expressing progenitors, causing outflow tract defects resembling disrupted BMP/TGFβ-SMAD signaling, alongside reduced nuclear pSMAD1/5/8 in cardiac tissues. Compound +/ΔIIA ; Smad4+/− mutants exhibit aggravated malformations. IIA enhances BMP-responsive reporter activity in cells in transactivation assays. We propose that IIA supports a positive functional role on SMAD4-dependent signaling, fine-tuning BMP/TGFβ signaling, thereby regulating GATA4 and NKX2-5 activity during second heart field progenitor specification. These findings position IIA procollagen as a key ECM component that integrates BMP/TGFβ signaling with cardiac transcription factors such as NKX2-5, revealing a feedback loop essential for cardiogenesis. Given its role in cardiac development, IIA emerges as a potential congenital heart disease risk factor.",

          "abstract": "In vivo genome editing has the potential to address many inherited and environmental disorders. However, a major hurdle for the clinical translation of genome editing is safe, efficient delivery to disease-relevant tissues. A modality-agnostic reporter animal model that facilitates rapid, precise, and quantifiable assessment of functional delivery and editing could greatly enhance the evaluation and translation of delivery technologies. Here, we present the development of the tdTomato in vivo genome-editing reporter (TIGER) mouse, a reporter strain that harbors an integrated and constitutively expressed mutated tdTomato gene in the Polr2a locus. The mutations (Q115X, Q357X) abolish fluorescence, but successful adenine base editing (ABE) or prime editing (PE) restores tdTomato fluorescence. This mouse model facilitates the tissue- and cell type–specific assessment of genome editing agent delivery. We describe several editing strategies validated in vitro and demonstrate efficient ABE and PE in vivo using viral and nonviral delivery vectors targeting four cell types within the mouse eye: the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors, Müller glia, and the trabecular meshwork. We show direct editing characterization in the ocular tissues via in vivo and ex vivo two-photon confocal microscopy and verify the spectral and fluorescence lifetime properties of tdTomato reporter in other mouse tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate successful adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated PE of extraocular tissues, including hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, and brain neurons by intravenous injection. Thus, the TIGER mouse facilitates the direct development, comparison, and optimization of delivery platforms for efficient and productive ABE or PE broadly applicable in vivo across multiple tissues tested in this study.",

          "abstract": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a target for near-term climate change mitigation. In many natural ecosystems, methane is sequestered by microbial communities, yet little is known about how constituents of methane-oxidizing communities interact with each other and their environment. This lack of mechanistic understanding is a common issue for many important microbial communities, but it is difficult to draw links between available sequencing information and the metabolites that govern community interactions. Here, we develop and apply a technique called inverse stable isotope probing–metabolomics (InverSIP) to bridge the gap between metagenomic and metabolomic information and functionally characterize interactions in a complex methane-oxidizing community. Using InverSIP, we link a highly transcribed biosynthetic gene cluster in the community with its secondary metabolite product: methylocystabactin, a triscatecholate siderophore not previously observed in nature. We find that production of methylocystabactin is widespread among methanotrophic alphaproteobacteria and that it can be used by another methanotroph in the community that does not produce this siderophore itself. Functional assays reveal that methylocystabactin supports methanotroph growth and the activity of the methane-oxidizing enzyme soluble methane monooxygenase under conditions where bioavailable iron is limited, establishing an important molecular link between methane-oxidation and the insoluble iron found in many natural environments. These findings contribute to a molecular-level understanding of these environmentally important bacterial communities and establish InverSIP as a broadly applicable genomics-guided strategy for characterizing metabolites in microbial ecosystems.",

Here, we show that monoallelic missense mutations in TRIM71 are associated with hearing loss (HL) and inner ear aplasia in humans. Utilizing conditional Trim71 knockout mice carrying a CH and HL-associated mutation, we demonstrate that loss of TRIM71 function during early otic development (embryonic day 9 to 10) causes severe HL. While inner ear morphogenesis occurs normally in Trim71 knockout mice, we find that early otic loss of TRIM71 function disrupts the highly stereotyped timing of cell cycle exit and differentiation within the inner ear auditory sensory organ (cochlea), resulting in the premature formation and innervation of mechanosensory hair cells. Transcriptomic profiling of Trim71 -deficient cochlear progenitor cells identifies Inhba and Tgfbr2 as targets of TRIM71 repression, and our analysis of Inhba-Tgfbr1 double knockout mice indicates that TRIM71 maintains hair cell progenitors in a proliferative and undifferentiated state by restricting TGFβ-type signaling. Characterization of hair cells and their associated neurons in adult Trim71 knockout mice revealed reduced presynaptic terminals and neuronal degeneration in the outer hair cell region, providing a basis for the observed hearing deficits in Trim71 knockout mice.",

We developed a CRISPR knockout screen to identify host factors that impact ZIKV replication, resulting in the finding of angiomotin-like protein 2 (AMOTL2), a protein that inhibits ZIKV by regulating the host type I interferon (IFN) response. AMOTL2 affects IFN signaling by modulating STAT1 levels and activation in response to type I IFN. Thus, AMOTL2, which has largely been studied for its role in cancer, represents an antiviral protein that interacts with the IFN signaling pathway to promote downstream expression of IFN stimulated genes, resulting in restriction of ZIKV.",

Further decoration of phosphatidylserine on the surface of Mito@Microgels boosted cellular uptake efficiency by cardiomyocytes. These Mito@Microgels effectively deliver active mitochondria to cardiomyocytes, improving the mitochondrial network architecture and function and consequently reducing the cellular injury induced by oxidative stress. Moreover, Mito@Microgels attenuated the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages, helping resolve excessive local inflammation. In vivo animal studies using a rat MI model further validated the therapeutic efficacy of the Mito@Microgels, as evidenced by improved myocardial function, prevention of infarcted left ventricular wall thinning, and increased cardiomyocyte survival.

This framework speeds up DFT calculations through better initial guesses for magnetic moments, determines the ground-state ordering of bulk materials and even generalizes to magnetic ordering in surfaces.

          "abstract": "Creatine plays a vital role in cellular energy production and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) homeostasis and has also been identified as a neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. Creatine is transported into cells by the human creatine transporter (hCRT) (SLC6A8), an Na + /Cl − -dependent symporter encoded on the X chromosome. Mutations in hCRT cause cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome 1, a neurological disorder marked by intellectual disability, speech delay, and seizures. Beyond its role in the brain and muscle, hCRT is highly expressed in metabolically active tumors. Many cancer cells, including colorectal cancer and glioblastoma, upregulate hCRT to sustain intracellular creatine levels and buffer ATP under energy stress. Pharmacological blockade of hCRT by RGX202 has been shown to impair tumor growth by disrupting energy homeostasis. Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human hCRT in three states: apo, creatine-bound, and RGX202-bound. hCRT adopts a canonical LeuT-fold with 12 transmembrane helices and two pseudosymmetric inverted repeats. Creatine is coordinated in the central substrate-binding site through interactions with transmembrane helices TM1, TM3, TM6, and TM8, while the inhibitor RGX202 occupies the same binding pocket, engaging in overlapping contacts that competitively block creatine access. Our structural and mechanistic findings clarify substrate recognition and inhibitory binding of hCRT, providing a molecular rationale for targeting hCRT in both inherited metabolic diseases and cancer therapy.",

This process shifts the water column toward a more autotrophic and alkaline state, effectively sequestering CO 2 from the atmosphere. Over the full culture period, the net carbon sequestered by oyster-driven organic carbon production is 2.39 times greater than the CO 2 sequestered in oyster shells. These findings position oyster farming as a scalable, nature-based solution for climate change mitigation, offering dual benefits of carbon sequestration and enhanced food security.

However, over 10% of Mtb infections are INH-resistant. The compound C10 can sensitize clinically relevant INH-resistant mutants to killing by INH. Thus, understanding the mechanism of action for C10 could aid in designing new strategies for circumventing drug resistance. We find that C10 treatment reroutes carbon flux toward valine, drawing carbon away from gluconeogenesis and the TCA cycle. As a result, C10 decreases cell envelope capsule thickness and blocks an accumulation of peptidoglycan precursors that occurs in response to INH treatment in an INH-resistant Mtb katG mutant. In this altered metabolic state induced by C10, INH treatment of the INH-resistant Mtb katG mutant inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis, precipitating collapse of cell envelope integrity. Pyruvate supplementation relieves the C10-induced requirement for carbon flux toward valine, enhancing carbon assimilation into cell envelope precursors and restoring resistance to INH. In addition, we identify the formation of isoniazid-pyruvate in INH-treated katG W328L Mtb , where pyruvate sequesters INH, lowering the concentration of INH available to inhibit Mtb . Together, our findings reveal a bactericidal activity for INH in Mtb that can function in INH-resistant mutants independently of INH-mediated inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis. This activity for INH can be elicited by shifting carbon flux toward valine and away from cell envelope precursor synthesis, highlighting a metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to kill INH-resistant Mtb .",

However, structural studies of membrane proteins often rely on solubilization with detergents, which may not accurately reflect their native states in a cellular context. Additionally, identifying suitable detergents for individual membrane proteins can be a detailed and time-consuming process. Here, we developed a vesicle-based method that preserves the native lipid environment for subsequent structural and functional studies. Using the bacterial multidrug efflux transporter AcrB as an example, we isolated AcrB-containing vesicles and determined its cryo-EM structure with all protomers in a loose (L) state at 3.88 Å by incorporating our micrograph-based sorting strategy. Notably, compared to the L-state AcrB in liposomes and nanoparticles, the exterior transmembrane helices (TMs) in our map exhibited superior quality, featuring a continuous and clear representation of lα, which is positioned horizontally within the lipid bilayer. We further expanded our method by identifying endogenous membrane proteins, including F-ATPase and respiratory complexes, in vesicles generated using mitochondria from pig hearts. The high-resolution structure of respiratory complex III in vesicles revealed a shared subunit nine between two monomers. Briefly, our method presents a promising and straightforward approach for studying the structure and function of membrane proteins in their native environment, eliminating the need for detergent screening and protein purification.",

          "abstract": "Arsenite (As III ) is toxic to all organisms due to its ability to tightly bind exposed thiols within cells. An important As III resistance mechanism in prokaryotes involves proteins encoded by the ars operon. A central component of the ars operon in many bacteria is the cytoplasmic ATPase, ArsA, which orchestrates a series of nucleotide-dependent handoffs, starting with the capture of As III by the ArsD metallochaperone and culminating in its removal from the cell by the ArsB efflux pump. Although the mechanism of ArsA has been widely studied, the molecular details of how nucleotide hydrolysis modulates these events remain unclear. ArsA is an archetypal member of the intradimeric Walker A (IWA) family of ATPases, implicated in a diversity of complex biological functions. Conformational changes typical of IWA ATPases have been postulated to drive these molecular events but have not been demonstrated. We report cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ArsA in MgADP-bound and MgATP-bound open states, as well as a distinct closed MgATP-bound state liganded to As III . X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed three-coordinate binding of As III to the conserved cysteines at the metalloid-binding site of the closed state. Coupled with biochemical characterization, our cryo-EM structures reveal key conformational changes in the ArsA catalytic cycle consistent with other IWA ATPases and provide the structural basis for allosteric activation of nucleotide hydrolysis by As III . This work establishes how the nucleotide state of ArsA transiently creates a high-affinity binding site that can sequester metalloid within the cell, followed by a nucleotide-driven handoff to ArsB for efflux.",

          "abstract": "Redox-sensitive elements figure prominently in studies of the evolution of Earth’s surface redox state, including the first major rise in atmospheric O 2 , the Paleoproterozoic Great Oxidation Event. Most Precambrian rocks endured multistage tectonothermal histories, however, adding ambiguity to interpretation of their chemistry. Here, we apply U-Th-Pb isotope geochronology to the highly oxidized ~2.06 Ga Kuetsjärvi Volcanic Formation, Pechenga Greenstone Belt, Russia, to constrain the age and extent of U oxidation. By contrasting the relative mobility of U and Th using Pb isotopes, we find that complete to near-complete oxidation and removal of U occurred shortly after eruption. We argue that this likely indicates relatively high atmospheric O 2 , where oxidative weathering and alteration produced a global pulse of U to the oceans. Such a pulse could explain widespread shifts in the U-Th-Pb isotope character of mantle reservoirs at ~2 Ga, including a decrease in the 232 Th/ 238 U ratio of the mid-ocean ridge basalt source and inception of the high- 238 U/ 204 Pb (HIMU) source to ocean island basalts, underscoring the connections between the redox character of the Paleoproterozoic surface and deep Earth. Using 207 Pb- 206 Pb, 238 U- 206 Pb, 235 U- 207 Pb, and 232 Th- 208 Pb geochronology, ~2.06 Ga oxidative loss of U may be distinguished from reintroduction of U at ~1.8 Ga during regional metamorphism, as well as Pb loss during a Phanerozoic tectonothermal event. Our results therefore establish the complex history of redox-sensitive element behavior in the rocks, highlighting the fact that elemental abundances, by themselves, are unlikely to capture straightforward proxy information in rocks that have seen multistage geologic histories.",

Genetic ablation of FA2H interfered with an early step in RV entry for multiple human and animal strains. Intestinal epithelial cell–specific deletion of Fa2h limited RV replication and diarrhea incidence in vivo. Using transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence, we found that viral particles were trapped in early and late endosomes in FA2H knockout cells, preventing their further exit into the cytosol. The defect in RV infectivity could be partially restored by treatment of cells with long-chain 2-hydroxy ceramides or a calcium channel activator that promotes Ca 2+ efflux from endosomes. Both Junín virus, an arenavirus, and Shiga toxin, dependent on endosomal Ca 2+ transport, required FA2H for efficient entry. Together, this study highlights a role of fatty acid 2-hydroxylation in RV entry into host cells and implicates 2-hydroxy ceramides as potential key regulators of endosomal Ca 2+ levels, offering important insights for the development of host-directed therapies targeting fatty acid 2-hydroxylation to control microbial infections.",

Recent studies identified excessive glutamate accumulation as a key Aβ-dependent determinant of hyperactivity. The cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal silence depend on both Aβ and tau protein pathologies, with an unknown role of Aβ. Here, by using single-cell-initiated rabies virus (RV) tracing in mouse models of β-amyloidosis, we demonstrate that the presynaptic connectivity of silent, but not that of hyperactive, neurons is severely disrupted. Furthermore, silent neurons display a major spine loss and strongly suppressed synaptic activity.

          "abstract": "Cosmic rays (CRs) play an important role in affecting planetary and interstellar climate and environment. Here, we apply the CR–driven electron-induced reaction (CRE) theory of ozone depletion to obtain a quantitative understanding of spatiotemporal variations in Earth’s lower-stratospheric ozone (LSO) and temperature, which provide fingerprints for the mechanisms of ozone depletion and examine the impact of nonhalogen greenhouse gases on the ozone layer. We first show from observations that both LSO and temperature display pronounced 11-y cyclic variations over Antarctica and mid-latitudes, while weak (no apparent) cyclic variations over the tropics. These observations are consistent with the prediction by the CRE theory. Second, our no-parameter CRE theoretical calculations give the vertical profile of ozone loss in perfect agreement with observations at the Antarctic Syowa station and reproduce well the time-series variations of both LSO and temperature in the polar, mid-latitude, and tropical regions, including the previously reported large ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere over the tropics. The results also demonstrate that both LSO and temperature are controlled by CRs and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) only. Moreover, CRE calculations exhibit complex phenomena in future trends of LSO and temperature, which are strongly affected by the future trend of CR fluxes. The latter might even lead to almost no recovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica and no returning to the 1980 level over the tropics by 2100. This study greatly improves quantitative understanding of ozone depletion and climate in the global lower stratosphere and offers predictions on future trends.",

Recent advances in imaging technologies, such as “mother machines” for bacteria or yeast, have allowed long-term tracking of cell-size dynamics across many generations, and thus have brought major insights into the mechanisms underlying cell-size control. However, understanding the governing rules of cell growth and division within a quantitative dynamical-systems framework remains a major challenge. Here, we implement and apply a framework that makes it possible to infer stochastic-differential-equation models with Poisson noise directly from experimentally measured time series for cellular growth and division. To account for potential nonlinear memory effects, we parameterize the Poisson intensity of stochastic cell-division events in terms of both the cell’s current size and its ancestral history. By applying the algorithm to experimentally measured cell-size trajectories, we are able to quantitatively evaluate the linear one-step memory hypothesis underlying the popular “sizer,” “adder,” and “timer” models of cell homeostasis. For Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria, Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast and Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, we find that in many cases, the inferred stochastic models have a substantial nonlinear memory component. This suggests a need to reevaluate and generalize some of the currently prevailing linear-memory paradigms of cell homeostasis. More broadly, the underlying inference framework is directly applicable to identify quantitative models for stochastic jump processes in a wide range of scientific disciplines.",

Achieving such complex assemblies with the same level of fidelity, reproducibility, and advanced functionality in synthetic systems, however, has remained a grand challenge. One outstanding problem is the presence of parasitic products and long-lived intermediate states that slow the reaction process and limit the yield of the final product. Biology overcomes this challenge by proofreading to recognize and disassemble parasitic products. Such local checks, however, are currently difficult to implement in available self-assembly platforms. Here, we overcome this challenge by implementing a proofreading mechanism in a self-assembly platform. Specifically, we design intermediate states that strongly couple to an external force but a final product that is decoupled and thus highly stable to external driving, such that application of external forces selectively dissociates parasitic products. To implement this idea, we introduce lithographically patterned magnetic dipoles and an applied magnetic field to drive an assembly process similar to thermal self-assembly, but with additional controls. By applying patterns of magnetic driving that selectively destabilize parasitic states, we effectively implement a proofreading strategy to enable high-yield, time-efficient self-assembly. This realization of a general proofreading mechanism bridges the gap between artificial and biological self-assembly, paving the way for advanced self-assembled materials, with applications in next generation responsive materials, biomimetic devices, and microscale machines.",

          "abstract": "Biological flyers periodically flap their appendages to generate aerodynamic forces. Extensive studies have made significant progress in explaining the physics behind their propulsion in cruising by developing scaling laws of their flight kinematics. Notably Strouhal number ( St ; ratio of flapping frequency times stroke amplitude to cruising speed) has been found to fall in a narrow range for animal cruising flights. However, St exhibits strong correlation to flight conditions; as such, its universality has been confined to preferred flight conditions. Since the leading-edge vortices (LEV) on flapping appendages generate the majority of propulsive forces, here we take the perspective of LEV circulation maximization, which generalizes the dimensionless vortex formation time to flapping flight. The generalized vortex formation time scales the duration of vorticity injection with the rate of total vorticity growth inside the LEV and the maximum vorticity allowed inside it. By comparing the new scaling with St of previously reported animal cruising flights of 28 species, we show that the generalized vortex formation time is consistent across different animals and cruising locomotion, independent of flight conditions. This finding advances the fundamental principles underlying the complex wing kinematics of biological flyers and highlights a unifying framework for understanding biolocomotion.",

However, the rapid dynamics and highly localized nature of SB propagation present significant challenges for direct observation of their atomistic mechanisms using experimental techniques. In this study, we employ hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the atomic-scale mechanisms of SB propagation in Mg 65 Cu 25 Y 10 MGs, prepared using cooling rates as slow as 10 4 K s −1 —comparable to experimental casting conditions and significantly slower than the 10 10 K s −1 rates previously employed in atomistic simulations. Our results reveal a qualitative shift in SB propagation mechanisms as the structural state evolves with decreasing cooling rates. In hyperquenched MGs, SB propagation occurs intermittently, characterized by a “stop-and-go” motion driven by sequential activation and coalescence of multiple shear transformation zones (STZs) separated by vortex-like fields. In contrast, slowly cooled MGs exhibit continuous and rapid SB propagation, mediated by localized shear softening and the formation of large vortex fields, indicative of a more collective structural response. This transition arises from significant differences in the number density and spatial distribution of activated STZs across different structural states. These findings provide insights into the microscopic dynamics of SB initiation and propagation in MGs, highlighting how the structural state can be strategically tuned to control SB behavior. This opens up different opportunities for optimizing the mechanical performance of MGs for targeted engineering applications.",

We followed the fate of anthracycline cancer drugs at high resolution by exploiting their intrinsic fluorescence. In a cell-based spheroid model, the soluble compound fluorescein penetrates the entire spheroid, unlike hydrophobic fluorescent lipids, which only enter the outermost cell layer. Anthracyclines have intermediate hydrophobicity. They enter the nucleus of a few outer cell layers at neutral pH, but penetrate the spheroids more deeply under acidic conditions, with a reduction in cell entry and cytotoxicity. The glycolytic conditions that prevail in the tumor microenvironment may thus limit cell entry and contribute to anthracycline drug resistance. We evaluated a library of anthracycline variants to determine the physicochemical properties related to tissue penetration depth. We find that this is determined by only three chemical properties: molar refractivity, topological polar surface area, and water solubility. Our findings suggest that modifications of anthracyclines may improve access and activity to deeply tissue-embedded targets such as pancreatic cancer.",

We investigate the extent of biogenic methane release and its contribution to climate variability across the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE) approximately 183 million years ago. To do this, we developed a global biogeochemical model and applied a Bayesian inversion using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Based on a high-resolution record of carbon isotope excursions from the Yorkshire section, our results indicate that a release of at least 4,700 Gt carbon from biogenic CH 4 (with a carbon isotopic composition, δ 13 C of −50 to −70‰) is necessary to accurately reproduce the pronounced pulsed shift in the δ 13 C, as well as the inferred changes in atmospheric p CO 2 and global temperature. This massive methane release may have led to a substantial increase in atmospheric p CH 4 and contributed to additional global surface warming, perhaps by more than 2 °C. We further elucidate that the liberation of methane may have been facilitated by an upsurge in methanogenesis alongside a concomitant decline in methane oxidation within organic-rich, sulfate-depleted marine environments. An active CH 4 cycle represents a positive feedback mechanism that exacerbates environmental deterioration during climatic warming events, ultimately contributing to mass extinction of marine life.",

The hallmark of osteoarthritis is the degeneration of the joint cartilage, characterized by changes in chondrocytes including mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the precise mechanisms of how this affects chondrocyte homeostasis and whether such processes can be explored as therapeutic targets for osteoarthritis remain unclear. Here, we show that impaired mitochondrial function and disrupted cartilage matrix metabolism due to loss of mitofusin-2 (MFN2) expression in chondrocytes leads to the development of osteoarthritis. Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), a key regulator of mitochondrial function, plays a critical role in modulating MFN2 to restore mitochondrial dynamics, reduce fragmentation, and preserve mitochondrial function in chondrocytes. Specifically, SIRT3 directly deacetylates and indirectly deubiquitinates MFN2, preventing its degradation. MFN2-mediated mitochondrial–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions support cellular homeostasis, alleviate ER stress, and maintain mitochondrial calcium ion balance, which collectively mitigate chondrocyte senescence. Extracellular vesicles engineered with MFN2 mRNA effectively prevented cartilage degeneration and restored mobility in osteoarthritic mice. These findings suggest that targeting MFN2 is a promising strategy to prevent cartilage degeneration and alleviate progression of osteoarthritis.",

In this study, through integrated transcriptome profiling and systematic phenotyping of mutants in several thermosensory pathways, we identified HsfA1 as a positive regulator of heat priming–enhanced blast resistance in rice. Systematic analysis of microRNA (miRNA) dynamics, bioinformatics prediction, and RNA pull-down experiments revealed that miR444b.2 , a temperature-responsive miRNA, directly suppresses the expression of HsfA1 by targeting the second exon of HsfA1 messenger RNA (mRNA). Genetic analyses demonstrated that heat stress–mediated suppression of miR444b.2 expression relieves the repression of HsfA1 , thereby enhancing blast resistance in rice. Furthermore, HsfA1 directly binds to the promoter of AOC1 , a key jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis gene, to activate its expression. Knockout of HsfA1 or AOC1 abolishes heat priming–enhanced JA accumulation and blast disease resistance, and the phenotypes are largely restored via AOC1 overexpression and MeJA treatment. Further identification of HsfA1 natural variants and generation of the HsfA1 uORF -edited lines with improved blast resistance offer potential strategies for breeding disease-resistant rice varieties. This study elucidates the miR444b.2 –HsfA1– AOC1 module that links thermal sensing to JA-mediated blast resistance, providing a molecular blueprint for engineering climate-resilient crops with concurrent biotic–abiotic stress tolerance.",

The first and rate-limiting step in this pathway is catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs), with microsomal GPAT3 and GPAT4 being evolutionarily conserved and predominant in most tissues. While previous studies have implicated Calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1) as a cofactor for GPAT4, the broader role of CHP1 in regulating microsomal GPATs and TAG biosynthesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CHP1 is a critical regulator of both GPAT3 and GPAT4, essential for their stability, enzymatic activity, and lipid droplet (LD) localization. Structural modeling and mutational analyses identified key hydrophobic interfaces mediating the CHP1–GPAT interaction, which are required for optimal GPAT activity and LD growth. Loss of CHP1 impairs LD expansion and disrupts the localization of GPAT3/4 and downstream enzymes in the TAG synthesis pathway, including 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3 (AGPAT3) and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). Mechanistically, CHP1 helps circumvent seipin-mediated restriction of late LD-targeting enzymes, facilitating their access to mature LDs. Together, our findings reveal CHP1 as a dual-function regulator that stabilizes and activates microsomal GPATs while enabling the coordinated recruitment of TAG biosynthetic enzymes to LDs. This work uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating LD growth and glycerolipid metabolism, with broad implications for lipid homeostasis and metabolic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Membrane active peptides (MAPs) represent a diverse group of agents that disrupt the integrity of lipid membranes. One class of MAPs, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), destroy bacteria by transiently porating the bacterial membrane causing leakage of cellular contents. Transient leakage is classified as “graded,” where all vesicles in a population leak partially, or “all-or-none,” where some vesicles leak completely. However, the molecular interactions underlying transient leakage have eluded experimental determination. Here, dye leakage experiments with the AMP piscidin 1 (P1) show that graded leakage can be converted to all-or-none by simply adding a defect-promoting lysophospholipid. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that area stress arising from membrane asymmetry decreases the energy of pore formation and is highly lipid dependent. Furthermore, lipids and peptides translocate the bilayer through these pores, leading to area-relaxed states where poration is highly unfavorable. Even pores too small to leak dye relieve area stress; they are the “none” component of all-or-none release. These observations lead to development of a quantitative model where graded and all-or-none leakage are treated as a continuum explained by a single mechanism that accounts for the local peptide concentration and probabilities of different pore sizes. This unified model accurately reproduces the P1 dye leakage data and provides an explanation for varying pore energy, size, and probability within the framework of asymmetry-driven poration. This model is expected to be applicable to other MAPs, including cell-penetrating peptides, and could provide a framework for designing peptides with greater cellular specificity, a long-sought outcome.",

Its response to osmotic stress shares similarities with the function of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. In this study, we show that Yoda1, a Piezo1 agonist, activates WNK1 downstream kinase targets oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OSR1) and STE20/SPS1-related serine, proline-, and alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) in endothelial cells within minutes. Ionophore-induced Ca 2+ influx similarly triggers their activation. Comparable responses were observed in HDMEC, HUVEC, A549, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa cells. Hypotonic stress also enhances SPAK and OSR1 phosphorylation, which is attenuated by WNK1 inhibition or Piezo1 knockdown, whereas hypertonic stress-induced phosphorylation is not affected by Piezo1 knockdown. Chelating Ca 2+ or depleting intracellular stores prevents their activation, while increasing intracellular Ca 2+ via the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger or thapsigargin enhances it. ER-released Ca 2+ is sufficient to activate SPAK and OSR1 even in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+ , and this effect is diminished by Piezo1 knockdown. Both Yoda1 and ionomycin promote phosphorylation of WNK1 at serine 382, a modification that increases its catalytic activity.

          "abstract": "With rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there has been an increasing application of LLMs in creative content ideation and generation. A critical question emerges: can current LLMs provide ideas that are diverse enough to truly bolster collective creativity? We examine two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui Generis score, an automatic metric that measures the uniqueness of a plot element among alternative storylines generated using the same prompt under an LLM. Evaluating on 100 short stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations and across different LLMs, while plots from the original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces. Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on human judgment.",

          "abstract": "Cavitation, the formation of vapor bubbles as the liquid pressure is reduced below the saturated vapor pressure, often requires a substantial negative relative pressure in a pure liquid. Classical nucleation theory (CNT) provides an estimate for the rate of cavitation but there is often a disconnect between the predictions at the molecular scale compared to observations at the macroscale. We report on mesoscale simulations of cavitation based on many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD), a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD), which bridges the two scales. A liquid layer is confined between smooth planar walls at a constant temperature, while the pressure is reduced slowly by expanding the wall-bounded domain. The wetting properties of the liquid are determined by the parameters of the interaction potentials. With hydrophilic walls, homogeneous nucleation is observed in the liquid bulk. As a bubble forms and grows, it creates a strong pressure pulse and oscillations that cause other bubbles that may have formed slightly later to collapse. For a nearly neutral wall with a contact angle close to 90 ° , heterogeneous nucleation occurs at the walls at a smaller negative pressure and generates weaker pressure oscillations. With hydrophobic walls or seed particles, heterogeneous nucleation readily occurs, where fluctuations and the merger of transient surface bubbles are significant.",

In the present study, we demonstrate that dormant breast cancer cells lodged in the lungs reside in a highly mesenchymal, nonproliferative phenotypic state. The awakening of these cells is not triggered by a cancer cell-autonomous process. Instead, lung inflammation induced by the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin effectively awakens dormant cancer cells, providing useful models for studying metastatic awakening. Mechanistically, the awakened cells shift from a highly mesenchymal to a quasi-mesenchymal phenotypic state in which they acquire tumorigenicity and proliferative ability. Once awakened, these cells can stably reside in this quasi-mesenchymal state and maintain their tumor-initiating ability, doing so without ongoing heterotypic signaling from the lung microenvironment. Epidermal growth factor receptor ligands released by the cells of the injured tissue microenvironment, including notably M2 type macrophages, promote dormant cancer cells to move toward this quasi-mesenchymal state, a transition that is critical for the awakening process. An understanding of the mechanisms of metastatic awakening may lead in the future to treatment strategies designed to prevent such awakening and resulting metastatic relapse.",

The transient regenerative cellular state that discriminates between missing-tissue and non-missing-tissue injuries remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we identified a homolog of Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), named pdgf-like ( pdgfl ), in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea . This gene exhibits inducible expression following missing-tissue injury in a back-and-forth manner between myosin + muscular cells and piwi-1 + stem cells. The dynamic expression of pdgfl is induced through the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) signaling over short distances. Suppression of pdgfl expression impairs the regrowth of essential structures, including the intestine and central nervous system. Evidence on the decrease of notum and sfrp-1 at the anterior pole, together with the accumulation of myoD + PIWI-1 + progenitors, suggests a role of pdgfl in pole muscular cell differentiation. These findings highlight the significant impact of pdgfl in orchestrating the behavior of specific cell types by the regional specificity of this gene expression.",

The SV2A-BRV-UCB1244283 structure reveals how UCB1244283 allosterically enhances BRV binding by occupying an allosteric site near the primary binding site, preventing BRV dissociation. This allosteric site, formed by hydrophobic and uncharged residues, is an uncharacterized small-molecule binding site in SV2A. Structural analysis and mutagenesis demonstrate that an allosteric network between the primary and allosteric sites governs high-affinity ASM binding. Our studies suggest that UCB1244283 selectively binds SV2A over SV2B and SV2C, with specific mutations disrupting binding. Structures of SV2A-UCB-J and SV2A-UCB7361 show that UCB1244283 binding is only possible when the primary site ligand does not overlap with the allosteric site, and that repositioning of Ser601, Thr605, and Leu655 is critical for allosteric ligand binding. Structural comparison of multiple SV2A complexes reveals that primary site occupancy shapes the conformation of the lumenal half of the transmembrane domain, influencing how UCB1244283 binds via a connected network that differentially stabilizes TM1 in either an open or closed conformation and repositions key allosteric and primary site residues. These insights provide a foundation for developing therapeutics targeting the allosteric site and modulating SV2A function.",

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in metastatic progression, yet their molecular diversity and upstream regulators remain poorly defined. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), overexpressed in subsets of tumors including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), is implicated in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified GPNMB as a marker of immunosuppressive TAMs associated with poor prognosis, but its mechanistic role in TNBC has remained unclear. Coculturing monocytic cells with three-dimensional TNBC spheres induced GPNMB + TAMs expressing sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 9 (Siglec-9). Tumor-expressed GPNMB promotes monocyte-to-TAM polarization by inducing secondary GPNMB expression in monocytes, establishing a feed-forward amplification loop. GPNMB knockdown in TNBC cells inhibited immunosuppressive TAM subsets, including Siglec-9 + and EMT-associated populations, as determined by deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data using a custom TAM signature matrix derived from publicly available TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. TNBC-derived GPNMB carried α2,3-sialylation, whereas macrophage-derived GPNMB carried α2,6-sialylation, enabling differential Siglec-9 recognition. Elevated GPNMB and Siglec-9 correlated with poor prognosis in TNBCcohorts. Importantly, dual inhibition of Siglec-E (murine Siglec-9 ortholog) and PD-1 reduced tumor stemness, suppressed IL-6-dependent EMT, and limited lung metastasis in vivo. The GPNMB–Siglec-9 axis thus represents a critical glyco-immunological checkpoint driving TAM-mediated metastasis, providing a promising therapeutic target in TNBC.",

          "abstract": "Human learning embodies a striking duality: Sometimes, we can rapidly infer and compose logical rules, benefiting from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly conflicting behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems—one for rapid, rule-based inferences (e.g., in working memory) and another for slow, incremental adaptation (e.g., in long-term and procedural memory). It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of in-context learning (ICL)—the ability to flexibly infer the structure of a new task from a few examples. In contrast to standard in-weight learning (IWL), which is analogous to synaptic change, ICL is more naturally linked to activation-based dynamics thought to underlie working memory in humans. Here, we show that the interplay between ICL and IWL naturally ties together a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, including curriculum effects on category-learning tasks, compositionality, and a trade-off between flexibility and retention in brain and behavior. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering an integrative perspective on dual-process theories of human cognition.",

          "abstract": "While it has been appreciated for decades that lysosomes can import cysteine, its significance for whole-organism physiology has remained uncertain. Recent work identified MFSD12 as a transmembrane protein required for cysteine import into lysosomes (and melanosomes), enabling genetic interrogation of this pathway. Here, we show that Mfsd12 knockout mice die between embryonic days 10.5 and 12.5, indicating that MFSD12 is essential for organogenesis. Mfsd12 loss results in the expression of genes involved in cellular stress and thiol metabolism and likely disproportionately affects the erythroid, myeloid, and neuronal lineages. Within lysosomes, imported cysteine is largely oxidized to cystine, which is exported to the cytosol by the cystinosin (CTNS) transporter. However, unlike Mfsd12 , loss of Ctns is compatible with viability, suggesting that the essential role of MFSD12 lies not in supplying cystine to the cytosol, but in providing reduced cysteine within the lysosomal lumen. Supporting this model, maternal treatment with cysteamine—a lysosome-penetrant thiol—rescued the development of Mfsd12 knockout embryos, yielding viable adult offspring. These findings establish lysosomal thiol import as a critical metabolic pathway and provide genetic tools to further clarify its physiological and biochemical roles.",

Here, we report a solution by demonstrating a reconfigurable current with arbitrary shape to engineer microwave and DC magnetic field at microscale. A “photothermal doping” method was proposed to optically control local insulator-to-metal transition in vanadium dioxide.

This wind speed is typically the largest uncertainty in derived emission rates. It is often, by necessity, inferred from coarse-resolution meteorological reanalysis products which do not match the spatial or temporal extent of wind experienced by the gas plume. Here, we circumvent this problem by simultaneously measuring plume velocity using the same spectrometer that maps the methane plume. Our approach acquires multiple consecutive views of the same point source, with visual tracking of the plume’s features to estimate its ground velocity. This resolves the representational mismatch between reanalysis and effective wind speeds. It provides data with exact spatiotemporal coincidence to the plume being measured.

However, conventional approaches typically rely on fluorescence detection of single-enzyme reactions, which limits molecular selectivity and the ability to analyze multiple targets simultaneously. To address these limitations, we developed a digital bioanalysis platform based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy and microchamber arrays decorated with silver nanoparticles. This platform achieves a million-fold amplification of Raman signals from products generated by single-enzyme reactions, enabling precise digital counting of enzyme biomarkers with high molecular selectivity and multiplexing capability. We applied this platform to detect and distinguish two closely related enzyme biomarkers, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase. By leveraging the sharp and distinct Raman spectral signatures of the reaction products, the platform achieved multiplexed biomarker quantification with femtomolar-level sensitivity. As a proof-of-concept, the platform successfully quantified AChE in human cerebrospinal fluid within 8.5 min, highlighting its potential utility in clinical diagnostics, particularly for differentiating types of dementia based on subtle differences in enzyme levels. Hence, this study presents a valuable alternative to fluorescence-based digital bioanalysis by offering enhanced molecular selectivity and multiplexing capability.

Borrowing from observations of innate immune proteins, we found that resurfacing nanobodies with positively charged residues enabled them to bind and perturb the gram-negative outer membrane, but this alone was not sufficient for toxic activity. However, when we resurface our lipid A-targeting nanobody, it gained the ability to disrupt the outer membrane and enact its antibacterial function against wild-type bacteria.

          "abstract": "The discovery of paleo-meanders on Mars and debates about the occurrence of meandering on prevegetation early Earth have stimulated field studies of channel morphology and deposit stratigraphy in arid environments. They show that mud can provide the cohesive strength to retard outer bank erosion, enabling inner bank lateral accretion (including mud deposition) to keep pace and thus sustain meandering. The process by which mud is deposited in the lateral accretion deposits, however, is poorly known. Building on previous fieldwork in the muddy meandering Quinn River, we use Delft3D and the Partheniades–Krone model for cohesive sediment transport to predict erosion and deposition patterns in a 2,300 m long reach. While flocculation of mud increases the settling velocity and hence the likelihood of deposition, the standard metric for distinguishing washload from suspended load, (i.e. settling velocity to shear velocity ratio), does not indicate relative deposition rate. Mud deposition is driven by the product of settling velocity times basal concentration: w s c b . Relatively low w s but high c b can induce deposition. We show that with sufficiently high basal concentrations, significant net lateral accretion deposition occurs in areas where elevated flocculation settling velocities are &gt; 100 times lower than the local shear velocity. Observed grain size distributions of lateral accretion deposits are predicted. Just by introducing a period of elevated mud load with no change in discharge creates a distinct muddy interbed. Our model points to multiple ways lateral accretion deposits can vary sedimentologically, including creating mud-sand couplets, and lead to single thread, active meandering channels in muddy rivers.",

However, there is a shortage of molecular tools that enable the discovery of potential drug targets within schistosomes. Thus, praziquantel has remained the frontline treatment for schistosomiasis despite known liabilities. Here, we have conducted a genome-wide study in Schistosoma mansoni using the human druggable genome as a bioinformatic template to identify essential genes within schistosomes bearing similarity to catalogued drug targets. Then, we assessed these candidate targets in silico using a set of unbiased criteria to determine which possess ideal characteristics for a ready-made drug discovery campaign. Following this prioritization, we pursued a parasite p97 ortholog as a bona-fide drug target for the development of therapeutics to treat schistosomiasis. From this effort, we identified a covalent inhibitor series that kills schistosomes through an on-target killing mechanism by disrupting the ubiquitin proteasome system. Fascinatingly, these inhibitors induce a conformational change in the conserved D2 domain P-loop of schistosome p97 upon modification of Cys519. This conformational change reveals an allosteric binding site adjacent to the D2 domain active site reminiscent of the “DFG” flip in protein kinases. This allosteric binding site can potentially be utilized to generate new classes of species-selective p97 inhibitors. Furthermore, these studies provide a resource for the development of alternative therapeutics for schistosomiasis and a workflow to identify potential drug targets in similar systems with few available molecular tools.",

The results of this study highlight the role of aqueous Fe in generating H 2 and magnetite and have far-reaching implications for carbon speciation and solubility in deep fluids and for endogenic abiotic synthesis, which may be pivotal in the prebiotic occurrence of organic compounds on Earth.",

          "abstract": "The tendency to repeat past choices more often than expected from the history of outcomes has been repeatedly empirically observed in reinforcement learning experiments. It can be explained by at least two computational processes: asymmetric update and (gradual) choice perseveration. A recent meta-analysis showed that both mechanisms are detectable in human reinforcement learning. However, while their descriptive value seems to be well established, they have not been compared regarding their possible adaptive value. In this study, we address this gap by simulating reinforcement learning agents in a variety of environments with a variant of an evolutionary algorithm. Our results show that positivity bias (in the form of asymmetric update) is evolutionary stable in many situations, while the emergence of gradual perseveration is less systematic and robust. Overall, our results illustrate that biases can be adaptive and selected by evolution, in an environment-specific manner.",

However, the potential has not yet been realized, with few claims of quantum advantage and high resource estimates, especially due to the need for optimization in the presence of noise. Finding algorithms and methods to improve convergence is important to accelerate the capabilities of near-term hardware for variational quantum eigensolver or more broad applications of hybrid methods in which optimization is required. To this goal, we look to use modern approaches developed in circuit simulations and stochastic classical optimization, which can be combined to form a surrogate optimization approach to quantum circuits. Using an approximate (classical central processing unit/graphical processing unit) state vector simulator as a surrogate model, we efficiently calculate an approximate Hessian, which is passed as input for a quantum processing unit or exact circuit simulator. This method will lend itself well to parallelization across quantum processing units. We demonstrate the capabilities of such an approach with and without sampling noise and a proof-of-principle demonstration on a quantum processing unit utilizing 40 qubits.",

          "abstract": "Environmental stimuli, including the exposure to ultraviolet (UV)-B light, are known to play a role in the modulation of immune-mediated mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS). In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we have shown that UV-B irradiation ameliorates disease outcome by regulatory T cells (Treg) expansion. Moreover, the UV-B-mediated induction of Treg numbers was also observed in MS. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) can be activated by environmental factors including UV-B-induced photoproducts of tryptophan. Thus, we investigated the role of AhR during the transmission of UV-B irradiation. Therefore, wild-type (WT) and AhR-deficient mice (AhR –/– ) were irradiated with UV-B light and immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-peptide. In WT mice it was shown that UV-B irradiation reduces EAE symptoms by Treg expansion. This effect was abrogated in animals with AhR deficiency. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of AhR regulation, we used mice with a deletion of AhR specifically in different subsets of antigen-presenting cells (APC) that have been shown to mediate the expansion of Treg. Interestingly, we could show that the AhR activation in murine cutaneous APC was sufficient to switch APC from a stimulatory into a regulatory phenotype, and moreover, responsible for APC cell maturation and migration into regional lymph nodes. Thus, our data indicate that AhR activation in APC might be required for UV-B-mediated immunosuppression during MOG-induced EAE. Hence, activation of AHR in tissue-resident APC, potentially by low-dose UV-B irradiation, might be beneficial as an adjuvant treatment in inflammatory or degenerative diseases of the central nervous system.",

          "abstract": "The niche is a key concept that unifies ecology and evolutionary biology. However, empirical and theoretical treatments of the niche are mostly performed at the species level, neglecting individuals as important units of ecological and evolutionary processes. So far, a formal mathematical link between individual-level niches and higher organismal-level niches has been lacking, hampering the unification of ecological theories and more accurate forecasts of biodiversity change. To fill in this gap, we propose a bottom–up approach to derive population and higher organismal-level niches from individual niches. We demonstrate the power of our framework by showing that 1) the statistical properties of higher organismal-level niches (e.g., niche breadth, skewness, etc.) can be partitioned into individual contributions and 2) the species-level niche shifts can be estimated by tracing the responses of individuals. By using individual-level GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking data from three different species, we show that climate change could have contrasting consequences on population-level niche shift depending on individual niche compositions. Our method paves the way for a unifying niche theory and enables mechanistic assessments of organism–environment relationships across organismal scales.",

          "abstract": "Macrophages often pervade solid tumors, and clusters of macrophages sometimes associate with longer survival of patients. However, clustering mechanisms and impacts on key functions such as phagocytosis remain obscure. Here, under conditions that maximize cancer cell phagocytosis within cohesive tumors, we uncover pathways that favor dynamic clusters and find a colocalization of tumor-intrusive pseudopodia which we term “intrudopodia.” Cluster formation over hours on low-adhesion substrates occurs after macrophage induction to a state colloquially referred to as M1 after exposure to interferons and T cell–derived cytokines. Clusters prove fluid on timescales of minutes and also sort from interleukin-4-treated, so-called M2 macrophages that tend to disperse. M1 macrophages upregulate specific cell–cell adhesion receptors but suppress actomyosin contractility, with both pathways contributing to cluster formation. Decreased cortical tension was not only reflected in a low level of nuclear lamin-A that downregulates cytoskeletal targets of serum response factor and tends to soften the nucleus but was also predicted to unleash pseudopodia. Macrophage neighbors in tumor spheroids indeed coextend intrudopodia between cancer cell junctions—at least when phagocytosis conditions are maximized. Intrudopodia from neighbors help detach and individualize cancer cells for rapid engulfment. Juxtaposition of a macrophage cluster with tumor cell nests defines a broad interface that minimizes cancer cell nearest neighbor interactions and maximizes coordination of macrophage intrudopodia. Cooperative phagocytosis thus overcomes solid tumor cohesion—and might explain why the macrophage clustering factor ITGAL associates with patient survival.",

These two giant silver nanoclusters are metallic in nature, as confirmed by their plasmonic absorption and pump-power–dependent excited-state dynamics.

          "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells have evolved sophisticated quality control mechanisms to eliminate aggregation-prone proteins that compromise cellular health. Central to this defense is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where UBR4 acts as an essential E4 ubiquitin ligase, amplifying degradation marks on defective proteins. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis of UBR4 in complex with its cofactors KCMF1 and CALM1 reveals a massive 1.3-megadalton ring structure, featuring a central substrate-binding arena and flexibly attached catalytic units. Our structure shows how UBR4 binds substrate and extends lysine-48–specific ubiquitin chains. Efficient substrate targeting depends on both preubiquitination and specific N-degrons, with KCMF1 acting as a key substrate filter. The architecture of the E4 megacomplex is conserved across eukaryotes, but species-specific adaptations allow UBR4 to perform its precisely tuned quality control function in diverse cellular environments.",

          "abstract": "Although momentum is building to restore bison across North America, most efforts focus on small, managed herds, leaving unclear how large, migrating herds shape landscapes and whether their effects enhance or degrade ecosystems. We assessed carbon and nitrogen dynamics across the northern Yellowstone ecosystem, where one of the last remaining large migratory populations resides. Bison stabilized net aboveground production while accelerating nitrogen turnover, increasing aboveground nitrogen pools while carbon pools remained stable, which improved landscape nutritional quality. Effects were strongest in wet, nutrient-rich habitats that received higher bison densities and grazing than is recommended in rangeland management, while soil and plant conditions suggested landscape resilience. Restoration should embrace heterogeneity in densities and effects across habitats and spatial scales beyond those guiding most current recovery efforts.",

          "abstract": "Industrial chemicals and untreated sewage have polluted the Tijuana River for decades, recently causing &gt;1300 consecutive days of California beach closures. In summer 2024, wastewater flows surged to millions of gallons per day despite no rain, enhancing water-to-air transfer of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and other toxic gases at a turbulent hotspot. High wastewater flows and low winds led to nighttime H 2 S peaks, reaching 4500 parts per billion (ppb)—exceeding typical urban levels of &lt;1 ppb. H 2 S levels and community malodor reports were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient r = 0.92), validating long-dismissed community voices and highlighting an environmental injustice. This study demonstrates that poor water quality can substantially affect air quality—although rarely included in air quality models and health assessments—with far-reaching implications as polluted waterways increase globally.",

However, the suite of biological traits that reshaped horses during domestication remains unclear. We scanned an extensive horse genome time series for selection signatures at 266 markers associated with key traits. We detected a signature of positive selection at ZFPM1 —known to be a modulator of behavior in mice—occurring ~5000 years ago (ya), suggesting that taming was one of the earliest steps toward domestication of horses. Intensive selection at GSDMC began ~4750 ya with the domestication bottleneck, leading regulatory variants to high frequency by ~4150 ya. GSDMC genotypes are linked to body conformation in horses and to spinal anatomy, motor coordination, and muscular strength in mice. Our results suggest that selection on standing variation at GSDMC was crucial for the emergence of horses that could facilitate fast mobility in human societies ~4200 ya.",

We used a multiomics comparison of the transcriptomes of ciliated and unciliated embryonic cells to identify TFs up-regulated in ciliated cells. We also used conditional genetics in mouse embryos and stem cells and found that the TFs SP5 and SP8 regulate cilia formation and gene expression. In embryos lacking Sp5 and Sp8 , primary and motile cilia were shorter than normal and reduced in number across cell types, contributing to situs inversus and hydrocephalus. Moreover, expression of SP8 was sufficient to induce primary cilia in unciliated cells. This work will facilitate the study of cilia assembly using stem cell models and promote further understanding of human ciliopathies.",

However, global mitigation from forestation remains uncertain owing to varying estimates of carbon sequestration rates (notably in soil) and land availability. In this study, we developed global maps of soil carbon change that reveal carbon gains and losses with forestation, primarily in the topsoil. Constraining land availability to avoid unintended albedo-induced warming and safeguard water and biodiversity (389 million hectares available for forestation globally) would sequester 39.9 petagrams of carbon by 2050, substantially below previous estimates. This estimate drops to 12.5 petagrams of carbon with land further limited to existing policy commitments (120 million hectares). Achieving greater mitigation requires expanding dedicated forestation areas and strengthening commitments from nations with considerable but untapped potential.",

Here, we showed that tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR, a hypoxia-induced tDR derived from the 3′ end of tRNA-Asp-GTC, activated autophagic flux in kidney cells and its silencing blocked autophagic flux. Functional gain-/loss-of-function studies in murine kidney disease models demonstrated a substantial renoprotective function of tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR. Mechanistically, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR assembled stable G-quadruplex structures and sequestered pseudouridine synthase 7 (PUS7), preventing catalytic pseudouridylation of histone mRNAs. The resulting pseudouridylation deficiency directed histone mRNAs to the autophagosome-lysosome pathway, triggering RNA autophagy. This tDR-induced RNA autophagy pathway was activated during murine and human kidney diseases, suggesting clinical relevance. Thus, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR plays a role in regulating RNA autophagy, which helps to maintain homeostasis in kidney cells and protects against kidney injury.",

          "abstract": "A primary axiom in geoscience is that the evolution of plants drove global changes in river dynamics. Notably, the apparent sinuosity of rivers, derived from the variance of sediment accretion direction measured in rocks, substantially increased when land plants evolved, around 425 million years ago. This led to the hypothesis that the rise of vegetation triggered river meandering. Recent studies of barren, meandering rivers challenge this notion, but the Paleozoic shift in the geometry of river deposits remains unexplained. Here, we suggest that it occurred because vegetation changes how river bends move through space. Using satellite images to monitor river migration, we found that bank vegetation alters the orientation of point bar accretion, resulting in a 62% increase in the inferred variance of flow direction. These results explain why meandering rivers have been underrecognized in prevegetation stratigraphy.",

          "abstract": "We investigate how to counter misinformation about voter and election fraud using data from the US and Brazil. Our study first compares two types of messages countering claims of widespread fraud: (i) retrospective corrections from credible sources speaking against interest and (ii) prebunking messages that prospectively warn of false claims about future elections and provide information about election security practices. In the US, each approach immediately increased election confidence and reduced fraud beliefs, with prebunking showing somewhat more durable effects. In Brazil, prebunking had positive immediate effects across measured outcomes, whereas those of the credible source corrections were less consistent. We then conducted an experiment in the US randomizing exposure to a persuasion forewarning before election security information is provided. Prebunking again increased confidence and decreased fraud beliefs but only when the forewarning was omitted, suggesting that novel factual information is responsible for the observed effects of the prebunking treatment.",

          "abstract": "When speakers of different languages are in contact, they often borrow features like sounds, words, or syntactic patterns from one language to the other. However, the lack of historical data has hampered estimation of this effect at a global scale. We overcome this hurdle by using genetic admixture and shared geohistorical location as a proxy for population contact. We find that language pairs whose speaker populations underwent genetic admixture or that are located in the same geohistorical area exhibit notable similar increases in shared linguistic patterns across world regions and different demographic relationships, suggesting a consistent trend in borrowing rates. At the same time, the effect varies strongly across specific linguistic features. This variation is only partly explained by cognitive differences in lifelong learnability and by social functions of signaling assimilation through borrowing, leaving much randomness in which specific features are borrowed. Additionally, we find that, for some features, admixture decreases sharing, likely reflecting signals of divergence (schismogenesis) under contact.",

          "abstract": "Artists are rapidly integrating generative text-to-image models into their workflows, yet how this affects creative discovery remains unclear. Leveraging large-scale data from an online art platform, we compare artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted creators to matched nonadopters to assess novel idea contributions. Initially, a concentrated subset of AI-assisted creators contributes more novel artifacts in absolute terms through increased output—the productivity effect—although the average rate of contributing novel artifacts decreases because of a dilution effect. This reflects a shift toward high-volume, incremental exploration, ultimately yielding a greater aggregate of novel artifacts by AI-assisted creators. We observe no evidence of a human-AI effect above and beyond the productivity effect. The release of open-source Stable Diffusion accelerates novel contributions across a more diverse group, suggesting that text-to-image tools facilitate exploration at scale, initially enabling persistent breakthroughs by select “masterminds,” driven by increased volume, and subsequently enabling widespread novel contributions from a “hive mind.”",

          "abstract": "Calcium is a critical regulator of Staphylococcus aureus skin adhesion, stabilizing one of the strongest noncovalent biomolecular interactions ever recorded. Using in vitro and in silico single-molecule force spectroscopy, we demonstrate that calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) are essential for the ultrastrong binding between the serine-aspartate repeat protein D (SdrD) adhesin and the human skin protein desmoglein-1 (DSG-1), withstanding forces exceeding 2 nanonewtons. Ca 2+ ions stabilize both the SdrD complex and the mechanically robust SdrD B-domains, which exhibit unprecedented folding strength. In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), disrupted calcium gradients amplify SdrD interactions, which could potentially intensify S. aureus virulence. Furthermore, abnormal DSG-1 distribution on AD-affected skin enhances bacterial adhesion. These findings provide crucial insights into the calcium-dependent regulation of bacterial adhesion and folding, suggesting possible therapeutic targets to combat S. aureus infections.",

          "abstract": "Ferroelectricity in BaTiO 3 was observed nearly 80 years ago, but the mechanism underlying its ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition remains elusive. The order-disorder transition has been recognized as playing a critical role; however, the precise nature of the order parameter still remains under scrutiny, including the local dipole direction and the correlations above and below the Curie temperature. Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO 3 across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into an order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions. The displacements align along &lt;111&gt; direction in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition emerges from real-space correlations of the &lt;111&gt; polar Ti displacements.

It is accepted that most STAT3 variants causing AD-HIES are dominant negative. Whether haploinsufficient mutations cause a phenotype in humans is still debated. We report on a family with a heterozygous STAT3 nonsense mutation that led to rapid decay of the mutant mRNA and protein, leading to haploinsufficiency. To explore STAT3 heterozygosity, we created a Stat3 haploinsufficient ( Stat3 +/− ) mouse model in which we found that Stat3 +/− mice had increased IgE serum levels, reduced T H 17 cell differentiation, and were susceptible to a cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus infection. Together, our findings provide mechanistic evidence for the impact of haploinsufficiency in STAT3 with residual protein expression as an important cause for immune deficiency. The implications extend to the diagnosis of immunodeficiency disorders and to the design of gene therapy in situations where gene dosage matters.",

The patch-form sensor maintains conformal contact with the skin, regardless of body motion or deformation. It provides continuous, depth-sensitive estimation of subcutaneous tissue stiffness through real-time surface wave dispersion analysis. Theoretical and experimental investigations on phantom materials and tissues spanning a wide range of Young’s modulus (in kilopascals to megapascals) demonstrate the capability of the device to rapidly and robustly evaluate the stiffness at depths up to several centimeters. The device shows compatibility with various tissue models, with results consistent with in-parallel ultrasound elastography measurements. Deployment of the device during exercises confirms its viability for ambulatory monitoring, enabling continuous assessment of variation in tissue stiffness.",

In this study, we examined path integration performance in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a group at increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease, and healthy controls using an immersive virtual reality task. We developed a Bayesian computational model to decompose path integration errors into distinct components. SCD participants exhibited significantly higher path integration error, primarily driven by increased memory leak, while other modeling-derived error sources, such as velocity gain, sensory, and reporting noise, remained comparable across groups. Our findings suggest that path integration deficits, specifically memory leak, may serve as an early marker of neurodegeneration in SCD and highlight the potential of self-motion–based navigation tasks for detecting presymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease–related cognitive changes.",

Here, we mapped the chromatin contacts along nuclear radial axis and built radial score by factoring in contact frequencies. The chromatin high-order structures exhibit rich diversity along radial axis. Furthermore, the proximal trans contacts retrieved by radial score reveal conserved active/inactive chromatin segregation across intra- and interchromosomal interactions. Ablation of CTCF proteins disrupts chromatin loops with mild changes to chromatin radial positioning. By acutely perturbing multiple transcription factor (TF) occupancy, chromatin loop dissolutions are often accompanied by radial dissociations between two anchors. Our work provides a genome architecture reference map adhering to nuclear physical axis and suggests that multiple architectural TFs collectively shape nuclear positioning of chromatin and their contacts, with contacts serving as forces on chromatin positioning as well.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal death in stroke and other conditions stems in part from stimulation of N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors. This induces neuronal production of both nitric oxide and superoxide, which together induce oxidative cell injury. Nitric oxide can readily cross lipid membranes, but superoxide, being an anion, cannot. Using primary neuronal cultures, we show that superoxide enters neurons through volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs). Oxidative injury produced by either exogenous superoxide or NMDA receptor stimulation is prevented by the VRAC inhibitor [4-(2-butyl-6,7-dichlor-2-cyclopentylindan-1-on-5-yl)oxybutyric acid] (DCPIB) and by disruption of the essential VRAC subunit, leucine-rich repeat–containing 8A (LRRC8A). In mouse cortex, neuronal oxidative injury induced by either NMDA or transient ischemia is likewise blocked by both DCPIB and LRRC8A disruption. Selective expression of LRRC8A/C and LRRC8A/D but not LRRC8A/D subunits conferred superoxide conductance in HeLa cells. Superoxide entry through VRACs is thus a requisite step in excitotoxic neuronal injury, and interventions affecting VRAC subunit composition, localization, or opening could influence neuronal survival.",

Here, spatial programming of stiffness variation in the azobenzene-functionalized liquid-crystalline polymer (Azo-LCP) addresses this limitation and achieves efficient photomechanical jumping. Introduction of stiffness mismatch induced localized curvature, which preserved the initial curvature and simultaneously enhanced photomechanical strain responsivity. By programming for symmetry of stiffness variation, we achieved directional or vertical jumping via strategic placement of the rigid region, with corresponding stress accumulation behaviors corroborated by finite element simulations. Integration of patterned stiffness variation with geometric asymmetry enabled both vertical and horizontal jumping within a single structure, without compromising performance. This dual-mode jumper also demonstrated sequential and consecutive jumps under continuous light exposure.",

In addition, all four essential variants of bilinear π rotations—BIRD d , BIRD r , BIRD d , X , and BIRD r , X filters—were given for all cases studied. In the first step, adiabatic CHIRP-type and BUBI/BUBU pulses lead to improved robustness with respect to offset/detuning effects and variations in B 1 -field strengths.

Together with correspondingly optimized pulse shapes, we established fully coupling, offset, and B 1 -compensated bilinear π-rotation (COB-BIRD) elements and characterized them in theory and experiment. Overall, this demonstrated the use of the robust bilinear rotation capability on a partially aligned sample in a homodecoupled two-dimensional NMR experiment.",

Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified gene networks involved in cell cycle regulation, embryonic cell identity, and interferon response and revealed features of regulome components, such as susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition and the fine-tuning of TBXT downstream effectors through IGFBP3. Finally, we found high interferon signaling in chordoma cell lines and patient tumors, which was promoted by TBXT and associated with sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors.

Here, we describe the mechanism used by tularemia agent Francisella tularensis exploiting host mitochondrial anaplerosis. Shortly after internalization, Francisella associates with DC mitochondria, which leads to the rapid repurposing of their oxidative metabolism for production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Mitochondrial metabolic rewiring is orchestrated by the intramitochondrial signaling mediated by protein acetylation and involves switching to glutamate as the primary substrate for DC tricarboxylic acid cycle. Rather than killing the bacterium, glutamate-fueled mtROS production activates p38-dependent proinflammatory gene expression. Blocking of glutamate utilization prevents DC activation and bacterial dissemination and alleviates inflammation in vivo. Our findings underscore the importance of metabolic plasticity in antibacterial DC response and open up potential avenues for therapies targeting host metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Apical-basal polarity (ABP) establishment and maintenance is necessary for proper brain development, yet how it is controlled is unclear. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been previously implicated in ABP of epithelial cells, and, here, we find that it is apically expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) during neural induction. Gal-3 blockade disrupts ABP and alters the distribution of junctional proteins in hESC-derived neural rosettes and is rescued by addition of recombinant Gal-3. Transcriptomics analysis shows that blocking Gal-3 regulates expression of genes responsible for nervous system development and cell junction assembly, among others. Last, Gal-3 blockade during embryonic development in vivo reduces horizontal cell divisions, disturbs cortical layering of neural progenitors, and induces gyrification. These data uncover a regulatory mechanism for ABP in the brain and warrant caution in modulating Gal-3 during pregnancy.",

Differentiation therapy, aiming to mature CSCs and MDSCs, shows great promise. However, its efficacy is hindered by limited accessibility in hypoxic deep tumor regions. Inspired by the apoptotic body (ApoBD)–mediated deep tumor penetration, we design a pulsatile sequential drug release system with a core-shell structure. The reversible acid-responsive shell protonates and swells in lysosomes to release doxorubicin, inducing lysosomal escape and cell apoptosis. In ApoBDs, it deprotonates and contracts to prevent excessive drug release. After deep penetration via ApoBDs, the hypoxia-responsive core releases all-trans retinoic acid to reverse CSCs and MDSCs, overcoming chemoresistance and modulating the immuno-microenvironment. This strategy targets the heterogeneous distribution of CSCs and MDSCs in solid tumors, enhancing chemo-intervention and immune checkpoint blockade therapy while presenting encouraging potential for cascade deep tumor penetration and differentiation therapy.",

We quantify dynamic changes to northern terrestrial carbon stocks from the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years) until present at millennial time steps using a combination of paleo-data and climate-biome modeling. During the deglaciation, northern land carbon storage declined by &gt;300 petagrams of carbon with a minimum around 11,000 years, followed by progressively higher land carbon stocks during the Holocene. We find evidence that dynamic changes in terrestrial land carbon stocks were of a scale to exert large influence on atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and that postglacial terrestrial carbon stock dynamics were dominated by losses from permafrost-affected loess and gains into peatlands.",

Combining the structural advantage of polyethyleneimine and piperazine monomers, the separation layer had a large free volume, high-density homogeneity, well-tuned nanopores, and tailored charge distribution. The staged-regulated membrane exhibited high water permeance and could even adapt to ion separation in ultrahigh-salt solutions (Mg/Li = 50, 20,000 parts per million), with a notable Mg 2+ /Li + selectivity improvement of more than 1600% over that of the control, directly mixed dual aqueous monomer-prepared membrane.

However, excitonic absorption may dampen SHG. Here, we demonstrate tunable SHG enhancement using virtual coupling effects between quasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC) optical resonances and tunable excitons in high-index WS 2 metasurfaces with crescent meta-atoms. These metasurfaces promote a magnetic-type qBIC resonance, enabling control over nonlinear optical processes in the visible spectrum. The used qBIC resonance at half the exciton energy increases SHG efficiency by 98-fold compared to monolayer WS 2 and by four orders of magnitude relative to an unpatterned WS 2 film. The enhancement is tunable with temperature and incident light polarization, allowing the dynamic control of virtual coupling and SHG efficiency, thereby paving the way for next-generation reconfigurable metaoptics devices.",

While the role of these genes has been extensively studied in neurons, microglial functions such as phagocytosis are also dependent on cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that disturbance of actin cytoskeletal regulation in microglia, modeled by genetically impairing the scaffold protein Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which integrates actin-binding proteins, causes a shift in actin regulatory balance favoring filopodial versus lamellipodial actin organization. The resulting microglia-specific dysregulation of actin dynamics leads to excessive uptake of synaptic proteins. Genetically engineered DISC1-deficient mice show diminished hippocampal excitatory transmission and associated spatial memory deficits. Reintroducing wild-type microglia-like cells via bone marrow transplantation in adult DISC1-deficient mice restores the synaptic function of neurons and rescues cognitive performance. These findings reveal a pivotal role for microglial actin cytoskeletal remodeling in preserving synaptic integrity and cognitive health. Targeting microglial cytoskeletal dynamics may effectively address cognitive impairments associated with NDDs, even in adulthood.",

Using parylene C film for waterproofing and encapsulation, the ultrathin perovskite curved image sensor with the hierarchical mesh design is demonstrated, which conforms to spherical surfaces of different radii while maintaining mechanical stability during deformation. The image sensor exhibits low detection limit (10 nanowatts per square centimeter) and long-term stable dynamic photoresponse. Combining the image sensor with a tunable lens achieves clear images at different distances via simultaneously adjusting both sensor and lens radii.

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway repairs stalled replication forks (RFs) and prevents such instability. Through an E3 ubiquitin ligase screen aimed at identifying regulators of RAD51, we identified macrophage erythroblast attacher (MAEA), a core component of C-terminal to Lish (CTLH) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, as a regulator of the HR pathway. Loss of MAEA impairs RAD51 recruitment at stalled RFs, leading to increased sensitivity to RS-inducing agents and excessive degradation of nascent DNA strands. Mechanistically, MAEA associates with and mediates the ubiquitylation of Ku80, enabling its removal from RF ends and facilitating the loading of RAD51. Notably, MAEA deficiency is associated with a developmental disorder involving microcephaly, craniofacial abnormalities, ocular defects, and heart malformations. Functional assays show that disease-linked MAEA variants (R34C, E349G, Y394D, and M396R) are defective in RS response.

We lack a mechanistic understanding of how environmental changes reshape the resulting bimodal rest-activity pattern. Here, we uncover a seasonal switch mechanism that remodels the evening bout of activity. Under temperate summer-like conditions, levels of the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptide diminish, triggering a cascade. Lowered PDF receptor (PDFR) signaling disinhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3/SHAGGY to advance the evening output, and in parallel, weakens the siesta-promoting vc DN1p-SIF amide axis to expand the evening peak. Under these conditions, vc DN1p takes over the evening pacemaker role by exerting control over the dorsal lateral oscillator neurons. Our findings elucidate how environment-induced changes in PDFR signaling tip the balanced output of the clock network, aligning daily rhythms with seasonal time. Neuropeptide-driven parallel adjustment of clock circuitry and clock protein functioning likely represents a conserved strategy, enabling animals to adapt their daily behavior to seasonal changes.",

Although neurons in the macaque anterior temporal lobe (ATL) show invariance to face viewpoint, whether they also encode abstract representations of caller identity is not known. Here, we demonstrate that neurons in the voice-selective ATL of two macaques support invariant voice identity representations through dynamic population-level coding. These representations minimize neural distances across different vocalizations from the same individual while preserving distinct trajectories for different callers. This structure emerged from the coordinated activity of the broader neuronal ensemble, although a small subset of highly identity-selective neurons carried high identity information. Our findings provide a neural basis for voice identity recognition in primates and highlight the ATL as a key hub for integrating perceptual voice features into higher-level identity representations.",

Under opposing forces, kinetochores move bidirectionally along these walls while remaining near the ends, yet how continuous wall sliding occurs without end detachment remains unclear. Using ultrafast force-clamp spectroscopy, we show that single Ndc80 complexes, the primary microtubule-binding kinetochore component, exhibit processive, bidirectional sliding. Plus end–directed forces induce a mobile catch bond in Ndc80, increasing frictional resistance and restricting sliding toward the tip. Conversely, forces pulling Ndc80 away from the plus end trigger mobile slip-bond behavior, facilitating sliding. This dual behavior arises from force-dependent modulation of the Nuf2 calponin-homology domain’s microtubule binding, identifying this subunit as a friction regulator. We propose that Ndc80’s ability to modulate sliding friction provides the mechanistic basis for the kinetochore’s end coupling, enabling its slip-clutch behavior.",

Many non-native marine taxa are not documented until after they have become invasive, leaving questions about invasion timing (first introduction and lag period), geographic origin, vectors and pathways, and cause(s) of success. Foraminifera, unicellular, calcareous-shelled eukaryotes, offer a unique way of analyzing past ecosystem structure because their fossilized shells provide a window into the past, and small size and abundance enable us to document distribution over time in core samples. We use records of Foraminifera to document the timing and history of establishment of an invasive species ( Ammonia confertitesta ) in Long Island Sound, east of New York City (USA). A. confertitesta was rare from the mid-19th century but did not proliferate until the mid-1970s.

However, these processes were not fully integrated in past sulfur cycling models because of complexity from the gas-melt interactions in chemically and dynamically evolving magmatic systems with multicomponent volatiles. Here, we incorporate these processes to simulate how sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen degas from martian melts. We find that reduced sulfur species, H 2 S and S 2 , are dominantly emitted through degassing at crustal to surficial pressures. These sulfur species could condense as sulfide and elemental sulfur, potentially yielding the sulfate deposits observed on the martian surface through secondary oxidation. Our models also show that evolved magmas reach graphite and sulfide saturation at crustal pressures and thus may establish sulfur and carbon reservoirs in the martian crust. The degassed H 2 S and S 2 may form a hazy atmosphere with SF 6 , a potent greenhouse gas, to shape the paleoclimate of Mars.",

          "abstract": "Malignant B cells rely on B cell receptor (BCR) signals for their survival and growth. Besides the Immunoglobulin M (IgM) BCR, lymphoma cells can also express non–IgM (IgG) BCRs; however, the role of IgG BCRs in malignant B cell is not well understood. Here, we report poorer disease outcomes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) expressing high IgM versus those expressing IgG1. Using isogenic lymphoma cells expressing distinct BCRs, we found that IgM expressing cells strongly outcompete their IgG1 counterparts. Mechanistically, IgG1 BCR is associated with a dysfunctional mitochondrial state and reduced cell survival. We show that mitochondrial dysfunction is triggered by accentuated calcium responses downstream of IgG1 BCR. Genetic reversal of IgG1 to IgM, pharmacological dampening of calcium signaling, or treatment with interleukin-21 can correct mitochondrial defects and rescue IgG1 survival. Our findings demonstrate that distinct BCR isotypes are inherently unique and can differentially affect B cell lymphoma pathogenesis.",

The mottled-brindled mouse recapitulates salient features of the human illness. Affected male mice typically die by 14 postnatal days. We evaluated a single-dose intravenous adeno-associated virus gene therapy approach to deliver working copies of a codon-optimized version of ATP7A to male mottled-brindled mice. In conjunction with subcutaneous injections of clinical-grade copper histidinate in the first month of life, 95% long-term survival was attained, which was correlated with improvements in serum and brain copper levels, brain neurochemical profiles, somatic growth, and neuromotor function. The notable results support a trial of this treatment combination in affected male newborns with Menkes disease.",

Specifically, Mn 2+ @Man-phage anchored on bacterial surfaces and provided artificial recognition sites that enabled macrophages to phagocytize via mannose receptors, accompanied by enhanced bactericidal activity triggered by manganese ions in response to an infectious microenvironment. Moreover, immune labeling–activated macrophages enhanced antigen presentation at infection sites, further boosting specific T cell–mediated adaptive immune responses and infection eradication effects. Overall, this study illustrates a scalable bacteriophage immune therapy based on precise biological labeling and targeted modulation of immune responses, bridging the natural divide between bacteriophages and host immunity.",

          "abstract": "Hematopoietic malignancies emerge through the acquisition of genetic mutations within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Some mutations impart a selective growth advantage to HSPCs, which expand and contribute to mature blood cells. This expansion is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) protein is a transcriptional regulator of proliferation/differentiation of hematopoietic cells. HSPCs express low levels of Id1 that is induced by growth factors and other mediators of inflammatory during stress to promote HSPC expansion. Since chronic inflammation is associated with the progression of hematopoietic malignancies, reducing Id1 expression may reduce CH. Genetic ablation of Id1 in Tet2 −/− HSPCs reduces HSPC expansion/CH, extramedullary hematopoiesis, myeloid skewing, and genetic instability and delays the onset of disease. Mechanistically, p16 expression, senescence, and apoptosis were increased, and proliferation decreased in Tet2 −/− ;Id1 −/− HSPCs. Thus, ID1 may represent a therapeutic target to reduce CH and delay the onset of disease.",

In contrast, little is known about the role of the synaptic connections that sLN v s form with downstream neurons. Connectomic analyses revealed that the sLN v s form strong synaptic connections with previously uncharacterized neurons called superior lateral protocerebrum 316 (SLP316). Here, we show that silencing the synaptic output from the SLP316 neurons via tetanus toxin expression shortened the free-running period, whereas hyperexciting them by expressing the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel resulted in period lengthening. Under light-dark cycles, silencing SLP316 neurons caused lower daytime activity and higher daytime sleep.

We introduce a mathematical method to reconstruct the dynamic unfolding of intercellular exchange networks from these data, applying it to an experimental coculture system. The exchange network, initially dense, progressively fragments into small disconnected clusters. To explain these dynamics, we develop a maximum-entropy multicellular metabolic model with diffusion-driven exchanges. The model predicts a transition from a dense network to a sparse one as nutrient consumption shifts. We characterize this crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in the cluster-size distribution, and analytically, by connecting to percolation theory. Comparison with data suggests that populations evolve toward the sparse phase by remaining near the crossover. These findings offer insights into the collective organization driving the adaptive dynamics of cell populations.",

However, atomic-scale visualization, particularly in doped CDW systems without foreign ions, remains rare. Here, we present real-space observation of doping-tunable granular charge ordering using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in semiconducting single-layer Cr 2 Se 3 , a group VIB transition metal chalcogenide (TMC). Observations of lattice distortion, bandgap modulation at E F , and STM contrast inversion at low temperatures indicate a charge ordering origin. Cr 2 Se 3 ’s semiconducting nature enables charge ordering modulation through doping: Hole doping suppresses it, whereas electron doping alters the pattern, yielding a periodic 3√3 × 3√3 CDW phase. This tunable charge ordering in a group VIB TMC advances the understanding of charge doping and ordering interactions in two-dimensional materials.",

We report on the operation of a free space ring laser gyroscope over a period of 250 days under an ambient pressure stabilizing vessel continuously in an unperturbed underground laboratory. Because we measure relative to local inertial space, the precession and nutation motion of Earth’s axis are intrinsically contained in the observations. It is demonstrated that optical interferometry, using an ultrastable cavity, yields an accuracy limit for rotation sensing of 48 parts per billion (i.e., picoradians per second), less than an order of magnitude away from the regime in which relativistic effects can be measured.",

          "abstract": "ADP-ribosylation can occur as mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) or be extended into poly-ADP-ribose (PAR). Tankyrase, a PAR transferase, adds PAR to itself and other proteins targeting them for proteasomal degradation via the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146. This degradation can be counteracted by RING-UIM E3 ligases RNF114 and RNF166, although the process is unclear. Here, we identify a mechanism that can regulate the balance between MAR and PAR on tankyrase to control degradation. We show that Deltex E3 ligases DTX2 and DTX3 catalyze monoubiquitylation of tankyrase in cells. This ubiquitylation occurs, not on a (canonical) lysine, but rather on MAR, creating a monoubiquitin-MAR hybrid mark. RNF114 and RNF166 recognize this mark using a unique hybrid reader domain and further diubiquitylate it. This ubiquitylation of MAR, which occurs near the ADP-ribose addition site, prevents PAR formation, antagonizing the action of the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146 and stabilizing tankyrase. These findings reveal an interplay between ubiquitin, ADP-ribose, and E3 ligases in cellular signaling.",

Here, we unveil that the TaCEP15 peptide interacts with the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase TaCEPRL. Knockout of TaCEP15 or TaCEPRL increases primary root length and enhances drought tolerance in wheat. TaCEPRL interacts with and phosphorylates TaSnRK1α, leading to the degradation of TaSnRK1α. The presence of TaCEP15 intensifies the phosphorylation and degradation of TaSnRK1α. Consistently, overexpressing TaSnRK1 α boosts primary root elongation and augments drought tolerance. In addition, we identify the transcription factor TabZIP9, which binds to the TaCEP15 promoter and suppresses its transcription. A-to-T substitution in the TaCEP15 promoter decreases the binding affinity of TabZIP9. As expected, transgenic plants with TabZIP9 knockout or overexpression exhibit noteworthy changes in primary root length and drought tolerance.

Phytoplankton frequently experience a limiting supply of multiple nutrients simultaneously (colimitation). Ocean warming is predicted to exacerbate marine nutrient limitation. Yet, how phytoplankton adapt their physiology and regulate responses to colimitation is poorly understood. Here, we show that when the crucial macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) colimit growth of globally abundant phytoplankton, the diatoms, cellular resources are diverted to prioritize N uptake over P sensing and acquisition. Regulatory mechanisms for responding to fluctuating P supply, including Phosphate Starvation Response 1 (PSR1) and P-resupply sensing via Ca 2+ signaling, are strictly nitrate dependent. Further, P-Ca 2+ signaling is impaired in psr1 mutants, suggesting that PSR1 is necessary for this response and coordinates adaptations to colimitation. Our study demonstrates a hierarchy of resource allocation during colimitation that points to N starvation mechanisms overriding those of P and could lead to N-P colimitation being masked in many marine ecosystems.",

Mechanical theories, finite element analysis, and experiments verified that, with multilayer stacks and interconnects with various geometric designs as examples, the overbend strategy can enhance the designed elastic bendability to twice for the material of the ideal elastoplastic/kinematic hardening constitutive relationship and to more than twice for the mixed hardening/isotropic hardening constitutive relationship. The mechanism is extending the elastic strain range at the critical section to twice or more times the original value by the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relationship.

Our findings reveal dynamic regulation of SLC35A4-MP expression during primary brown adipocyte differentiation in vitro and during cold exposure or high-fat diet (HFD)–induced obesity in mice. Using a knockout mouse model, we show that loss of SLC35A4-MP disrupts mitochondrial lipid composition, decreasing cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolamine in brown adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice. SLC35A4-MP deficiency also impairs mitochondrial activity, alters mitochondrial number and morphology, and promotes inflammation. Knockout mice accumulate acylcarnitines during cold exposure, indicating defective fatty acid oxidation.

          "abstract": "Stereotactic neurointervention is a common procedure for biopsy, injection, ablation, and implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation. Guided by preoperative imaging, conventional approaches are mostly performed manually, lacking operation stability and interactive feedback. The intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance enables both structural and functional assessment during operation, permitting interactive adaptation to tissue deformation and avoidance of critical anatomical regions. Here, we report an MRI-guided robotic system for stereotactic neurointervention. A macro-micro hybrid pneumatic-hydraulic actuated stereotactic robot with a large range of motion and high precision is developed. This is coupled with a compact bioinspired soft actuator for target intervention. A global-focal MRI sequence is proposed for interactive navigation, closed-loop control, and precise targeting. Validation is performed with phantom, cadaveric, and in vivo animal studies, showing positional accuracies of 0.39, 0.68, and 0.14 millimeters, respectively, demonstrating superior performance compared to the current state of the art in robotic-assisted stereotactic neurointervention.",

Herein, we investigate the permeation of alkali chlorides (LiCl, KCl, and CsCl) through steric hindrance–free nanoporous membranes with tunable surface charge densities. Supported by molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm that electrostatic effects promote the dehydration of Cl − , the counterions to the membrane charge, at the positively charged membrane surface. This dehydration leads to a great tendency of Cl − to absorb to the membrane surface and be retained, compromises Cl − partitioning, and impedes salt cotransport. For negatively charged membranes, Cs + with its lower hydration energy undergoes greater electrostatic-driven dehydration and partition hindrance than K + , resulting in selective KCl transport. Our findings provide both theoretical and experimental proofs of ionic dehydration and transport impediments driven by electrostatic interactions at charged membrane surfaces, presenting an in-depth perspective for designing ion-selective membranes to separate similar ions based on charge effects.",

          "abstract": "The pseudouridine synthase DKC1 regulates internal ribosome entry site (IRES)–dependent translation and is up-regulated in cancers by the MYC family of oncogenes. The functional significance of DKC1 up-regulation and the mechanistic connection between pseudouridylation and IRES-mediated translation remain poorly understood. Here, we report that DKC1 drives an ATF4-mediated transcriptional program that supports amino acid metabolism and stress adaptation. We identify hnRNP A1, an IRES trans-acting factor, as a critical downstream mediator of DKC1 in sustaining ATF4 expression and IRES-dependent translation. Mechanistically, DKC1-mediated pseudouridylation at two specific 28 S ribosomal RNA sites is crucial for maintaining hnRNP A1 protein expression. In turn, hnRNP A1 binds and stabilizes ATF4 messenger RNA, preferentially promoting IRES-dependent translation of ATF4 variant 1. Furthermore, cellular stress induces hnRNP A1, which is necessary for stress-induced ATF4 protein expression. Collectively, our findings uncover an MYC-driven DKC1-hnRNP A1 axis that links IRES-dependent translation and ATF4-mediated metabolic adaptation, thereby supporting cancer cell survival under metabolic stress during tumor progression.",

          "abstract": "Year-to-year variance of agricultural productivity is an important determinant of food security. Previous global analyses described increased yield volatility from warming, but it has become increasingly clear that changes in water availability are also a key determinant of yields. Here, we provide the first global quantification of climate change impacts on maize, soybean, and sorghum yield variance due to changes in temperature and soil moisture. Pairing an empirical crop model with CMIP6 simulations indicates that changes in temperature and soil moisture increase interannual weather-induced yield variance by 7   to   19 % ° C across crops. This increase is driven roughly equally by previously quantified increased temperature stress variance, as well as by increased covariance between temperature and soil moisture stresses. Results using a simple land surface model are consistent with those using CMIP6 simulations in indicating that this increased covariance is driven by warmer air more quickly drying soils and by dry soils promoting greater warming.",

Compensated ferrimagnet spintronic devices with both a large anomalous Hall effect and a high coercivity would be simultaneously easy to read and difficult to erase. The kagome ferrimagnet TbMn 6 Sn 6 has been reported to host a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Here, we demonstrate that doping the Mn sites with Cr drives the system toward magnetic compensation. For nearly compensated compositions at low temperatures, giant coercive fields exceeding 14 T are observed. Additionally, Cr doping markedly enhances the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, which can be attributed to a shift in the Fermi level. Our results extend the range of unique magnetic states observed in kagome materials, demonstrating that chemical doping is an effective strategy to tune and realize these states.",

The THM-TENG protector exhibits tunable stiffness (40 to 4300 newtons per millimeter), ~70% impact energy absorption, and achieves a specific energy absorption of ~0.25 joules per gram at a weight of only 10 grams. Through triboelectrification, the protector converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, enabling real-time monitoring of impact loads up to 1000 newtons (≤5 hertz). Integrated with a microcontroller unit, wireless transmission, and alarm systems, THM-TENG demonstrates dual functionality in UAVs: mitigating vibration while providing real-time force monitoring, positioning, and early warning, all without external power sources.

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is hallmarked by phenotypic transitions enabling abnormal cell proliferation and invasion. The stress-protective transcription factor heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is associated with cancer, but its function in breast carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Analysis of human breast tumor samples and mouse in vivo xenografts uncovered that HSF2 expression and activity undergo dynamic changes as a function of tumor progression. HSF2 expression, nuclear localization, and coexpression with the proliferation marker Ki67 are increased in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), suggesting that HSF2 designates hyperplastic cells underlying tumor expansion. In mouse xenografts, HSF2 localization switches from nuclear to cytoplasmic upon DCIS-to-invasive transition. Using cell-based models, we identify canonical transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling as the molecular mechanism regulating HSF2. TGF-β–mediated down-regulation of HSF2 allowed acquisition of an invasive cell phenotype, which was counteracted by ectopic HSF2. Together, we propose that HSF2 acts as a stage-specific switch between proliferation and invasion in breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people with HIV (PWH) experience persistent inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, increasing their risk for non-AIDS comorbidities. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of long-term/low-dose Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) supplementation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–infected, ART-treated rhesus macaques (RMs). THC significantly increased plasma/jejunum serotonin and indole-3-propionate, enhancing gut-brain communication through up-regulation of serotonin receptors (HTR4/HTR7) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling via a cannabinoid receptor (CBR)-2–mediated mechanism. Furthermore, THC enriched cholesterol-metabolizing Oscillibacter and reduced plasma cholesterol and toxic secondary bile acids (SBAs), thus improving cholesterol and SBA homeostasis. Furthermore, THC increased β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels via a CBR1-mediated mechanism, suggesting enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation for metabolic and cardiovascular health. THC restored ART/SIV-induced elevation of pro-inflammatory and cardiotoxic long-chain acylcholines to preinfection levels. THC-treated RMs maintained viral suppression despite reduced plasma ART levels, suggesting diminished ART-related toxicity. Our findings demonstrate phytocannabinoids to be a safe adjunct therapy alongside ART to mitigate chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in PWH.",

The resulting cold-welded LMP micropatterns exhibit exceptional electromechanical properties, high conductivity (2.4 × 10 6 siemens per meter), stretchability (more than 1200%), and strain- and pressure-insensitive resistance, owing to their multiscale and dynamic morphologies. Demonstrations in highly stretchable strain sensors and cardiac mapping devices highlight the capabilities of this method for creating high-performance, highly stretchable electronic systems. Notably, balloon catheter–integrated LMP microelectrode arrays show low impedance under extreme deformations and enable high-resolution endocardial electrogram mapping inside the human heart. This method expands the potential of liquid metal–based stretchable electronics for a wide range of applications, including implantable biomedical devices and soft robotics.",

Yet the oxygenation history of Paleozoic deep oceans remains debated. Using thallium (Tl) isotope ratios in deep-marine mudrocks, we reconstruct the history of deep marine oxygenation from ~485 to 380 million years ago. Thallium isotopes can track bottom water oxygenation indirectly through their sensitivity to seafloor Mn oxide burial. We apply Tl isotopes to a global set of mudrocks, placing a particular focus on the Road River Group of Yukon, Canada. Our data reveal an oscillatory pattern in seawater Tl isotope ratios and, in turn, a dynamic ocean ventilation history. A long-lived deep ocean oxygenation episode is identified between ~405 and 386 million years ago. These short-term dynamics are superimposed on a muted positive ocean oxygenation trend over the entire Early and Middle Paleozoic. Sustained O 2 accumulation in global marine bottom waters occurred sometime after ~380 million years ago according to our dataset.",

Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in the zebrafish adult telencephalon, we identified different molecular clusters of quiescent NSCs, interpreted to sign different quiescence depths. Here, we show that these clusters, when challenged in vivo with an inhibitor of Notch signaling, a major quiescence promoting pathway, unfold different behaviors. Notably, deeply quiescent NSCs with astrocytic features display a unique activation phenotype that combines the maintenance of astrocytic markers with the rapid up-regulation of activation and neuronal commitment genes, reminiscent to murine periventricular astrocytes activating upon lesion. In contrast, an NSC cluster predicted to be in the deepest quiescence state resists Notch blockade, and we demonstrate that the transcription factor Nr2f1b mediates this resistance to activation in vivo. These results together link the molecular heterogeneity of quiescent NSCs with bona fide biological properties and their molecular regulators.",

Four SCRs inhibited all tested PVPs, and their efficacy was confirmed against live viruses including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, EBOV, MARV, NiV, and HeV.

These intriguing molecules are rare instances of stable CO diborylation products that were made accessible by direct CO capture.

The cyclopentanone analog engages in stepwise one- and two-electron reduction processes to yield radical monoanion and dianion species while preserving the five-membered ring structure and the boron-boron bonds.

          "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) is naturally produced by bacteria along with four nontoxic neurotoxin-associated proteins (NTNH, HA70, HA33, and HA17), forming a bimodular large progenitor toxin complex (L-PTC). The BoNT/A–NTNH complex protects the toxin from adverse environment, while the complex consisting of HA proteins facilitates toxin absorption during oral intoxication. How these two independent modules assemble into the L-PTC remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the BoNT/A–NTNH–HA70 complex at ~2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals that the BoNT/A–NTNH complex is anchored into a concentric double β-barrel channel of trimeric HA70 through a short β-hairpin of NTNH (termed nLoop), resembling a nut-and-bolt attachment. We find that the nLoop of NTNH is strictly conserved across HA-containing BoNT complexes and that NTNH–HA70 binding is interchangeable among them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nLoop functions as a minimal motif enabling attachment of a protein-of-interest to the HA complex, with potential applications in oral biologics delivery.",

Genetic evidence implicates impaired mitophagy in Parkinson’s disease, making its pharmacological enhancement a promising therapeutic strategy. Here, we characterize two mitophagy activators: a novel Parkin activator, FB231, and the reported PINK1 activator MTK458. Both compounds lower the threshold for mitochondrial toxins to induce PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. However, global proteomics revealed that FB231 and MTK458 independently induce mild mitochondrial stress, resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and activation of the integrated stress response, effects that result from PINK1/Parkin-independent off-target activities. We find that these compounds impair mitochondria by distinct mechanisms and synergistically decrease mitochondrial function and cell viability in combination with classical mitochondrial toxins. Our findings support a model whereby weak or “silent” mitochondrial toxins potentiate other mitochondrial stressors, enhancing PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. These insights highlight important considerations for therapeutic strategies targeting mitophagy activation in Parkinson’s disease.",

Toward the creation of biomaterials with both excellent biocompatibility and customizability, recombinant protein–based hydrogels have emerged as molecularly defined and user-programmable platforms that mimic the proteinaceous nature of the extracellular matrix. Here, we introduce PhoCoil, a dynamically tunable recombinant hydrogel formed from a single protein component with unique multistimuli responsiveness. Physical cross-linking through coiled-coil interactions promotes rapid shear-thinning and self-healing behavior, rendering the gel injectable, whereas an included photodegradable motif affords on-demand network dissolution via visible light. PhoCoil gel photodegradation can be spatiotemporally and lithographically controlled in a dose-dependent manner, through complex tissue, and without harm to encapsulated cells.

We integrate macronutrient regulation and metabolic flexibility to elucidate how wild orangutans ( Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii ) are buffered against natural fluctuations in nutritional resources. We found that these orangutans regulate protein and regularly switch between exogenous and endogenous nutritional substrates as preferred food resource availability declines. When total caloric, lipid, and carbohydrate intake declined during episodes of fruit scarcity, orangutans drew on fat and endogenous amino acids for energy. This strategy is beneficial only in the context of alternating periods of fruit scarcity and abundance.

In particular, USI’s limited ability to differentiate follicular neoplasms from benign nodules contributes to suboptimal biopsy decision-making. We propose a dual-modal imaging approach that combines multiparametric photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and USI to support smarter biopsy decisions. In 106 patients with 29 benign nodules, 45 papillary thyroid carcinomas, and 32 follicular neoplasms, three PAI-derived parameters—the photoacoustic spectral gradient, oxygen saturation, and skewness of the oxygen saturation distribution—were combined using a support vector machine. Following USI-based American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, they were used to develop the ATA-Photoacoustic (ATAP) scoring system. The ATAP score achieved 97% sensitivity and 38% specificity in distinguishing nodules requiring FNAB. Our approach enabled better identification of benign nodules, reducing unnecessary FNAB in 11 of the 29 benign cases. This dual-modal strategy can assess thyroid nodules, effectively reducing unnecessary biopsies while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.",

In this study, we investigate the differences between these two phases through a comprehensive set of analytical methods, from macrolevel assessments (rheology) to microlevel characterizations (small and wide-angle x-ray scattering, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy) and chemical analyses. The lower phase is enriched in free fatty acids and lead carboxylates, especially saturated species—both as free acids and metal soaps—prone to self-organization. As a result, the lower phase displays a pronounced lamellar organization with partial crystallization and exhibits viscoelastic and shear-thinning properties. In contrast, the unstructured upper phase behaves as a Newtonian fluid.

To address this, we developed a deep learning–based method that not only recovers parameter distributions from exponential signals with improved accuracy but also provides an uncertainty estimation for each reconstruction result. This additional insight allows the user to assess the confidence across spectral regions, providing a clearer and more reliable framework for Laplace-related data interpretation, thus facilitating broader applications in fields such as chemistry and materials science.",

Much of our knowledge about SSA derives from coastal observations near shorelines, but whether and when these observations accurately represent open oceans remain unclear. Here, we show that strong nearshore SSA production during high-wave periods greatly enhances downwind cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and aerosol mass concentrations. Strong shoreline wave breaking is widespread globally, and swell waves, which are decoupled from local winds, play a dominant role in many coastal regions. Therefore, extrapolating results based on coastal measurements to open oceans may significantly overestimate SSA concentration and its contribution to CCN and, by extension, the impact of SSA on clouds and climate. Additionally, the strong enhancement of coastal aerosol population by shoreline wave breaking and its environmental impact on coastal communities cannot be captured by current regional models, which do not parameterize nearshore SSA generation using wave energy or completely neglect it.",

Here, we show that α-actinin-3 deficiency decreases AR in muscles of mice and humans (in males and females) and that AR positively correlates with α-actinin-3 expression in a dosage-dependent manner. α-Actinin-3 deficiency exacerbates gastrocnemius mass loss with androgen deprivation in male mice and stunts the muscle growth response to dihydrotestosterone in female mice at the onset of puberty. This is mediated by differential activation of pathways regulating amino acid metabolism, intracellular transport, autophagy, mitochondrial activity, MAPK, and calcineurin signaling, likely driven by seven key genes that are both androgen sensitive and α-actinin-3–dependent in expression. Our results highlight a role for ACTN3 as a regulator of muscle mass and a genetic modifier of androgen action in skeletal muscle.",

BioFuse comprises a series of fuse-like tandem DNA cassettes that can be sequentially edited by the adenine base editors (ABEs), resulting in either the activation or deactivation of a downstream gene once the editing is complete. Adjusting the number of DNA cassettes incorporated allows precise programming of BioFuse’s reaction time. Applying BioFuse to control carotenoid biosynthesis genes decouples lycopene production from growth in E. coli and increases lycopene yield without external inducers.

          "authors": "Tianhe Wang, Yifan Fang, David Whitney",
          "abstract": "The nervous system uses prior information to enhance movement accuracy, yet the underlying computational mechanisms remain relatively unclear. Prevailing motor control models emphasize Bayesian inference, where prior information is integrated to optimally estimate the current state. An alternative framework, efficient coding, proposes that the system dynamically reallocates encoding resources on the basis of environmental statistics—a mechanism highlighted in perception while underappreciated in motor control. We compared these frameworks in reaching movements, focusing on how the system leverages short-term priors in unpredictable environments. Unexpectedly, sequential effects aligned with the efficient coding model and contradicted Bayesian models. Specifically, current movements were biased in the opposite direction of previous movements, and movement variability decreased when successive reaches were similar. We further explored the temporal dynamics of these effects and showed that sequential bias is enhanced by intrinsic motor variability. These findings, accompanied by model comparisons, further support efficient coding in motor planning.",

Here, we revisit Pianka’s 1966 hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity contributes to tropical biodiversity. Using a comprehensive survey of a fish community in a central Amazonian floodplain, conducted over the 2003, 2012, and 2022 hydrological cycles, we ask if the high levels of environmental heterogeneity (both temporal and spatial) that characterize this ecosystem constrain the capacity of species to dominate local assemblages. We find rapid replacement of dominant species, with local species richness inversely related to dominance. Marked turnover in fish community structure and composition is also present, with different functional groups favored under changing environmental conditions. By showing that turnover in dominant species fuels species coexistence, we identify an ecological mechanism that helps explain how environmental heterogeneity can foster tropical biodiversity.",

In this study, we characterize every SUMO component in the Arabidopsis root to create a complete SUMO Cell Atlas in eukaryotes. This unique resource reveals wide spatial variation, where SUMO proteins and proteases have subfunctionalized in both their expression and subcellular localization. During stress, SUMO conjugation is mainly driven by tissue-specific regulation of the SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme. Stress-specific modulation of the SUMO pathway reveals unique combinations of proteases being targeted for regulation in distinct root tissues by salt, osmotic, and biotic signals. Our SUMO Cell Atlas resources reveal how this posttranslational modification (PTM) influences cellular- and tissue-scale adaptations during root development and stress responses. To our knowledge, we provide the first comprehensive study elucidating how multiple stress inputs can regulate an entire PTM system.",

          "abstract": "Supercell thunderstorms are the most hazardous thunderstorm category and particularly impactful to society. Their monitoring is challenging and often confined to the radar networks of single countries. By exploiting kilometer-scale climate simulations, we have derived a previously unknown characterization of supercell occurrence in Europe for the current and a warmer climate. The current climate shows several hundred supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are colocated with complex topography, e.g., the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps and minima over the oceans and flat areas. Comparing a current-climate simulation with a pseudo–global warming +3°C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11%. However, there is a spatial dipole of change with strong increases in supercell frequencies in central and eastern Europe and a decrease in frequency over the Iberian Peninsula and southwestern France.",

The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), present from tabletop to astronomical scales, is an iconic example characterized by mushroom-shaped incursions appearing when immiscible fluids are forced together. Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the “ripplon” interface modes. Last, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain. These results—in agreement with our theory—demonstrate the close connection between the RTI in classical and quantum fluids.",

          "abstract": "A cell’s global physical state is characterized by its volume and dry mass. The ratio of cell mass to volume defines the cell mass density (CMD), which is also a measure of macromolecular crowding and concentrations of all proteins. Using the fluorescence eXclusion method (FXm) and quantitative phase microscopy (QPM), we investigate CMD dynamics following sudden changes in media osmolarity. We find that while cell volume and mass exhibit complex behavior after osmotic shock, CMD follows a straightforward monotonic recovery over 48 hours. This recovery is cell cycle independent and depends on coordinated adjustment of protein synthesis and volume growth rates. Unexpectedly, the protein synthesis rate decreases when CMD increases. We observe that nucleoplasm-cytoplasm transport is CMD dependent, which contributes to negative regulatory feedback on CMD. The Na + /H + exchanger helps regulate CMD by affecting both protein synthesis and volume change. Together, we reveal that cells have a robust control system that actively regulates CMD during environmental change.",

          "abstract": "Macrophage-to-foam cell transition is an integral part of atherosclerotic plaque progression. Particularly, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a driving factor in foam cell formation, altering macrophage function and metabolism. The aim of our research was to understand the impact of oxLDL-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species on macrophage-to-foam cell differentiation. We demonstrate that macrophage oxLDL-derived superoxide modulates mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, facilitating foam cell formation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial superoxide drives signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation, leading to reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In parallel, mitochondrial superoxide enhances chromatin accessibility at STAT5 target genes, establishing a distinct STAT5 signaling signature in foam cells ex vivo and in human and mouse plaques in vivo. Inhibition of STAT5 during atherosclerosis progression prevents the differentiation of macrophages to mature Trem2 hi Gpnmb hi foam cells. Collectively, our data describe an oxLDL-induced, mitochondrial superoxide–dependent STAT5 activation that leads to a self-amplifying feedback loop of reciprocal mitochondrial superoxide production and STAT5 activation, ultimately driving macrophage-to-foam cell transition.",

          "abstract": "Prefibrillar structures of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide are central to cytotoxicity in Alzheimer’s disease. Time-resolved imaging of oligomers has enabled quantification of their extension. A snapshot of these prefibrillar assemblies has been characterized using a combination of cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET), cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A highly consistent diameter for all curvilinear protofibrils and oligomers of 2.8 nanometers suggests that these assemblies are structural extensions from the smaller oligomers. In situ AFM confirms that spherical oligomers template and extend over time into curvilinear protofibrils. Furthermore, their basic cross section suggests that amyloid fibrils might be initiated by the lateral binding of two curvilinear protofibrils. Cryo-ET/EM single particles also reveal ring-shaped annular assemblies. These have a central internal channel, ~1.4 nanometers in diameter, which is capable of traversing lipid membranes. Large conductance recorded using patch-clamp electrophysiology matches the internal diameter of the Aβ annular architecture.",

A critical component of this approach is the photoresponsive material that has sufficient drug-loading capacity and can be actuated by near-infrared (NIR) light with considerable penetration depths. Here, we establish a photoactivated drug delivery platform based on the π-stacked organic framework (πOF), which demonstrates an intrinsic NIR absorption and superior photothermal effect. πOF not only has considerable loading capacity for a variety of drugs but also prompts the inducible burst release of loaded cargoes under NIR irradiation with notable increase of the release rate. Based on these features, πOF is used to effectively modulate the delivery of resiquimod (R848) and simultaneously induce photothermal effect by NIR irradiation. In 4T1-bearing mouse models, the photoactivated release of R848 can significantly potentiate treatment efficacy.",
