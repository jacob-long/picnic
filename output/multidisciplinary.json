          "abstract": "The fabrication of scalable all-perovskite tandem solar cells is considered an attractive route to commercialize perovskite photovoltaic modules1. However, The certified efficiency of 1-cm2 scale all-perovskite tandem solar cells lags behind their small-area (~0.1 cm2) counterparts2,3. This performance deficit originates from inhomogeneity in wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at a large scale. The inhomogeneity is known to be introduced at the bottom interface and within the perovskite bulk itself4,5. Here we uncover another crucial source for the inhomogeneity – the top interface formed during the deposition of the electron transport layer (ETL, C60). Meanwhile, the poor ETL interface is also a significant limitation of device performance. We address this issue by introducing a mixture of 4-fluorophenethylamine (F-PEA) and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA) to create a tailored two-dimensional perovskite layer (TTDL), in which F-PEA forms a two-dimensional perovskite at the surface reducing contact losses and inhomogeneity, CF3-PA enhances charge extraction and transport. As a result, we demonstrate a high open-circuit voltage of 1.35 V and an efficiency of 20.5% in 1.77-eV WBG PSCs at a square centimeter scale. By stacking with a narrow-bandgap perovskite sub-cell, we report 1.05 cm2 all-perovskite tandem cells delivering 28.5% (certified 28.2%) efficiency, the highest among all reported so far. Our work showcases the importance of treating the top perovskite/ETL contact for upscaling perovskite solar cells.",

          "abstract": "Dopamine signalling modes differ in kinetics and spatial patterns of receptor activation1,2. How these modes contribute to motor function, motivation and learning has long been debated3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21. Here we show that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for movement initiation but supports reward-oriented behaviour. We generated mice with dopamine-neuron-specific knockout of the release site organizer protein RIM to disrupt action-potential-induced dopamine release. In these mice, rapid in vivo dopamine dynamics were strongly impaired, but baseline dopamine persisted and fully supported spontaneous movement. Conversely, reserpine-mediated dopamine depletion or blockade of dopamine receptors disrupted movement initiation. The dopamine precursor l-DOPA reversed reserpine-induced bradykinesia without restoring fast dopamine dynamics, a result that substantiated the conclusion that these dynamics are dispensable for movement initiation. In contrast to spontaneous movement, reward-oriented behaviour was impaired in dopamine-neuron-specific RIM knockout mice. In conditioned place preference and two-odour discrimination tasks, the mice effectively learned to distinguish the cues, which indicates that reward-based learning persists after RIM ablation. However, the performance vigour was reduced. During probabilistic cue-reward association, dopamine dynamics and conditioned responses assessed through anticipatory licking were disrupted. These results demonstrate that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for motor function and subsecond precision of movement initiation but promotes motivation and performance during reward-guided behaviours.",

          "abstract": "The prevailing dogma for morphological patterning in developing organisms argues that the combined inputs of transcription factor networks and signalling morphogens alone generate spatially and temporally distinct expression patterns. However, metabolism has also emerged as a critical developmental regulator1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, independent of its functions in energy production and growth. The mechanistic role of nutrient utilization in instructing cellular programmes to shape the in vivo developing mammalian embryo remains unknown. Here we reveal two spatially resolved, cell-type- and stage-specific waves of glucose metabolism during mammalian gastrulation by using single-cell-resolution quantitative imaging of developing mouse embryos, stem cell models and embryo-derived tissue explants. We identify that the first spatiotemporal wave of glucose metabolism occurs through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to drive fate acquisition in the epiblast, and the second wave uses glycolysis to guide mesoderm migration and lateral expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that glucose exerts its influence on these developmental processes through cellular signalling pathways, with distinct mechanisms connecting glucose with the ERK activity in each wave. Our findings underscore that—in synergy with genetic mechanisms and morphogenic gradients—compartmentalized cellular metabolism is integral in guiding cell fate and specialized functions during development. This study challenges the view of the generic and housekeeping nature of cellular metabolism, offering valuable insights into its roles in various developmental contexts.",

          "abstract": "Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a fatal drug-induced skin reaction triggered by common medications and is an emerging public health issue 1–3 . Patients with TEN undergo severe and sudden epidermal detachment caused by keratinocyte cell death. Although molecular mechanisms that drive keratinocyte cell death have been proposed, the main drivers remain unknown, and there is no effective therapy for TEN 4–6 . Here, to systematically map molecular changes that are associated with TEN and identify potential druggable targets, we utilized deep visual proteomics, which provides single-cell-based, cell-type-resolution proteomics 7,8 . We analysed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived skin tissue biopsies of three types of cutaneous drug reactions with varying severity and quantified more than 5,000 proteins in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating immune cells. This revealed a marked enrichment of type I and type II interferon signatures in the immune cell and keratinocyte compartment of patients with TEN, as well as phosphorylated STAT1 activation. Targeted inhibition with the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in vitro reduced keratinocyte-directed cytotoxicity. In vivo oral administration of tofacitinib, baricitinib or the JAK1-specific inhibitors abrocitinib or upadacitinib ameliorated clinical and histological disease severity in two distinct mouse models of TEN. Crucially, treatment with JAK inhibitors (JAKi) was safe and associated with rapid cutaneous re-epithelialization and recovery in seven patients with TEN. This study uncovers the JAK/STAT and interferon signalling pathways as key pathogenic drivers of TEN and demonstrates the potential of targeted JAKi as a curative therapy.",

          "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori disturbs the stomach lining during long-term colonization of its human host, with sequelae including ulcers and gastric cancer 1,2 . Numerous H. pylori virulence factors have been identified, showing extensive geographic variation 1 . Here we identify a ‘Hardy’ ecospecies of H. pylori that shares the ancestry of ‘Ubiquitous’ H. pylori from the same region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in 100 genes, many of which encode outer membrane proteins and host interaction factors. Most Hardy strains have a second urease, which uses iron as a cofactor rather than nickel 3 , and two additional copies of the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA. Hardy strains currently have a limited distribution, including in Indigenous populations in Siberia and the Americas and in lineages that have jumped from humans to other mammals. Analysis of polymorphism data implies that Hardy and Ubiquitous coexisted in the stomachs of modern humans since before we left Africa and that both were dispersed around the world by our migrations. Our results also show that highly distinct adaptive strategies can arise and be maintained stably within bacterial populations, even in the presence of continuous genetic exchange between strains.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has an important yet often overlooked role in health and disease. Constraint models quantify the removal of deleterious variation from the population by selection and represent powerful tools for identifying genetic variation that underlies human phenotypes1,2,3,4. However, nuclear constraint models are not applicable to mtDNA, owing to its distinct features. Here we describe the development of a mitochondrial genome constraint model and its application to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), a large-scale population dataset that reports mtDNA variation across 56,434 human participants5. Specifically, we analyse constraint by comparing the observed variation in gnomAD to that expected under neutrality, which was calculated using a mtDNA mutational model and observed maximum heteroplasmy-level data. Our results highlight strong depletion of expected variation, which suggests that many deleterious mtDNA variants remain undetected. To aid their discovery, we compute constraint metrics for every mitochondrial protein, tRNA and rRNA gene, which revealed a range of intolerance to variation. We further characterize the most constrained regions within genes through regional constraint and identify the most constrained sites within the entire mitochondrial genome through local constraint, which showed enrichment of pathogenic variation. Constraint also clustered in three-dimensional structures, which provided insight into functionally important domains and their disease relevance. Notably, we identify constraint at often overlooked sites, including in rRNA and noncoding regions. Last, we demonstrate that these metrics can improve the discovery of deleterious variation that underlies rare and common phenotypes.",

The resulting micron-thick perovskite films, with enhanced grain boundaries and grains, showed stable material properties and outstanding optoelectronic performances. The small-area solar cells achieved efficiencies of 26.1%. The 1-square-centimeter devices and 5 cm × 5 cm minimodules delivered efficiencies of 24.3% and 21.4%, respectively.

          "abstract": "Owing to their similarities with giant exoplanets, brown dwarf companions of stars provide insights into the fundamental processes of planet formation and evolution. From their orbits, several brown dwarf companions are found to be more massive than theoretical predictions given their luminosities and the ages of their host stars1,2,3. Either the theory is incomplete or these objects are not single entities. For example, they could be two brown dwarfs each with a lower mass and intrinsic luminosity1,4. The most problematic example is Gliese 229 B (refs. 5,6), which is at least 2–6 times less luminous than model predictions given its dynamical mass of 71.4 ± 0.6 Jupiter masses (MJup) (ref. 1). We observed Gliese 229 B with the GRAVITY interferometer and, separately, the CRIRES+ spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Both sets of observations independently resolve Gliese 229 B into two components, Gliese 229 Ba and Bb, settling the conflict between theory and observations. The two objects have a flux ratio of 0.47 ± 0.03 at a wavelength of 2 μm and masses of 38.1 ± 1.0 and 34.4 ± 1.5 MJup, respectively. They orbit each other every 12.1 days with a semimajor axis of 0.042 astronomical units (au). The discovery of Gliese 229 BaBb, each only a few times more massive than the most massive planets, and separated by 16 times the Earth–moon distance, raises new questions about the formation and prevalence of tight binary brown dwarfs around stars.",

          "abstract": "A key concept proposed by Landau to explain superfluid liquid helium is the elementary excitation of quantum particles called rotons1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The irregular arrangement of atoms in a liquid leads to the aperiodic dispersion of rotons, which played a pivotal role in understanding fractional quantum Hall liquids (magneto-rotons)9,10 and the supersolidity of Bose–Einstein condensates11,12,13. Even for a two-dimensional electron or dipole liquid, in the absence of a magnetic field, the repulsive interactions have been predicted to form a roton minimum14,15,16,17,18,19, which can be used to trace the transition to Wigner crystals20,21,22,23,24 and superconductivity25,26,27, although this has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of such electronic rotons in a two-dimensional dipole liquid of alkali-metal ions donating electrons to surface layers of black phosphorus. Our data reveal the striking aperiodic dispersion of rotons, which is characterized by a local minimum of energy at finite momentum. As the density of dipoles decreases so that interactions dominate over the kinetic energy, the roton gap reduces to 0, as in a crystal, signalling Wigner crystallization. Our model shows the importance of short-range order arising from repulsion between dipoles, which can be viewed as the formation of Wigner crystallites (bubbles or stripes) floating in the sea of a Fermi liquid. Our results reveal that the primary origin of electronic rotons (and the pseudogap) is strong correlations.",

The breakup of a large asteroid in the main belt is the likely cause of this massive infall. Currently, material originating from this breakup still dominates meteorite falls (>20% of all falls)5.

          "abstract": "Human prenatal skin is populated by innate immune cells, including macrophages, but whether they act solely in immunity or have additional functions in morphogenesis is unclear. Here we assembled a comprehensive multi-omics reference atlas of prenatal human skin (7–17 post-conception weeks), combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, to characterize the microanatomical tissue niches of the skin. This atlas revealed that crosstalk between non-immune and immune cells underpins the formation of hair follicles, is implicated in scarless wound healing and is crucial for skin angiogenesis. We systematically compared a hair-bearing skin organoid (SkO) model derived from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells to prenatal and adult skin1. The SkO model closely recapitulated in vivo skin epidermal and dermal cell types during hair follicle development and expression of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of genetic hair and skin disorders. However, the SkO model lacked immune cells and had markedly reduced endothelial cell heterogeneity and quantity. Our in vivo prenatal skin cell atlas indicated that macrophages and macrophage-derived growth factors have a role in driving endothelial development. Indeed, vascular network remodelling was enhanced following transfer of autologous macrophages derived from induced pluripotent stem cells into SkO cultures. Innate immune cells are therefore key players in skin morphogenesis beyond their conventional role in immunity, a function they achieve through crosstalk with non-immune cells.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotic innate immune systems use pattern recognition receptors to sense infection by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which then triggers an immune response. Bacteria have similarly evolved immunity proteins that sense certain components of their viral predators, known as bacteriophages1,2,3,4,5,6. Although different immunity proteins can recognize different phage-encoded triggers, individual bacterial immunity proteins have been found to sense only a single trigger during infection, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between bacterial pattern recognition receptors and their ligands7,8,9,10,11. Here we demonstrate that the antiphage defence protein CapRelSJ46 in Escherichia coli can directly bind and sense two completely unrelated and structurally different proteins using the same sensory domain, with overlapping but distinct interfaces. Our results highlight the notable versatility of an immune sensory domain, which may be a common property of antiphage defence systems that enables them to keep pace with their rapidly evolving viral predators. We found that Bas11 phages harbour both trigger proteins that are sensed by CapRelSJ46 during infection, and we demonstrate that such phages can fully evade CapRelSJ46 defence only when both triggers are mutated. Our work shows how a bacterial immune system that senses more than one trigger can help prevent phages from easily escaping detection, and it may allow the detection of a broader range of phages. More generally, our findings illustrate unexpected multifactorial sensing by bacterial defence systems and complex coevolutionary relationships between them and their phage-encoded triggers.",

These HPAI viruses caused mortality events in poultry, wild birds, and wild mammals. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses.1 Over 200 positive herds were identified in 14 U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk.2,3 The diagnostic investigation revealed viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium. A single transmission event, likely from birds, was followed by limited local transmission and onward horizontal transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13.4 We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. Heifers were inoculated by aerosol respiratory route and cows by intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, pathogenesis, transmission, and intervention strategies.",

However, there is still a lack of systematic studies to investigate whether the empirical rules of working lifetime assessment used in silicon solar cells can be applied to pero-SCs. It is commonly believed that pero-SCs show enhanced stability under day/night cycling due to the reported self-healing effect in the dark.1,2 While we discovered that the degradation of highly efficient FAPbI3 pero-SCs is in fact much faster under natural day/night cycling mode, questioning the widely accepted approach to estimate the operational lifetime of pero-SCs based on continuous mode testing. We reveal the key factor to be the lattice strain caused by thermal expansion/shrinking of the perovskite during the operation, an effect that gradually relaxes under the continuous-illumination mode but cycles synchronously under the cycling mode.3,4 The periodic lattice strain under the cycling mode results in deep trap accumulation and chemical degradation during operation, decreasing the ion migration potential and hence the device lifetime.5 We introduce phenylselenenyl chloride (Ph-Se-Cl) to regulate the perovskite lattice strain during day/night cycling, which achieved the certified efficiency of 26.3% and a 10-time improved T80 lifetime under the cycling mode after the modification.",

Here we present global observational evidence for the important role of mesoscale eddies in the occurrence and intensification of subsurface MHWs and MCSs. We found that 80% of measured MHWs and MCSs below a depth of 100 m do not concur with surface events. In contrast to the weak link between surface MHWs (MCSs) and ocean eddies, nearly one-third of subsurface MHWs (MCSs) in the global ocean, and more than half of such events in subtropical gyres and mid-latitude main current systems, occur within anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies. These eddy-associated temperature extremes have intensified at rates greater than background level in past decades, suggesting a growing impact of ocean eddies on subsurface MHWs and MCSs with ongoing global warming.",

Here we examine how taste stimuli are encoded by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes—a highly invasive disease vector—and how these cues influence biting, feeding and egg laying. We find that neurons of the labellum, the major taste organ of the head, differentially encode a wide variety of human and other cues. We identify three functional classes of taste sensilla with an expansive coding capacity. In addition to excitatory responses, we identify prevalent inhibitory responses, which are predictive of biting behaviour. Certain bitter compounds suppress physiological and behavioural responses to sugar, suggesting their use as potent stop signals against appetitive cues. Complex cues, including human sweat, nectar and egg-laying site water, elicit distinct response profiles from the neuronal repertoire. We identify key tastants on human skin and in sweat that synergistically promote biting behaviours. Transcriptomic profiling identifies taste receptors that could be targeted to disrupt behaviours. Our study sheds light on key features of the taste system that suggest new ways of manipulating chemosensory function and controlling mosquito vectors.",

Until now, metamaterial design has primarily relied on geometry, and materials nonlinearities such as viscoelasticity, fracture and plasticity have been largely left out of the design rationale. In fact, plastic deformations have been traditionally seen as a failure mode and thereby carefully avoided1,3,17,18. Here we embrace plasticity instead and discover a delicate balance between plasticity and buckling instability, which we term ‘yield buckling’. We exploit yield buckling to design metamaterials that buckle sequentially in an arbitrary large sequence of steps whilst keeping a load-bearing capacity. We make use of sequential yield buckling to create metamaterials that combine stiffness and dissipation—two properties that are usually incompatible—and that can be used several times. Hence, our metamaterials exhibit superior shock-absorption performance. Our findings add plasticity to the metamaterial toolbox and make mechanical metamaterials a burgeoning technology with serious potential for mass production.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, perovskite has been widely adopted in series-connected monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs) to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction solar cells. Perovskite/organic TSCs, comprising a wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cell (pero-SC) as the front cell and a narrow-bandgap organic solar cell (OSC) as the rear cell, have recently drawn attention owing to the good stability and potential high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1,2,3,4. However, WBG pero-SCs usually exhibit higher voltage losses than regular pero-SCs, which limits the performance of TSCs5,6. One of the major obstacles comes from interfacial recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface, and it is important to develop effective surface passivation strategies to pursue higher PCE of perovskite/organic TSCs7. Here we exploit a new surface passivator cyclohexane 1,4-diammonium diiodide (CyDAI2), which naturally contains two isomeric structures with ammonium groups on the same or opposite sides of the hexane ring (denoted as cis-CyDAI2 and trans-CyDAI2, respectively), and the two isomers demonstrate completely different surface interaction behaviors. The cis-CyDAI2 passivation treatment reduces the Quasi–Fermi level splitting (QFLS)–open circuit voltage (Voc) mismatch of the WBG pero-SCs with a bandgap of 1.88 eV and enhanced its Voc to 1.36 V. Combining the cis-CyDAI2 treated perovskite and the organic active layer with a narrow-bandgap of 1.24 eV, the constructed monolithic perovskite/organic TSC demonstrates a PCE of 26.4% (certified as 25.7%).",

Recently, investigations and revelations of phonon hydrodynamics in graphitic materials7,8,9,10 have opened up new avenues for achieving thermal rectification. Here we demonstrate a phonon hydrodynamics approach to realize the rectification of heat conduction in isotopically enriched graphite crystals. We design a micrometre-scale Tesla valve within 90-nm-thick graphite and experimentally observe a discernible 15.2% difference in thermal conductivity between opposite directions at 45 K.

          "abstract": "Many organisms, including cosmopolitan drosophilids, show circadian plasticity, varying their activity with changing dawn–dusk intervals1. How this behaviour evolves is unclear. Here we compare Drosophila melanogaster with Drosophila sechellia, an equatorial, ecological specialist that experiences minimal photoperiod variation, to investigate the mechanistic basis of circadian plasticity evolution2. D. sechellia has lost the ability to delay its evening activity peak time under long photoperiods. Screening of circadian mutants in D. melanogaster/D. sechellia hybrids identifies a contribution of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf) to this loss. Pdf exhibits species-specific temporal expression, due in part to cis-regulatory divergence. RNA interference and rescue experiments in D. melanogaster using species-specific Pdf regulatory sequences demonstrate that modulation of this neuropeptide’s expression affects the degree of behavioural plasticity. The Pdf regulatory region exhibits signals of selection in D. sechellia and across populations of D. melanogaster from different latitudes. We provide evidence that plasticity confers a selective advantage for D. melanogaster at elevated latitude, whereas D. sechellia probably suffers fitness costs through reduced copulation success outside its range. Our findings highlight this neuropeptide gene as a hotspot locus for circadian plasticity evolution that might have contributed to both D. melanogaster’s global distribution and D. sechellia’s specialization.",

          "abstract": "Microquasars are laboratories for the study of jets of relativistic particles produced by accretion onto a spinning black hole. Microquasars are near enough to allow detailed imaging of spatial features across the multiwavelength spectrum. The recent extension measurement of the spatial morphology of a microquasar, SS 433, to TeV gamma rays1 localizes the acceleration of electrons at shocks in the jet far from the black hole2. V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) is a similar binary system with a black hole and B-type main-sequence companion star and has an orbit period of 2.8 days (refs. 3,4). It stands out for its super-Eddington accretion5 and for its radio jet, which is one of the fastest superluminal jets in the Milky Way. Previous observations of V4641 Sgr did not report gamma-ray emission6. Here we report TeV gamma-ray emission from V4641 Sgr that reveals particle acceleration at similar distances from the black hole as SS 433. Furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum of V4641 Sgr is among the hardest TeV spectra observed from any known gamma-ray source and is detected above 200 TeV. Gamma rays are produced by particles, either electrons or protons, of higher energies. Because energetic electrons lose energy more quickly the higher their energy, such a spectrum either very strongly constrains the electron-production mechanism or points to the acceleration of high-energy protons. This suggests that large-scale jets from microquasars could be more common than previously expected and that they could be a notable source of galactic cosmic rays7,8,9.",

Here we dissected the dynamic regulation of TH1 cell differentiation during in vitro polarization, and during in vivo differentiation after acute viral infection. We identified regulators modulating T helper cell differentiation using a unique TH1–TH2 cell dichotomous culture system and systematically validated their regulatory functions through multiple in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screens. We found that RAMP3, a component of the receptor for the neuropeptide CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), has a cell-intrinsic role in TH1 cell fate determination. Extracellular CGRP signalling through the receptor RAMP3–CALCRL restricted the differentiation of TH2 cells, but promoted TH1 cell differentiation through the activation of downstream cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). ATF3 promoted TH1 cell differentiation by inducing the expression of Stat1, a key regulator of TH1 cell differentiation. After viral infection, an interaction between CGRP produced by neurons and RAMP3 expressed on T cells enhanced the anti-viral IFNγ-producing TH1 and CD8+ T cell response, and timely control of acute viral infection. Our research identifies a neuroimmune circuit in which neurons participate in T cell fate determination by producing the neuropeptide CGRP during acute viral infection, which acts on RAMP3-expressing T cells to induce an effective anti-viral TH1 cell response.",

Our analyses of 304,103 plant species reveal that 94,052 species (31%) are native to islands, which constitute 5.3% of the global landmass4. Of these, 63,280 are island endemic species, which represent 21% of global plant diversity. Three-quarters of these are restricted to large or isolated islands. Compared with the world flora, island endemics are non-randomly distributed within the tree of life, with a total of 1,005 billion years of unique phylogenetic history with 17 families and 1,702 genera being entirely endemic to islands. Of all vascular plants assigned International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation categories5, 22% are island endemics. Among these endemic species, 51% are threatened, and 55% of all documented global extinctions have occurred on islands. We find that of all single-island endemic species, only 6% occur on islands meeting the United Nations 30×30 conservation target. Urgent measures including habitat restoration, invasive species removal and ex situ programmes are needed to protect the world’s island flora. Our checklist quantifies the uniqueness of island life, provides a basis for future studies of island floras, and highlights the urgent need to take actions for conserving them.",

However, populations of neurons can also exhibit transient bursts of spiking activity, wherein neurons fire in a specific temporal order or sequence6,7,8. The human brain may utilize these neuronal sequences within population bursts to efficiently represent information9,10,11,12, thereby complementing the well-known neural code based on spike rate or latency. Here we examined this possibility by recording the spiking activity of populations of single units in the human anterior temporal lobe as eight participants performed a visual categorization task. We find that population spiking activity organizes into bursts during the task. The temporal order of spiking across the activated units within each burst varies across stimulus categories, creating unique stereotypical sequences for individual categories as well as for individual exemplars within a category. The information conveyed by the temporal order of spiking activity is separable from and complements the information conveyed by the units’ spike rates or latencies following stimulus onset. Collectively, our data provide evidence that the human brain contains a complementary code based on the neuronal sequence within bursts of population spiking to represent information.",

          "abstract": "The risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) constitutes the main challenge associated with insulin therapy for diabetes1,2. Insulin doses must be adjusted to ensure that blood glucose values are within the normal range, but matching insulin doses to fluctuating glucose levels is difficult because even a slightly higher insulin dose than needed can lead to a hypoglycaemic incidence, which can be anything from uncomfortable to life-threatening. It has therefore been a long-standing goal to engineer a glucose-sensitive insulin that can auto-adjust its bioactivity in a reversible manner according to ambient glucose levels to ultimately achieve better glycaemic control while lowering the risk of hypoglycaemia3. Here we report the design and properties of NNC2215, an insulin conjugate with bioactivity that is reversibly responsive to a glucose range relevant for diabetes, as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. NNC2215 was engineered by conjugating a glucose-binding macrocycle4 and a glucoside to insulin, thereby introducing a switch that can open and close in response to glucose and thereby equilibrate insulin between active and less-active conformations. The insulin receptor affinity for NNC2215 increased 3.2-fold when the glucose concentration was increased from 3 to 20 mM. In animal studies, the glucose-sensitive bioactivity of NNC2215 was demonstrated to lead to protection against hypoglycaemia while partially covering glucose excursions.",

          "abstract": "Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N) deposition affect plant communities in numerous ways1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Nitrogen deposition causes local biodiversity loss globally12,13,14, but whether, and if so how, rising CO2 concentrations amplify or dampen those losses remains unclear and is almost entirely unstudied. We addressed this knowledge gap with an open-air experiment in which 108 grassland plots were grown for 24 years under different CO2 and N regimes. We initially found that adding N reduced plant species richness less at elevated than at ambient CO2. Over time, however, this interaction reversed, and elevated CO2 amplified losses in diversity from enriched N, tripling reductions in species richness from N addition over the last eight years of the study. These interactions resulted from temporal changes in the drivers of diversity, especially light availability, that were in turn driven by CO2 and N inputs and associated changes in plant biomass. This mechanism is likely to be similar in many grasslands, because additions of the plant resources CO2 and N are likely to increase the abundance of the dominant species. If rising CO2 generally exacerbates the widespread negative impacts of N deposition on plant diversity, this bodes poorly for the conservation of grassland biodiversity worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Oil has long been the dominant feedstock for producing fuels and chemicals, but coal, natural gas and biomass are increasingly explored alternatives 1–3 . Their conversion first generates syngas, a mixture of CO and H 2 , which is then processed further using Fischer–Tropsch (FT) chemistry. However, although commercial FT technology for fuel production is established, using it to access valuable chemicals remains challenging. A case in point is linear α-olefins (LAOs), which are important chemical intermediates obtained by ethylene oligomerization at present 4–8 . The commercial high-temperature FT process and the FT-to-olefin process under development at present both convert syngas directly to LAOs, but also generate much CO 2 waste that leads to a low carbon utilization efficiency 9–14 . The efficiency is further compromised by substantially fewer of the converted carbon atoms ending up as valuable C 5 –C 10 LAOs than are found in the C 2 –C 4 olefins that dominate the product mixtures 9–14 . Here we show that the use of the original phase-pure χ-iron carbide can minimize these syngas conversion problems: tailored and optimized for the process of FT to LAOs, this catalyst exhibits an activity at 290 °C that is 1–2 orders higher than dedicated FT-to-olefin catalysts can achieve above 320 °C (refs. 12–15 ), is stable for 200 h, and produces desired C 2 –C 10 LAOs and unwanted CO 2 with carbon-based selectivities of 51% and 9% under industrially relevant conditions. This higher catalytic performance, persisting over a wide temperature range (250–320 °C), demonstrates the potential of the system for developing a practically relevant technology.",

          "abstract": "Terrestrial photosynthesis, or gross primary production (GPP), is the largest carbon flux in the biosphere, but its global magnitude and spatiotemporal dynamics remain uncertain1. The global annual mean GPP is historically thought to be around 120 PgC yr−1 (refs. 2,3,4,5,6), which is about 30–50 PgC yr−1 lower than GPP inferred from the oxygen-18 (18O) isotope7 and soil respiration8. This disparity is a source of uncertainty in predicting climate–carbon cycle feedbacks9,10. Here we infer GPP from carbonyl sulfide, an innovative tracer for CO2 diffusion from ambient air to leaf chloroplasts through stomata and mesophyll layers. We demonstrate that explicitly representing mesophyll diffusion is important for accurately quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbonyl sulfide uptake by plants. From the estimate of carbonyl sulfide uptake by plants, we infer a global contemporary GPP of 157 (±8.5) PgC yr−1, which is consistent with estimates from 18O (150–175 PgC yr−1) and soil respiration (\\({149}_{-23}^{+29}\\) PgC yr−1), but with an improved confidence level. Our global GPP is higher than satellite optical observation-driven estimates (120–140 PgC yr–1) that are used for Earth system model benchmarking. This difference predominantly occurs in the pan-tropical rainforests and is corroborated by ground measurements11, suggesting a more productive tropics than satellite-based GPP products indicated. As GPP is a primary determinant of terrestrial carbon sinks and may shape climate trajectories9,10, our findings lay a physiological foundation on which the understanding and prediction of carbon–climate feedbacks can be advanced.",

The disease is characterized by a high concentration of glucose in the blood, owing to insufficient production of, or impaired responses to, the hormone insulin. Injecting synthetic insulin lowers blood glucose, but exercise or skipping meals can lead to hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose), which is a complication much feared by people with diabetes, because it can lead to loss of consciousness, coma or death. To avoid this situation, attempts to produce glucose-controlled insulin were initiated 45 years ago 2 and many strategies have been used since then, but without success. Writing in Nature , Hoeg-Jensen et al. 3 describe the engineering of a glucose-regulated insulin that can alter its own activity in response to glucose concentration.",

          "abstract": "As incarceration rates rise globally, the need to reduce re-offending grows increasingly urgent. We investigate whether positive group bonds can improve behaviours among incarcerated people via a unique soccer-based prison intervention, the Twinning Project. We analyse effects of participation compared to a control group (study 1, n = 676, n = 1,874 control cases) and longitudinal patterns of social cohesion underlying these effects (study 2, n = 388) in the United Kingdom. We also explore desistance from crime after release (study 3, n = 249) in the United Kingdom and the United States. As law-abiding behaviour also requires a supportive receiving community, we assessed factors influencing willingness to employ formerly incarcerated people in online samples in the United Kingdom and the United States (studies 4–9, n = 1,797). Results indicate that social bonding relates to both improved behaviour within prison and increased willingness of receiving communities to support re-integration efforts. Harnessing the power of group identities both within prison and receiving communities can help to address the global incarceration crisis.",

          "abstract": "Maintaining COVID-19 vaccine demand was key to ending the global health emergency. To help do this, many governments used chatbots that provided personalized information guiding people on where, when and how to get vaccinated. We designed and tested a WhatsApp chatbot to understand whether two-way interactive messaging incorporating behaviourally informed functionalities could perform better than one-way message reminders. We ran a large-scale preregistered randomized controlled trial with 249,705 participants in Argentina, measuring vaccinations using Ministry of Health records. The behaviourally informed chatbot more than tripled COVID-19 vaccine uptake compared with the control group (a 1.6 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (1.36 pp, 1.77 pp)) and nearly doubled uptake compared with the one-way message reminder (a 1 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (0.83 pp, 1.17 pp)). Communications tools designed with behaviourally informed functionalities that simplify the vaccine user journey can increase vaccination more than traditional message reminders and may have applications to other health behaviours.",

          "abstract": "Human infants are born with their eyes open and an otherwise limited motor repertoire; thus, studies measuring infant looking are commonly used to investigate the developmental origins of perception and cognition. However, scholars have long expressed concerns about the reliability and interpretation of looking behaviours. We evaluated these concerns using a pre-registered (https://osf.io/jghc3), systematic meta-analysis of 76 published and unpublished studies of infants’ early physical and psychological reasoning (total n = 1,899; 3- to 12-month-old infants; database search and call for unpublished studies conducted July to August 2022). We studied two effects in the same datasets: looking towards expected versus unexpected events (violation of expectation (VOE)) and looking towards visually familiar versus visually novel events (perceptual novelty (PN)). Most studies implemented methods to minimize the risk of bias (for example, ensuring that experimenters were naive to the conditions and reporting inter-rater reliability). There was mixed evidence about publication bias for the VOE effect. Most centrally to our research aims, we found that these two effects varied systematically—with roughly equal effect sizes (VOE, standardized mean difference 0.290 and 95% confidence interval (0.208, 0.372); PN, standardized mean difference 0.239 and 95% confidence interval (0.109, 0.369))—but independently, based on different predictors. Age predicted infants’ looking responses to unexpected events, but not visually novel events. Habituation predicted infants’ looking responses to visually novel events, but not unexpected events. From these findings, we suggest that conceptual and perceptual novelty independently influence infants’ looking behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Executive function (EF) delays are well documented in paediatric neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs). There is no consensus about whether EF delay represents a transdiagnostic feature of NDCs. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized 180 studies reporting two or more NDC comparisons on EF, examined differences between NDCs, and the moderating effects of gender, age, publication year, DSM editions and assessment types. Studies using established EF measures across seven domains (attention, fluency, set-shifting, set-switching, response inhibition, planning and working memory) in participants under 18 were included. Summary effects were compared: (1) for all reported NDCs relative to control, (2) for each individual NDC relative to control and (3) between NDC groups. Results confirmed that EF delay was a transdiagnostic feature of neurodevelopmental delay, with a moderate effect size of delay across all NDCs ( g = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–0.63) compared with control. This effect increased with comorbidities ( g = 0.72, 95% CI 0.59–0.86), DSM-5 criteria and informant measures. Comparisons between NDCs revealed few differences: children with tic disorders (TD) showed smaller EF delays, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed larger delays in attention, response inhibition, planning and working memory compared with TD and specific learning disorders, while children with autism spectrum disorders showed greater delays on set-switching compared with ADHD. Findings support transdiagnostic models of neurodevelopment to further a developmentally sensitive science that can reveal how EF delays contribute to brain circuitry, symptom profiles and functioning, and ultimately support early interventions and outcomes for all children with NDCs.",

          "abstract": "A sniff in humans typically lasts one to three seconds and is commonly considered to produce a long-exposure shot of the chemical environment that sets the temporal limit of olfactory perception. To break this limit, we devised a sniff-triggered apparatus that controls odorant deliveries within a sniff with a precision of 18 milliseconds. Using this apparatus, we show through rigorous psychophysical testing of 229 participants (649 sessions) that two odorants presented in one order and its reverse become perceptually discriminable when the stimulus onset asynchrony is merely 60 milliseconds (Cohen’s d = 0.48; 95% confidence interval, (55, 59); 120-millisecond difference). Discrimination performance improves with the length of stimulus onset asynchrony and is independent of explicit knowledge of the temporal order of odorants or the relative amount of odorant molecules accumulated in a sniff. Our findings demonstrate that human olfactory perception is sensitive to chemical dynamics within a single sniff and provide behavioural evidence for a temporal code of odour identity.",

          "abstract": "Effective health promotion may benefit from understanding how persuasion emerges. While earlier research has identified brain regions implicated in persuasion, these studies often relied on event-related analyses and frequently simplified persuasive communications. The present study investigates the neural basis of valuation change induced by a persuasive healthy eating call, employing naturalistic stimuli. Fifty healthy participants performed two blocks of a bidding task, in which they had to bid on sugar-containing, sugar-free, and nonedible products during functional MRI. In between the two blocks, they listened to a persuasive healthy eating call that influenced their bidding behavior. Intriguingly, participants who resisted persuasion exhibited increased synchronization of brain activity during listening in several regions, including default mode network structures. Additionally, intersubject functional connectivity among these brain regions was found to be weaker in persuaded individuals. These results emphasize the individualized nature of processing persuasive messages, challenging conventional interpretations of synchronized neural activity. Our findings support the emerging practice of tailoring persuasive messages in health promotion campaigns.",

          "abstract": "Based on current research, it is evident that the way people see themselves is shaped by their conversation partners. Historically, this literature focuses on how one individual’s expectations can shape another person’s self-views. Given the reciprocal nature of conversation, we wondered whether conversation partners’ self-views may mutually evolve. Using four-person round-robin conversation networks, we found that participants tended to have more similar self-views post-conversation than pre-conversation, an effect we term “inter-self alignment.” Further, the more two partners’ self-views aligned, the more they enjoyed their conversation and were inclined to interact again. This effect depended on both conversation partners becoming aligned. These findings suggest that the way we see ourselves is coauthored in the act of dialogue and that as shared self-views develop, the desire to continue the conversation increases.",

          "abstract": "Obesity is a major public health crisis in the United States (US) affecting 42% of the population, exacerbating a spectrum of other diseases and contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality overall. Recent advances in pharmaceutical interventions, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide) and dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., tirzepatide), have shown remarkable efficacy in weight-loss. However, limited access to these medications due to high costs and insurance coverage issues restricts their utility in mitigating the obesity epidemic. We quantify the annual mortality burden directly attributable to limited access to these medications in the US. By integrating hazard ratios of mortality across body mass index categories with current obesity prevalence data, combined with healthcare access, willingness to take the medication, and observed adherence to and efficacy of the medications, we estimate the impact of making these medications accessible to all those eligible. Specifically, we project that with expanded access, over 42,000 deaths could be averted annually, including more than 11,000 deaths among people with type 2 diabetes. These findings underscore the urgent need to address barriers to access and highlight the transformative public health impact that could be achieved by expanding access to these novel treatments.",

          "abstract": "We propose that experiencing a lack of personal control will increase people’s preferences for self-similar others and that this effect would be explained by a greater need for structure. Our hypotheses received support across 11 longitudinal, experimental, and archival studies composed of data from 60 countries (5 preregistered studies, N = 90,216). In an analysis of cross-country archival data, we found that respondents who indicated a lower sense of personal control were less likely to prefer to live with neighbors who had a different religion, race, or spoke a different language (Study 1). Study 2 found that participants who perceived lower (vs. higher) personal control indicated greater liking for coworkers who they perceived to be more self-similar across a wide range of characteristics (e.g., gender, personality). Studies 3a and 3b, two live-interaction experiments conducted in the United States and China, provided additional causal evidence for control-motivated similarity attraction. A causal experimental chain (Studies 4a to 4c) and a manipulation-of-mediation-as-a-moderator study (Study 5) provided evidence for the mediating effects of the need for structure. Study 6, a longitudinal study with Chinese employees, found that workers who reported perceiving a lower (vs. higher) sense of personal control preferred more self-similar coworkers, and this effect was mediated by a greater desire for structure. Finally, exploring downstream consequences, Studies 7a and 7b found that control-motivated similarity attraction was associated with a greater preference for homogenous (vs. diverse) groups. These findings highlight how the fundamental motive for personal control shapes the structure of social life.",

          "abstract": "Lockdowns were implemented to reduce the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. However, it is unclear how severely curtailed physical interaction shapes individual behaviors that are considered vital for socioeconomic development. In this exploratory study, we investigate the behavior of college students who experienced a strict campus-wide lockdown and those who did not. Employing a combination of experimental and survey methodologies, we elicit students’ behavioral variables, which are then integrated with administrative records from the university. We find that those exposed to the lockdown were more likely to trust others and be honest; however, their creativity was lower. Exposure to the lockdown was not found to significantly affect students’ trustworthiness, risk preferences, or competitiveness. A follow-up study reveals that the lower creativity among students may be attributed to reduced communication frequency with friends during the lockdown, mediating the lockdown’s impact. Conversely, the effects of the lockdown on trust and honesty may operate through a direct pathway, independent of changes in daily activities during the lockdown. Further analysis reveals a gender-dependent trend, with lockdowns exerting a more pronounced influence on male students than their female counterparts. These results underscore the consequences of lockdowns and advocate for enhanced support networks, emphasizing the importance of communicating with friends in similar circumstances.",

However, there are currently limited data on real-life effectiveness of the third-dose MMR vaccine in preventing mumps. Here, we used a deterministic compartmental model to infer the effectiveness of the third-dose MMR vaccine in preventing mumps cases by analyzing the mumps outbreak that occurred at the University of Iowa between August 24, 2015, and May 13, 2016. The modeling approach further allowed us to evaluate the population-level impact of vaccination by different timing in relation to the start of the outbreak and varied coverage levels, and to account for potential sources of bias in estimating vaccine effectiveness. We found large uncertainty in vaccine effectiveness estimates; however, our models showed that early introduction of a third dose of MMR vaccine during a mumps outbreak can be effective in preventing transmission. School holidays, such as the winter break, likely played important roles in preventing mumps transmission.",

          "authors": "Yuanyuan Tian, Xin Zhang, Boyuan Hou, Asker Jarlöv, Chunyang Du, Kun Zhou",
          "abstract": "Shear bands frequently appear in lattice architectures subjected to compression, leading to an unstable stress–strain curve and global deformation. This deformation mechanism reduces their energy absorption and loading-bearing capacity and causes the architectures to prioritize mechanical protection of external components at the expense of the entire structure. Here, we leverage the design freedom offered by additive manufacturing and the geometrical relation of dual-phase nanolamellar crystals to fabricate heterogeneous lamellar lattice architectures consisting of body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cells in alternating lamella. The lamellar lattice demonstrates more than 10 and 9 times higher specific energy absorption and energy absorption efficiency, respectively, compared to the BCC lattice. The drastic improvement arises as the nucleation of shear bands is inhibited by the discrete energy threshold for plastic buckling of adjacent heterogeneous lattice lamella during loading. Despite its lower density than the FCC lattice, the lamellar lattice exhibits significant enhancement in plateau stress and crushing force efficiency, attributed to the strengthening effect induced by simultaneous deformation of unit cells in the BCC lattice lamella and the resulting cushion shielding effect. The design improves the global mechanical properties, making lamellar lattices compare favorably against numerous materials proposed for mechanical protection. Additionally, it provides opportunities to program the local mechanical response, achieving programmable internal protection alongside overall external protection. This work provides a different route to design lattice architecture by combining internal and external dual mechanical protection, enabling a generation of multiple mechanical protectors in aerospace, automotive, and transportation fields.",

          "abstract": "The major organelles of the endomembrane system were in place by the time of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) (~1.5 billion years ago). Their acquisitions were defining milestones during eukaryogenesis. Comparative cell biology and evolutionary analyses show multiple instances of homology in the protein machinery controlling distinct interorganelle trafficking routes. Resolving these homologous relationships allows us to explore processes underlying the emergence of additional, distinct cellular compartments, infer ancestral states predating LECA, and explore the process of eukaryogenesis itself. Here, we undertake a molecular evolutionary analysis (including providing a transcriptome of the jakobid flagellate Reclinomonas americana ), exploring the origins of the machinery responsible for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LROs), the Biogenesis of LRO Complexes (BLOCs 1,2, and 3). This pathway has been studied only in animals and is not considered a feature of the basic eukaryotic cell plan. We show that this machinery is present across the eukaryotic tree of life and was likely in place prior to LECA, making it an underappreciated facet of eukaryotic cellular organisation. Moreover, we resolve multiple points of ancient homology between all three BLOCs and other post-endosomal retrograde trafficking machinery (BORC, CCZ1 and MON1 proteins, and an unexpected relationship with the “homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting” (HOPS) and “Class C core vacuole/endosomal tethering” (CORVET) complexes), offering a mechanistic and evolutionary unification of these trafficking pathways. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive account of the rise of the LROs biogenesis machinery from before the LECA to current eukaryotic diversity, integrating it into the larger mechanistic framework describing endomembrane evolution.",

          "abstract": "Liquid–liquid phase separation has emerged as a crucial mechanism driving the formation of membraneless biomolecular condensates, which play important roles in numerous cellular processes. These condensates, found both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, are formed through multivalent, low-affinity interactions between various molecules. P62-containing condensates serve, among other functions, as proteolytic hubs for the ubiquitin–proteasome system. In this study, we investigated the dynamic interplay between nuclear p62 condensates and promyelocytic nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). We show that p62 condensates stabilize PML-NBs under both basal conditions and following exposure to arsenic trioxide which stimulates their degradation. We further show that this effect on the stability of PML-NBs is due to sequestration of their ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 in the p62 condensates with subsequent rapid degradation of the ligase. The sequestration of the ligase is made possible by association between the proline-rich domain of the PML protein and the PB1 domain of p62, which results in the formation of a PML-NB shell around the p62 condensates. Importantly, these hybrid structures do not undergo fusion and mixing of their contents which leaves unsolved the mechanism of sequestration of RNF4 in the condensates. These findings suggest an additional possible mechanism of PML-NB as a tumor suppressor which is mediated via interactions between different biomolecular condensates.",

          "abstract": "RNA N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) demethylase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) plays a crucial role in regulating innate immunity. Lysine acylation, a widespread protein modification, influences protein function, but its impact on ALKBH5 during viral infections has not been well characterized. This study investigates the presence and regulatory mechanisms of a previously unidentified lysine acylation in ALKBH5 and its role in mediating m 6 A modifications to activate antiviral innate immune responses. We demonstrate that ALKBH5 undergoes lactylation, which is essential for an effective innate immune response against DNA herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and mpox virus (MPXV). This lactylation attenuates viral replication. Mechanistically, viral infections enhance ALKBH5 lactylation by increasing its interaction with acetyltransferase ESCO2 and decreasing its interaction with deacetyltransferase SIRT6. Lactylated ALKBH5 binds interferon-beta (IFN-β) messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to demethylation of its m 6 A modifications and promoting IFN-β mRNA biogenesis. Overexpression of ESCO2 or depletion of SIRT6 further enhances ALKBH5 lactylation to strengthen IFN-β mRNA biogenesis. Our results identify a posttranslational modification of ALKBH5 and its role in regulating antiviral innate immune responses through m 6 A modification. The finding provides an understanding of innate immunity and offers a potential therapeutic target for HSV-1, KSHV, and MPXV infections.",

          "abstract": "Ribonuclease P (RNase P) plays a vital role in the maturation of tRNA across bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. However, how RNase P assembles various components to achieve specific cleavage of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) in different organisms remains elusive. In this study, we employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to probe the dynamics of RNase P from E. coli ( Escherichia coli ) and Mja ( Methanocaldococcus jannaschii ) during pre-tRNA cleavage by incorporating five Cy3-Cy5 pairs into pre-tRNA and RNase P. Our results revealed significant differences in the assembly and catalytic mechanisms of RNase P between E. coli and Mja at both the RNA and protein levels. Specifically, the RNA of E. coli RNase P ( Eco RPR) can adopt an active conformation that is capable of binding and cleaving pre-tRNA with high specificity independently. The addition of the protein component of E. coli RNase P (RnpA) enhances and accelerates pre-tRNA cleavage efficiency by increasing and stabilizing the active conformation. In contrast, Mja RPR is unable to form the catalytically active conformation on its own, and at least four proteins are required to induce the correct folding of Mja RPR. Mutation experiments suggest that the functional deficiency of Mja RPR arises from the absence of the second structural layer, and proper intermolecular assembly is essential for Mja RNase P to be functional over a broad temperature range. We propose models to illustrate the distinct catalytic patterns and RNA–protein interactions of RNase P in these two organisms.",

          "abstract": "Expanding the protein fold space beyond linear chains is of fundamental significance, yet remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the creation of seven topological isoforms (i.e., linear, cyclic, knot, lasso, pseudorotaxane, and catenane) from a single protein fold precursor by rewiring the connectivity of secondary structure elements of the SpyTag-SpyCatcher complex and mutating the reactive residue on SpyTag to abolish the isopeptide bonding. These topological isoforms can be directly expressed in cells. Their topologies were confirmed by combined techniques of proteolytic digestion, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and topological transformation. To study the effects of topology on their structures and properties, their biophysical properties were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HSQC-NMR), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were further performed to reveal the atomic details of structural changes upon unfolding. Both experimental and simulation results suggest that they share a similar, well-folded hydrophobic core but exhibit distinct folding/unfolding dynamic behaviors. These results shed light onto the folding landscape of topological isoforms derived from the same protein fold. As a model system, this work improves our understanding of protein structure and dynamics beyond linear chains and suggests that protein folds are highly amenable to topological variation.",

          "abstract": "The fabrication of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) using liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) that are tolerant to substrate roughness is explored in this work. Traditional soft adhesives are designed by maintaining a balance between their cohesive strength and compliance. However, rough surfaces can significantly affect the adhesion strength of PSAs. Lowering the stiffness of the adhesive by reducing the cross-linking density or using additives can improve contact on rough surfaces. But this also decreases the cohesive strength and affects the overall performance of the adhesive. Additive-free LCE-based adhesives are shown to overcome these challenges due to their unique properties. Soft elasticity of LCE and low cross-link density contribute to their high compliance, while moderate cross-linking provides finite strength. The effect of contact time and substrate roughness on the adhesive performance is evaluated using probe-tack, indentation, lap shear, and static loading experiments. The unique combination of properties offered by LCE can lead to the development of roughness-tolerant adhesives, thereby broadening the application scope of PSAs.",

          "abstract": "Hibernation is a widespread and highly efficient mechanism to save energy in mammals. However, one major challenge of hibernation is maintaining blood circulation at low body temperatures, which strongly depends on the viscoelastic properties of red blood cells (RBCs). Here, we examined at physiologically relevant timescales the thermomechanical properties of hundreds of thousands of individual RBCs from the hibernating common noctule bat ( Nyctalus noctula ), the nonhibernating Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ), and humans ( Homo sapiens ). We exposed RBCs to temperatures encountered during normothermia and hibernation and found a significant increase in elasticity and viscosity with decreasing temperatures. Our data demonstrate that temperature adjustment of RBCs is mainly driven by membrane properties and not the cytosol while viscous dissipation in the membrane of both bat species exceeds the one in humans by a factor of 15. Finally, our results show that RBCs from both bat species reveal a transition to a more viscous-like state when temperature decreases. This process on a minute timescale has an effect size that is comparable with fluctuations in RBC viscoelasticity over the course of the year, implying that environmental factors, such as diets, have a lower impact on the capability of RBCs to respond to different temperatures than general physical properties of the cell membrane.

          "abstract": "Free radical generation plays a key role in many biological processes including cell communication, maturation, and aging. In addition, free radical generation is usually elevated in cells under stress as is the case for many different pathological conditions. In liver tissue, cells produce radicals when exposed to toxic substances but also, for instance, in cancer, alcoholic liver disease and liver cirrhosis. However, free radicals are small, short-lived, and occur in low abundance making them challenging to detect and especially to time resolve, leading to a lack of nanoscale information. Recently, our group has demonstrated that diamond-based quantum sensing offers a solution to measure free radical generation in single living cells. The method is based on defects in diamonds, the so-called nitrogen-vacancy centers, which change their optical properties based on their magnetic surrounding. As a result, this technique reveals magnetic resonance signals by optical means offering high sensitivity. However, compared to cells, there are several challenges that we resolved here: Tissues are more fragile, have a higher background fluorescence, have less particle uptake, and do not adhere to microscopy slides. Here, we overcame those challenges and adapted the method to perform measurements in living tissues. More specifically, we used precision-cut liver slices and were able to detect free radical generation during a stress response to ethanol, as well as the reduction in the radical load after adding an antioxidant.",

The images were computationally processed to fill in the missing wedges of data caused by incomplete tomographic tilts. The resulting structures increased z-resolution enabling an extension of the proposed architecture to that of mitotic chromosomes. Here, we provide additional insights into the chromosome architecture that was recently published [M. Elbaum et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 119 , e2119101119 (2022)]. We build on the defined chromosomes time-dependent structures in an effort to probe their dynamics. Variants of the coiled chromosome structures, possibly further defining specific regions, are discussed. We propose, based on generalized specific uncoiling of mitotic chromosomes in telophase, large-scale reorganization of interphase chromosomes. Chromosome territories, organized as micron-sized small patches, are constructed, satisfying complex volume considerations. Finally, we unveiled the structures of replicated coiled chromosomes, still attached to centromeres, as part of chromosome architecture.",

Similar evidence for effects on traits linked to fitness in nature is rare, not least because experimentally manipulating the gut microbiota is challenging. We isolated, characterized, and cultured a bacterial strain, Lactobacillus kimchicus APC4233, directly from a wild bird (the great tit Parus major ) and provided it as a self-administered dietary supplement. We assessed the impact of the treatment on the host microbiota community, on weight, and tested whether the treatment affected a previous result linking microbiota alpha diversity to weight in nestlings. The treatment dramatically increased L. kimchicus abundance in the gut microbiota and increased alpha diversity. This effect was strongest in the youngest birds, validating earlier findings pointing to a brief developmental window when the gut microbiota are most sensitive. In time-lagged models, nestling weight was higher in the treatment birds suggesting L. kimchicus may have probiotic potential. There was also a positive time-lagged relationship between diversity and weight in control birds but not in the treatment birds, suggesting L. kimchicus helped birds compensate for low alpha diversity. We discuss why ecological context is likely key when predicting impacts of the microbiome. The manipulation of the gut microbiota with a host native strain in this wild population provides direct evidence for the role of the microbiota in the ecology and evolution of natural populations.",

          "abstract": "Obesity is one of the primary risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA), acting through cross talk among altered biomechanics, metabolism, adipokines, and dietary free fatty acid (FA) composition. Obesity and aging have been linked to cellular senescence in various tissues, resulting in increased local and systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction. We hypothesized that obesity and joint injury lead to cellular senescence that is typically associated with increased OA severity or with aging and that the ratio of omega-6 (ω-6) to omega-3 (ω-3) FAs regulates these pathologic effects. Mice were placed on an ω-6-rich high-fat diet or a lean control diet and underwent destabilization of the medial meniscus to induce OA. Obesity and joint injury significantly increased cellular senescence in subcutaneous and visceral fat as well as joint tissues such as synovium and cartilage. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for fat-1 , a fatty acid desaturase that converts ω-6 to ω-3 FAs, decreasing the serum ω-6:ω-3 FA ratio had a strong senomorphic and therapeutic effect, mitigating metabolic dysfunction, cellular senescence, and joint degeneration. In vitro coculture of bone marrow-derived macrophages and chondrocytes from control and AAV8- fat1- treated mice were used to examine the roles of various FA mediators in regulating chondrocyte senescence. Our results suggest that obesity and joint injury result in a premature “aging” of the joint as measured by senescence markers, and these changes can be ameliorated by altering FA composition using fat-1 gene therapy. These findings support the potential for fat-1 gene therapy to treat obesity- and/or injury-induced OA clinically.",

          "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) slows aging in many animals, while in some cases, the sensory signals from diet alone are sufficient to retard or accelerate lifespan. The digestive tract is a candidate location to sense nutrients, where neuropeptides secreted by enteroendocrine cells (EEC) produce systemic signals in response to food. Here, we measure how Drosophila neuropeptide F (NPF) is secreted into adult circulation by EEC and find that specific EEC differentially respond to dietary sugar and yeast. Female lifespan is increased when gut NPF is genetically depleted, and this manipulation is sufficient to blunt the longevity benefit conferred by DR. Depletion of NPF receptors at insulin-producing neurons of the brain also increases female lifespan, consistent with observations where loss of gut NPF decreases neuronal insulin secretion. The longevity conferred by repressing gut NPF and brain NPF receptors is reversed by treating adults with a juvenile hormone (JH) analog. JH is produced by the adult corpora allata, and inhibition of the insulin receptor at this tissue decreases JH titer and extends lifespan in both males and females, while this longevity is restored to wild type by treating adults with a JH analog. Overall, EEC of the gut modulate Drosophila aging through interorgan communication mediated by a gut–brain–corpora allata axis, and insulin produced in the brain impacts lifespan through its control of JH titer. These data suggest that we consider how human incretins and their analogs, which are used to treat obesity and diabetes, may impact aging.",

However, the role of BLNK in Syk-coupled C-type lectin receptor (CLR) signaling in macrophages remains unclear. Here, we delineate that CLRs govern the Syk-mediated activation of BLNK, thereby impeding macrophage migration by disrupting podosome ring formation upon stimulation with fungal β-glucans or α-mannans. Mechanistically, BLNK instigates its association with casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl), competitively impeding the interaction between c-Cbl and Src-family kinase Fyn. This interference disrupts Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of c-Cbl and subsequent c-Cbl-associated F-actin assembly. Consequently, BLNK deficiency intensifies CLR-mediated recruitment of the c-Cbl/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex to the F-actin cytoskeleton, thereby enhancing macrophage migration. Notably, mice with monocyte-specific BLNK deficiency exhibit heightened resistance to infection with Candida albicans , a prominent human fungal pathogen. This resistance is attributed to the increased infiltration of Ly6C + macrophages into renal tissue. These findings unveil a previously unrecognized role of BLNK for the negative regulation of macrophage migration through inhibiting CLR-mediated podosome ring formation during fungal infections.",

          "authors": "Andrew K. Davis, Jordan R. Croy, William E. Snyder",
          "abstract": "The conservation status of monarch butterflies in North America is a topic of intense scrutiny and debate. It is clear that winter colonies in Mexico are declining, yet some recent studies suggest that summer breeding populations are relatively stable and similar to historical abundances. One possible explanation for these discordant patterns is that fall migration success has been recently disrupted. Here, we use a relatively unexplored citizen-scientist dataset on the size of monarch “roosts,” which are resting aggregations on vegetation, to infer changes in monarch abundance along the fall migration route over the last 17 y. We found that the timing of migration remained relatively unchanged while the flyway has generally become warmer and greener. Warmer and greener conditions were associated with larger roosts, yet we found steady, dramatic declines in roost sizes through time that were independent of climate and landscape factors. Roost sizes have declined as much as 80%, with losses increasing from north to south along the migration route. These findings suggest that failure during the fall migration could explain the apparent drop in monarch numbers from summer breeding to overwintering populations. This in turn suggests that conservation efforts that support fall migration success are most needed, such as providing high quality nectar plants along the migration route or limiting the planting of nonnative milkweeds that enhance monarch parasite loads. Overall, it appears the fall migration of monarch butterflies is under imminent threat, even if the species’ overall survival is not.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic changes in intracellular ultrastructure can be critical for the ability of organisms to acclimate to environmental conditions. Microalgae, which are responsible for ~50% of global photosynthesis, compartmentalize their Ribulose 1,5 Bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (Rubisco) into a specialized structure known as the pyrenoid when the cells experience limiting CO 2 conditions; this compartmentalization is a component of the CO 2 Concentrating Mechanism (CCM), which facilitates photosynthetic CO 2 fixation as environmental levels of inorganic carbon (Ci) decline. Changes in the spatial distribution of mitochondria in green algae have also been observed under CO 2 limitation, although a role for this reorganization in CCM function remains unclear. We used the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to monitor changes in mitochondrial position and ultrastructure as cells transition between high CO 2 and Low/Very Low CO 2 (LC/VLC). Upon transferring cells to VLC, the mitochondria move from a central to a peripheral cell location and orient in parallel tubular arrays that extend along the cell’s apico-basal axis. We show that these ultrastructural changes correlate with CCM induction and are regulated by the CCM master regulator CIA5. The apico-basal orientation of the mitochondrial membranes, but not the movement of the mitochondrion to the cell periphery, is dependent on microtubules and the MIRO1 protein, with the latter involved in membrane–microtubule interactions. Furthermore, blocking mitochondrial respiration in VLC-acclimated cells reduces the affinity of the cells for Ci. Overall, our results suggest that mitochondrial repositioning functions in integrating cellular architecture and energetics with CCM activities and invite further exploration of how intracellular architecture can impact fitness under dynamic environmental conditions.",

Burmese pythons possess extreme intestinal regenerative capacity yet lack crypts, thus providing opportunities to identify noncanonical but potentially conserved mechanisms that expand our understanding of regenerative capacity in vertebrates, including humans. Here, we leverage single-nucleus RNA sequencing of fasted and postprandial python small intestine to identify the signaling pathways and cell–cell interactions underlying the python’s regenerative response. We find that python intestinal regeneration entails the activation of multiple conserved mechanisms of growth and stress response, including core lipid metabolism pathways and the unfolded protein response in intestinal enterocytes. Our single-cell resolution highlights extensive heterogeneity in mesenchymal cell population signaling and intercellular communication that directs major tissue restructuring and the shift out of a dormant fasted state by activating both embryonic developmental and wound healing pathways. We also identify distinct roles of BEST4+ enterocytes in coordinating key regenerative transitions via NOTCH signaling. Python intestinal regeneration shares key signaling features and molecules with mammalian gastric bypass, indicating that conserved regenerative programs are common to both. Our findings provide different insights into cooperative and conserved regenerative programs and intercellular interactions in vertebrates independent of crypts which have been otherwise obscured in model species where temporal phases of generative growth are limited to embryonic development or recovery from injury.",

Goblet cells provide the mucous surface of the gut, and when present in colorectal cancers (CRC), the cancers are called mucinous. We have used the presence of MUC2, the main mucous product of goblet cells, and an associated gene product, TFF3, to classify a large panel of nearly 80 CRC-derived cell lines into five categories based on their levels of MUC2 and TFF3 expression. We have then shown that these five patterns of expression can be easily identified in the direct analysis of tumor specimens allowing a much finer characterization of CRCs with respect to the presence of goblet cell differentiation. In particular, about 30% of all CRCs fall into the category of expressing TFF3 but not MUC2, which has not previously been acknowledged. Using the cell line data, we suggest that there are up to 12 genes ( MUC2, TFF3, ATOH1, SPDEF, CDX1, CDX2, GATA6, HES1, ETS2, OLFM4, TOX3, and LGR5 ) that may be involved in selection against goblet cell differentiation in CRC by changes in methylation rather than mutations. Of these, LGR5 , which is particularly associated with lack of goblet cell features, may function in the control of differentiation rather than direct control of cell growth, as has so far mostly been assumed. These results emphasize the importance of methylation changes in driving cancer progression.",

MurG redeploys to the forespore surface during sporulation, where we show that the local pH is reduced and propose that this change in cytosolic nanoenvironment abrogates MurG function. Further, we show that SpoVK participates in a developmental checkpoint in which improper spore surface assembly mis-localizes SpoVK, which leads to sporulation arrest. The AAA+ ATPase clade containing SpoVK includes specialized chaperones involved in secretion, cell envelope biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that such fine-tuning might be a widespread feature of different subcellular nanoenvironments.",

Previously, we showed that Caenorhabditis elegans manf-1 null mutants exhibit defects such as increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and abnormal protein aggregation. These findings suggest an essential role for MANF in cellular processes. However, the mechanisms by which intracellular and extracellular MANF regulate broader cellular functions remain unclear. We report a unique mechanism of action for MANF-1 that involves the transcription factor HLH-30/TFEB-mediated signaling to regulate autophagy and lysosomal function. Multiple transgenic strains overexpressing MANF-1 showed extended lifespan of animals, reduced protein aggregation, and improved neuronal survival. Using fluorescently tagged MANF-1, we observed tissue-specific localization of the protein, which was dependent on the ER retention signal. Further subcellular analysis showed that MANF-1 localizes within cells to the lysosomes and utilizes the endosomal pathway. Consistent with the lysosomal localization, our transcriptomic study of MANF-1 and analyses of autophagy regulators demonstrated that MANF-1 promotes proteostasis by regulating autophagic flux and lysosomal activity. Collectively, our findings establish MANF as a critical regulator of stress response, proteostasis, and aging.",

          "abstract": "Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there exists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows with low Reynolds number. This has triggered a search for alternative hydroelectric conversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet triboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy, or flow-induced ionic Coulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate charge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that the kinetic energy of small-scale “waste” flows can be directly and efficiently converted into electricity thanks to the hydroelectronic drag effect, by which an ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between fluid motion and electron transport. We develop a nonequilibrium thermodynamic formalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion, dubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to thermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless figure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this figure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the liquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest strategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste flow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.",

          "abstract": "As catabolic enzyme, CD73 dephosphorylates adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and can also regulate tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. To date, very few studies have explored the role of CD73 in mediating non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis, and the underlying transducing signal has not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that the CD73/Axl axis could regulate Smad3-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote NSCLC metastasis. Mechanically, CD73 can be secreted via the Golgi apparatus transport pathway. Then secreted CD73 may activate AXl by directly bind with site R55 located in Axl extracellular domain independently of GAS6. In addition, we proved that CD73 can stabilize Axl expression via inhibiting CBLB expression. We also identified the distinct function of CD73 activity in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings indicated a role of CD73 in mediating NSCLC metastasis and propose it as a therapeutic target for NSCLC.",

          "abstract": "The chemical compositions of island arc basalts (IAB) reflect contributions from the mantle as well as fluids and melts from the subducting slab. Addition of radiogenic seawater Sr to oceanic crust through hydrothermal alteration and subsequent subduction is often invoked to explain elevated 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures in modern IAB. However, changes in the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of island arc magmatic rocks through time has not been investigated, limiting our understanding of the factors influencing the Sr budgets of arcs throughout Earth’s history. To address this, we compiled 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values from island arc magmatic rocks ranging in age from modern to Paleoproterozoic, only including data from island arc localities that best preserve initial magmatic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. Median initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values are consistently elevated compared to depleted mantle 87 Sr/ 86 Sr over this period, indicating persistent enrichment in radiogenic Sr in island arcs. Moreover, the elevation in island arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr relative to the depleted mantle is variable. A notable rise in island arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr during the late Neoproterozoic coincides with a steep increase in seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and Sr concentration. To investigate this potential connectivity, we modeled the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of island arc magmas between 0 and 830 Ma with inputs of depleted mantle 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and seawater Sr concentration. The model reproduces the overall trajectory of the compiled data. We interpret the observed temporal variation in island arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values and its close association with fluctuations in seawater chemistry as evidence that changes in marine geochemistry have strongly influenced the Sr isotopic record of island arc magmas over time.",

With a unique stacking configuration analogous to the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model, rhombohedral graphite (RG) is a potential candidate for realizing both flat bands and nontrivial topological physics. Here, we report experimental evidence of topological flat bands (TFBs) on the surface of bulk RG, which are topologically protected by bulk helical Dirac nodal lines via the bulk-boundary correspondence. Moreover, upon in situ electron doping, the surface TFBs show a splitting with exotic doping evolution, with an order-of-magnitude increase in the bandwidth of the lower split band, and pinning of the upper band near the Fermi level. These experimental observations together with Hartree–Fock calculations suggest that correlation effects are important in this system. Our results demonstrate RG as a platform for investigating the rich interplay between nontrivial band topology, correlation effects, and interaction-driven symmetry-broken states.",

Striatal dopamine converges downstream to Adenylyl Cyclase Type 5 (AC5)-mediated synthesis of cAMP, indicating the essential role of signal transduction in motor physiology. However, the relationship between dopamine decoding and AC5 regulation is unknown. Here, we utilized an unbiased global protein stability screen to identify Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain 1 (KCTD1) as a key regulator of AC5 level that is mechanistically tied to N-linked glycosylation. We then implemented a CRISPR/SaCas9 approach to eliminate KCTD1 in striatal neurons expressing a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP biosensor. 2-photon imaging of striatal neurons in intact circuits uncovered that dopaminergic signaling was substantially compromised in the absence of KCTD1. Finally, knockdown of KCTD1 in genetically defined dorsal striatal neurons significantly altered motor behavior in mice. These results reveal that KCTD1 acts as an essential modifier of dopaminergic signaling by stabilizing striatal AC5.",

          "authors": "Giulia Paiardi, Matheus Ferraz, Marco Rusnati, Rebecca C. Wade",
          "abstract": "Although it is well established that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds to the host cell ACE2 receptor to initiate infection, far less is known about the tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility to the virus. Differential expression across different cell types of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, with variably sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and their synergistic interactions with host and viral N-glycans may contribute to tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility. Nevertheless, their contribution remains unclear since HS and N-glycans evade experimental characterization. We, therefore, carried out microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, followed by random acceleration molecular dynamics simulations, of the fully glycosylated spike:ACE2 complex with and without highly sulfated GAG chains bound. By considering the model GAGs as surrogates for the highly sulfated HS expressed in lung cells, we identified key cell entry mechanisms of spike SARS-CoV-2. We find that HS promotes structural and energetic stabilization of the active conformation of the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and reorientation of ACE2 toward the N-terminal domain in the same spike subunit as the RBD. Spike and ACE2 N-glycans exert synergistic effects, promoting better packing, strengthening the protein:protein interaction, and prolonging the residence time of the complex. ACE2 and HS binding trigger rearrangement of the S2’ functional protease cleavage site through allosteric interdomain communication. These results thus show that HS has a multifaceted role in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they provide a mechanistic basis for the development of GAG derivatives with anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential.",

Here, we compared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of human and bat ( Rhinolophus ferrumequinum ) pluripotent cells and fibroblasts. Since bat cells do not express an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that allows virus infection, we transduced the human ACE2 (hA) receptor into the cells and found that transduced cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Compared to human embryonic stem cells-hA, infected bat induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-hA produced about a 100-fold lower level of infectious virus and displayed lower toxicity. In contrast, bat embryonic fibroblast-hA produced no infectious virus while being infectable and synthesizing viral RNA and proteins, suggesting abortive infection. Indeed, electron microscopy failed to detect virus-like particles in infected bat fibroblasts in contrast to bat iPSCs or human cells, consistent with the latter producing infectious viruses. This suggests that bat somatic but not pluripotent cells have an effective mechanism to control virus replication. Consistent with previous results by others, we find that bat cells have a constitutively activated innate immune system, which might limit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to human cells.",

Whether personal light exposure predicts mortality risk has not been established. We therefore investigated whether personal day and night light, and light patterns that disrupt circadian rhythms, predicted mortality risk. UK Biobank participants (N = 88,905, 62.4 ± 7.8 y, 57% female) wore light sensors for 1 wk. Day and night light exposures were defined by factor analysis of 24-h light profiles. A computational model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from light data. Cause-specific mortality was recorded in 3,750 participants across a mean (±SD) follow-up period of 8.0 ± 1.0 y. Individuals with brighter day light had incrementally lower all-cause mortality risk (adjusted-HR ranges: 0.84 to 0.90 [50 to 70th light exposure percentiles], 0.74 to 0.84 [70 to 90th], and 0.66 to 0.83 [90 to 100th]), and those with brighter night light had incrementally higher all-cause mortality risk (aHR ranges: 1.15 to 1.18 [70 to 90th], and 1.21 to 1.34 [90 to 100th]), compared to individuals in darker environments (0 to 50th percentiles). Individuals with lower circadian amplitude (aHR range: 0.90 to 0.96 per SD), earlier circadian phase (aHR range: 1.16 to 1.30), or later circadian phase (aHR range: 1.13 to 1.20) had higher all-cause mortality risks. Day light, night light, and circadian amplitude predicted cardiometabolic mortality, with larger hazard ratios than for mortality by other causes. Findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, photoperiod, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Minimizing night light, maximizing day light, and keeping regular light–dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity.",

However, the functions of ubr5 within animals remain unclear due to lethality in both mammals and flies when disrupted. Using Caenorhabditis elegans , we show that UBR-5 E3 ligase is required for timely exit of stem fate and complete transition into multiple cell type descendants in an ectodermal blast lineage. Animals lacking intact UBR-5 function simultaneously exhibit both stem fate and differentiated fate in the same descendant cells. A functional screen of UBR-5 physical interactors allowed us to identify the UBE2D2/3 E2 conjugase LET-70 working with UBR-5 to exit stem fate. Strikingly, we revealed that another UBR-5 physical interactor, namely the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 ortholog PABP-2, worked antagonistically to UBR-5 and LET-70. Lowering pabp-2 levels restored normal transition of cell state out of stemness and promoted normal cell fusion when either ubr-5 or let-70 UBE2D function was compromised. The UBR-5-LET-70 and PABP-2 switch works independently of the stem pool size determined by pluripotency factors like lin-28. UBR-5 limits PABP-2 protein and reverses the PABP-2-dependent gene expression program including developmental, proteostasis, and innate immunity genes. Loss of ubr-5 rescues the developmental stall when pabp-2 is compromised. Disruption of ubr-5 elevates PABP-2 levels and prolongs expression of ectodermal and muscle stem markers at the transition to adulthood. Additionally, ubr-5 mutants exhibit an extended period of motility during aging and suppress pabp-2- dependent early onset of immobility.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial ice nucleating proteins (INPs) are exceptionally effective in promoting the kinetically hindered transition of water to ice. Their efficiency relies on the assembly of INPs into large functional aggregates, with the size of ice nucleation sites determining activity. Experimental freezing spectra have revealed two distinct, defined aggregate sizes, typically classified as class A and C ice nucleators (INs). Despite the importance of INPs and years of extensive research, the precise number of INPs forming the two aggregate classes, and their assembly mechanism have remained enigmatic. Here, we report that bacterial ice nucleation activity emerges from more than two prevailing aggregate species and identify the specific number of INPs responsible for distinct crystallization temperatures. We find that INP dimers constitute class C INs, tetramers class B INs, and hexamers and larger multimers are responsible for the most efficient class A activity. We propose a hierarchical assembly mechanism based on tyrosine interactions for dimers, and electrostatic interactions between INP dimers to produce larger aggregates. This assembly is membrane-assisted: Increasing the bacterial outer membrane fluidity decreases the population of the larger aggregates, while preserving the dimers. Inversely, Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline buffer increases the population of multimeric class A and B aggregates 200-fold and endows the bacteria with enhanced stability toward repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Our analysis suggests that the enhancement results from the better alignment of dimers in the negatively charged outer membrane, due to screening of their electrostatic repulsion. This demonstrates significant enhancement of the most potent bacterial INs.",

Using a fleet turnover model and future electricity generation mix scenarios, we compare ambitious vehicle electrification to fleet renewal relying on newer internal combustion engine vehicles, without electric vehicles. The model includes vehicle-level pollutant emission factors and a reduced complexity air quality and valuation model and covers direct (tailpipe, brake wear, and tire wear) and indirect (production of electricity and liquid fuels) emissions of NO x , SO 2 , PM 2.5 , NH 3 , and VOCs, with a breakdown at the county level to identify geographical disparities in the distribution of health impacts. Short-term health benefits are mostly generated by reductions in NO x emissions from newer gasoline vehicles, while fleet electrification generates further benefits in the long term. The electricity mix plays a crucial role in the success of electrification policies. With continued grid decarbonization, electrification would reduce harmful air quality–related health impacts cumulatively by 84 to 188 billion USD over the study period, compared with fleet renewal without electric vehicles. In contrast, artificially freezing the 2022 grid would make electrification responsible for 32 to 71 billion USD additional health disbenefits compared with fleet renewal. Finally, we show that while fleet electrification achieves most of its benefits over fleet renewal in the long term, delaying the implementation of such policies would sacrifice meaningful cumulative benefits.",

When water was not limiting, all genotypes cooled leaves 2 to 5 °C below air temperatures. Homeothermic cooling was disrupted for weeks following a 72-h reduction in soil water, resulting in leaf temperatures rising 3 °C above air temperature and 1.3 °C above leaf thresholds for physiological damage, despite the water stress having little effect on leaf water potentials. Tradeoffs between leaf thermal safety and hydraulic safety emerged but, regardless of water use strategy, all genotypes experienced significant leaf mortality following water stress. Genotypes from warmer climates showed greater leaf cooling and less leaf mortality after water stress in comparison with genotypes from cooler climates.

Yet, the impact of such asymmetric seasonal warming on soil microbial carbon metabolism and growth remains poorly understood. Using 18 O isotope labeling, we examined the effects of a decade-long experimental seasonal warming on microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and growth in alpine grassland ecosystems. Moreover, the quantitative stable isotope probing with 18 O-H 2 O was employed to evaluate taxon-specific bacterial growth in these ecosystems. Results show that symmetric year-round warming decreased microbial growth rate by 31% and CUE by 22%. Asymmetric winter warming resulted in a further decrease in microbial growth rate of 27% and microbial CUE of 59% compared to symmetric year-round warming. Long-term warming increased microbial carbon limitations, especially under asymmetric winter warming. Long-term warming suppressed the growth rates of most bacterial genera, with asymmetric winter warming having a stronger inhibition on the growth rates of specific genera (e.g., Gp10 , Actinomarinicola , Bosea , Acidibacter , and Gemmata ) compared to symmetric year-round warming. Bacterial growth was phylogenetically conserved, but this conservation diminished under warming conditions, primarily due to shifts in bacterial physiological states rather than the number of bacterial species and community composition. Overall, long-term warming escalated microbial carbon limitations, decreased microbial growth and CUE, with asymmetric winter warming having a more pronounced effect. Understanding these impacts is crucial for predicting soil carbon cycling as global warming progresses.",

Here, we combine live-cell imaging and mathematical modeling to gain insights into the role of actin filament crosslinking proteins in force generation. Genetic manipulation showed that CME sites with more crosslinking proteins are more effective at internalization under high load. Simulations of an experimentally constrained, agent-based mathematical model recapitulate the result that endocytic networks with more double-bound fimbrin molecules internalize the plasma membrane against elevated turgor pressure more effectively. Networks with large numbers of crosslinks also have more growing actin filament barbed ends at the plasma membrane, where the addition of new actin monomers contributes to force generation and vesicle internalization.

Here, we establish atomic magnetometers with sub-pT sensitivity as an alternative modality to detect in real time the complex dynamics of hyperpolarized materials without disturbing or interrupting the magnetogenesis process. As an example of dynamics that are impossible to detect in real time by conventional means, we examine parahydrogen-induced 1 H and 13 C magnetization during adiabatic eigenbasis transformations at μ T-field avoided crossings. Continuous but nondestructive magnetometry reveals previously unseen spin dynamics, fidelity limits, and magnetization backaction effects. As a second example, we apply magnetometry to observe the chemical-exchange-driven 13 C hyperpolarization of [1– 13 C]-pyruvate—the most important spin tracer for clinical metabolic imaging. The approach can be readily combined with other high-sensitivity magnetometers and is applicable to a broader range of general observation scenarios involving production, transport, and systems interaction of hyperpolarized compounds.",

          "abstract": "Two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels play a central role in modulating cellular excitability and neuronal function. The unique structure of the selectivity filter in K2P and other potassium channels determines their ability to allow the selective passage of potassium ions across cell membranes. The nematode C. elegans has one of the largest K2P families, with 47 subunit-coding genes. This remarkable expansion has been accompanied by the evolution of atypical selectivity filter sequences that diverge from the canonical TxGYG motif. Whether and how this sequence variation may impact the function of K2P channels has not been investigated so far. Here, we show that the UNC-58 K2P channel is constitutively permeable to sodium ions and that a cysteine residue in its selectivity filter is responsible for this atypical behavior. Indeed, by performing in vivo electrophysiological recordings and Ca 2+ imaging experiments, we demonstrate that UNC-58 has a depolarizing effect in muscles and sensory neurons. Consistently, unc-58 gain-of-function mutants are hypercontracted, unlike the relaxed phenotype observed in hyperactive mutants of many neuromuscular K2P channels. Finally, by combining molecular dynamics simulations with functional studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we show that the atypical cysteine residue plays a key role in the unconventional sodium permeability of UNC-58. As predicting the consequences of selectivity filter sequence variations in silico remains a major challenge, our study illustrates how functional experiments are essential to determine the contribution of such unusual potassium channels to the electrical profile of excitable cells.",

          "abstract": "Synaptic-vesicle (SV) recruitment is thought to maintain reliable neurotransmitter release during high-frequency signaling. However, the mechanism underlying the SV reloading for sustained neurotransmission at central synapses remains unknown. To elucidate this, we performed direct observations of SV reloading and mobility at a single-vesicle level near the plasma membrane in cerebellar mossy fiber terminals using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, together with simultaneous recordings of membrane fusion by capacitance measurements. We found that actin disruption abolished the rapid SV recruitment and reduced sustained release. In contrast, induction of actin polymerization and stabilization did not affect vesicle recruitment and release, suggesting that the presence of actin filaments, rather than actin dynamics, was required for the rapid recruitment. Single-particle tracking experiments of quantum dot-labeled vesicles, which allows nanoscale resolution of vesicle mobility, revealed that actin disruption caused vesicles to diffuse more rapidly. Hidden Markov modeling with Bayesian inference revealed that SVs had two diffusion states under normal conditions: free-diffusing and trapped. After disruption of the actin filament, vesicles tended to have only the free-diffusing state. F-actin staining showed that actin filaments were localized outside the active zones (AZs) and surrounded some SV trajectories. Perturbation of SV mobility, possibly through interference with biomolecular condensates, also suggested that the restricted diffusion state determined the rate of SV recruitment. We propose that actin filaments confined SVs near the AZ to achieve rapid and efficient recruitment followed by priming and sustained synaptic transmission.",

However, our understanding of the force required to move large organelles, such as the nucleus, inside the cytoplasm is limited, in part owing to a lack of accurate methods for measurement. We devised a method to apply forces to the nucleus of living Caenorhabditis elegans embryos to measure the force generated inside the cell. We used a centrifuge polarizing microscope to apply centrifugal force and orientation-independent differential interference contrast microscopy to characterize the mass density of the nucleus and cytoplasm. The cellular forces moving the nucleus toward the cell center increased linearly at ~12 pN/μm depending on the distance from the center. The frictional coefficient was ~980 pN s/μm. The measured values were smaller than the previously reported estimates for sea urchin embryos. The forces were consistent with the centrosome-organelle mutual pulling model for nuclear centration. The frictional coefficient was reduced when microtubules were shorter or detached from nuclei in mutant embryos, demonstrating the contribution of astral microtubules. Finally, the frictional coefficient was higher than a theoretical estimate, indicating the contribution of uncharacterized properties of the cytoplasm.",

A critical step of all CRISPR-Cas technologies is the delivery of the Cas endonuclease to the target cell. Here, we investigate the possibility of using bacterial conjugation to translocate Cas proteins into recipient bacteria. Conjugative relaxases are translocated through a type IV secretion system into the recipient cell, covalently attached to the transferred DNA strand. We fused relaxase R388-TrwC with the endonuclease Cas12a and confirmed that it can be transported through a T4SS. The fusion protein maintained its activity upon translocation by conjugation into the recipient cell, as evidenced by the induction of the SOS signal resulting from DNA breaks produced by the endonuclease in the recipient cell, and the detection of mutations at the target position. We further show how a template DNA provided on the transferred DNA can be used to introduce specific mutations. The guide RNA can also be encoded by the transferred DNA, enabling its production in the recipient cells where it can form a complex with the Cas nuclease transferred as a protein. This self-contained setup enables to target wild-type bacterial cells. Finally, we extended this strategy to the delivery of relaxases fused to base editors. Using TrwC and MobA relaxases as drivers, we achieved precise editing of transconjugants. Thus, conjugation provides a delivery system for Cas-derived editing tools, bypassing the need to deliver and express a cas gene in the target cells.",

The unsolved challenge is to observe the movement of the crack front at the nanoscale while extracting quantitative information. Here, we address this challenge by monitoring stable crack growth inside a transmission electron microscope. Our analysis demonstrates how phase transformation toughening, previously thought to be effective at the microscale and above, promotes crack deflection at the nanolevel and increases the fracture resistance. The work is a first step to help connecting the atomistic and continuous view of fracture in a way that can guide the design of the next generation of strong and tough materials demanded by technologies as diverse as healthcare, energy generation, or transport.",

Through careful examination of inelastic neutron scattering powder spectra, we propose a modified Kitaev model to accurately describe the twisted chains of edge-sharing octahedra surrounding Co 2 + ions. The extended Kitaev–Heisenberg model, including a significant anisotropic bond-dependent exchange term with K / | J | = 0.96 , is identified as the key descriptor of the magnetic interactions in SrCoGe 2 O 6 . Furthermore, our heat capacity measurements reveal an effect of an external magnetic field (approximately 13 T) which shifts the system from a fragile antiferromagnetic ordering with T N = 9 K to a field-induced state. We argue that pyroxenes, particularly those modified by substituting Ge with Si and its less extended p orbitals, emerge as a platform for the Kitaev model. This opens up possibilities for advancing our understanding of Kitaev physics.",

Annual emissions tripled in one extratropical pyrome due to increases in fire-favorable weather, compounded by increased forest cover and productivity.

          "abstract": "Previous studies suggested that the copy number of the human salivary amylase gene, AMY1 , correlates with starch-rich diets. However, evolutionary analyses are hampered by the absence of accurate, sequence-resolved haplotype variation maps. We identified 30 structurally distinct haplotypes at nucleotide resolution among 98 present-day humans, revealing that the coding sequences of AMY1 copies are evolving under negative selection. Genomic analyses of these haplotypes in archaic hominins and ancient human genomes suggest that a common three-copy haplotype, dating as far back as 800 KYA, has seeded rapidly evolving rearrangements through recurrent non-allelic homologous recombination. Additionally, haplotypes with more than three AMY1 copies have significantly increased in frequency among European farmers over the past 4,000 years, potentially as an adaptive response to increased starch digestion.",

Insects and spiders play critical roles in ecosystems by accumulating and synthesizing organic nutrients such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, links between biodiversity and nutrient content of insect and spider communities have yet to be quantified. We relate insect and spider richness to biomass and PUFA-mass from stream and terrestrial communities encompassing nine land uses. PUFA-mass and biomass relate positively to biodiversity across ecosystems. In terrestrial systems, human-dominated areas have lower biomass and PUFA-mass than more natural areas, even at equivalent levels of richness. Aquatic ecosystems have consistently higher PUFA-mass than terrestrial ecosystems. Our findings reinforce the importance of conserving biodiversity and highlight the distinctive benefits of aquatic biodiversity.",

Among existing thermoelectrics, tin selenide (SnSe) has had particularly rapid development owing to the unexpectedly high thermoelectric efficiency that has been continuously established over the past decade. Several transport mechanisms and strategies used to interpret and improve the thermoelectric performance of SnSe have been important for understanding and developing other material systems with SnSe-like characteristics. Similar to other thermoelectrics, building commercially viable SnSe-based devices requires advances in device efficiency and service stability. Further optimization across all material systems should enable thermoelectric technology to play a critical role in the future global energy landscape.",

We show that predator-prey contact can be established by gliding motility or extracellular assemblages we call “grappling hooks.” Cryo–electron microscopy identified the grappling hooks as heptamers of a type IX secretion system substrate. After close predator-prey contact is established, cryo–electron tomography and functional assays showed that puncturing by a type VI secretion system mediated killing. Single-cell analyses with stable isotope–labeled prey revealed that prey components are taken up by the attacker. Depending on nutrient availability, insertion sequence elements toggle the activity of ixotrophy. A marine metagenomic time series shows coupled dynamics of ixotrophic bacteria and prey. We found that the mechanism of ixotrophy involves multiple cellular machineries, is conserved, and may shape microbial populations in the environment.",

Lavas from individual eruptions are often chemically homogeneous, suggesting that they derive from single, well-mixed magma reservoirs. The 2023 to 2024 eruptions at Sundhnúksgígar in the Svartsengi volcanic system in Iceland provide an opportunity to observe the behavior of a mid-crustal magma domain at high spatial and temporal resolution by detailed sampling and geochemical characterization. We observed substantial mantle-derived geochemical variability in the products erupted in the first hours of the December 2023 and January, February, and March to May 2024 eruptions, indicating that the eruptions derived from multiple magma reservoirs, which mineral-melt equilibration pressures place in the mid crust. The unusual presence of geochemical heterogeneity in the mid-crustal magma domain provides insights into how dynamic and complex mid-crustal magma domains can be.",

Here, we developed an approach to reprogram tumor cells in vivo by adenoviral delivery of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3, which enabled them to present antigens as type 1 conventional dendritic cells. Reprogrammed tumor cells remodeled their tumor microenvironment, recruited, and expanded polyclonal cytotoxic T cells; induced tumor regressions; and established long-term systemic immunity in multiple mouse melanoma models. In human tumor spheroids and xenografts, reprogramming to immunogenic dendritic-like cells progressed independently of immunosuppression, which usually limits immunotherapy.

Previous studies highlighted the value of large, threatened shark species, regulated under CITES Appendix II. However, sampling biases may have overlooked small shark species. Here, we address this by identifying species from ~4000 small shark fins in Hong Kong. These fins included species not recorded in previous surveys, raising the market’s species diversity to 106. Nearly 75% of the small fins came from small shark species and 58.1% of small species were threatened with extinction. We identified an important CITES listing gap: Trade in 19 small, threatened species, especially from the family Triakidae, is unregulated. In addition, a quarter of small fins come from large sharks, indicating that substantial exploitation of juveniles is occurring and may be affecting fisheries sustainability. Enhanced surveillance of small shark fin trade is essential to ensure effective conservation under emerging trade regulations.",

The Jevons paradox refers to circumstances where improvements in the efficiency of resource use lead to growth in consumption and therefore undermine conservation. The displacement paradox refers to circumstances where increasing use of a potential substitute for a resource (e.g., farmed fish) does not lead to proportionate reduction in consumption of the other resource (e.g., wild fish). The literature on the displacement paradox and the Jevons paradox suggests that there may be unanticipated consequences from the rise of aquaculture that may be detrimental for fisheries conservation. Here, we present theoretical explanations, drawing on the tragedy of the commodity, for understanding the tendencies for these technological paradoxes to occur and emphasize their relevance for concerns associated with fisheries and aquaculture systems.",

While in vitro studies have used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to study HCM, these models have not examined the multicellular interactions involved in fibrosis. Using engineered cardiac microtissues (CMTs) composed of HCM-causing MYH7 -variant hiPSC-CMs and wild-type fibroblasts, we observed cell-cell cross-talk leading to increased collagen deposition, tissue stiffening, and decreased contractility dependent on fibroblast proliferation. hiPSC-CM conditioned media and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data suggested that fibroblast proliferation is mediated by paracrine signals from MYH7 -variant cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase with erlotinib hydrochloride attenuated stromal activation. Last, HCM-causing MYBPC3 -variant CMTs also demonstrated increased stromal activation and reduced contractility, but with distinct characteristics. Together, these findings establish a paracrine-mediated cross-talk potentially responsible for fibrotic changes observed in HCM.",

          "abstract": "Aquacultured carnivorous species consume most of the world’s fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), which itself is primarily derived from small pelagic fish. This has raised concerns about the practice’s impact on wild fish stocks, ecosystems, and coastal communities that rely on these fish. The aquaculture industry claims a decreasing dependence on wild fish, relying on the Fish In:Fish Out (FIFO) metric as a ratio of the quantity of wild fish required for farmed fish production. This is misleading because it usually assumes constant FM or FO yields, inclusion rates and feed conversion ratios, which vary widely. Thus, a constant FIFO value for a given species cannot be assumed. Furthermore, low FIFO values resulting from averaging carnivores and herbivores conceal the high feed requirements of carnivore species. The increasing use of FMFO from by-products does not demonstrate a decreased use of wild fish but rather reflects a growing demand for FMFO, particularly for the fast growing and valuable salmon and shrimp farming industries.",

However, the hyperpolarized state exponentially decays back to the thermal equilibrium, depending on the spin-lattice relaxation time ( T 1 ). Because of the limitation in T 1 , peptide-based DNP NMR molecular probes applicable in vivo have been limited to amino acids or dipeptides. Here, we report the direct detection of in vivo metabolic conversions of hyperpolarized 13 C-oligopeptides. Structure-based T 1 relaxation analysis suggests that the C-terminal [1- 13 C]Gly- d 2 residue affords sufficient T 1 for biological uses, even in relatively large oligopeptides, and allowed us to develop 13 C-β-casomorphin-5 and 13 C-glutathione.

We explore this question with large-scale networks of spatially ordered spiking neuron models where a downstream network receives input from an upstream sender network. We show that linear measures of the communication between the sender and receiver networks can discriminate between emergent or inherited population dynamics. A match in the dimensionality of the sender and receiver population activities promotes faithful communication. In contrast, a nonlinear mapping between the sender to receiver activity, for example, through downstream emergent population-wide fluctuations, can impair linear communication. Our work exposes the benefits and limitations of linear measures when analyzing between-area communication in circuits with rich population-wide neuronal dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Chiral structures and functions are essential natural components in biominerals and biological crystals. Chiral molecules direct inorganics through chiral growth of facets or screw dislocation of crystal clusters. As chirality promoters, they initiate an asymmetric hierarchical self-assembly in a quasi-thermodynamic steady state. However, achieving chiral assembly requires a delicate balance between intricate interactions. This complexity causes the roles of achiral-chiral and inorganic components in crystallization to remain ambiguous. Here, we elucidate a definitive mechanism using an achiral-chiral ligand strategy to assemble inorganics into hierarchical, self-organized superstructures. Achiral ligands cluster inorganic building blocks, while chiral ligands impart chiral rotation. Achiral and chiral ligands can flexibly modulate the chirality of superstructures by fully using their competition in coordination chemistry. This dual-ligand strategy offers a versatile framework for engineering chiroptical nanomaterials tailored to optical devices and metamaterials with optical activities across a broad wavelength range, with applications in imaging, detection, catalysis, and sensing.",

Chondrocytes frequently undergo energy stress under pathological conditions, characterized by disrupted cellular metabolism and reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels.

Here, we developed bioenergetic-active exosomes (Suc-EXO) to promote cartilage regeneration and homeostasis maintenance. Suc-EXO exhibited a 5.42-fold increase in ATP content, enabling the manipulation of cellular energy metabolism by fueling the TCA cycle. With continuous energy supply, Suc-EXO promoted BMSC chondrogenic differentiation via the P2X7-mediated PI3K-AKT pathway. Moreover, Suc-EXO improved chondrocyte anabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis via the P2X7-mediated SIRT3 pathway. In a rabbit cartilage defect model, the Suc-EXO–encapsulated hydrogel notably promoted cartilage regeneration and maintained neocartilage homeostasis, leading to 2.26 and 1.53 times increase in Col2 and ACAN abundance, respectively. These findings make a remarkable breakthrough in modulating energy metabolism for cartilage regeneration, offering immense potential for clinical translation.",

To unify known and uncover unknown principles governing eukaryotic elongation rate, we developed a machine learning pipeline to analyze RiboSeq datasets. We find that the chemical nature of the incoming amino acid determines how codon optimality influences elongation rate, with hydrophobic residues more dependent on transfer RNA (tRNA) levels than charged residues. Unexpectedly, we find that wobble interactions exert a widespread effect on elongation pausing, with wobble-mediated decoding being slower than Watson-Crick decoding, irrespective of tRNA levels. Applying our ribosome pausing principles to ribosome collisions reveals that disomes arise upon apposition of fast-decoding and slow-decoding signatures. We conclude that codon choice and tRNA pools are evolutionarily constrained to harmonize elongation rate with cotranslational folding while minimizing wobble pairing and deleterious stalling.",

These multivalent interactions not only ensure the stability of the probes but also enhance fluorescence efficiency by minimizing nonradiative decay. Our self-assembly approach effectively modulates probe size and surface properties, enabling evasion of MPS clearance and promoting prolonged bloodstream circulation, thereby improving the signal-to-background ratio for imaging. The effectiveness of our design is demonstrated by substantial advancements in the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury and by providing high-contrast imaging and precise surgical navigation across various tumor models.

Collectively, we refer to these four types of risks as “dewilding.” In this systematic review, we searched Scopus and Web of Science for recent literature documenting mariculture’s dewilding impacts to organize and collate this evidence under one unified framework. We find that mariculture’s dewilding impacts are consistently documented, though often in isolation, and that captivity and conceptual dewilding impacts are recognized as potential harms far less than impacts on the environment and wildlife. Future work examining mariculture’s dewilding impacts will be paramount to guiding human decision-making and activity going forward.",

Pancreatic-specific knockout of the SEMA3D gene from the KRAS G12D and TP53 R172H mutation knock-in, PDX1-Cre(KPC) mouse model demonstrated delayed tumor initiation, prolonged survival, absence of metastasis, and reduced M2 macrophage expression. Mechanistically, tumor- and nerve-derived SEMA3D indirectly reprograms macrophages through KRAS MUT -dependent ARF6 signaling in PDA cells, resulting in increased lactate production, which is sensed by GPCR132 on macrophages to stimulate protumorigenic M2 polarization. Multiplex immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased M2-polarized macrophages proximal to nerves in SEMA3D-expressing human PDA tissue. This study suggests that altered SEMA3D expression leads to an acquisition of cancer-promoting functions, and nerve-derived SEMA3D is “hijacked” by PDA cells to support growth and metastasis in a KRAS MUT -dependent manner.",

Furthermore, by preparing superposition states of neighboring kinks with different phases, we observe the propagation of the wave packet in different directions, thus unambiguously verifying the quantum coherence in the superposition states. Our work provides useful tools for nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum Kibble-Zurek physics.",

          "abstract": "Renewable alternatives for nonelectrifiable fossil-derived chemicals are needed and plant matter, the most abundant biomass on Earth, provide an ideal feedstock. However, the heterogeneous polymeric composition of lignocellulose makes conversion difficult. Lignin presents a formidable barrier to fermentation of nonpretreated biomass. Extensive chemical and enzymatic treatments can liberate fermentable carbohydrates from plant biomass, but microbial routes offer many advantages, including concomitant conversion to industrial chemicals. Here, testing of lignin content of nonpretreated biomass using the cellulolytic thermophilic bacterium, Anaerocellum bescii , revealed that the primary microbial degradation barrier relates to methoxy substitutions in lignin. This contrasts with optimal lignin composition for chemical pretreatment that favors high S/G ratio and low H lignin. Genetically modified poplar trees with diverse lignin compositions confirm these findings. In addition, poplar trees with low methoxy content achieve industrially relevant levels of microbial solubilization without any pretreatments and with no impact on tree fitness in greenhouse.",

Here, tracking the same neurons across wakefulness and isoflurane or ketamine medetomidine anesthesia, we show that the amplitude and sign of single neuron responses to sounds are massively modified by anesthesia in the cochlear nucleus of the brainstem, the first relay of the auditory system. The reorganization of activity is so profound that decoding of sound representation under anesthesia is not possible based on awake activity. However, population-level parameters, such as average tuning strength and population decoding accuracy, are weakly affected by anesthesia, explaining why its effect has previously gone unnoticed when comparing independently sampled neurons. Together, our results indicate that the functional organization of the auditory brainstem largely depends on the network state and is ill-defined under anesthesia. This demonstrates a remarkable sensitivity of an early sensory stage to anesthesia, which is bound to disrupt downstream processing.",

Here, we show that field-scale observations of sliding velocity and pore water pressure at two creeping landslides are explained by velocity-strengthening friction, in close agreement with laboratory measurements on similar materials. This suggests that the rate-strengthening friction commonly measured in clay-rich materials may govern episodic slow slip in landslides, in addition to tectonic faults. Further, our results show more generally that transient slow slip can arise in velocity-strengthening materials from modulation of effective normal stress through pore pressure fluctuations. This challenges the idea that episodic slow slip requires a narrow range of transitional frictional properties near the stability threshold, or pore pressure feedbacks operating on initially unstable frictional slip.",

Molecular screening of infectious agents in farmed and wild salmon and environmental DNA highlights a further 4 agents that are likely elevated near salmon farms and 37 that co-occur in wild and farmed salmon. Pathogens likely affect wild salmon indirectly by mediating migration, competition, and predation. Current net-pen aquaculture practices pose these risks to numerous populations of all species of wild salmon in BC, most of which are not covered in Government of Canada science and advisory reports.

Widely cited estimates of declines in wild fish use from 1997 to 2017 entailed a trade-off of more than fivefold increase in feed crops over the same period.

Transitioning from a proliferative to an invasive melanoma phenotype is coupled with increased ferroptosis vulnerability. However, the regulatory circuits controlling ferroptosis susceptibility across melanoma cell states are unknown. In this work, we identified Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) as the top lipid-metabolism gene segregating the melanoma MITF high /AXL low proliferative/ferroptosis-resistant from MITF low /AXL high invasive/ferroptosis-sensitive state. Mechanistically, ApoE secreted by the MITF high /AXL low cells protects the invasive phenotype from ferroptosis-inducing agents by reducing the content of peroxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids and boosting GPX4 levels both in vitro and in vivo. Whole-exome sequencing indicates that APOE high expression in patients with melanoma is associated with resistance to ferroptosis, regardless of APOE germline status. In aggregate, we found a ferroptosis-resistance mechanism between melanoma cell states relying on secreted ApoE and APOE high expression as a potential biomarker for poor ferroptosis response in melanoma.",

Here, we report that 2′3′-cGAMP promotes cell migration independent of innate immunity. 2′3′-cGAMP interactome analysis identifies the small GTPase Rab18 as a 2′3′-cGAMP binding partner and effector in cell migration control. Mechanistically, 2′3′-cGAMP binds Rab18 to facilitate GTP loading and subsequent Rab18 activation, which further promotes FosB transcription in facilitating cell migration. Induced synthesis of endogenous 2′3′-cGAMP by intrabreast tumor bacterium S. aureus infection or low-dose doxorubicin treatment facilitates cell migration depending on the cGAS/cGAMP/Rab18/FosB signaling. We find that lovastatin induces Rab18 deprenylation that abolishes 2′3′-cGAMP recognition therefore suppressing cell migration.

In this context, the role of evolving global geodynamics and plate (re)organization on the spatial and temporal distribution of compositional heterogeneities in the convecting mantle is poorly understood. Here, using the geochemical compositions of intracontinental basalts formed over the past billion years, we show that intracontinental basalts with subchondritic initial neodymium-144/neodymium-143 values become common only after 300 million years, broadly coeval with the global appearance of kimberlites with geochemically enriched isotopic signatures. These step changes in the sources of intraplate magmatism stem from a rapid increase in the supply of deeply subducted lithosphere during the protracted formation of Pangea following the widespread onset of “modern” (cold and deep) subduction in the late Neoproterozoic. We argue that the delay (~300 million years) in the appearance of enriched intraplate magmas reflects the time required for the sinking and (re)incorporation of slabs into the sources of mantle-derived magmas.",

Framing aquaculture as a monolith, however, overlooks its extreme taxonomic diversity. This paper assesses the welfare risks associated with that diversity, establishing seven species-level risk factors from involved parental care to long lifespans. Investigating these welfare risks across all aquatic species reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed an uneven distribution of risk, with extreme species-level risks in chordates, crustaceans, and cephalopod mollusks. Compared to species with fewer risks, species with extreme welfare risks were found to cost more and contribute the least to global production. This work challenges the notion that prioritizing animal welfare is incompatible with addressing food security and creates the possibility of identifying certain plant and invertebrate species, like seaweeds and bivalves, that minimize welfare concerns while providing affordability and accessibility. Going forward, proactive welfare approaches are needed to inform consumer choice and shape just and sustainable aquaculture policy.",

Here, we identify a cell-cell communication pathway containing the proteins ShfA (YabQ) and ShfP (YvnB) that actively promotes phenotypic heterogeneity, wherein Bacillus subtilis cells that start sporulating early use a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase to release glycerol, which simultaneously acts as a signaling molecule and a nutrient to delay nonsporulating cells from entering sporulation. This produced a more diverse population that was better poised to exploit a sudden influx of nutrients compared to those generating heterogeneity via stochastic gene expression alone.

However, the regulation of its different functions remains poorly understood. Here, we report the role of PARP1 acetylation status in modulating its DNA repair and transactivation functions. We demonstrate that histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) determines PARP1 acetylation at Lys498 and Lys521 sites. HDAC5-mediated deacetylation at Lys498 site regulates PARP1 DNA damage response and facilitates efficient recruitment of DNA repair factors at damaged sites, thereby promoting cell survival. Additionally, HDAC5-mediated deacetylation at Lys521 site promotes PARP1 coactivator function, resulting in induction of proliferative and metabolic genes in an activating transcription factor 4-dependent manner. Thus, PARP1 induces metabolic adaptation to spur malignant phenotype. Our studies in mouse tumor models suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity does not block tumor progression robustly as transactivation function remains unperturbed.

Here, we developed a strategy that limits the atomic diffusion within surface layers, fostering the phase transition and shape retention during thermal treatment. This enables selective transformation of platinum-iron nanowire surfaces into intermetallic structures via atomic ordering at a low temperature. The catalysts exhibit enhanced MEA stability with 50% less Fe loss while maintaining high catalytic activity comparable to that in half-cells. Density functional calculations suggest that the ordered intermetallic surface stabilizes morphology against rapid corrosion and improves the ORR activity.

We used high-resolution measurements of refractory rBC in a firn core collected near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, as well as atmospheric rBC from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, satellite measurements, modeling, burned area data, and tourism statistics, to assess combined impacts of both long-range transported rBC and locally emitted rBC.

          "abstract": "Nuclear speckles are nuclear membraneless organelles in higher eukaryotic cells playing a vital role in gene expression. Using an in situ reverse transcription–based sequencing method, we study nuclear speckle–associated human transcripts. Our data indicate the existence of three gene groups whose transcripts demonstrate different speckle localization properties: stably enriched in nuclear speckles, transiently enriched in speckles at the pre–messenger RNA stage, and not enriched. We find that stably enriched transcripts contain inefficiently excised introns and that disruption of nuclear speckles specifically affects splicing of speckle-enriched transcripts. We further reveal RNA sequence features contributing to transcript speckle localization, indicating a tight interplay between transcript speckle enrichment, genome organization, and splicing efficiency. Collectively, our data highlight a role of nuclear speckles in both co- and posttranscriptional splicing regulation. Last, we show that genes with stably enriched transcripts are over-represented among genes with heat shock–up-regulated intron retention, hinting at a connection between speckle localization and cellular stress response.",

Here, a void-free ion-permeable interface between the solid-state polymer electrolyte and electrode is constructed in situ during cycling using charge/discharge voltage as the stimulus. During the charge-discharge, the permeation phase fills the voids at the interface and penetrates the electrode, forming strong bonds with the cathode and effectively mitigating the contact problem. Our all-solid-state potassium ion polymer batteries maintain high Coulombic efficiency more than 2000 cycles at a high operating voltage of 4.5 volt and stably cycle more than 500 cycles even at 4.6 volt. Our rational design for mitigating the contact problem is versatile, as demonstrated by the scalability of all-solid-state graphite-based polymer potassium-ion pouch cells and all-solid-state lithium-ion polymer batteries.",

          "abstract": "Stem cell therapies for Parkinson’s disease are at an exciting time of development, and several clinical trials have recently been initiated. Human pluripotent stem cells are differentiated into transplantable dopamine (DA) progenitors which are proliferative at the time of grafting and undergo terminal differentiation and maturation in vivo. While the progenitors are homogeneous at the time of transplantation, they give rise to heterogeneous grafts composed not only of therapeutic DA neurons but also of other mature cell types. The mechanisms for graft diversification are unclear. We used single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to profile DA progenitors before transplantation combined with molecular barcode-based tracing to determine origin and shared lineages of the mature cell types in the grafts. Our data demonstrate that astrocytes, vascular leptomeningeal cells, and DA neurons are the main component of the DAergic grafts, originating from a common progenitor that is tripotent at the time of transplantation.",

          "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have achieved impressive antitumor clinical outcomes. However, the limited response rates suggest the incomplete understanding of PD-L1 regulation. Here, we demonstrate that vacuole protein sorting 11 and 18 (VPS11/18), two key players in vesicular trafficking, positively regulate PD-L1 and confer resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. VPS11/18 interact with PD-L1 in endosome recycling accompanied by promoting PD-L1 glycosylation and protein stability. VPS18 deficiency enhances antitumor immune response. Pharmacological inhibition by VPS18 inhibitor RDN impaired PD-L1 member trafficking and protein stability. Combination treatment of RDN and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 synergistically enhances antitumor efficacy in aggressive and drug-resistant tumors. RDN exerted lung-preferred distribution and good bioavailability, suggesting a favorable drug efficacy. Together, our study links VPS18/11-mediated trans-Golgi network recycling of PD-L1 and points to a promising treatment strategy for the enhancement of antitumor immunity.",

PNFs are rich in immune cells, but whether immune cells are necessary for tumorigenesis is unknown. We show that inhibition of stimulator of interferon gene (STING) reduces plasma CXCL10, tumor T cell and dendritic cell (DC) recruitment, and tumor formation. Further, mice lacking XCR-1 + DCs showed reduced tumor-infiltrating T cells and PNF tumors. Antigen-presenting cells from tumor-bearing mice promoted CD8 + T cell proliferation in vitro, and PNF T cells expressed high levels of CCL5, implicating T cell activation. Notably, tumors and nerve-associated macrophages were absent in Rag1 −/− ; Nf1 f/f ; DhhCre mice and adoptive transfer of CD8 + T cells from tumor-bearing mice restored PNF initiation. In this setting, PNF shrunk upon subsequent T cell removal. Thus, STING pathway activation contributes to CD8 + T cell–dependent inflammatory responses required for PNF initiation and maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Inorganic semiconductor materials are crucial for modern technologies, but their brittleness and limited processability hinder the development of flexible, wearable, and miniaturized electronics. The recent discovery of room-temperature plasticity in some inorganic semiconductors offers a promising solution, but the deformation mechanisms remain controversial. Here, we investigate the deformation of indium selenide, a two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductor with substantial plasticity. By developing a machine-learned deep potential, we perform atomistic simulations that capture the deformation features of hexagonal indium selenide upon out-of-plane compression. Unexpectedly, we find that indium selenide plastifies through a martensitic transformation; that is, the layered hexagonal structure is converted to a tetragonal lattice with specific orientation relationship. This observation is corroborated by high-resolution experimental observations and theory. It suggests a change of paradigm, where the design of new plastically deformable inorganic semiconductors can focus on compositions and structures that facilitate phase transformations, going beyond the conventional dislocation slip.",

Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition and climate change may, however, limit the competitive advantage of nitrogen-fixing plants, leading to reduced relative diversity of nitrogen-fixing plants. Yet, assessments of changes of nitrogen-fixing plant long-term community diversity are rare. Here, we examine temporal trends in the diversity of nitrogen-fixing plants and their relationships with anthropogenic nitrogen deposition while accounting for changes in temperature and aridity. We used forest-floor vegetation resurveys of temperate forests in Europe and the United States spanning multiple decades. Nitrogen-fixer richness declined as nitrogen deposition increased over time but did not respond to changes in climate. Phylogenetic diversity also declined, as distinct lineages of N-fixers were lost between surveys, but the “winners” and “losers” among nitrogen-fixing lineages varied among study sites, suggesting that losses are context dependent. Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition reduces nitrogen-fixing plant diversity in ways that may strongly affect natural nitrogen fixation.",

Here, we present an artificial olfactory system for spatiotemporal recognition of NO 2 gas flow by integrating a network of chemical receptors with a near-sensor computing. The artificial olfactory receptor features nano-islands of metal-based catalysts that cover the graphene surface on the heterostructure of an AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel. Catalytically dissociated NO 2 molecules bind to graphene, thereby modulating the conductivity of the 2DEG channel. For the energy/resource-efficient gas flow monitoring, trust-region Bayesian optimization algorithm allocates many sensors optimally in a complex space. Integrated artificial neural networks on a compact microprocessor with a network of sensors provide in situ gas flow predictions. This system enhances protective measures against toxic environments through spatiotemporal monitoring of toxic gases.",

Conversely, histology and virtual histology methods have lacked metabolic contrast. Here, we present metabolic light absorption, scattering, and emission (MetaLASE) microscopy, which rapidly provides a virtual histology and optical metabolic readout simultaneously. Hematoxylin-like nucleic contrast and eosin-like cytoplasmic contrast are obtained using photoacoustic remote sensing and ultraviolet reflectance microscopy, respectively. The same ultraviolet source excites endogenous Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate), flavin adenine dinucleotide, and collagen autofluorescence, providing a map of optical redox ratios to visualize metabolic variations including in areas of invasive carcinoma. Benign chronic inflammation and glands also are seen to exhibit hypermetabolism. MetaLASE microscopy offers promise for future applications in intraoperative margin analysis and in research applications where greater insights into metabolic activity could be correlated with cell and tissue types.",
