          "authors": "Riley C. Gentry, Nicholas A. Ide, Victoria M. Comunale, Erik W. Hartwick, Colin D. Kinz-Thompson, Ruben L. Gonzalez",
          "abstract": "During translation initiation, mRNA molecules must be identified and activated for loading into a ribosome1,2,3. In this rate-limiting step, the heterotrimeric protein eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F must recognize and productively interact with the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA and subsequently activate the message1,2,3. Despite its fundamental, regulatory role in gene expression, the molecular events underlying cap recognition and mRNA activation remain unclear3. Here we generate a single-molecule fluorescence imaging system to examine the dynamics with which eIF4F discriminates productive and non-productive locations on full-length, native mRNA molecules. At the single-molecule level, we observe stochastic sampling of eIF4F along the length of the mRNA and identify allosteric communication between the eIF4F subunits that ultimately drive cap-recognition and subsequent activation of the message. Our experiments uncover functions for each subunit of eIF4F and we conclude by presenting a model for mRNA activation that precisely defines the composition of the activated message. This model provides a general framework for understanding how mRNA molecules may be discriminated from one another and how other RNA-binding proteins may control the efficiency of translation initiation.",

          "authors": "Shiheng Liu, Tiantian Su, Xian Xia, Z. Hong Zhou",
          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting leading to premature mortality1,2. Discovery of the DMD gene encoding dystrophin both revealed the cause of DMD and helped identify a family of at least ten dystrophin-associated proteins at the muscle cell membrane, collectively forming the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC)3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The DGC links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, but, despite its importance, its molecular architecture has remained elusive. Here we determined the native cryo-electron microscopy structure of rabbit DGC and conducted biochemical analyses to reveal its intricate molecular configuration. An unexpected β-helix comprising β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan forms an extracellular platform that interacts with α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan and α-sarcoglycan, allowing α-dystroglycan to contact the extracellular matrix. In the membrane, sarcospan anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, while in the cytoplasm, β-dystroglycan’s juxtamembrane fragment binds dystrophin’s ZZ domain. Through these interactions, the DGC links laminin 2 to intracellular actin. Additionally, dystrophin’s WW domain, along with its EF-hand 1 domain, interacts with α-dystrobrevin. A disease-causing mutation mapping to the WW domain weakens this interaction, as confirmed by deletion of the WW domain in biochemical assays. Our findings rationalize more than 110 mutations affecting single residues associated with various muscular dystrophy subtypes and contribute to ongoing therapeutic developments, including protein restoration, upregulation of compensatory genes and gene replacement.",

          "authors": "Gabriel N. Santos-Durán, Rory L. Cooper, Ebrahim Jahanbakhsh, Grigorii Timin, Michel C. Milinkovitch",
          "abstract": "Amniote integumentary appendages constitute a diverse group of micro-organs, including feathers, hair and scales. These structures typically develop as genetically controlled units 1 , the spatial patterning of which emerges from a self-organized chemical Turing system 2,3 with integrated mechanical feedback 4,5 . The seemingly purely mechanical patterning of polygonal crocodile head scales provides an exception to this paradigm 6 . However, the nature and origin of the mechanical stress field driving this patterning remain unclear. Here, using precise in ovo intravenous injections of epidermal growth factor protein, we generate Nile crocodile embryos with substantially convoluted head skin, as well as hatchlings with smaller polygonal head scales resembling those of caimans. We then use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to quantify embryonic tissue-layer geometry, collagen architecture and the spatial distribution of proliferating cells. Using these data, we build a phenomenological three-dimensional mechanical growth model that recapitulates both normal and experimentally modified patterning of crocodile head scales. Our experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that crocodile head scales self-organize through compressive folding, originating from near-homogeneous skin growth with differential stiffness of the dermis versus the epidermis. Our experiments and theoretical morphospace analyses indicate that variation in embryonic growth and material properties of skin layers provides a simple evolutionary mechanism that produces a diversity of head-scale patterns among crocodilian species.",

However, the scope and purpose of this anti-commensal immune program are not well defined, limiting our ability to harness it therapeutically. Here, we show that this colonist also induces a potent, durable, and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates. A series of S. epidermidis cell-wall mutants revealed that the cell surface protein Aap is a predominant target. By colonizing mice with a strain of S. epidermidis in which the parallel β-helix domain of Aap is replaced by tetanus toxin fragment C, we elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response that protects mice against a lethal challenge. A similar strain of S. epidermidis expressing an Aap-SpyCatcher chimera can be conjugated with recombinant immunogens; the resulting labeled commensal elicits high antibody titers under conditions of physiologic colonization, including a robust IgA response in the nasal and pulmonary mucosa. Thus, immunity to a common skin colonist involves a coordinated T and B cell response, the latter of which can be redirected against pathogens as a novel form of topical vaccination.",

          "abstract": "The ring-shaped chaperonin T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC; also known as chaperonin containing TCP-1, CCT) is an ATP-driven protein-folding machine that is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis 1,2 . Its dysfunction is related to cancer and neurodegenerative disease 3,4 . Despite its importance, how TRiC works in the cell remains unclear. Here we structurally analysed the architecture, conformational dynamics and spatial organization of the chaperonin TRiC in human cells using cryo-electron tomography. We resolved distinctive open, closed, substrate-bound and prefoldin-associated states of TRiC, and reconstructed its duty cycle in situ. The substrate-bound open and symmetrically closed TRiC states were equally abundant. Closed TRiC containing substrate forms distinctive clusters, indicative of spatial organization. Translation inhibition did not fundamentally change the distribution of duty cycle intermediates, but reduced substrate binding for all states as well as cluster formation. From our in-cell structures, we identified the programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5) as an interactor that specifically binds to almost all open but not closed TRiC, in a position that is compatible with both substrate and prefoldin binding. Our data support a model in which TRiC functions at near full occupancy to fold newly synthesized proteins inside cells. Defining the TRiC cycle and function inside cells lays the foundation to understand its dysfunction during cancer and neurodegeneration.",

          "authors": "Sixie Yang, Yigang Wang, Hui Pan, Ping He, Haoshen Zhou",
          "abstract": "In the quest for environmental sustainability, the rising demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies has substantially increased the need for efficient lithium extraction methods. Traditional lithium production, relying on geographically concentrated hard-rock ores and salar brines, is associated with considerable energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and land disturbance, thereby posing notable environmental and supply chain challenges. On the other hand, low-quality brines—such as those found in sedimentary waters, geothermal fluids, oilfield-produced waters, seawater and some salar brines and salt lakes—hold large potential owing to their extensive reserves and widespread geographical distribution. However, extracting lithium from these sources presents technical challenges owing to low lithium concentrations and high magnesium-to-lithium ratios. This Review explores the latest advances and continuing challenges in lithium extraction from these demanding yet promising sources, covering a variety of methods, including precipitation, solvent extraction, sorption, membrane-based separation and electrochemical-based separation. Furthermore, we share perspectives on the future development of lithium extraction technologies, framed within the basic principles of separation processes. The aim is to encourage the development of innovative extraction methods capable of making use of the substantial potential of low-quality brines.",

          "abstract": "The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have sparked considerable research interest 1–13 . However, despite the dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several possible pairing mechanisms 14–24 , the origin of its superconductivity remains elusive. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometre spatial resolution, we reveal flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG, where MATBG is unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride substrate 11 . These replicas show uniform energy spacing, approximately 150 ± 15 meV apart, indicative of strong electron–boson coupling. Strikingly, these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, either when MATBG is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride or when TBG deviates from the magic angle. Calculations suggest that the formation of these flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG are attributed to the strong coupling between flat-band electrons and an optical phonon mode at the graphene K point, facilitated by intervalley scattering. These findings, although they do not necessarily put electron–phonon coupling as the main driving force for the superconductivity in MATBG, unravel the electronic structure inherent in superconducting MATBG, thereby providing crucial information for understanding the unusual electronic landscape from which its superconductivity is derived.",

          "abstract": "Aromatic compounds are used across chemistry and materials science as a result of their stability, characteristic interactions, defined molecular shape and the numerous synthetic approaches for their synthesis by a diversity of cyclization reactions1. In contrast, the cleavage of inert aromatic carbon-carbon bonds remained largely unfeasible due to the unfavourable energetics of disrupting aromaticity on ring opening. For non-aromatic structures, alkene metathesis catalysed by transition metal alkylidenes is established as one of the most versatile carbon-carbon bond-forming and breaking reactions2,3. However, despite remarkable advancements, strategies to open aromatic compounds by metathesis remained elusive4. Here, we report aromatic ring-opening metathesis (ArROM) for the cleavage of aromatic rings, including tetraphene, naphthalene, indole, benzofuran and phenanthrene by employing Schrock-Hoveyda molybdenum catalysts. The reactions for each of the ring systems proceed through unique alkylidene intermediates. We further show the possibility for stereoselective aromatic ring-opening metathesis with exquisite catalyst control over the configuration of atropisomers. Aromatic ring-opening metathesis is therefore a viable and efficient approach to catalytically transform and interconvert various aromatics without the requirement for any reagents or photoexcitation.",

          "abstract": "Natural tissues are composed of diverse cells and extracellular materials whose arrangements across several length scales—from subcellular lengths1 (micrometre) to the organ scale2 (centimetre)—regulate biological functions. Tissue-fabrication methods have progressed to large constructs, for example, through stereolithography3 and nozzle-based bioprinting4,5, and subcellular resolution through subtractive photoablation6,7,8. However, additive bioprinting struggles with sub-nozzle/voxel features9 and photoablation is restricted to small volumes by prohibitive heat generation and time10. Building across several length scales with temperature-sensitive, water-based soft biological matter has emerged as a critical challenge, leaving large classes of biological motifs—such as multiscalar vascular trees with varying calibres—inaccessible with present technologies11,12. Here we use gallium-based engineered sacrificial capillary pumps for evacuation (ESCAPE) during moulding to generate multiscalar structures in soft natural hydrogels, achieving both cellular-scale (<10 µm) and millimetre-scale features. Decoupling the biomaterial of interest from the process of constructing the geometry allows non-biocompatible tools to create the initial geometry. As an exemplar, we fabricated branched, cell-laden vascular trees in collagen, spanning approximately 300-µm arterioles down to the microvasculature (roughly ten times smaller). The same approach can micropattern the inner surface of vascular walls with topographical cues to orient cells in 3D and engineer fine structures such as vascular malformations. ESCAPE moulding enables the fabrication of multiscalar forms in soft biomaterials, paving the way for a wide range of tissue architectures that were previously inaccessible in vitro.",

          "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials constructed by corner-sharing tetrahedra (SiO4 and AlO4), with many industrial applications as ion exchangers, adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts1,2,3,4. However, the presence of micropores impedes the use of zeolites in areas dealing with bulky substrates. Introducing extrinsic mesopores, that is, intercrystal/intracrystal mesopores, in zeolites is a solution to overcome the diffusion barrier5,6,7,8. Still, those extrinsic mesopores are generally disordered and non-uniform; moreover, acidity and crystallinity are always, to some extent, impaired9. Thus, synthesizing thermally stable zeolites with intrinsic mesopores that are of uniform size and crystallographically connected with micropores, denoted here as intrinsic mesoporous zeolite, is highly desired but still not achieved. Here we report ZMQ-1 (Zeolitic Materials, Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, no. 1), an aluminosilicate zeolite with an intersecting intrinsic meso-microporous channel system delimited by 28 × 10 × 10-rings, in which the 28-ring has a free diameter of 22.76 Å × 11.83 Å, which reaches the mesopore domain. ZMQ-1 has high thermal and hydrothermal stability with tunable framework Si/Al molar ratios. ZMQ-1 is the first aluminosilicate zeolite with an intrinsic meso-microporous channel system. The Brønsted acidity of ZMQ-1 imparts high activity and unique selectivity in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. The position of the organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) used for ZMQ-1 synthesis was determined from three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) data, which shows the unique structure-directing role of the OSDA in the formation of the intrinsic meso-microporous zeolite. This provides an incentive for preparing other stable mesopore-containing zeolites.",

They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation2 steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures3. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains4,5. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways.",

However, due to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size-frequency distribution —which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth—varies significantly among models10−14. Here, we report 138 detections of the smallest asteroids (⪆ 10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST’s infrared capabilities covering the asteroids’ emission peaks15 and synthetic tracking techniques16−18. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the objects’ distances and phase angles using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their size-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ~ 100 m (debiased cumulative slopes of q = − 2.66 ± 0.60 and − 0.97 ± 0.14 for diameters smaller and larger than ~ 100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple asteroid families —most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia— according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families19 and the source regions of meteorites13,14 “in-situ”.",

          "abstract": "Quantum error correction [1, 2, 3, 4] provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here, we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code, and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of \\(\\varLambda \\mathrm{=2.14}\\pm 0.02\\) when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% ± 0.003% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit’s lifetime by a factor of \\(2.4\\pm 0.3\\). Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 μs at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 μs. We also run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or \\(3\\)\\(\\times \\)\\({10}^{9}\\) cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.",

However, it remains uncertain how changes in daily rainfall variability are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis and growth3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we use several satellite-based vegetation indices and field observations indicative of photosynthesis and growth, and find that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year. Specifically, we find that satellite-based vegetation indices are sensitive to daily rainfall variability across 42 per cent of the vegetated land surfaces. On average, the sensitivity of vegetation to daily rainfall variability is almost as large (95 per cent) as the sensitivity of vegetation to annual rainfall totals. Moreover, we find that wet-day frequency and intensity are projected to change with similar magnitudes and spatial extents as annual rainfall changes. Overall, our findings suggest that daily rainfall variability and its trends are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis, with potential implications for the carbon cycle and food security.",

          "abstract": "The automated synthesis of small organic molecules from modular building blocks has the potential to transform our capacity to create medicines and materials1,2,3. Disruptive acceleration of this molecule-building strategy broadly unlocks its functional potential and requires the integration of many new assembly chemistries. Although recent advances in high-throughput chemistry4,5,6 can speed up the development of appropriate synthetic methods, for example, in selecting appropriate chemical reaction conditions from the vast range of potential options, equivalent high-throughput analytical methods are needed. Here we report a streamlined approach for the rapid, quantitative analysis of chemical reactions by mass spectrometry. The intrinsic fragmentation features of chemical building blocks generalize the analyses of chemical reactions, allowing sub-second readouts of reaction outcomes. Central to this advance was identifying that starting material fragmentation patterns function as universal barcodes for downstream product analysis by mass spectrometry. Combining these features with acoustic droplet ejection mass spectrometry7,8 we could eliminate slow chromatographic steps and continuously evaluate chemical reactions in multiplexed formats. This enabled the assignment of reaction conditions to molecules derived from ultrahigh-throughput chemical synthesis experiments. More generally, these results indicate that fragmentation features inherent to chemical synthesis can empower rapid data-rich experimentation.",

          "abstract": "Nanoscale detection and control of the magnetic order underpins a spectrum of condensed-matter research and device functionalities involving magnetism. The key principle involved is the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, which in ferromagnets is generated by an internal magnetization. However, the presence of a net magnetization limits device scalability and compatibility with phases, such as superconductors and topological insulators. Recently, altermagnetism has been proposed as a solution to these restrictions, as it shares the enabling time-reversal-symmetry-breaking characteristic of ferromagnetism, combined with the antiferromagnetic-like vanishing net magnetization 1–4 . So far, altermagnetic ordering has been inferred from spatially averaged probes 4–19 . Here we demonstrate nanoscale imaging of altermagnetic states from 100-nanometre-scale vortices and domain walls to 10-micrometre - scale single-domain states in manganese telluride (MnTe) 2,7,9,14–16,18,20,21 . We combine the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking sensitivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism 12 with magnetic linear dichroism and photoemission electron microscopy to achieve maps of the local altermagnetic ordering vector. A variety of spin configurations are imposed using microstructure patterning and thermal cycling in magnetic fields. The demonstrated detection and controlled formation of altermagnetic spin configurations paves the way for future experimental studies across the theoretically predicted research landscape of altermagnetism, including unconventional spin-polarization phenomena, the interplay of altermagnetism with superconducting and topological phases, and highly scalable digital and neuromorphic spintronic devices 3,14,22–24 .",

          "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies with antibodies blocking immune checkpoint molecules are clinically active across multiple cancer entities and have markedly improved cancer treatment1. Yet, response rates are still limited, and tumour progression commonly occurs2. Soluble and cell-bound factors in the tumour microenvironment negatively affect cancer immunity. Recently, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine that is abundantly produced by many cancer types, was shown to interfere with antitumour immune response. In preclinical cancer models, GDF-15 blockade synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint inhibition3. In a first-in-human phase 1–2a study (GDFATHER-1/2a trial, NCT04725474), patients with advanced cancers refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (termed generally as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractoriness) were treated with the neutralizing anti-GDF-15 antibody visugromab (CTL-002) in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Here we show that durable and deep responses were achieved in some patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer, two cancer entities identified as frequently immunosuppressed by GDF-15 in an in silico screening of approximately 10,000 tumour samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Increased levels of tumour infiltration, proliferation, interferon-γ-related signalling and granzyme B expression by cytotoxic T cells were observed in response to treatment. Neutralizing GDF-15 holds promise in overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer.",

          "abstract": "The complete blood count (CBC) is an important screening tool for healthy adults and a common test at periodic exams. However, results are usually interpreted relative to one-size-fits-all reference intervals1,2, undermining the precision medicine goal to tailor care for patients on the basis of their unique characteristics3,4. Here we study thousands of diverse patients at an academic medical centre and show that routine CBC indices fluctuate around stable values or setpoints5, and setpoints are patient-specific, with the typical healthy adult’s nine CBC setpoints distinguishable as a group from those of 98% of other healthy adults, and setpoint differences persist for at least 20 years. Haematological setpoints reflect a deep physiologic phenotype enabling investigation of acquired and genetic determinants of haematological regulation and its variation among healthy adults. Setpoints in apparently healthy adults were associated with significant variation in clinical risk: absolute risk of some common diseases and morbidities varied by more than 2% (heart attack and stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, osteoporosis), and absolute risk of all-cause 10 year mortality varied by more than 5%. Setpoints also define patient-specific reference intervals and personalize the interpretation of subsequent test results. In retrospective analysis, setpoints improved sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of some common conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This study shows CBC setpoints are sufficiently stable and patient-specific to help realize the promise of precision medicine for healthy adults.",

          "abstract": "Tailored light–matter interactions in the strong coupling regime enable the manipulation and control of quantum systems with up to unit efficiency 1,2 , with applications ranging from quantum information to photochemistry 3–7 . Although strong light–matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation 8 , comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states 9,10 . However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, because of the lack of pulse-shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach reveals a strong dressing of the ionization continuum, otherwise elusive to experimental observables. The latter is exploited to achieve control of the total ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and soft X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to soft X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time.",

          "abstract": "Pre-eclampsia is a placental disorder that affects 3–5% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity worldwide1,2. With no drug available to slow disease progression, engineering ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for extrahepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the placenta is an attractive therapeutic option for pre-eclampsia. Here we use high-throughput screening to evaluate a library of 98 LNP formulations in vivo and identify a placenta-tropic LNP (LNP 55) that mediates more than 100-fold greater mRNA delivery to the placenta in pregnant mice than a formulation based on the Food and Drug Administration-approved Onpattro LNP (DLin-MC3-DMA)3. We propose an endogenous targeting mechanism based on β2-glycoprotein I adsorption that enables LNP delivery to the placenta. In both inflammation- and hypoxia-induced models of pre-eclampsia, a single administration of LNP 55 encapsulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA resolves maternal hypertension until the end of gestation. In addition, with our VEGF mRNA LNP 55 therapeutic, we demonstrate improvements in fetal health and partially restore placental vasculature, the local and systemic immune landscape and serum levels of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, a clinical biomarker of pre-eclampsia1. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of this mRNA LNP platform for treating placental disorders such as pre-eclampsia.",

          "abstract": "Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from viral (phage) infections. Three Zorya subtypes have been discovered, each containing predicted membrane-embedded ZorAB complexes paired with soluble subunits that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD in type I Zorya systems1,2. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of Zorya defense using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics, and functional studies. We present cryo-EM structures of ZorAB and show that it shares stoichiometry and features of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. The ZorA5B2 complex contains a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan binding domain and a pentameric α-helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 70 nm into the cytoplasm. We also characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components, ZorC and ZorD, finding that they harbour DNA binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrate that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We provide evidence that ZorAB operates as a proton-driven motor that becomes activated upon sensing of phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to recruit and activate the soluble ZorC and ZorD effectors, which facilitate degradation of the phage DNA. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function as an anti-phage defense system.",

In addition, cells of the same type can assume different states within an individual’s body during their lifetime.

High-throughput screening identified RU-0415529, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 by forming a unique ternary S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)-bound complex. Hit-to-lead optimization of RU-0415529 resulted in TDI-015051 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 61 pM and a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 11 nM, inhibiting virus infection in a cell-based system. TDI-015051 also inhibited viral replication in primary small airway epithelial cells and in a transgenic mouse model of SARS CoV-2 infection with an efficacy comparable with the FDA-approved reversible covalent protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir6.

          "abstract": "The most distant galaxies detected were seen when the Universe was a scant 5% of its current age. At these times, progenitors of galaxies such as the Milky Way were about 10,000 times less massive. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) combined with magnification from gravitational lensing, these low-mass galaxies can not only be detected but also be studied in detail. Here we present JWST observations of a strongly lensed galaxy at z spec = 8.296 ± 0.001, showing massive star clusters (the Firefly Sparkle) cocooned in a diffuse arc in the Canadian Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS) 1 . The Firefly Sparkle exhibits traits of a young, gas-rich galaxy in its early formation stage. The mass of the galaxy is concentrated in 10 star clusters (49–57% of total mass), with individual masses ranging from 10 5 M ⊙ to 10 6 M ⊙ . These unresolved clusters have high surface densities (&gt;10 3 M ⊙ pc − 2 ), exceeding those of Milky Way globular clusters and young star clusters in nearby galaxies. The central cluster shows a nebular-dominated spectrum, low metallicity, high gas density and high electron temperature, hinting at a top-heavy initial mass function. These observations provide our first spectrophotometric view of a typical galaxy in its early stages, in a 600-million-year-old Universe.",

          "abstract": "The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) has a crucial role in maintaining cell membrane stability and integrity by connecting the intracellular cytoskeleton with the surrounding extracellular matrix1,2,3. Dysfunction of dystrophin and its associated proteins results in muscular dystrophy, a disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration4,5. Despite the important roles of the DGC in physiology and pathology, its structural details remain largely unknown, hindering a comprehensive understanding of its assembly and function. Here we isolated the native DGC from mouse skeletal muscle and obtained its high-resolution structure. Our findings unveil a markedly divergent structure from the previous model of DGC assembly. Specifically, on the extracellular side, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycans co-fold to form a specialized, extracellular tower-like structure, which has a central role in complex assembly by providing binding sites for α-sarcoglycan and dystroglycan. In the transmembrane region, sarcoglycans and sarcospan flank and stabilize the single transmembrane helix of dystroglycan, rather than forming a subcomplex as previously proposed6,7,8. On the intracellular side, sarcoglycans and dystroglycan engage in assembly with the dystrophin–dystrobrevin subcomplex through extensive interaction with the ZZ domain of dystrophin. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the structural linkage across the cell membrane and provide a foundation for the molecular interpretation of many muscular dystrophy-related mutations.",

Mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolaemia, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by a marked increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease2. The structure of apoB100 on LDL and its interaction with LDLR are poorly understood. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apoB100 on LDL bound to the LDLR and a nanobody complex, which can form a C2-symmetric, higher-order complex. Using local refinement, we determined high-resolution structures of the interfaces between apoB100 and LDLR. One binding interface is formed between several small-ligand-binding modules of LDLR and a series of basic patches that are scattered along a β-belt formed by apoB100, encircling LDL. The other binding interface is formed between the β-propeller domain of LDLR and the N-terminal domain of apoB100. Our results reveal how both interfaces are involved in LDL dimer formation, and how LDLR cycles between LDL- and self-bound conformations. In addition, known mutations in either apoB100 or LDLR, associated with high levels of LDL-C, are located at the LDL–LDLR interface.",

Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), one of the largest proteins in the genome, is the primary structural and functional component of LDL, yet its size and complex lipid associations have posed major challenges for structural studies3. Here we present the first structure of apoB100 resolved to sub-nanometer resolution in most regions using an integrative approach of cryo-electron microscopy, AlphaFold24, and molecular dynamics-based refinement5. The structure consists of a large globular N-terminal domain and a ~61 nm long continuous amphipathic β-sheet that wraps around the LDL particle like a belt. Distributed quasi-symmetrically across the two sides of the “β-belt” are 9 strategically located inter-strand inserts that extend across the lipid surface to provide additional structural support through a network of long-range interactions. We further compare our structure to a comprehensive list of >200 intramolecular crosslinks and find close agreement between the two. These results suggest a mechanism for how the various domains of apoB100 act in concert to maintain LDL shape and cohesion across a range of particle sizes. More generally, they advance our fundamental understanding of LDL synthesis, form and function and will help accelerate the design of potential new therapeutics.",

The key chemical step in these biosyntheses is amide bond formation between aminoacyl building blocks, catalyzed by the condensation (C) domain 3. There has been much debate over the mechanism of this reaction 3-12. NRPS condensation has been difficult to fully characterize because it is one of many successive reactions in the NRPS synthetic cycle and because the canonical substrates are each attached transiently as thioesters to mobile carrier domains, which are often both contained in the same very flexible protein as the C domain. We have produced a dimodular NRPS protein in two parts, modified each with appropriate non-hydrolysable substrate analogs 13,14 assembled the two parts with protein ligation 15, and solved structures of the substrate- and product-bound states. The structures show precise orientation of the megaenzyme preparing the nucleophilic attack of its key chemical step, and allow biochemical assays and quantum mechanical simulations to precisely interrogate the reaction. These data suggest that NRPSs C domains use a concerted reaction mechanism, where the active site histidine likely serves not a as general base, but as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium.",

Here we present X-ray linear dichroic orientation tomography (XL-DOT), a quantitative, non-invasive technique that allows for an intragranular and intergranular characterization of extended polycrystalline and non-crystalline 16 materials in three dimensions. We present the detailed characterization of a polycrystalline sample of vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ), a key catalyst in the production of sulfuric acid 17 . We determine the nanoscale composition, microstructure and crystal orientation throughout the polycrystalline sample with 73 nm spatial resolution. We identify and characterize grains, as well as twist, tilt and twin grain boundaries. We further observe the creation and annihilation of topological defects promoted by the presence of volume crystallographic defects.

          "abstract": "The microbiota colonizes each barrier site and broadly controls host physiology1. However, when uncontrolled, microbial colonists can also promote inflammation and induce systemic infection2. The unique strategies employed at each barrier tissue to control the coexistence of the host with its microbiota remain largely elusive. Here we uncover that, within the skin, host-microbiota symbiosis depends on the remarkable ability of the skin to act as an autonomous lymphoid organ. Notably, an encounter with a new skin commensal promotes two parallel responses, both under the control of Langerhans cells. On one hand, skin commensals induce the formation of classical germinal centers within the lymph node associated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibody responses. On the other hand, microbial colonization also leads to the development of tertiary lymphoid organs within the skin that can locally sustain IgG2b and IgG2c responses. These phenomena are supported by the ability of regulatory T cells to convert into T follicular helper cells. Skin autonomous production of antibodies is sufficient to control local microbial biomass, as well as subsequent systemic infection with the same microbe. Collectively, these results reveal a striking compartmentalization of humoral responses to the microbiota allowing for control of both microbial symbiosis and potential pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "The ability of cells to maintain distinct identities and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks 1–3 . These dynamic regulatory circuits that respond to extracellular cues in primary human cells remain poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in T cells, where distinct lineages must respond to diverse signals to mount effective immune responses and maintain homeostasis 4–8 . Here we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4 + T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL-2Rα, a canonical marker of T cell activation transiently expressed by pro-inflammatory effector T cells and constitutively expressed by anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells where it is required for fitness 9–11 . Approximately 90% of identified regulators of IL-2Rα had effects that varied across cell types and/or stimulation states, including a subset that even had opposite effects across conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits, we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. MED12 — a component of the Mediator complex — serves as a dynamic orchestrator of key regulators, controlling expression of distinct sets of regulators in different T cell contexts. Immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry revealed that MED12 interacts with the histone methylating COMPASS complex. MED12 was required for histone methylation and expression of genes encoding key context-specific regulators, including the rest maintenance factor KLF2 and the versatile regulator MYC. CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted the cell-state transitions between rest and activation and protected from activation-induced cell death. Overall, this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across conditions to define dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.",

But what if you wanted to produce spaces in a material that is soft and delicate, and that can’t survive the high temperatures typically used to remove the template? Writing in Nature, Sundaram et al.2 introduce a process in which gallium, a metal that is liquid near room temperature, is used as a sacrificial material to generate multiscale 3D channel networks in soft, natural hydrogels such as collagen.

In the first stage of pre-eclampsia, incomplete placental development leads to compromised blood flow through the vasculature and a lack of oxygen in placental tissue. In the second stage, the placenta releases vascular toxins, such as the protein sFlt-1 — a circulating inhibitor of the signalling protein VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). These toxins cause dysfunction of the endothelial cells that line maternal blood vessels and lead to the clinical syndrome of pre-eclampsia. Levels of sFlt-1 and related biomarkers in the blood can now be measured and are routinely used for early diagnosis in women with suspected pre-eclampsia2–4.",

Yet this standard approach overlooks a crucial point — many blood measurements (biomarkers) are highly individualized and regulated around unique stable values called setpoints, which differ between people. For many people, their ‘normal’ blood values fall within a narrow range — one that is much smaller than the population-based reference range1. Writing in Nature, Foy et al.2 present evidence that underscores the importance of these personalized setpoints, analysing decades of blood-test data across nine key parameters. The authors’ findings suggest that integrating personalized reference intervals into clinical diagnostics could bring about a new level of precision medicine.",

Here, in 421,889 individuals with European ancestry from the Million Veteran Program and UK Biobank, we examine how PGS of 17 neuropsychiatric traits are related to membership in 22 broad professional categories. Overall, we find statistically significant but weak (the highest odds ratio is 1.1 per PGS standard deviation) associations between most professional categories and genetic predisposition for at least one neuropsychiatric trait. Secondary analyses in UK Biobank revealed independence of these associations from observed fluid intelligence and sex-specific effects. By leveraging aggregate population trends, we identified patterns in the public interest, such as the mediating effect of education attainment on the association of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder PGS with multiple professional categories. However, at the individual level, PGS explained less than 0.5% of the variance of professional membership, and almost none after we adjusted for education and socio-economic status.",

          "abstract": "Identifying communal rituals in the Paleolithic is of scientific importance, as it reflects the expression of collective identity and the maintenance of group cohesion. This study provides evidence indicating the practice of deep cave collective rituals in the Levant during the Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) period. It is demonstrated that these gatherings occurred within a distinct ritual compound and were centered around an engraved object in the deepest part of Manot Cave, a pivotal EUP site in southwest Asia. The ritual compound, segregated from the living areas, encompasses a large gallery partitioned by a cluster of remarkable speleothems. Within this gallery, an engraved boulder stands out, displaying geometric signs suggesting a unique representation of a tortoise. Isotopic analysis of calcite crusts on the boulder’s grooves revealed alignment with values found in speleothems from the cave dated to ~37 to 35 ka BP. Additionally, meticulous shape analysis of the grooves’ cross-section and the discernible presence of microlinear scratches on the grooves’ walls confirmed their anthropogenic origin. Examination of stalagmite laminae (36 ka BP) near the engraved boulder revealed a significant presence of wood ash particles within. This finding provides evidence for using fire to illuminate the dark, deep part of the cave during rituals. Acoustic tests conducted in various cave areas indicate that the ritual compound was well suited for communal gatherings, facilitating conversations, speeches, and hearing. Our results underscore the critical role of collective practices centered around a symbolic object in fostering a functional social network within the regional EUP communities.",

Comparative analyses across platforms and over different years can provide critical insights into these phenomena. This study investigates the linguistic characteristics of user comments over 34 y, focusing on their complexity and temporal shifts. Using a dataset of approximately 300 million English comments from eight diverse platforms and topics, we examine user communications’ vocabulary size and linguistic richness and their evolution over time. Our findings reveal consistent patterns of complexity across social media platforms and topics, characterized by a nearly universal reduction in text length, diminished lexical richness, and decreased repetitiveness. Despite these trends, users consistently introduce new words into their comments at a nearly constant rate. This analysis underscores that platforms only partially influence the complexity of user comments but, instead, it reflects a broader pattern of linguistic change driven by social triggers, suggesting intrinsic tendencies in users’ online interactions comparable to historically recognized linguistic hybridization and contamination processes.",

          "abstract": "In many complex systems encountered in the natural and social sciences, mechanisms governing system dynamics at a microscale depend upon the values of state variables characterizing the system at coarse-grained, macroscale (Goldenfeld and Woese, 2011, Noble et al., 2019, and Chater and Loewenstein, 2023). State variables, in turn, are averages over relevant probability distributions of the microscale variables. Neither inferential Top–Down nor mechanistic Bottom–Up modeling alone can predict responses of such scale-entwined systems to perturbations. We describe and explore the properties of a dynamic theory that combines Top–Down information-theoretic inference with Bottom–Up , state-variable-dependent mechanisms. The theory predicts the functional form of nonstationary probability distributions over microvariables and relates the trajectories of time-evolving macrovariables to the form of those distributions. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of Lagrange multipliers from Maxent solutions allow for rapid calculation of the time trajectories of state variables even in high dimensional systems. Examples of possible applications to scale-entwined systems in nonequilibrium chemical thermodynamics, epidemiology, economics, and ecology exemplify the potential multidisciplinary scope of the theory. A worked-out low-dimension example illustrates the structure of the theory and demonstrates how scale entwinement can result in slowed recovery from perturbations, reddened time series spectra in response to white-noise input, and hysteresis upon parameter displacement and subsequent restoration.",

Court-related debt can cause continuing court involvement and incarceration, not because of new crimes, but because of unpaid financial obligations. We conducted an experiment with 606 people found guilty of misdemeanors in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. Study participants were randomly selected to receive relief from all current and prior fines and fees assessed for criminal charges in the county. Fee relief reduced jail bookings 21 mo after randomization and the effect persisted over 44 mo of follow-up. Although fee relief reduced incarceration, financial sanctions had no effect on indicators of lawbreaking. Instead, the control group (who obtained no relief from fines and fees) were rearrested at significantly higher rates because of open arrest warrants for nonpayment. These results indicate the long-term and criminalizing effects of legal debt, supporting claims that financial sanctions disproportionately harm low-income defendants while contributing little to public safety.",

A well-known approach is given by reactive strategies, which respond to the coplayer’s previous move. Here, we extend reactive strategies to longer memories. A reactive- n strategy takes into account the sequence of the last n moves of the coplayer. A reactive- n counting strategy responds to how often the coplayer cooperated during the last n rounds. We derive an algorithm to identify the partner strategies within these strategy sets. Partner strategies are those that ensure mutual cooperation without exploitation. We give explicit conditions for all partner strategies among reactive-2, reactive-3 strategies, and reactive- n counting strategies. To further explore the role of memory, we perform evolutionary simulations. We vary several key parameters, such as the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation, the error rate, and the strength of selection. Within the strategy sets we consider, we find that longer memory tends to promote cooperation. This positive effect of memory is particularly pronounced when individuals take into account the precise sequence of moves.",

          "abstract": "Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is an intracellular process widely used by cells for many key biological functions. It occurs in complex and crowded environments, where amino acids (AAs) are vital components. We have found that AAs render the net interaction between proteins more repulsive. Here, we find that some AAs efficiently suppress LLPS in test tubes (in vitro). We then screen all the proteinogenic AAs and find that three specific AAs, including proline, glutamine, and glycine, significantly suppressed the formation of stress granules (SGs) in U2OS and HeLa cell lines (in vivo) irrespective of stress types. We also observe the effect in primary fibroblast cells, a viable cell model for neurodegenerative disorders. Kinetic studies by live-cell microscopy show that the presence of AAs not only slows down the formation but also decreases the saturating number and prevents the coalescence of SGs. We finally use sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium analytical ultracentrifuge (SE-AUC) to demonstrate that the suppression effects of AAs on LLPS may be due to their modulation in protein–protein and RNA–RNA interactions. Overall, this study reveals an underappreciated role of cellular AAs, which may find biomedical applications, especially in treating SG-associated diseases.",

High-density renewables conversion and harsh-condition electrification further emphasize the need for high-temperature, high-k polymers. A unique design strategy is developed to augment high-temperature polyolefins with improved dielectric constant, via the integration of phenyl pendants hanging off the rigid bicyclic backbone. The impacts of the pendant polarizability and steric positioning on dielectric constant, bandgap, glass-transition temperature ( T g ), and high-field, high-temperature dielectric characteristics have been investigated. The orientational polarization of the polar phenyl pendants with rotational degree of freedom imparts cyclic olefins with enhanced dielectric constants, while maintaining the large bandgap, and high glass-transition temperature ( T g &gt; 170 °C). Among these synthesized polymers, m-PNB-BP stands out with a remarkable dielectric constant of 4 at a high sub- T g temperature of 150 °C, and a high discharged density of 8.6 J/m 3 at 660 MV/m. This study unveils a different path for designing high-temperature polymers with enhanced dielectric constants, particularly beneficial for capacitive energy storage.",

Here, we elucidated the cryoelectron microscopy structure of the photosystem I–light-harvesting complex I (PSI–LHCI) supercomplex from the haptophyte Isochrysis galbana . The PSI core comprises 12 subunits, which have evolved differently from red algae and cryptophytes by losing the PsaO subunit while incorporating the PsaK subunit, which is absent in diatoms and dinoflagellates. The PSI core is encircled by 22 fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a / c -binding light-harvesting antenna proteins (iFCPIs) that form a trilayered antenna arrangement. Moreover, a pigment-binding subunit, L iFP , which has not been identified in any other previously characterized PSI–LHCI supercomplexes, was determined in I. galbana PSI–iFCPI, presumably facilitating the interactions and energy transfer between peripheral iFCPIs and the PSI core. Calculation of excitation energy transfer rates by computational simulations revealed that the intricate pigment network formed within PSI–iFCPI ensures efficient transfer of excitation energy. Overall, our study provides a solid structural foundation for understanding the light-harvesting and energy transfer mechanisms in haptophyte PSI–iFCPI and provides insights into the evolution and structural variations of red-lineage PSI–LHCIs.",

          "abstract": "The curious chemistry observed in microdroplets has captivated chemists in recent years and has led to an investigation into their ability to drive seemingly impossible chemistries. One particularly interesting capability of these microdroplets is their ability to accelerate reactions by several orders of magnitude. While there have been many investigations into which reactions can be accelerated by confinement within microdroplets, no study has directly compared reaction acceleration at the liquid|liquid and gas|liquid interfaces. Here, we confine glucose oxidase, one of life’s most important enzymes, to microdroplets and monitor the turnover rate of glucose by the electroactive cofactor, hexacyanoferrate (III). We use stochastic electrochemistry to monitor the collision of single femtoliter water droplets on an ultramicroelectrode. We also develop a measurement modality to robustly quantify reaction rates for femtoliter liquid aerosol droplets, where the majority of the interface is gas|liquid. We demonstrate that the gas|liquid interface accelerates enzyme turnover by over an order of magnitude over the liquid|liquid interface. This is the first apples-to-apples comparison of reaction acceleration at two distinct interfaces that indicates that the gas|liquid interface plays a central role in driving curious chemistry.",

The entire surface of vegetative cells in exponential or stationary growth phase is covered in proteinaceous arrays called S-layers, composed of Sap or EA1 protein, respectively. The Sap S-layer represents an important virulence factor and cell envelope support structure whose paracrystalline nature is essential for its function. However, the spatial organization of Sap in its lattice state remains elusive. Here, we employed cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging to obtain a map of the Sap S-layer from tubular polymers that revealed a conformational switch between the postassembly protomers and the previously available X-ray structure of the condensed monomers. To build and validate an atomic model of the lattice within this map, we used a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, X-ray crystallography, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and biophysics in an integrative structural biology approach. The Sap lattice model produced recapitulates a close-to-physiological arrangement, reveals high-resolution details of lattice contacts, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the stability of the Sap layer.",

          "abstract": "Le Chatelier in 1887 and Powers in 1947 demonstrated that the volume of nanoscale C-S-H (calcium silicate hydrate) particles formed during hydration is smaller than the combined volume of the reactants—the anhydrous Portland cement and water. Hydration has thus been considered as contractive. An experiment shows that the opposite is true above the nanoscale. The porous skeleton of cement paste expands as the growing C-S-H particles push each other apart, similar to crystal growth pressure. This is significant for high-performance concretes (HPC) with low water-cement ratios (w/c ≤ 0.4), where chemical self-desiccation lowers pore relative humidity by 40%, compared to just 1% in traditional concretes (w/c ≈ 0.5). Standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C1608 tests, using 10 mm thick water-immersed specimens, show large shrinkage because the half-time of water ingress is many decades, unable to offset shrinkage-causing self-desiccation. The present experiment, using a laser microscopy-topography technique, proves the opposite—expansion, evidenced by measuring the length changes of water-immersed HPC shards 0.5 mm thick in which the diffusion halftime, only about one hour, allows continuous resaturation of pores, canceling self-desiccation. The faster diffusion (halftime of one hour) enables continuous pore resaturation, preventing shrinkage. When sealed with paraffin oil, the shards self-desiccate and shrink.

          "abstract": "Climate change has emerged as a key threat to biodiversity, leading to broad-scale shifts in distributions of marine and terrestrial species as they attempt to track thermally suitable habitat. By contrast, our understanding of climate responses of freshwater species is relatively undeveloped, limiting our knowledge of whether projected warming will lead to freshwater biodiversity loss. Here, we linked a multicontinental database of riverine fish population abundance time series collected from 1958 to 2019 to temperature data from the same period. Across the sampled localities, waters warmed by 0.21 °C per decade (annual maximum of monthly temperatures). We tested whether fish responded to this change by i) increasing abundance at the cooler poleward limit of species distributions—predicted if warming has opened new opportunities—and ii) decreasing abundance toward the equatorward limit of distributions—predicted if temperatures have exceeded tolerance thresholds. We found that observed population trends were consistent with both of these expected patterns from climatic warming and that the trends were more pronounced in time series covering the longer time periods of 30+ y. The responses consistent with climate change were most evident in species with larger body sizes, higher trophic levels, river–sea migratory behavior, and more widespread distributions. Moreover, positive abundance responses to warming were more likely at higher altitudes where conditions tend to be cooler. These findings indicate that projected future warming will likely lead to widespread shifts in riverine community structure, including abundance declines at the trailing edge of species distributions.",

FTO is ubiquitinated by its E3 ligase DTX2, followed by UFD1 recruitment and subsequent degradation in the proteasome. VES binds to FTO and DTX2, leading to enhanced FTO–DTX2 interaction, FTO ubiquitination, and degradation in FTO-dependent tumor cells. VES suppressed tumor growth and enhanced antitumor immunity and response to immunotherapy in vivo in mouse models. Genetic FTO knockdown or VES treatment increased m 6 A methylation in the LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor) gene and decreased LIF mRNA decay, and thus sensitized melanoma cells to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity.

Several TMEM16A inhibitors have been identified; however, their binding sites and inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. Using magnolol and honokiol, the two regioisomeric inhibitors, as chemical probes, we have identified a drug-binding site distinct from the pore region, in TMEM16A, which is described here. With electrophysiology, unbiased molecular docking and clustering, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validation with mutant cycle analysis, we show that magnolol and honokiol utilize different drug-binding sites, pore and nonpore pockets. The pore blocker utilizes amino acids crucial for chloride passage, whereas the nonpore blocker allosterically modulates the pore residues to hinder ion permeation. Among 17 inhibitors tested, 11 were pore blockers and 6 were nonpore blockers, indicating the importance of this nonpore pocket. Our study provides insights into drug-binding mechanism in TMEM16A together with a rationale for future drug development.",

          "abstract": "Spatial games provide a simple and elegant mathematical model to study the evolution of cooperation in networks. In spatial games, individuals reside in vertices, adopt simple strategies, and interact with neighbors to receive a payoff. Depending on their own and neighbors’ payoffs, individuals can change their strategy. The payoff is determined by the Prisoners’ Dilemma, a classical matrix game, where players cooperate or defect. While cooperation is the desired behavior, defection provides a higher payoff for a selfish individual. There are many theoretical and empirical studies related to the role of the network in the evolution of cooperation. However, the fundamental question of whether there exist networks that for low initial cooperation rate ensure a high chance of fixation, i.e., cooperation spreads across the whole population, has remained elusive for spatial games with strong selection. In this work, we answer this fundamental question in the affirmative by presenting network structures that ensure high fixation probability for cooperators in the strong selection regime. Besides, our structures have many desirable properties: (a) they ensure the spread of cooperation even for a low initial density of cooperation and high temptation of defection, (b) they have constant degrees, and (c) the number of steps, until cooperation spreads, is at most quadratic in the size of the network.",

The biomineralization mechanisms responsible for the mineral structures, which are key to interpreting palaeoceanographic signals, are poorly understood. Here, we present an extensive analysis of the test-bound proteins. Using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, we identify 373 test-bound proteins in the large benthic foraminifer Amphistegina lobifera , the majority of which are highly acidic and rich in negatively charged residues. We detect proteins involved in vesicle formation and active Ca 2+ trafficking, but in contrast, do not find similar proteins involved in Mg 2+ transport. Considering findings from this study and previous ones, we propose a dual ion transport model involving seawater vacuolization, followed by the active release of Ca 2+ from the initial vacuoles and subsequent uptake into newly formed Ca-rich vesicles that consequently enrich the calcification fluid. We further speculate that Mg 2+ passively leaks through the membrane from the remaining Mg-rich vesicles, into the calcifying fluid, at much lower concentrations than in seawater. This hypothesis could not only explain the low Mg/Ca ratio in foraminiferal tests compared to inorganic calcite, but could possibly also account for its elevated sensitivity to temperature compared with inorganically precipitated CaCO 3 .",

Mechanistically novel small-molecule autophagy regulators are highly desirable from a pharmacological point of view. Here, we report the macroautophagy-inhibitory effect of hapalindole Q, a member of the structurally intriguing but biologically understudied hapalindole family of indole terpenoids. This compound promotes the noncanonical degradation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), the downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, via chaperone-mediated autophagy, disrupting proper distribution of Rab7 and suppressing autophagosome−lysosome fusion in macroautophagy. Its binding to YAP1 is further confirmed by using biophysical techniques. A preliminary structure−activity relationship study reveals that the hapalindole Q scaffold, rather than the isothiocyanate group, is essential for YAP1 binding and degradation. This work not only identifies a macroautophagy inhibitor with a distinct mechanism of action but also provided a molecular scaffold for direct targeting of YAP1, which may benefit the development of therapeutics for both autophagy-related and Hippo−YAP-related diseases.",

Turbulent-like active flows power giant interfacial fluctuations, which exhibit pronounced asymmetry between regions of positive and negative curvature. Experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical arguments reveal how the interface breaks up the spatial symmetry of the fundamental bend instability to generate local vortical flows that lead to asymmetric interface fluctuations. The magnitude of interface deformations increases with activity: In the high activity limit, the interface self-folds invaginating passive droplets and generating a foam-like phase, where active fluid is perforated with passive droplets.

Despite our substantial understanding of plant responses to low humidity, molecular mechanisms underlying the high humidity (HH) response are much less well understood. In this study, we investigated early responses to HH in Arabidopsis . Expression of CYP707A3 , encoding an abscisic acid (ABA) 8′-hydroxylase, is induced by HH within 10 min, which leads to a decrease in foliar ABA level. We identified that the combined action of CAMTA3 and CAMTA2 transcription factors regulate this response. This regulation requires a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain of CAMTA3. Transcriptomes of HH-regulated genes are enriched in those related to calcium signaling, including cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs). Moreover, HH induces CNGC2- and CNGC4-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations in leaves within a few minutes. We also found that CNGC2, CNGC4, and CAMTAs participate in HH-induced hyponastic movement of petioles. Taken together, our results indicate that CNGC2/CNGC4-Ca 2+ -CaM-CAMTA3/CAMTA2 acts as a primary regulatory module to trigger downstream HH responses.",

          "abstract": "The routing of blood flow throughout the brain vasculature is precisely controlled by mechanisms that serve to maintain a fine balance between local neuronal demands and vascular supply of nutrients. We recently identified two capillary endothelial cell (cEC)-based mechanisms that control cerebral blood flow in vivo: 1) electrical signaling, mediated by extracellular K + -dependent activation of strong inward rectifying K + (Kir2.1) channels, which are steeply activated by hyperpolarization and thus are capable of cell-to-cell propagation, and 2) calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling, which reflects release of Ca 2+ via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R)—a target of G q -protein-coupled receptor signaling. Notably, Ca 2+ signals were restricted to the cell in which they were initiated. Unexpectedly, we found that these two mechanisms, which were presumed to operate in distinct spatiotemporal realms, are linked such that Kir2.1-dependent hyperpolarization induces increases in the electrical driving force for Ca 2+ entry into cECs through resident TRPV4 channels. This process, termed electrocalcium (E-Ca) coupling, enhances IP 3 R-mediated Ca 2+ release via a Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ -release mechanism, and allows focally induced hyperpolarization, including that initiated by ATP-dependent K + (K ATP ) channels, to travel cell-to-cell via activation of Kir2.1 channels in adjacent cells, providing a mechanism for the “pseudopropagation” of Ca 2+ signals. Computational modeling supported the basic features of E-Ca coupling and provided insight into the intracellular processes involved. Collectively, these data provide strong support for the concept of E-Ca coupling and provide a mechanism for the spatiotemporal integration of diverse signaling pathways in the control of cerebral blood flow.",

We demonstrated that exclusive DC-intrinsic expression of CARD11-GOF in mice was sufficient to induce a lethal autoinflammatory syndrome that mimicked human HLH.

Recently, several morphologically inactive near-Earth objects were reported to experience significant nongravitational accelerations inconsistent with radiation-based effects, and possibly explained by volatile-driven outgassing. However, these “dark comets” display no evidence of comae in archival images, which are the defining feature of cometary activity. Here, we report detections of nongravitational accelerations on seven additional objects classified as inactive (doubling the population) that could also be explainable by asymmetric mass loss. A detailed search of archival survey and targeted data rendered no detection of dust activity in any of these objects in individual or stacked images. We calculate dust production limits of ∼ 10, 0.1 , and 0.1 kg s − 1 for 1998 FR 11 , 2001 ME 1 , and 2003 RM with these data, indicating little or no dust surrounding the objects during the observations. This set of dark comets reveals the delineation between two distinct populations: larger, “outer” dark comets on eccentric orbits that are end members of a continuum in activity level of comets, and smaller, “inner” dark comets on near-circular orbits that could signify a different different population. These objects may trace various stages in the life cycle of a previously undetected, but potentially numerous, volatile-rich population that may have provided essential material to the Earth.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the biophysical basis of protein aggregation is important in biology because of the potential link to several misfolding diseases. Although experiments have shown that protein aggregates adopt a variety of morphologies, the dynamics of their formation are less well characterized. Here, we introduce a minimal model to explore the dependence of the aggregation dynamics on the structural and sequence features of the monomers. Using simulations, we demonstrate that sequence complexity (codified in terms of word entropy) and monomer rigidity profoundly influence the dynamics and morphology of the aggregates. Flexible monomers with low sequence complexity (corresponding to repeat sequences) form liquid-like droplets that exhibit ergodic behavior. Strikingly, these aggregates abruptly transition to more ordered structures, reminiscent of amyloid fibrils, when the monomer rigidity is increased. In contrast, aggregates resulting from monomers with high sequence complexity are amorphous and display nonergodic glassy dynamics. The heterogeneous dynamics of the low and high-complexity sequences follow stretched exponential kinetics, which is one of the characteristics of glassy dynamics. Importantly, at nonzero values of the bending rigidities, the aggregates age with the relaxation times that increase with the waiting time. Informed by these findings, we provide insights into aging dynamics in protein condensates and contrast the behavior with the dynamics expected in RNA repeat sequences. Our findings underscore the influence of the monomer characteristics in shaping the morphology and dynamics of protein aggregates, thus providing a foundation for deciphering the general rules governing the behavior of protein condensates.",

          "abstract": "Structurally intact native forests free from major human pressures are vitally important habitats for the persistence of forest biodiversity. However, the extent of such high-integrity forest habitats remaining for biodiversity is unknown. Here, we quantify the amount of high-integrity tropical rainforests, as a fraction of total forest cover, within the geographic ranges of 16,396 species of terrestrial vertebrates worldwide. We found up to 90% of the humid tropical ranges of forest-dependent vertebrates was encompassed by forest cover. Concerningly, however, merely 25% of these remaining rainforests are of high integrity. Forest-dependent species that are threatened and declining and species with small geographic ranges have disproportionately low proportions of high-integrity forest habitat left. Our work brings much needed attention to the poor quality of much of the forest estate remaining for biodiversity across the humid tropics. The targeted preservation of the world’s remaining high-integrity tropical rainforests that are currently unprotected is a critical conservation priority that may help alleviate the biodiversity crisis in these hyperdiverse and irreplaceable ecosystems. Enhanced efforts worldwide to preserve tropical rainforest integrity are essential to meet the targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework which aims to achieve near zero loss of high biodiversity importance areas (including ecosystems of high integrity) by 2030.",

          "abstract": "Retinal rods and cones underlie scotopic and photopic vision, respectively. Their pigments exhibit spontaneous isomerizations (quantal noise) in darkness due to intrinsic thermal energy. This quantal noise, albeit exceedingly low in rods, dictates the light threshold for scotopic vision. The same quantal noise in cones, however, is too low to explain the much higher diurnal light threshold. Separately, a dark continuous noise is present in rods, long accepted to originate from an intrinsic random activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-phosphodiesterase enzyme mediating phototransduction downstream of the pigment. Here, we report the surprising finding that most of this rod dark continuous noise actually originates from rhodopsin itself. Importantly, we found the same continuous noise with a much higher magnitude from cone pigments. The rod and cone continuous noises are apparently both associated with a hitherto unrecognized “metastable” pigment conformational state physiologically resembling that in apo-opsin (opsin devoid of chromophore) and is intermittently active for very brief moments. The cone holopigment’s high continuous noise is expected to act as an intrinsic equivalent light and adapt the cone dramatically, accounting for a major part of the light-sensitivity difference between rods and cones in darkness.",

Multiple chaperones interact with and disaggregate amyloid fibrils, which impacts amyloid propagation and cellular phenotypes. However, it remains poorly understood whether and how site-specific binding of chaperones to amyloids facilitates the concerted disaggregation process and modulates physiological consequences in vivo. Here, we identified binding sites of Ssa1, Sis1, and Hsp104 chaperones for Sup35, the protein determinant of yeast prion [ PSI + ] yeast. Our biophysical and genetic analyses with various Sup35 deletion mutants and amyloid conformations revealed that the Ssa1-binding to the region outside amyloid core plays a key role in facilitating disaggregation and propagation of yeast prions both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we developed a reconstitution system, including the Ssa1-binding tag and the HAP/Caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) hybrid chaperones, and found that this reconstitution system successfully degraded distinct prion strain conformations. Together, these results show that the properly positioned, exposed Ssa1-binding region in amyloid fibrils influences the efficiency of amyloid disaggregation and propagation, and eventually prion strain phenotypes. More broadly, our findings provide molecular foundations for previous, puzzling observations of prion propagation in vivo, and offer insights into elimination of amyloid deposits in cells.",

In contrast to Frenkel exciton–polarons, an excimer is long-lived and energetically low-lying due to stabilization resulting from a substantial reorganization of the intermolecular geometry. Here, we show that ultrafast electron diffraction can follow the dynamics of solid-state excimer formation in polycrystalline thin films of a molecular semiconductor, revealing both the key reaction modes and the eventual structure of the emitting state. We study the prototypical organic semiconductor zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) in its crystallographic α -phase as a model excimeric system. We show that the excimer forms in a two-step process starting with a fast dimerization (approx. 0.4 ps) followed by a subsequent slow shear-twist motion (14 ps) leading to an alignment of the π -systems of the involved monomers. This structural distortion persists well beyond 300 ps. Furthermore, we show that while the same excimer geometry is present in partially fluorinated derivatives of ZnPc, the formation kinematics slow down with increasing level of fluorination.",

          "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax parasites can lie dormant in the liver as hypnozoites, activating weeks to months after sporozoite inoculation to cause relapsing malarial illness. It is not known what biological processes govern hypnozoite activation. We use longitudinal data from the most detailed cohort study ever conducted in an area where both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were endemic to fit a simple within-host mathematical model of P. vivax hypnozoite activation. 1,344 children living on the Thailand–Myanmar border were followed daily for 21 mo. There were 2,504 vivax and 1,164 falciparum malaria symptomatic episodes recorded over 1988 person-years. The model assumes that hypnozoites activate independently at a constant rate (“exponential clock model”). When this model was embedded in a stochastic framework for repeated infectious mosquito bites, with seasonality inferred from the incidence of clinical falciparum malaria episodes, it explained the observed temporal patterns of multiple (up to 13) recurrent vivax malaria episodes. Under this model, we estimate the mean dormancy period for a single hypnozoite to be 6 mo (i.e., a half-life of 4 mo). We use the calibrated within-host model to characterize population-level overdispersion in the risk of relapse, and assess the potential utility of a serological test for radical cure in low transmission settings. We show that mefloquine treatment of falciparum malaria eliminates early vivax relapses; and that there are substantially more P. vivax recurrences than expected under the model following artesunate monotherapy treatment for falciparum malaria. These results suggest that hypnozoites can be activated by symptomatic malarial illness.",

          "abstract": "Multiple hypotheses have been put forth to understand why defense chemistry in individual plants is so diverse. A major challenge has been teasing apart the importance of concentration vs. composition of defense compounds and resolving the mechanisms of diversity effects that determine plant resistance against herbivores. Accordingly, we first outline nonexclusive mechanisms by which phytochemical diversity may increase toxicity of a mixture compared to the average effect of each compound alone. We then leveraged independent in vitro, in vivo transgenic, and organismal experiments to test the effect of equimolar concentrations of purified milkweed toxins in isolation vs. mixtures on the specialist and sequestering monarch butterfly. We show that cardenolide toxin mixtures from milkweed plants enhance resistance against this herbivore compared to equal concentrations of single compounds. In mixtures, highly potent toxins dominated the inhibition of the monarch’s target enzyme (Na + /K + -ATPase) in vitro, revealing toxin-specific affinity for the adapted enzyme in the absence of other physiological adaptations of the monarch. Mixtures also caused increased mortality in CRISPR-edited adult Drosophila melanogaster with the monarch enzyme in vivo, whereas wild-type flies showed lower survival regardless of mixture type. Finally, although experimentally administered mixtures were not more toxic to monarch caterpillars than single compounds overall, increasing caterpillar sequestration from mixtures resulted in an increasing burden for growth compared to single compounds. Phytochemical diversity likely provides an economical plant defense by acting on multiple aspects of herbivore physiology and may be particularly effective against sequestering specialist herbivores.",

          "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a major role in the chemistry of combustion, pyrolysis, and the interstellar medium. Production (or activation) of radical PAHs and propagation of their resulting reactions require efficient dehydrogenation, but the preferred method of hydrogen loss is not well understood. Unimolecular hydrogen ejection (i.e., direct C─H bond fission) and bimolecular radical abstraction are two main candidate pathways. We performed a computational study to characterize the role of H ejection, particularly as a driver for radical-centric hydrocarbon-growth mechanisms and particle formation. Electronic structure calculations establish that C─H bond strengths span a broad range of energies, which can be weaker than 30 kcal/mol in some C 9 and C 13 PAH radicals. At T &gt; 1200 K, calculated thermal rates for hydrogen ejection from weak C─H bonds at zigzag sites on PAH radicals are significantly larger than typical H-abstraction rates. These results are highly relevant in the context of chain reactions of radical species and soot inception under fuel-rich combustion conditions. Furthermore, calculated microcanonical rates that include the additional internal energy released by bond formation (e.g., ring closure to yield C 9 H 9 ) yield significantly higher rates than those associated with full thermalization. These microcanonical considerations are relevant to the astrochemical processes associated with hydrocarbon growth and processing in the low-density interstellar environment.",

This study employs a multiproxy approach (phytolith, starch, and fungi) to analyze microfossil remains associated with pottery vessels from the earliest phase of the Shangshan site (ca. 10,000 to 9,000 cal. BP). The results indicate that rice was consumed as a dietary staple and used for brewing fermented beverages with a qu starter containing Monascus mold and yeast as fermentation agents. The fermentation ingredients included rice, supplemented with other cereals (Job’s tears, Panicoideae, and Triticeae), acorn, and lily. This rice-fungi-based multiplant brewing method marked the earliest-known alcoholic fermentation technique in East Asia. The emergence of this fermentation technology is attributable to the early development of rice domestication and the arrival of the wet-warm Holocene climate, which was favorable for fungal growth. These alcoholic beverages likely played a pivotal role in ceremonial feasting, highlighting their ritual function as a driving factor that may have stimulated the intensive utilization and widespread cultivation of rice in Neolithic China.",

Cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry is an essential tool for elucidating protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Despite its importance, we still know surprisingly little about the principles that underlie the process of chemical cross-link formation itself and how it is influenced by different physicochemical factors. To understand the molecular details of cross-link formation, we have set up a comprehensive kinetic model and carried out simulations of protein cross-linking on large protein complexes. We dissect the contribution on the cross-link yield of parameters such as amino acid reactivity, cross-linker concentration, and hydrolysis rate. Our model can compute cross-link formation based solely on the structure of a protein complex, thereby enabling realistic predictions for a diverse set of systems. We quantitatively show how cross-links and mono-links are in direct competition and how the hydrolysis rate and abundance of cross-linker and proteins directly influence their relative formation. We show how cross-links and mono-links exist in an “all-against-all” competition due to their simultaneous formation, resulting in a nonintuitive network of interdependence. We show that this interdependence is locally confined and mainly limited to direct neighbors or residues in direct vicinity. These results enable us to identify the optimal cross-linker concentration at which the maximal number of cross-links is formed. Taken together, our study establishes a comprehensive kinetic model to quantitatively describe cross-link formation for PPIs.",

Our study reveals that the negative Δ 33 S anomalies produced by coal combustion are consistent with similar anomalies observed in present-day sulfate aerosols in Beijing, China, and the black crust sulfates formed on building stones, monument walls, and sculptures in Europe that contribute to carbonate stone deterioration and cultural heritage damage. This finding provides independent evidence for a critical role of atmospheric sulfate from coal combustion in maintaining isotopic balance and offers an effective method for tracing sulfate aerosol sources.

Here, we reconstructed the origin and evolutionary history of auxin-mediated acid growth. Comparative phylogenomic analysis showed that most core components of acid growth originated in Charophyta and then underwent subclass expansion and functional innovation during plant terrestrialization. In Charophyceae algae Chara braunii, we found that PM H + -ATPase has formed a core regulatory module with TMK and PP2C.D, which can be activated by photosynthesis-dependent phosphorylation through light rather than auxin. Despite the lack of canonical auxin receptor TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB), auxin elicits significant internodal elongation and transcriptional reprogramming in C. braunii , implying the existence of an ancient auxin-mediated growth mechanism. We propose that the evolution of acid growth represents a neofunctional adaptation to terrestrial environments, in which PM H + -ATPase in carbon concentrating for photosynthesis was utilized to acidify apoplast for cell expansion, and the core components responsible for acid growth eventually established a regulatory network in land plants by connecting with the TIR1/AFB pathway.",

          "abstract": "DNA repair systems are essential to maintain genome integrity and stability. Some obligate endosymbionts that experience long-term symbiosis with the insect hosts, however, have lost their key components for DNA repair. It is largely unexplored how the bacterial endosymbionts cope with the increased demand for mismatch repairs under heat stresses. Here, we showed that ibpA, a small heat shock protein encoded by Buchnera aphidicola , directly interacted with the cytoskeletal actin to prevent its aggregation in bacteriocytes, thus reinforcing the stability of bacteriocytes. However, the succession of 11 adenines in the promoter of ibpA is extremely prone to mismatching error, e.g., a single adenine deletion, which impairs the induction of ibpA under heat stress. Coinfection with a facultative endosymbiont Serratia symbiotica remarkably reduced the mutagenesis rate in the Buchnera genome and potentially prevented a single adenine deletion in ibpA promoter, thereby alleviating the heat vulnerability of aphid bacteriocytes. Furthermore, Serratia encoded mutH, a conserved core protein of prokaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR), accessed to Buchnera cells, which complemented Buchnera mutL and mutS in constituting an active MMR. Our findings imply that a full complement of a prokaryotic MMR system assembled by two bacterial endosymbionts contributes significantly to the thermostability of aphid bacteriocytes in an ibpA-dependent manner, furnishing a distinct molecular link among tripartite symbioses in shaping resilience and adaptation of their insect hosts to occupy other ecological niches.",

GABA A receptors, however, have a pseudosymmetrical pentameric assembly, and curiously diverse functional outcomes have been reported for certain homologous variants in paralogous genes (paralogous variants). To investigate this, we assembled a cohort of 11 individuals harboring paralogous M1 proline missense variants in GABRA1 , GABRB2 , GABRB3, and GABRG2. Seven mutations (α1 P260L , α1 P260S , β2 P252L , β3 P253L , β3 P253S , γ2 P282A , and γ2 P282S ) in α1β2/3γ2 receptors were analyzed using electrophysiological examinations and molecular dynamics simulations. All individuals in the cohort were diagnosed with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, with a median seizure onset age of 3.5 mo, and all exhibited global developmental delay. The clinical data for this cohort aligned with established GABA A receptor GOF but not LOF cohorts. Electrophysiological assessments revealed that all variants caused GOF by increasing GABA sensitivity by 3- to 23-fold. In some cases, this was accompanied by LOF traits such as reduced maximal current amplitude and enhanced receptor desensitization. The specific subunit mutated and whether the mutation occurred in one or two subunits within the pentamer influenced the overall effects. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed similar structural changes from all mutations, but with position-dependent asymmetry. These findings establish that paralogous variants affecting the 100% conserved proline residue in the M1 transmembrane helix of GABA A R subunits all lead to overall GOF traits. The unexpected asymmetric and mixed effects on receptor function have broader implications for interpreting functional analyses for multimeric ion-channel proteins.",

The primary conformational descriptors for understanding IDP ensembles—the radius of gyration ( R G ), measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and the root mean square (rms) end-to-end distance ( R E ), probed by fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)—are often reported to produce inconsistent results regarding IDP expansion as a function of denaturant concentration in the buffer. This ongoing debate surrounding the FRET-SAXS discrepancy raises questions about the overall reliability of either method for quantitatively studying IDP properties. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a genetically encoded anomalous SAXS (ASAXS) ruler, enabling simultaneous and direct measurements of R G and R E without assuming a specific structural model. This ruler utilizes a genetically encoded noncanonical amino acid with two bromine atoms, providing an anomalous X-ray scattering signal for precise distance measurements. Through this approach, we experimentally demonstrate that the ratio between R E and R G varies under different denaturing conditions, highlighting the intrinsic properties of IDPs as the primary source of the observed SAXS-FRET discrepancy rather than shortcomings in either of the two established methods. The developed genetically encoded ASAXS ruler emerges as a versatile tool for both IDPs and folded proteins, providing a unified approach for obtaining complementary and site-specific conformational information in scattering experiments, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of protein functions.",

          "abstract": "Inflammation is associated with localized acidosis, however, attributing physiological and pathological roles to proton-sensitive receptors is challenging due to their diversity and widespread expression. Here, agonists of the proton-sensing GPCR, GPR65, were systematically characterized. The synthetic agonist BTB09089 (BTB) recapitulated many proton-induced signaling events and demonstrated selectivity for GPR65. BTB was used to show that GPR65 activation on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), cells that line synovial joints, results in the secretion of proinflammatory mediators capable of recruiting immune cells and sensitizing sensory neurons. Intra-articular injection of BTB resulted in GPR65-dependent sensitization of knee-innervating neurons and nocifensive behaviors in mice. Stimulation of GPR65 on human FLS also triggered the release of inflammatory mediators and synovial fluid samples from human osteoarthritis patients were shown to activate GPR65. These results suggest a role of GPR65 in mediating cell–cell interactions that drive inflammatory joint pain in both mice and humans.",

          "abstract": "Deception is a universal human behavior. Yet longstanding skepticism about the validity of measures used to characterize the biological mechanisms underlying deceptive behavior has relegated such studies to the scientific periphery. Here, we address these fundamental questions by applying machine learning methods and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to signaling games capturing motivated deception in human participants. First, we develop an approach to test for the presence of confounding processes and validate past skepticism by showing that much of the predictive power of neural predictors trained on deception data comes from processes other than deception. Specifically, we demonstrate that discriminant validity is compromised by the predictor’s ability to predict behavior in a control task that does not involve deception. Second, we show that the presence of confounding signals need not be fatal and that the validity of the neural predictor can be improved by removing confounding signals while retaining those associated with the task of interest. To this end, we develop a “dual-goal tuning” approach in which, beyond the typical goal of predicting the behavior of interest, the predictor also incorporates a second compulsory goal that enforces chance performance in the control task. Together, these findings provide a firmer scientific foundation for understanding the neural basis of a neglected class of behavior, and they suggest an approach for improving validity of neural predictors.",

          "abstract": "The stability of ecological communities has a profound impact on humans, ranging from individual health influenced by the microbiome to ecosystem services provided by fisheries. A long-standing goal of ecology is the elucidation of the interplay between biodiversity and ecosystem stability, with some ecologists warning of instability due to loss of species diversity while others arguing that greater diversity will instead lead to instability. Here, by considering a minimal two-level ecosystem with multiple predator and prey species, we show that stability does not depend on absolute diversity but rather on diversity differences between levels. We found that increasing diversity in either level first destabilizes but then stabilizes the community (i.e., a reentrant stability transition). We therefore find that it is the diversity difference between levels that is the key to stability, with the least stable communities having similar diversities in different levels. An analytical stability criterion is derived, demonstrating quantitatively that the critical diversity difference is determined by the correlation between how one level affects another and how it is affected in turn. Our stability criterion also applies to consumer–resource models with other forms of interaction such as cross-feeding. Finally, we show that stability depends on diversity differences in ecosystems with three trophic levels. Our finding of a nonmonotonic dependence of stability on diversity provides a natural explanation for the variety of diversity-stability relationships reported in the literature, and emphasizes the significance of level structure in predicting complex community behaviors.",

          "abstract": "The oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway is a fundamental carbon catabolic route for generating reducing power and metabolic intermediates for biosynthetic processes. In addition, its first two reactions form the OPP shunt, which replenishes the Calvin-Benson cycle under certain conditions. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of this metabolic route. In photosynthetic organisms, G6PDH is redox-regulated to allow fine-tuning and to prevent futile cycles while carbon is being fixed. In cyanobacteria, regulation of G6PDH requires the redox protein OpcA, but the underlying molecular mechanisms behind this allosteric activation remain elusive. Here, we used enzymatic assays and in vivo interaction analyses to show that OpcA binds G6PDH under different environmental conditions. However, complex formation enhances G6PDH activity when OpcA is oxidized and inhibits it when OpcA is reduced. To understand the molecular basis of this regulation, we used cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of Synechocystis G6PDH and the G6PDH–OpcA complex. OpcA binds the G6PDH tetramer and induces conformational changes in the active site of G6PDH. The redox sensitivity of OpcA is achieved by intramolecular disulfide bridge formation, which influences the allosteric regulation of G6PDH. In vitro assays reveal that the level of G6PDH activation depends on the number of bound OpcA molecules, which implies that this mechanism allows delicate fine-tuning. Our findings unveil a unique molecular mechanism governing the regulation of the OPP in Synechocystis .",

Here, we dissect the generation and elimination processes of non-Faradaic electric field in segments using the developed operando cryogenic transmission X-ray microscopy (Cryo-TXM). This method accurately tracks the ion self-balancing pathways in LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) post-fast-charging, elucidating the high polarization during late charging caused by exacerbated irreversible local electric field. By intermittently applying reverse potential during fast charging to alleviate the exacerbation of non-Faradaic electric field at the cathode interface, we achieved a roughly 400% reversible capacity increase of SSBs at 10 C. This insightful dynamic imaging method effectively captures and resolves the transient, opaque signals within SSBs, significantly enhancing their fast-charging performance.",

Zoonotic infections predominantly originate from ungulates and occasionally from rats, highlighting the zoonotic potential of rodent-associated hepeviruses. We conducted host genomic data mining and uncovered two genetically divergent rodent-associated hepeviruses, and two bat-associated hepeviruses genetically related to known bat-associated strains. We thus analyzed 2,565 liver specimens from 108 rodent and shrew species sampled from globally understudied regions and hosts in Africa, Asia, and Latin America during 2011-2018 for hepeviruses by RT–PCR. We detected 63 positive field samples (2.5%, 95% CI 1.9-3.1) from 14 animal species, including two coinfections with genetically divergent strains and significant variation ( X 2 , P &lt; 0.001) in detection rates between study sites. Strain-specific qRT–PCR assays showed virus concentrations between 9.2 × 10 2 and 3.2 × 10 9 copies/g. We recovered 24 near-complete hepeviral genomes from rodents, shrews, and bats, all showing three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), some including putative late domains that may be associated with quasi-envelopment. Rodent-derived hepeviruses grouped into five clades clustering in basal sister relationship to human- (31 to 84% distance in translated ORF1-3) and rat-associated HEV. Parsimony-based analyses and cophylogenetic reconciliations revealed that rodents were predominant sources of hepeviral cross-order host shifts. Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions substantiated a direct origin of human-associated HEV in ungulates such as swine and camelids (posterior probability 0.8), whereas the nonrecent evolutionary origins of human- and ungulate-associated HEV were projected to rodent hosts (posterior probability &gt; 0.9). Our results elucidate the genealogy of human HEV and warrant increased surveillance and experimental risk assessments for rodent-associated hepeviruses.",

We show that none of the four candidate protein-coding genes within this locus, including cortex , serve as major effectors. Instead, a microRNA (miRNA), mir-193 , serves as the major effector across three deeply diverged lineages of butterflies, and its role is conserved in Drosophila . In Lepidoptera, mir-193 is derived from a gigantic primary long noncoding RNA, ivory , and it functions by directly repressing multiple pigmentation genes.

Taking classic bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 )–based thermoelectric semiconductors as an example, we show that antisite defects can lead to high-density, diverse microstructures that substantially affect mechanical properties and thus successfully transform these bulk semiconductors from brittle to plastic, leading to a high figure of merit of up to 1.05 at 300 kelvin compared with other plastic semiconductors, similar to the best brittle semiconductors.

To design cells potentially useful for local immune suppression, we engineered conventional CD4 + T cells with synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors driving antigen-triggered production of anti-inflammatory payloads. Screening a diverse library of suppression programs, we observed the strongest suppression of cytotoxic T cell attack by the production of both anti-inflammatory factors (interleukin-10, transforming growth factor–β1, programmed death ligand 1) and sinks for proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-2 receptor subunit CD25). Engineered cells with bespoke regulatory programs protected tissues from immune attack without systemic suppression. Synthetic suppressor T cells protected transplanted beta cell organoids from cytotoxic T cells. They also protected specific tissues from unwanted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell cross-reaction. Synthetic suppressor T cells are a customizable platform to potentially treat autoimmune diseases, organ rejection, and CAR T cell toxicities with spatial precision.",

Synthetic Notch receptors engineered to detect these antigens were used to program T cells to induce the expression of diverse payloads only in the brain. CNS-targeted T cells that induced chimeric antigen receptor expression efficiently cleared primary and secondary brain tumors without harming cross-reactive cells outside of the brain. Conversely, CNS-targeted cells that locally delivered the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 ameliorated symptoms in a mouse model of neuroinflammation.

However, conventional soft materials are typically limited to a single, unidirectional deformation unless complex hybrid constructs are used. We exploited the combination of mesogen self-assembly, polymer chain elasticity, and polymerization-induced stress to design liquid crystalline elastomers that exhibit two mesophases: chevron smectic C (cSmC) and smectic A (SmA). Inducing the cSmC-SmA–isotropic phase transition led to an unusual inversion of the strain field in the microstructure, resulting in opposite deformation modes (e.g., consecutive shrinkage or expansion and right-handed or left-handed twisting and tilting in opposite directions) and high-frequency nonmonotonic oscillations. This ambidirectional movement is scalable and can be used to generate Gaussian transformations at the macroscale.",

I synthesized 485 studies and more than 5 million projections to produce a quantitative global assessment of climate change extinctions. With increased certainty, this meta-analysis suggests that extinctions will accelerate rapidly if global temperatures exceed 1.5°C. The highest-emission scenario would threaten approximately one-third of species, globally. Amphibians; species from mountain, island, and freshwater ecosystems; and species inhabiting South America, Australia, and New Zealand face the greatest threats. In line with predictions, climate change has contributed to an increasing proportion of observed global extinctions since 1970. Besides limiting greenhouse gases, pinpointing which species to protect first will be critical for preserving biodiversity until anthropogenic climate change is halted and reversed.",

Overfishing the largest species in nearshore and pelagic habitats risks loss of ecomorphotypes and a 5 to 22% erosion of functional diversity. Extinction risk is higher in countries with large human coastal populations but lower in nations with stronger governance, larger economies, and greater beneficial fisheries subsidies. Restricting fishing (including incidental catch) and trade to sustainable levels combined with prohibiting retention of highly threatened species can avert further depletion, widespread loss of population connectivity, and top-down predator control.",

Using detailed global and regional plastics datasets coupled with socioeconomic data, we employ machine learning to predict that, without intervention, annual mismanaged plastic waste will nearly double to 121 million metric tonnes (Mt) [100 to 139 Mt 95% confidence interval] by 2050. Annual greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic system are projected to grow by 37% to 3.35 billion tonnes CO 2 equivalent (3.09 to 3.54) over the same period. The United Nations plastic pollution treaty presents an opportunity to reshape these outcomes. We simulate eight candidate treaty policies and find that just four could together reduce mismanaged plastic waste by 91% (86 to 98%) and gross plastic–related greenhouse gas emissions by one-third.",

          "abstract": "Social networks may help individuals maintain their mental health. Most empirical work based on small-scale surveys finds that cohesive social networks are critical for mental well-being, while diverse networks are considered less important. Here, we link data on antidepressant use of 277,344 small-town residents to a nationwide online social network. The data enable us to examine how individuals’ mental health care is related to the spatial characteristics of their social networks including their ties in the local community and connections to distant communities. We find that, besides the cohesion of social networks around home, the diversity of connections to distant places is negatively correlated with the probability of antidepressant use. Spatial diversity of social networks is also associated with decreasing dosage in subsequent years. This relationship is independent from the local access to antidepressants and is more prevalent for young individuals. Structural features of spatial social networks are prospectively associated with depression treatment.",

We study heat and mortality in Mexico, a country that exhibits a unique combination of universal mortality microdata and among the most extreme levels of humid heat. Combining detailed measurements of wet-bulb temperature with age-specific mortality data, we find that younger people who are particularly vulnerable to heat: People under 35 years old account for 75% of recent heat-related deaths and 87% of heat-related lost life years, while those 50 and older account for 96% of cold-related deaths and 80% of cold-related lost life years. We develop high-resolution projections of humid heat and associated mortality and find that under the end-of-century SSP 3–7.0 emissions scenario, temperature-related deaths shift from older to younger people. Deaths among under-35-year-olds increase 32% while decreasing by 33% among other age groups.",

          "abstract": "Inferring the intentions and emotions of others from behavior is crucial for social cognition. While neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions involved in social inference, it remains unknown whether performing social inference is an abstract computation that generalizes across different stimulus categories or is specific to certain stimulus domain. We recorded single-neuron activity from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in neurosurgical patients performing different types of inferences from images of faces, hands, and natural scenes. Our findings indicate distinct neuron populations in both regions encoding inference type for social (faces, hands) and nonsocial (scenes) stimuli, while stimulus category was itself represented in a task-general manner.

          "authors": "Charles C. Lanfear, David S. Kirk, Robert J. Sampson",
          "abstract": "Most homicides in the United States are committed using a handgun, but little research examines gun carrying over critical stages of the life course and changing contexts of violence. Notably, although most of the handgun homicides are committed by adults, most research on concealed gun carrying focuses on adolescents in single cohort studies. Using more than 25 years of longitudinal multicohort data from Chicago, 1994–2021, we show that pathways of concealed gun carrying are distinct between adolescence and adulthood. Adolescent carrying is often age-limited and responsive to direct exposure to gun violence (witnessing and victimization), while adult carrying is a persistent behavior that is less tied to direct exposure. The onset of concealed carry is also a strong predictor of later gun use (shooting or brandishing), and we find distinct patterns of gun use between individuals who first carry in adolescence versus adulthood. We discuss the implications of these dual pathways for research and policies on firearm use.",

Super-resolution microscopic analysis of MuV IBs demonstrated that nucleocapsid and phospho (P)-proteins formed a cage-like structure and that the viral polymerase adopted a reticular pattern and colocalized with viral RNAs. In addition, we characterized host RNAs localized in MuV IBs by a spatial transcriptome analysis, and found that RNAs containing G-quadruplex motif sequences (G4-RNAs) were concentrated. An in vitro phase separation assay showed that the G4-RNAs interacted with the P protein and enhanced condensation in P droplets. Together, our data show that MuV generates IBs with a characteristic cage-like structure and host G4-RNAs play an important role in forming MuV IBs.",

Primary tumors were overall more transcriptomically similar to their tissues of origin, while metastases shifted toward their target tissues. However, pathway-level analysis highlighted critical metabolic and immune transcriptomic changes toward target tissues during metastasis in both primary and metastatic tumors. In addition, primary tumors exhibited higher activity in cancer hallmarks such as “Activating Invasion and Metastasis” when compared to metastases.

Palmitoylation and the signal peptide were not required for Wnt7a-EV secretion. Coatomer was identified as the EV-binding protein for the EBP. Analysis of cocrystal structures, binding thermodynamics, and mutagenesis found that a dilysine motif mediates EBP binding to coatomer with a conserved function across the Wnt family. We showed that EBP is required for Wnt7a bioactivity when expressed in vivo during regeneration.

Here, we demonstrate that the imaging depth for NAD(P)H can be extended to more than 700 μm in living engineered human multicellular microtissues by adopting multimode fiber-based, low repetition rate, high peak power, three-photon excitation of NAD(P)H at 1100 nm. This is achieved by having more than 0.5 megawatts peak power at the band of 1100 ± 25 nm through adaptively modulating multimodal nonlinear pulse propagation with a compact fiber shaper. Moreover, the eightfold increase in pulse energy enables faster imaging of monocyte behaviors in the living multicellular models. These results represent a substantial advance for deep and dynamic imaging of intact living biosystems.

Here, Turing-architecture COF membranes were constructed by engineering a reaction-diffusion assembly process via heterogeneous nucleation synthesis with tannic acid (TA). TA covalently binds with amine monomers to form a composite precursor with increased reactivity and decreased diffusivity. This altered the pathway of Schiff base reactions with aldehyde monomers, fulfilling suitable reaction-diffusion conditions, and ultimately formed the labyrinthine stripe or spot-patterned Turing COF film with controlled stacking and uniform pore structure. This endows our COF membrane with highly efficient molecule sieving ability for organic solvent nanofiltration while exhibiting a flux that is 621% greater than that of commercial membranes. Thus, this study provides a paradigm for the in situ synthesis of highly efficient COF membranes for diversely sustainable separations.",

Recycling and reusing HEMs are challenging because their design relies on high fractions of expensive and limited-supply elements in massive solid solutions. Therefore, we review the basic sustainability aspects of HEMs. Solutions include using feedstock with lower carbon and energy footprints, sustainable primary synthesis routes from minerals, attenuation of the equimolar alloying rule, and a preference for scrap and dumped waste for secondary and tertiary synthesis. The high solubility, compositional flexibility, and chemical robustness of HEMs offer pathways for using higher fractions of mixed and contaminated scrap and waste feedstocks, which are not admissible for synthesizing conventional materials. We also discuss thermodynamic and kinetic design strategies to reconcile good material properties with high impurity tolerance and variable compositions.",

Here, we introduce in situ pump-probe IR and Raman excitation (INSPIRE) microscopy, a nascent cross-modality spectroscopic imaging approach by encoding the ultrafast Raman and the IR photothermal relaxation into a single probe beam for simultaneous detection. INSPIRE inherits the merits of complementary modalities and demonstrates high-content molecular imaging of chemicals, cells, tissues, and organisms.

This ability is not innate; rather, it develops with experience early in life. We show that, when mice are naïve to an odor object, perceptual constancy is absent across increasing concentrations. The perceptual change coincides with a rapid reduction in activity from a single olfactory receptor channel that is most sensitive to the odor. This drop in activity is not a property of circuit interactions within the olfactory bulb; instead, it is due to a sensitivity mismatch of olfactory receptor neurons within the nose. We show that, after forming an association of this odor with food, the sensitivity of the receptor channel is matched to the odor object, preventing transmission failure and promoting perceptual stability.

Haploinsufficiency of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL/KMT2A) protein causes Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS), a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with microcephaly. However, whether MLL has a function at the centrosome is not clear. Here, we show that loss of the MLL/WDR5 complex affects microtubule nucleation and regrowth. MLL/WDR5 localize to the pericentriolar material and interact with centriolar satellite protein Cep72 and γ-tubulin ring complex proteins (γ-TuRCs). MLL/WDR5 promote the localization of γ-TuRCs and structural proteins like AKAP9 to the centrosome during interphase and mitosis, a phenotype also observed in cells derived from patients with WSS.

          "abstract": "Understanding the dynamic spatial and temporal release of neurotransmitters can help resolve long-standing questions related to chemical modulation of neurological circuits. Dopamine modulates function in a range of physiological processes and is key to transmission in addiction and neurological disorders. Studies at subcellular scales promise to help develop a broader understanding of dopamine release, diffusion, and receptor activation and how these processes lead to functional outcomes. Electrochemical measurements of dopamine release at individual cells have proven especially informative. We describe incorporation of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry for detection of dopamine release with subcellular spatial resolution and millisecond time resolution. The platform is benchmarked with standard redox probes and then applied to imaging stimulated release from subcellular locations of a coculture of dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes. Voltammetry reveals heterogeneity in release based on time, location, and neuron identity. We believe that this platform ultimately offers a window to understanding neurotransmission in pathophysiological models of disease where cell-cell communication is key.",

          "abstract": "Light is an important environmental factor for vision and for diverse physiological and psychological functions. Light can also modulate glucose metabolism. Here, we show that in mice, light is critical for glucose and lipid homeostasis by regulating the sympathetic nervous system, independent of circadian disruption. Light deprivation from birth elicits insulin hypersecretion, glucagon hyposecretion, lower gluconeogenesis, and reduced lipolysis by 6 to 8 weeks in male, but not female, mice. These metabolic defects are consistent with blunted sympathetic activity, and indeed, sympathetic responses to a cold stimulus are substantially attenuated in dark-reared mice. Further, long-term dark rearing leads to body weight gain, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Notably, metabolic dysfunction can be partially alleviated by 5 weeks exposure to a regular light-dark cycle. These studies provide insight into circadian-independent mechanisms by which light directly influences whole-body physiology and better understanding of metabolic disorders linked to aberrant environmental light conditions.",

          "abstract": "How information is integrated across different forms of learning is crucial to understanding higher cognitive functions. Animals form classic or operant associations between cues and their outcomes. It is believed that a prerequisite for operant conditioning is the formation of a classical association. Thus, both memories coexist and are additive. However, the two memories can result in opposing behavioral responses, which can be disadvantageous. We show that Drosophila classical and operant olfactory conditioning rely on distinct neuronal pathways leading to different behavioral responses. Plasticity in both pathways cannot be formed simultaneously. If plasticity occurs at both pathways, interference between them occurs and learning is disrupted. Activity of the navigation center is required to prevent plasticity in the classical pathway and enable it in the operant pathway. These findings fundamentally challenge hierarchical views of operant and classical learning and show that active processes prevent coexistence of the two memories.",

Compared to no vaccination, the model-estimated median percentage reductions in rotavirus ranged from 28 to 85% and 12 to 71% among children &lt;1 and &lt;5 years old, respectively.

Conducting organic polymers are a promising alternative because of their mechanical, chemical, and physical properties, which better match the ones of biological systems. They also can be synthesized in vivo to form bio-templated structures through biologically compatible manufacturing processes.

Ablation of Nr5a1 + cells leads to severe hypospadias and alters cell differentiation in the penis.

These spherical acoustic waves travel through tissue at 1.5 × 10 3 meters per second, much slower than x-rays, allowing ultrasound detectors to capture them and generate 3D images without mechanical scanning. We validate this theory by performing 3D numerical reconstructions of a human breast from a single x-ray projection and experimentally determining 3D structures of objects at different depths. Achieving resolutions of 0.4 millimeters in the XZ plane and 3.5 millimeters in the XY plane at a depth of 16 millimeters, XACT demonstrates the ability to produce 3D images from one x-ray projection, reducing radiation exposure and enabling gantry-free imaging.

During I/R, elevated mitochondrial Ca 2+ triggers mPTP opening, leading to necrotic cell death. Although nonessential regulators of this pore are characterized, the molecular identity of the pore-forming component remains elusive. Two of these genetically verified regulators are cyclophilin D (CypD) and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) family. We investigated the ANT/CypD relationship in mPTP dynamics and I/R injury. Despite lacking all ANT isoforms, Ca 2+ -dependent mPTP opening persisted in cardiac mitochondria but was desensitized. This desensitization conferred resistance to I/R injury in ANT-deficient mice. CypD is hypothesized to trigger mPTP opening through isomerization of ANTs at proline-62. To test this, we generated mice that expressed a P62A mutated version of ANT1. These mice showed similar mPTP dynamics and I/R sensitivity as the wild type, indicating that P62 is dispensable for CypD regulation. Together, these data indicate that the ANT family contributes to mPTP opening independently of CypD.",

In addition, a literature review complemented experimental results by summarizing physiological responses of marine animals to decreasing proton concentrations, or increased pH. The food web studied proved resistant, and zooplankton physiologically tolerant, to the OAE tested. We observed short-term effects of OAE on zooplankton reproduction and productivity, which were likely trophically mediated. Yet, these did not affect zooplankton populations or their nutritional value as food for fish.

Using a Drosophila tumor model originating from nonreproductive tissue, we show that female-biased tumor growth involves multifaceted communications among tumor cells, hemocytes, and neuroendocrine insulin-producing cells (IPCs). Notch-active tumor cells recruit hemocytes carrying the tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) homolog Eiger to the tumor microenvironment (TME), activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in tumor cells, instigating the sexually dimorphic up-regulation of cytokine Unpaired 2 (Upd2). Upd2, in turn, exerts a distal influence by modulating the release of a Drosophila insulin-like peptide (Dilp2) from IPCs. Dilp2 then activates the insulin signaling in the tumor, thereby fostering sexual-dimorphic tumor growth. Together, these findings reveal a relay mechanism involving the TME and systemic signals that collectively control the sexual dimorphism of tumor growth.",

However, no clear guidelines have been established to regulate their hybrid characteristics owing to limited understanding of their adsorption mechanism. This study investigates the effects of the particle size of a flexible-robust MOF on its adsorption and structural transition behaviors. The robust nature originates from the structural transition of a metastable guest-free structure, while its flexible nature arises from another guest-free structure. The type of guest-free structure is predominantly determined by the particle size; particles below the critical size are trapped in the metastable guest-free structure. Notably, the critical size varies with the type of guest molecule to be removed; consequently, the difference in critical size results in guest-memory characteristics, enabling guest-free structure switching. These results underscore the importance of controlling the particle size to fine-tune hybrid adsorption characteristics of flexible-robust MOFs.",

Here, we show that MRTX849, a covalent inhibitor targeting the KRAS-G12C mutation, leads to the reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in MRTX849-resistant NSCLC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. A genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter ABCC1 mediates MRTX849 resistance. Functional studies demonstrated that the transcription factor JUN drives ABCC1 expression, resulting in multidrug resistance. An unbiased drug screen identified the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib that potentiates MRTX849 efficacy by inhibiting SRC-dependent JUN activation, avoiding multidrug resistance and tumor suppression in vitro as well as in suitable preclinical mouse models and patient-derived organoids. SRC inhibitors (DGY-06-116, dasatinib, and bosutinib) also exhibit synergistic effects with MRTX849 in eliminating various tumor cell lines carrying KRAS-G12C mutations. Thus, SRC inhibitors amplify the therapeutic utility of G12Ci.",

Machine learning force field applications in computational chemistry, especially through deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD), offer a promising alternative that closely aligns with the accuracy of first-principles methods. Our research used DPMD to study how salts affect water by comparing its results with ab initio molecular dynamics, SPC/Fw, AMOEBA, and MB-Pol models. We studied water’s behavior in salt solutions by examining its spatiotemporally correlated movement. Our findings showed that each model’s accuracy in depicting water’s behavior in salt solutions is strongly connected to spatiotemporal correlation.

The resulting formula for calculating the absolute SRS signal is simple and differs from the commonly used relations by only one factor. We demonstrate the utility of this formula in a broad range of crucial applications of SRS microscopy, including stimulated Raman enhancement factor (&gt;10 8 times), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of typical imaging experiments, population saturation under high power excitation, and energy deposition during stimulated Raman photothermal microscopy. In particular, the theory predicts that SRS microscopy is almost always more sensitive than spontaneous Raman microscopy for chemical imaging.",

Here, we characterize the ssf gene cluster, which contributes to formaldehyde resistance, and use it to demonstrate how mobile element evolution shapes fungal adaptation. We found that ssf clusters have been acquired by various distantly related Starships , which each exhibit multiple instances of horizontal transfer across fungal species (at least nine events, including between different taxonomic orders). Many ssf clusters have subsequently integrated into their host’s genome, illustrating how Starships shape the evolutionary trajectory of fungal hosts beyond any single transfer.

In vitro drug selection experiments generated parasites with moderately reduced susceptibility to the inhibitors. Whole-genome sequencing of these parasites detected no mutations in PDEβ but rather mutations in downstream effectors: either the catalytic or regulatory subunits of cyclic adenosine monophosphate–dependent protein kinase (PKA) or in the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase that is required for PKA activation.

However, cancer-associated mutations promote misfolding and partially rigidify the p53 condensates with impaired DNA binding ability. Irrespective of wild-type and mutant forms, the partitioning of p53 into cytoplasm leads to the condensate formation, which subsequently undergoes rapid solidification. In vitro studies show that abundant nuclear components such as RNA and nonspecific DNA promote multicomponent phase separation of the p53 core domain and maintain their liquid-like property, whereas specific DNA promotes its dissolution into tetrameric functional p53.

Their large compositional space poses great design challenges for phase control and high strength-ductility synergy. The present research pioneers using integrated high-throughput machine learning with Monte Carlo simulations supplemented by ab initio calculations to effectively navigate phase selection and mechanical property predictions, developing single-phase ordered B2 aluminum-enriched RHEAs (Al-RHEAs) demonstrating high strength and ductility. These Al-RHEAs achieve remarkable mechanical properties, including compressive yield strengths up to 1.7 gigapascals, fracture strains exceeding 50%, and notable high-temperature strength retention. They also demonstrate a tensile yield strength of 1.0 gigapascals with a ductility of 9%, albeit with B2 ordering. Furthermore, we identify valence electron count domains for alloy ductility and brittleness with the explanation from density functional theory and provide crucial insights into elemental influence on atomic ordering and mechanical performance. The work sets forth a strategic blueprint for high-throughput alloy design and reveals fundamental principles governing the mechanical properties of advanced structural alloys.",

Halogenation with this [Fe]/H 2 O 2 oxidation protocol and halide (X − ) in the biological system is well established with the identification of heme-iron–dependent haloperoxidases. However, mimicking such halogenation process is rarely explored for practical use in organic synthesis. Here, we report the development of a nonheme iron catalyst that mimics the heme-iron–dependent haloperoxidases to catalyze the generation of HOBr from H 2 O 2 /Br − with high efficiency. We discovered that a tridentate terpyridine (TPY) ligand designed for Fenton chemistry was optimal for FeBr 3 to form a stable nonheme iron catalyst [Fe(TPY)Br 3 ], which catalyzed arene bromination, Hunsdiecker-type decarboxylative bromination, bromolactonization, and oxidation of sulfides and thiols. Mechanistic studies revealed that Fenton chemistry ([Fe]/H 2 O 2 ) might operate to generate hydroxyl radical (HO • ), which oxidize bromide ion [Br − ] into reactive HOBr. This nonheme iron catalyst represents a biomimetic model for heme-iron–dependent haloperoxidases with potential applications in organic synthesis, drug discovery, and biology.",

Here, we use a time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy called PIE-FCCS to resolve EGFR and EphA2 interactions in live cells. We tested the role of ligands and found that EGF, but not ephrin A1 (EA1), stimulated heteromultimerization between the receptors. To determine the effect of anionic lipids, we targeted phospholipase C (PLC) activity to alter the abundance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ). We found that higher PIP 2 levels increased homomultimerization of both EGFR and EphA2, as well as heteromultimerization. This study provides a direct characterization of EGFR and EphA2 interactions in live cells and shows that PIP 2 can have a substantial effect on the spatial organization of RTKs.",

Damaging mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, such as SMARCA4 (BRG1), are associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. We found that SMARCA4 loss in OC models resulted in increased cancer cell–intrinsic immunogenicity, characterized by up-regulation of long-terminal RNA repeats, increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes, and up-regulation of antigen presentation machinery. Notably, this response was dependent on STING, MAVS, and IRF3 signaling but was independent of the type I interferon receptor. Mouse ovarian and melanoma tumors with SMARCA4 loss demonstrated increased infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. These results were recapitulated in BRG1 inhibitor–treated SMARCA4- proficient tumor models, suggesting that modulation of chromatin remodeling through targeting SMARCA4 may serve as a strategy to overcome cancer immune evasion.",

The deformation field reconstructed from satellite data and field surveys reveals up to 4.4 meters of uplift and associated coastal advance along the entire northern coast of the peninsula, meter-scale systematic movement of the mountain slopes consistent with slip on flexural faults, and activation of secondary inland faults, suggesting synchronized ruptures.

When compared with second-order consumers, the Anzick-1 maternal diet is closest to that of scimitar cat, a mammoth specialist.

We compile original and existing genomic, isotopic, and osteological canid data from archaeological, paleontological, and modern sites. Results show that in contrast to canids recovered in non-anthropic contexts, canids recovered in association with human occupations are markedly diverse. They include multiple species and intraspecific lineages, morphological variation, and diets ranging from terrestrial to marine. This variation is expressed along both geographic and temporal gradients, starting in the terminal Pleistocene with canids showing high marine dietary estimates.

This problem is perhaps most pressing at the lowest fields (e.g., 80-MHz 1 H frequency), with rapidly increasing access to NMR through benchtop systems, but also sometimes for higher-field NMR systems from 300 MHz to 1.2 GHz. Hyperpolarization by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) can address this sensitivity limitation. However, dDNP implies massive and complex cryogenic and high-field instrumentation, which cannot be installed on the bench. We introduce here a compact helium-free 1-T tabletop polarizer as a simple and low-cost alternative. After freezing and polarizing the frozen analyte solutions at 77 K, we demonstrate 1 H signal enhancement factors of 100, with rapid 1-s buildup times. The high polarization is subsequently transferred by 1 H→ 13 C cross polarization (CP) to 13 C spins. Such a simple benchtop polarizer, in combination with hyperpolarizing solid matrices (HYPSOs), may open the way to replenishable hyperpolarization throughout multiple liquid-state NMR experiments.",

These materials enable dynamic bond reconfiguration, allowing reversible bond breaking and formation, similar to natural systems. Leveraging their discrete nature, these materials can adaptively reconfigure their shape and respond dynamically to varying conditions. Our investigations reveal that these granular metamaterials can substantially alter their mechanical properties, like compression, shearing, and bending, offering tunable mechanical characteristics across different states. Furthermore, they exhibit collective behaviors like directional movement, object capture, transportation, and gap crossing, showcasing their potential for reprogrammable functionalities.

Our pol-PD has a high detectivity, two orders of magnitude greater than that of commercial photodetectors, and exhibits high polarization sensitivity.

Here, we report leveraging spontaneous snapping stroke in the monostable flapping wing of a manta-like soft swimmer to address the challenge. The monostable wing is pneumatically actuated to instantaneously snap through to stroke down, and upon deflation, it will spontaneously stroke up by snapping back to its initial state, driven by elastic restoring force, without consuming additional energy.

          "abstract": "High-speed logic modulation of terahertz (THz) waves is crucial for future communications, yet a technology gap persists. Here, we report a dual gate–controlled two-dimensional electronic gas logic modulation metasurface that enables symmetric and asymmetric electron distribution states through independent control of the two electron transport channels. The transition between these two states leads to various response modes in the metasurface and notably increases the diversity of the spectrum transformation, resulting in a multivalued relationship in which each output corresponds to more than one input signal, thus establishing the logical modulation. Our results demonstrate the common logical functions of AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, NOR, and NAND at different frequencies with a modulation speed faster than 250 picoseconds. This work offers a unique avenue for the high-speed, free-space logical operation of THz waves and increases the security of secure communication.",

          "abstract": "The Great Barrier Reef is the largest reef system in the modern ocean. To date, the influence of temperature on the origin and long-term evolution of the Great Barrier Reef remains enigmatic. Here, we present a 900–thousand year TEX 86 H -derived temperature proxy record from Ocean Drilling Program Site 820 in the Coral Sea. It demonstrates that the onset of reef growth on the outer shelf was preceded by a rise in summer temperature from ~26° to ~28°C at around 700 thousand years ago (marine isotope stage 17). This approximately 2°C rise in summer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) likely resulted in higher carbonate production rates, which were crucial for the formation of the Great Barrier Reef. Subsequently, reconstructed SSTs remained sufficiently warm for the Great Barrier Reef to thrive and evolve continuously. The evolution of the Great Barrier Reef, therefore, appears to be closely linked to SSTs.",

          "abstract": "Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a key protein involved in lipoprotein metabolism, has diverse effects. There is an association between Angptl4 and diabetic kidney disease; however, this association has not been well investigated. We show that both podocyte- and tubule-specific ANGPTL4 are crucial fibrogenic molecules in diabetes. Diabetes accelerates the fibrogenic phenotype in control mice but not in ANGPTL4 mutant mice. The protective effect observed in ANGPTL4 mutant mice is correlated with a reduction in stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, lessened mitochondrial damage, and increased fatty acid oxidation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that podocyte- or tubule-secreted Angptl4 interacts with Integrin β1 and influences the association between dipeptidyl-4 with Integrin β1. We demonstrate the utility of a targeted pharmacologic therapy that specifically inhibits Angptl4 gene expression in the kidneys and protects diabetic kidneys from proteinuria and fibrosis. Together, these data demonstrate that podocyte- and tubule-derived Angptl4 is fibrogenic in diabetic kidneys.",

Conventional direct faradaic detection based on electron transfers at solid electrode/solution interfaces has been proven ineffective due to the electrochemically inactive nature of Cl − . Here, we present an approach involving molecularly tailored liquid/liquid interfacial ultramicro iontronics (L/L-UIs) supported at ultramicropipettes filled with organic gel containing lipophilic bis-thioureas ionophores, which represents the first application of amperometric methodology based on electrochemical facilitated ion transfers reactions at a soft L/L ultramicrointerface to achieve in vivo sensing of electrochemically inactive ions, and dynamically tracking cerebral Cl − in vivo. Furthermore, evidence of dynamic neuronal Cl − regulation via KCC2 modulated through GABA B receptors was provided, further substantiating GABA B receptor–mediated Cl − -related neuronal inhibition. The proposed L/L-UIs have notable potential for in situ tracking of other crucial electrochemically inactive ions or ionized biomolecules in vivo, thereby facilitating the study of brain diseases and the diagnosis and treatment of related disorders.",

          "abstract": "HER2 and α V β 6 integrin are independent predictors of breast cancer survival and metastasis. We identify an α V β 6 /HER2 cross-talk mechanism driving invasion, which is dysregulated in drug-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cells. Proteomic analyses reveal ligand-bound α V β 6 recruits HER2 and a trafficking subnetwork, comprising guanosine triphosphatases RAB5 and RAB7A and the Rab regulator guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor 2 (GDI2). The RAB5/RAB7A/GDI2 functional module mediates direct cross-talk between α V β 6 and HER2, affecting receptor trafficking and signaling. Acute exposure to trastuzumab increases recruitment of the subnetwork to α V β 6 , but trastuzumab resistance decouples GDI2 recruitment. GDI2, RAB5, and RAB7A cooperate to regulate migration and transforming growth factor–β activation to promote invasion. However, these mechanisms are dysregulated in trastuzumab-resistant cells. In patients, RAB5A , RAB7A , and GDI2 expression correlates with patient survival and α V β 6 expression predicts relapse following trastuzumab treatment. Thus, the RAB5/RAB7A/GDI2 subnetwork regulates α V β 6 -HER2 cross-talk to drive breast cancer invasion but is subverted in trastuzumab-resistant cells to drive α V β 6 -independent and HER2-independent tumor progression.",

          "abstract": "Modeling sea surface wind-waves is crucial for both scientific research and engineering applications. Nowadays, the most accurate wave models are based on numerical methods, which primarily concern the wave spectrum evolution by solving wave action balance partial differential equations. These methods are computationally expensive and limited by incomplete physical representations of wave spectral evolution. Here, we present a deep learning–based wave model trained using observation-merged wave hindcasts. Guided by the physics knowledge that waves are either generated by local current winds or by remote historical winds, this method can directly model significant wave height, bypassing the need for wave spectral information. This feature engineering effectively reduces the complexity of model inputs and outputs. The resulting artificial intelligence method can model 1 year of global significant wave heights at a 0.5° × 0.5° × 1-hour resolution within half an hour on a personal computer, achieving higher accuracy than state-of-the-art numerical wave models.",
