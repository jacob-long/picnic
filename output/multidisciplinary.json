          "abstract": "Immigrants to high-income countries often face considerable and persistent difficulties in the labour market1,2,3,4,5,6, whereas their native-born children typically experience economic progress6,7,8,9. However, little is known about the extent to which these immigrant–native earnings differences stem from unequal pay when doing the same work for the same employer versus labour market processes that sort immigrants into lower-paid jobs. Here, using data from nine European and North American countries, we show that the segregation of workers with immigrant backgrounds into lower-paying jobs accounts for about three-quarters of overall immigrant–native earnings differences. Although within-job pay inequality remains notable for immigrants in several countries, our results demonstrate that unequal access to higher-paying jobs is the primary driver of the immigrant–native pay gap across a range of institutionally and demographically diverse contexts. These findings highlight the importance of policies aimed at reducing between-job segregation, such as language training10,11,12,13, job training13,14,15, job search assistance programmes13,15, improving access to domestic education13,16,17, recognizing foreign qualifications18,19, and settlement programmes aimed at enhancing access to job-relevant information and networks13,20,21. Policies that target employer bias in hiring and promotion decisions are also likely to be effective, whereas measures aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work may have more limited scope for further progress in closing the immigrant–native pay gap22,23,24,25,26,27,28.",

          "abstract": "The Standard Model of particle physics—the theory of particles and interactions at the smallest scale—predicts that matter and antimatter interact differently due to violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). Charge conjugation transforms particles into their antimatter particles, whereas the parity transformation inverts spatial coordinates. This prediction applies to both mesons, which consist of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are composed of three quarks. However, despite having been discovered in various meson decays, CP violation has yet to be observed in baryons, the type of matter that makes up the observable Universe. Here we report a study of the decay of the beauty baryon $${\\varLambda }_{0}^{b}$$ Λ 0 b to the p K − π + π − final state, which proceeds through b → u or b → s quark-level transitions, and its CP-conjugated process, using data collected by the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment 1 at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The results reveal significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the $${\\varLambda }_{0}^{b}$$ Λ 0 b baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, providing, to our knowledge, the first observation of CP violation in baryon decays and demonstrating the different behaviours of baryons and antibaryons. In the Standard Model, CP violation arises from the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa mechanism 2 , and new forces or particles beyond the Standard Model could provide further contributions. This discovery opens a new path in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.",

          "abstract": "Non-antibiotic drugs can alter the composition of the gut microbiome 1 , but they have largely unknown implications for human health 2 . Here we examined how non-antibiotics affect the ability of gut commensals to resist colonization by enteropathogens 3 . We also developed an in vitro assay to assess enteropathogen growth in drug-perturbed microbial communities. Pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria were more resistant to non-antibiotics than commensals and their post-treatment expansion was potentiated. For 28% of the 53 drugs tested, the growth of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. ( S . Tm) in synthetic and human stool-derived communities was increased, and similar effects were observed for other enteropathogens. Non-antibiotics promoted pathogen proliferation by inhibiting the growth of commensals, altering microbial interactions and enhancing the ability of S . Tm to exploit metabolic niches. Drugs that promoted pathogen expansion in vitro increased the intestinal S . Tm load in mice. For the antihistamine terfenadine, drug-induced disruption of colonization resistance accelerated disease onset and increased inflammation caused by S . Tm.

          "abstract": "Climate change has significantly increased adverse effects on human health, and economic growth1–3. However, few studies have differentiated the impacts of extreme temperatures at the city level, and analysed the future implications for human health under various climate change scenarios.4–6 Here, data on historical relationship among six kinds of climate-sensitive diseases (CSD) hospitalizations and temperatures across 301 cities (over 90% of all cities) and more than 7,000 hospitals in China are leveraged, and a nonlinear distributed lag model is used. This study projects hospitalization risks associated with extreme temperatures through to the year 2100 and develops the Hospitalization Burden Economic Index to assess the burden under three carbon emission scenarios in cities. Five dimensions including spatial distribution, disease categories, population age groups, future time horizons, and carbon emission development pathways have been evaluated. Historical data specifically indicate more temperature-related risks among the CSDs in northwestern and southwestern China. Notably, gestation-related disease risk is associated with increased vulnerability to extreme heat in specific regions. The projections reveal that, under current thermal conditions with no adaptations, the excess hospitalizations from extreme heat will reach 5.1 million people by 2100 under the high emission scenario.These findings highlight the need for targeted climate change mitigation strategies to reduce uneven climate-related hospitalization risks and economic burdens while accounting for differences in city geography, extreme temperatures, population groups and carbon emission development pathways.",

          "abstract": "In microbial communities, viruses compete for host cells and have evolved diverse mechanisms to inhibit competitors. One strategy is superinfection exclusion, whereby an established viral infection prevents a secondary infection of the same cell1. This phenomenon has been shown to have an important role in the spread of eukaryotic viruses. Here we determine that superinfection exclusion proteins in bacterial viruses (bacteriophages, hereafter phages) perform a similar role, promoting viral spread through the bacterial community. We characterize a phage protein that alters the dynamics of a common phage receptor, the type IV pilus. This protein, known as Zip, does not abrogate pilus activity, but fine-tunes it, providing a strong phage defence without a fitness cost. Notably, Zip also prevents internalization and destruction of newly released phage progeny, a phenomenon that we call the anti-Kronos effect after the Greek god who consumed his offspring. Zip activity promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, thereby enhancing viral spread. We further demonstrate that the anti-Kronos effect is conserved across diverse prophage-encoded superinfection exclusion systems. Our results identify the mechanistic basis of a superinfection exclusion system that safeguards phage progeny and provide insights into the conservation of viral defence mechanisms among bacterial and eukaryotic systems.",

Here we examine the impact of WGD on somatic evolution and immune evasion at single-cell resolution in patient tumours. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we analysed 70 high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples from 41 patients (30,260 tumour genomes) and observed near-ubiquitous evidence that WGD is an ongoing mutational process. WGD was associated with increased cell–cell diversity and higher rates of chromosomal missegregation and consequent micronucleation. We developed a mutation-based WGD timing method called doubleTime to delineate specific modes by which WGD can drive tumour evolution, including early fixation followed by considerable diversification, multiple parallel WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy-number diversity, and evolutionarily late WGD in small clones and individual cells. Furthermore, using matched single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signalling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability, but this is restricted to predominantly diploid tumours (WGD-low). By contrast, predominantly WGD tumours (WGD-high), despite increased missegregation, exhibited cell-cycle dysregulation, STING1 repression, and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an ongoing mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.",

These networks sustain out-of-equilibrium regimes in which chemical energy is continually converted into controlled mechanical work and motion 1–3 . Out-of-equilibrium reaction networks have also enabled the design and successful development of artificial autonomously operating molecular machines 4,5 , in which networks comprising pairs of formally—but non-microscopically—reverse reaction pathways drive controlled motion at the molecular level. In biological systems, the concurrent operation of several reaction pathways is enabled by the chemoselectivity of enzymes and their cofactors, and nature’s dissipative reaction networks involve several classes of reactions. By contrast, the reactivity that has been harnessed to develop chemical reaction networks in pursuit of artificial molecular machines is limited to a single reaction type. Only a small number of synthetic systems exhibit chemically fuelled continuous controlled molecular-level motion 6–8 and all exploit the same class of acylation–hydrolysis reaction. Here we show that a redox reaction network, comprising concurrent oxidation and reduction pathways, can drive chemically fuelled continuous autonomous unidirectional motion about a C–C bond in a structurally simple synthetic molecular motor based on an achiral biphenyl. The combined use of an oxidant and reductant as fuels and the directionality of the motor are both enabled by exploiting the enantioselectivity and functional separation of reactivity inherent to enzyme catalysis.",

Processes that permit rapid and reversible transformations between these morphologies, however, have been difficult to realize because physical properties required for rapid shape change (for example, low interfacial tension or viscosity) provide pathways for relaxation that result in short-lived states. Fully reversible formation of long-lived microdomain states would expand the palette of properties that can be accessed dynamically using biphasic liquids (for example, tunable optical metamaterials). Here we report the discovery of shape-shifting and bistable microdomains of a biphasic liquid system consisting of an isotropic oil and a liquid crystalline oil. The isotropic oil forms stable wetting films (‘original’ shape) between solid surfaces and an overlying liquid crystal phase, and, when exposed to a transient (<1 s) a.c. electric field at low frequency (10 Hz), transforms into long-lived (>24 h) spherical domains (‘temporary’ shape) stabilized by topological defects in the liquid crystal1,4,5. Subsequent application of an a.c. electric field of high frequency (1 kHz) triggers solitons to form in the liquid crystal6,7,8, creating kinetic pathways that lead to remarkably rapid (<3 s) coalescence of the dispersed spherical domains and recovery of the original shape (wetting film)1,8,9. We show rapid and reversible switching between distinct optical states of the biphasic system, with each state persisting without continuous application of the field, thus providing a combination of optical properties long sought in thin liquid films10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17.

With growing recognition of electrochemistry as a powerful tool to improve the scope and sustainability of organic synthesis1, increasing efforts have been directed towards developing asymmetric electrocatalytic reactions to access challenging chiral molecules2,3,4. However, many useful electrochemical reactions rely on direct electrolysis without a catalyst, making them inherently difficult to render enantioselective. Supporting electrolytes are integral to electrochemical systems and, in addition to ensuring sufficient solution conductivity, they can influence the rate and selectivity of electrochemical transformations5. Chiral supporting electrolytes can mediate asymmetric reactions via direct electrolysis, but their use in organic electrosynthesis remains largely unexplored6,7. Here we describe the use of substoichiometric chiral phosphate salts as supporting electrolytes to facilitate the oxidation of racemic trivalent phosphines to afford enantioenriched phosphine oxides. Our approach relies on a dynamic-kinetic-resolution strategy that exploits the rapid pyramidal inversion of an anodically generated phosphoniumyl radical cation8, while a high concentration of chiral phosphate at the electrode–electrolyte interface9,10 enhances enantioselective control during rate-limiting nucleophilic addition. Our results highlight the promise of chiral supporting electrolytes for promoting radical-ion-mediated asymmetric transformations.",

However, current methods are constrained by the rapid evolution of plant pathogens and often lack broad-spectrum and durable protection. Here we report an innovative strategy to engineer broad-spectrum, durable and complete disease resistance in plants through expression of a chimeric protein containing a flexible polypeptide coupled with a single or dual conserved pathogen-originated protease cleavage site fused in frame to the N terminus of an autoactive nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat immune receptor (NLR) containing a coiled-coil or RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8-like coiled-coil domain. Following invasion, pathogen-originated specific proteases cleave the inactive chimeric protein to form free autoactive NLR, triggering broad-spectrum plant disease resistance. We demonstrate that a single engineered NLR can confer broad-spectrum and complete resistance against multiple potyviruses. Given that many pathogenic organisms across kingdoms encode proteases, this strategy has the potential to be exploited to control viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes and pests in plants.",

Here we report that transcripts upregulated after sleep deprivation, in sleep-control neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body 1,2 (dFBNs) but not ubiquitously in the brain, encode almost exclusively proteins with roles in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. These gene expression changes are accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation, enhanced mitophagy and an increase in the number of contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, creating conduits 3,4 for the replenishment of peroxidized lipids 5 . The morphological changes are reversible after recovery sleep and blunted by the installation of an electron overflow 6,7 in the respiratory chain. Inducing or preventing mitochondrial fission or fusion 8–13 in dFBNs alters sleep and the electrical properties of sleep-control cells in opposite directions: hyperfused mitochondria increase, whereas fragmented mitochondria decrease, neuronal excitability and sleep. ATP concentrations in dFBNs rise after enforced waking because of diminished ATP consumption during the arousal-mediated inhibition of these neurons 14 , which augments their mitochondrial electron leak 7 . Consistent with this view, uncoupling electron flux from ATP synthesis 15 relieves the pressure to sleep, while exacerbating mismatches between electron supply and ATP demand (by powering ATP synthesis with a light-driven proton pump 16 ) precipitates sleep. Sleep, like ageing 17,18 , may be an inescapable consequence of aerobic metabolism.",

SXRS has been long predicted as a means to launch and probe valence-electron wavepackets and as a building block for nonlinear X-ray spectroscopies5,6. However, experimental observations of SXRS to date4,7,8 have not provided spectroscopic information, and theoretical modelling has largely implemented hard-to-realize phase-coherent attosecond pulses. Here we demonstrate SXRS with spectroscopic precision, that is, detection of valence-excited states in neon with a near Fourier-limited joint energy–time resolution of 0.1 eV–40 fs. We used a new covariance analysis between statistically spiky broadband incident X-ray and scattered X-ray Raman pulses. Using 18,000 single shots, we beat not only the incident (about 8 eV) bandwidth but also the approximately 0.2 eV instrumental energy resolution, thus creating super-resolution conditions, in analogy to super-resolved fluorescence microscopy9. Our experimental results, supported by ab initio propagation simulations, reveal the competition between lasing in the ion and stimulated Raman scattering in the neutral. We demonstrate enhanced signal collection efficiency and a broad excitation window, surpassing spontaneous Raman efficiencies by orders of magnitude.

However, individuals at risk for early vascular disease often remain unidentified2. Recent research has identified new molecules in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis3, highlighting the need for alternative disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve early diagnosis and therapy efficacy. Here, we observed that imidazole propionate (ImP), produced by microorganisms, is associated with the extent of atherosclerosis in mice and in two independent human cohorts. Furthermore, ImP administration to atherosclerosis-prone mice fed with chow diet was sufficient to induce atherosclerosis without altering the lipid profile, and was linked to activation of both systemic and local innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. Specifically, we found that ImP caused atherosclerosis through the imidazoline-1 receptor (I1R, also known as nischarin) in myeloid cells. Blocking this ImP–I1R axis inhibited the development of atherosclerosis induced by ImP or high-cholesterol diet in mice. Identification of the strong association of ImP with active atherosclerosis and the contribution of the ImP–I1R axis to disease progression opens new avenues for improving the early diagnosis and personalized therapy of atherosclerosis.",

However, these phenomena have been restricted to hyperbolic crystals, whose optical responses are confined to fixed spectral regions and lack tunability, thereby limiting their broader applicability4,5. Here we demonstrate the emergence of hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in a non-hyperbolic yttrium vanadate (YVO4) crystal. Using real-space nanoimaging combined with theoretical analyses, we visualize hyperbolic wavefronts of surface phonon polaritons on YVO4 crystal surfaces within its non-hyperbolic frequency range, where the permittivity tensor components of the material have the same negative sign. Furthermore, by varying the temperature from room temperature to cryogenic levels, we realize in situ manipulation of polariton dispersions, enabling a topological transition from hyperbolic to canalization and eventually to the elliptic regime. This temperature-controlled dispersion engineering not only provides precise control over polariton topology but also modulates their wavelength and group velocity, showing remarkable sensitivity alongside low-loss, long-range propagation. These findings extend the realm of hyperbolic nano-optics by removing the reliance on hyperbolic crystals, unlocking opportunities for applications in negative refraction6,7,8,9,10, superlensing11,12, polaritonic chemistry13, integrated photonics14,15,16 and beyond.",

Approaching such high energy density, electrolytes capable of stabilizing both anode and cathode interphases are of importance to secure safe and long-term cycling3,4. Although anion-derived inorganic interphases have shown remarkable success at the Li side5,6,7, developing intrinsic strategies to concurrently protect both electrodes remains a key challenge. Here we report a micro-emulsion strategy for electrolyte design that bypasses the Li+ solvation regulation and produces fluoride-rich interphases for both electrodes. Specifically, liquid–liquid interfacial tension between the micelles and carbonate solvents, rather than the electric field, propels the motion of fluorinated droplets towards the anode and the cathode. In this way, the interphase construction of both electrodes can be enhanced and decoupled from the solvation structure strategy. Through use of the micro-emulsion electrolyte, two pouch full cells with energy densities of 531 Wh kg−1 and 547 Wh kg−1 retain 81% and 79% of their capacity after 189 and 155 cycles, respectively. The introduction of liquid–liquid interfacial tension provides a perspective for interphase regulation and electrolyte design, and paves the way for the development of high-voltage Li-metal batteries.",

          "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the largest natural source of new nitrogen (N) that supports terrestrial productivity1,2, yet estimates of global terrestrial BNF remain highly uncertain3,4. Here we show that this uncertainty is partly because of sampling bias, as field BNF measurements in natural terrestrial ecosystems occur where N fixers are 17 times more prevalent than their mean abundances worldwide. To correct this bias, we develop new estimates of global terrestrial BNF by upscaling field BNF measurements using spatially explicit abundances of all major biogeochemical N-fixing niches. We find that natural biomes sustain lower BNF, 65 (52–77) Tg N yr−1, than previous empirical bottom-up estimates3,4, with most BNF occurring in tropical forests and drylands. We also find high agricultural BNF in croplands and cultivated pastures, 56 (54–58) Tg N yr−1. Agricultural BNF has increased terrestrial BNF by 64% and total terrestrial N inputs from all sources by 60% over pre-industrial levels. Our results indicate that BNF may impose stronger constraints on the carbon sink in natural terrestrial biomes and represent a larger source of agricultural N than is generally considered in analyses of the global N cycle5,6, with implications for proposed safe operating limits for N use7,8.",

          "abstract": "A pervasive dilemma in brain-wide association studies 1 (BWAS) is whether to prioritize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan time or sample size. We derive a theoretical model showing that individual-level phenotypic prediction accuracy increases with sample size and total scan duration (sample size × scan time per participant). The model explains empirical prediction accuracies well across 76 phenotypes from nine resting-fMRI and task-fMRI datasets ( R 2 = 0.89), spanning diverse scanners, acquisitions, racial groups, disorders and ages. For scans of ≤20 min, accuracy increases linearly with the logarithm of the total scan duration, suggesting that sample size and scan time are initially interchangeable. However, sample size is ultimately more important. Nevertheless, when accounting for the overhead costs of each participant (such as recruitment), longer scans can be substantially cheaper than larger sample size for improving prediction performance. To achieve high prediction performance, 10 min scans are cost inefficient. In most scenarios, the optimal scan time is at least 20 min. On average, 30 min scans are the most cost-effective, yielding 22% savings over 10 min scans. Overshooting the optimal scan time is cheaper than undershooting it, so we recommend a scan time of at least 30 min. Compared with resting-state whole-brain BWAS, the most cost-effective scan time is shorter for task-fMRI and longer for subcortical-to-whole-brain BWAS. In contrast to standard power calculations, our results suggest that jointly optimizing sample size and scan time can boost prediction accuracy while cutting costs.

Understanding how soil metabolic activity responds to climate-driven environmental perturbations is a key challenge 2,3 .

Here we address this complexity by combining dynamic measurements of respiratory nitrate metabolism 7 with modelling to reveal functional regimes that define soil responses to environmental change. Measurements across more than 1,500 soil microcosms subjected to pH perturbations 8,9 reveal regimes in which distinct mechanisms govern metabolite dynamics. A minimal model with two parameters, biomass activity and growth-limiting nutrient availability, predicts nitrate utilization dynamics across soils and pH perturbations. Parameter shifts under perturbation reveal three functional regimes, each linked to distinct mechanisms: (1) an acidic regime marked by cell death and suppressed metabolism; (2) a nutrient-limited regime in which dominant taxa exploit matrix-released nutrients; and (3) a resurgent growth regime driven by exponential growth of rare taxa in nutrient-rich conditions. We validated these model-derived mechanisms with nutrient measurements, amendment experiments, sequencing and isolate studies. Additional experiments and meta-analyses suggest that functional regimes are widespread in pH-perturbed soils.",

The differentiation of avian sex chromosomes from ancestral autosomes entails the loss of most genes from the W chromosome during evolution1,2. However, the extent to which mechanisms evolved that counterbalance this substantial reduction in female gene dosage remains unclear. Here we report functional in vivo and evolutionary analyses of a Z-linked microRNA (miR-2954) with strong male-biased expression, previously proposed to mediate avian sex chromosome dosage compensation3. We knocked out miR-2954 in chicken, which resulted in early embryonic lethality in homozygous knockout males, probably driven by specific upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked target genes. Evolutionary gene expression analyses further revealed that these dosage-sensitive target genes underwent both transcriptional and translational upregulation on the single Z in female birds. Altogether, this work unveils a scenario in which evolutionary pressures following W gene loss drove transcriptional and translational upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes in females but also their transcriptional upregulation in males. The resulting excess of transcripts in males, resulting from the combined activity of two upregulated dosage-sensitive Z gene copies, was in turn offset by the emergence of a highly targeted miR-2954-mediated transcript degradation mechanism during avian evolution. This study uncovered a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation system in birds, in which a microRNA has become essential for male survival.",

Here we present a hybrid copper–iodide that shows near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (99.6%) with an emission wavelength of 449 nm and colour coordinates (0.147, 0.087), alongside its emission mechanism and charge transport characteristics. We use the thin film of this hybrid as the sole active emissive layer to fabricate deep-blue light-emitting diodes and subsequently enhance the device performance through a dual interfacial hydrogen-bond passivation strategy. This synergetic surface modification approach, integrating a hydrogen-bond-acceptor self-assembled monolayer with an ultrathin polymethyl methacrylate capping layer, effectively passivates both heterojunctions of the copper–iodide hybrid emissive layer and optimizes charge injections. We achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.57%, a maximum luminance of 3,970.30 cd m−2 with colour coordinates (0.147, 0.091) and an excellent operational stability (half-lifetime) of 204 hours under ambient conditions.

Much of what is known about ichthyosaur soft tissues derives from specimens with body outlines 4–6 . However, despite offering insights into aspects of biology that are otherwise difficult to envisage from skeletal evidence alone (such as the presence of a crescentic fluke), information on their soft parts has hitherto been limited to a taxonomically narrow sample of small- to dolphin-sized animals 2,4–6 . Here we report the discovery of a metre-long front flipper of the large-bodied Jurassic ichthyosaur Temnodontosaurus , including unique details of its soft-tissue anatomy. In addition to revealing a wing-like planform, the fossil preserves a serrated trailing edge that is reinforced by novel cartilaginous integumental elements, herein denominated chondroderms. We also document chordwise-parallel skin ornamentations and a protracted fleshy distal tip that presumably acted like a flexible winglet in life. By integrating morphological and numerical data, we show that the observed features probably provided hydroacoustic benefits, and conclude that the visually guided 7,8 Temnodontosaurus relied on stealth while hunting in dim-lit pelagic environments. This unexpected combination of control surface modifications represents a previously unrecognized mode of concealment, and underscores the importance of soft-tissue fossils when inferring aspects of palaeoethology and predator–prey palaeoecology.",

Here we report, however, that neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis.

The presence of these ‘vascular-restricted’ neutrophils correlated with the appearance of a ‘pleomorphic’ necrotic architecture in mice. In tumours with pleomorphic necrosis, we found intravascular aggregates of neutrophils and NETs that caused occlusion of the tumour vasculature, driving hypoxia and necrosis of downstream vascular beds. Furthermore, we found that cancer cells adjacent to these necrotic regions (that is, in ‘perinecrotic’ areas) underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, explaining the paradoxical metastasis-enhancing effect of tumour necrosis. Blocking NET formation genetically or pharmacologically reduced the extent of tumour necrosis and lung metastasis. Thus, by showing that NETs drive vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis, we demonstrate that tumour necrosis is not necessarily a passive byproduct of tumour growth and that it can be blocked to reduce metastatic spread.",

          "abstract": "The United States has for decades been a great benefactor of global science. Last year, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded hundreds of grants to researchers outside the country. In 2022–23, the country supplied about 42% of the overall donor-government assistance for global health and about 16% of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) funding. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it bankrolled a fair share of the global public vaccine effort.\n\nAs the current US administration seeks drastic cuts to research funding at home and abroad, the dangers of depending so much on one nation are becoming clear. My own projects are among those at risk.\n\nI am based in Lisbon, where, since 2020, I have been working on preclinical and clinical studies of several cancer therapies in collaboration with US and UK pharmaceutical companies and investigators. Now that our US partners (which were bringing the greatest share) are struggling to secure funds, all these projects are under threat.\n\nA fresh approach is needed to prevent further shocks — changes in governance, wars, natural disasters — from undermining essential global research and education.\n\nTurmoil at US science academy as Trump cuts force layoffs\n\nFor starters, more countries must provide more of the funding. Wealthier nations should increase their share of contributions to WHO initiatives, the success of which they stand to benefit from, such as those on pandemic preparedness. Programmes such as Horizon Europe should allocate resources to multilateral initiatives. Its ‘Cancer Mission’, which involves collaboration with Canada, is an encouraging example. By enabling various research projects on cancer, the programme aims to improve the lives of more than 3 million people by 2030. Future initiatives should include a greater diversity of stakeholders.\n\nLower-income nations, such as Nigeria and South Africa, could be persuaded to contribute more to initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, if they were given influence over how the money is spent. (In October 2024, the United States provided about 36% of the pledges and roughly 33% of the funds allocated to the Global Fund.) In fact, a permanent global research-funding initiative could provide emergency short-term funds to keep collaborations that are disrupted by geopolitical events running.\n\nIn general, those providing the most funds have the greatest influence on priorities and agendas. Decision-making and management that shapes research must instead also be shared more equitably between nations, and research should be evaluated in ways that are not so dependent on one nation.\n\nThe Global Research Council already coordinates transnational funding and policy among dozens of national science-funding agencies, although, as a voluntary organization, it cannot impose standards. Lessons can also be learnt from the European Research Council’s (ERC’s) multilingual grant-review panels, piloted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, reviewers from multiple countries can join meetings remotely. And there is collaboration between a decentralized ethics committee and the ethics committees of individual countries, ensuring that appraisals align with national laws and regulations.\n\nAll this must be underpinned by more-resilient shared databases and research-management platforms.",

          "title": "Smart brain-zapping implants could revolutionize Parkinson’s treatment",
          "authors": "Sally Adee",
          "abstract": "Keith Krehbiel lived with Parkinson’s disease for nearly 25 years before agreeing to try a brain implant that might alleviate his symptoms. He had long been reluctant to submit to the surgery. “It was a big move,” he says. But by 2020, his symptoms had become so severe that he grudgingly agreed to go ahead.\n\nDeep-brain stimulation involves inserting thin wires through two small holes in the skull into a region of the brain associated with movement. The hope is that by delivering electrical pulses to the region, the implant can normalize aberrant brain activity and reduce symptoms. Since the devices were first approved almost three decades ago, some 200,000 people have had them fitted to help calm the tremors and rigidity caused by Parkinson’s disease. But about 40,000 of those who received devices made after 2020 got them with a special feature that has largely not yet been turned on. The devices can read brain waves and then adapt and tailor the rhythm of their output, in much the same way as a pacemaker monitors and corrects the heart’s electrical rhythms, says Helen Bronte-Stewart, a neurologist at Stanford University in California.\n\nBronte-Stewart received approval to start a clinical trial of this new technology, known as adaptive deep-brain stimulation (aDBS), the same week that Krehbiel was preparing for surgery. He recalls the phone call in which she asked him if he wanted to be her first participant: “I said, ‘Boy, do I!’”\n\nBrain drugs can now cross the once impenetrable blood–brain barrier\n\nFive years on, the results of this 68-person trial, called ADAPT-PD, are under review for publication. Although the exact details are still under wraps, they were convincing enough to earn approval for the technology earlier this year from both US and European regulators.\n\nThe results of this study could be a boon for the estimated one million people in the United States and 1.2 million people in Europe who now live with Parkinson’s disease — and for Medtronic, the health-care technology company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that manufactures the implants. The seeming success also clears a path for other companies around the world that are racing for approval on advanced devices, says Martijn Beudel, a neurologist at Amsterdam University Medical Center who worked on the trial.\n\nThe approaching wave of therapies promises to level up DBS for Parkinson’s and other motor conditions. The technology might even help to treat neurological disorders such as Tourette’s syndrome and psychiatric conditions, including obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. Several clinicians suggest that the new technology could have even more profound health implications — that is, if funding for US brain-implant research isn’t cut.\n\nDeep trade-offs\n\nSince DBS was first approved in Europe and the United States in the late-1990s, the vast majority of devices have been given to people with Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s is a progressive disorder, typified by the death of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is key to controlling movements.\n\nExisting drugs that aim to increase dopamine levels can only manage the symptoms. They can’t match the constant dopamine production of a healthy brain. “No matter how clever we are with it, we have never been able to exactly mimic the way the brain supplies it,” says Bronte-Stewart. This means that symptoms vary throughout the day — from the unwanted involuntary movements induced by the morning flood of dopamine-mimicking drugs to increased rigidity later in the day as the drugs wear off. The medication also comes with other side effects that vary from person to person. For Krehbiel, it was nausea so severe he had to lie down multiple times a day.\n\nWhen these become overwhelming, a neurologist might recommend DBS. Implants typically dispense pulses of electrical energy deep into the brain 24 hours a day to regulate aberrant brain signals associated with uncontrollable body movements. Before this year, this always-on approach was the only commercially available form of the therapy.\n\nDeep-brain stimulation has often been considered a treatment of last resort for people with Parkinson’s disease.Credit: Zephyr/Science Photo Library\n\nBut continuous DBS can sometimes amplify the drugs’ effects — or generate new symptoms. Some of these are harmless: one man with OCD developed a passion for the music of Johnny Cash when his stimulator was turned on, but was uninterested in the artist when it was off1. Other symptoms are cause for more concern, including sudden-onset gambling disorders and other temporary changes in impulse control. More frequently, the addition of stimulation can induce speech impairments, such as slurring, raise the risk of falling and cause some involuntary movements.\n\nA clinician can try to balance the system by adjusting the intensity of stimulation, but there are limits to how precisely it can be calibrated.\n\nKrehbiel was aware of these shortcomings, and it contributed to his sense that DBS was a treatment of last resort. In the late 2010s, his neurologist hinted that big improvements were on the way. “So I thought, wait for the new technology.”\n\nCatching waves\n\nBrain-wave activity is different in people with and without Parkinson’s disease. In people with Parkinson’s, there are noticeable differences at one range of frequencies, known as β-oscillations (between about 13 and 30 hertz), in a region deep in the brain called the basal ganglia. This region processes sensorimotor, cognitive and mood information.\n\n‘Big leap’ for Parkinson’s treatment: symptoms improve in stem-cells trials\n\nβ-oscillations have become an important marker of motor state. In the early 2000s, researchers at University College London found increasing evidence that people with Parkinson’s have intense bursts of activity in this range2. When drug treatments are working, these bursts are less exaggerated. The same is true for DBS3. The more that stimulation normalizes β-oscillations, the better the relief of some symptoms, says Bronte-Stewart.\n\nAberrant oscillations were dubbed oscillopathies, and in the 2000s, Medtronic started focusing on developing a device that could both read and correct these rhythms, says Tim Denison, a biomedical engineer at the University of Oxford, UK, who was working at the company at the time. “Just like you can build a radio to tune in to an audio channel, can we build a circuit that will tune in to these oscillopathies and help to guide how to adjust the stimulator?” he asks.\n\nBy 2006, Denison and his colleagues had built a ‘brain radio’, a sensing chip that could tune in to the different frequency bands in which the electrode sits. The next challenge was finding out how changes in particular bands correspond to specific movement problems. That was “a huge part of the first eight to ten years of the research with the investigational hardware”, says Bronte-Stewart. She and other researchers, including Philip Starr at the University of California, San Francisco, used a succession of new prototype devices to map these oscillopathies and adjust to them.\n\nFor example, when β-oscillation intensity begins to dip after a dose of medication, aDBS automatically reduces stimulation, keeping β-power in a healthy range. As the medication wears off, it does the opposite (see ‘Fine-tuned stimulation’). In 2019, Bronte-Stewart developed one of the algorithms that would underpin aDBS. When she tested it on 13 people with Parkinson’s, it improved the halting movements, called bradykinesia, that are associated with the disease4. It also helped to reduce the inability to take steps, known as freezing of gait, in a study last year5. In a separate study, Starr found that aDBS shortened the duration of volunteers’ most bothersome motor disturbances, but without aggravating side effects6.\n\nSource: G. Tinkhause et al. Brain 140, 1053–1067 (2017).\n\nOther studies have suggested that aDBS reduces speech problems, such as slurring, that were another possible side effect of continuous DBS7,8. “It only suppressed the pathological brain activity,” without suppressing normal speech, says Beudel.\n\nSince 2013, small trials such as these have demonstrated these effects in around 400 people, estimates Robert Raike, the director of neuromodulation research and technology at Medtronic. What was missing was a way to validate these findings in real-world settings: in people’s homes and workplaces over a long period of time. Researchers needed a big trial.\n\nA personalized device\n\nAny Medtronic DBS implant manufactured after 2020 has the ability to be switched into adaptive stimulation mode. If people were enrolled in a clinical trial after 2020, their implant’s experimental capabilities could be activated by a firmware update, “a software unlock, like your iPhone”, says Raike. This approach opened up a large pool of possible trial participants. And the capability could be turned back off at the end of the trial.\n\nAfter two months with continuous DBS, Bronte-Stewart unlocked Krehbiel’s device. It continued to keep his tremor at bay. He needed fewer drugs.\n\nOther trial volunteers have reported similar improvements, along with a reduction of symptoms associated with continuous stimulation. Although she is not permitted to discuss the results, which are still pending publication, Bronte-Stewart points to data presented at a 2024 conference9. Of 45 volunteers in the trial who were given the choice to revert to the continuous DBS or to retain the new adaptive functionality for a further long-term follow-up, 44 chose to stay on aDBS, Krehbiel among them. “I would not have considered for more than 30 seconds reverting back,” he says. “I was feeling good and didn’t much care why.”\n\nBeudel saw a broadly similar trend among his participants. “It’s no secret that the results were positive,” he says. “We now see patients from all over the country coming to our centre saying that they want the aDBS.”\n\nBrain stimulation at home helps to treat depression\n\nSince the new system was approved earlier this year, the upgrade has been available to anyone with one of the post-2020 devices. Beyond straightforward symptom relief, these users might see beneficial effects that go beyond controlling motor symptoms.\n\nFor example, Parkinson’s disease notoriously interferes with sleep, and as the medicine wears off at night, problems emerge that range from insomnia to hallucinations. Sleep deprivation, in turn, worsens the symptoms. “It is a vicious circle,” says Beudel.\n\nAdaptive DBS could reduce sleep disturbances by automatically adjusting to the sleep-induced changes in β-oscillations.\n\nAnd better sleep might, in turn, protect the brain. If it does, says Denison, aDBS could shed light on the tantalizing but controversial hypothesis that DBS protects the brain when implanted earlier in Parkinson’s disease progression.",

          "abstract": "NASA headquarters in Washington DC. Agency staff from around the United States have signed their names to the Voyager Declaration, opposing cuts by the administration of US President Donald Trump.Credit: Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nMore than 280 NASA employees past and present, including at least 4 astronauts, have signed a declaration of opposition to the many drastic changes that the administration of US President Donald Trump is working to enact. The declaration also urges the acting head of NASA not to make the unprecedented budget cuts Trump has proposed.\n\n“The last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA’s workforce,” reads the employees’ letter to interim administrator Sean Duffy. It argues that Trump’s changes threaten human safety, scientific progress and global leadership at NASA.\n\nFive key climate and space projects on Trump’s chopping block\n\nThe Voyager Declaration joins similar protest documents by employees at other US federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The appeals stem from Trump’s sweeping campaign to overhaul the federal government, which has led to mass firings of workers and the proposal of steep cuts to agency budgets.\n\nThe declaration is “about getting our dissent out to the public and saying, hey — this is what’s happening at NASA, and this is not OK”, says Ella Kaplan, who has signed the document. Kaplan works on a contract basis as a website administrator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was speaking on her own behalf and not that of her employer or of NASA.\n\nKaplan says she does not expect Duffy to read the document or to care much about it if he does. When Duffy ran for a seat in the US Congress more than a decade ago, he released a campaign advertisement that featured him wearing lumberjack clothing and saying he would bring his axe to “topple the big spending in Washington”.\n\nThe agency is not interested in sustaining “lower-priority missions”, said NASA spokeswoman Bethany Stevens. “We must revisit what’s working and what’s not so that we can inspire the American people again and win the space race.”\n\nStaff exodus\n\nThe Voyager Declaration, named after the twin NASA spacecraft that are exploring interstellar space, protests against staffing cuts at the agency and Trump’s proposed cuts to science funding and other NASA budgets. The agency has fired some employees and pressured others to leave, resulting in the loss of more than 2,600 of the 17,000-plus NASA employees, according to news platform Politico. At least US$118 million in NASA grants has been cancelled outright, and the White House has proposed slashing nearly half of the agency’s science budget for next year.\n\nCongress, which sets US spending, might reject at least some of those proposed cuts. But the managers of many NASA science projects have been asked to draw up plans for winding down their programmes even though Congress hasn’t finalized the budget — drawing dissent from the declaration’s signers. “Once operational spacecraft are decommissioned, they cannot be turned back on,” the document says. NASA, like other agencies, is supposed to follow spending priorities laid out by Congress, and Duffy, as interim administrator, could theoretically ignore the White House requests until a budget is finalised.",

Later, I learnt that there was a word for that, too. A comedian.\n\nAnd still later, I learnt, along with everyone else, that there wasn’t just Earth. Fine. Greatest comedian in the Universe, then.\n\nThere was just one little problem. The Primulans didn’t laugh. As far as anyone could tell, they didn’t even have mouths. When they were amused — which didn’t happen all that often — their eye sacs would vibrate, making a sound like an angry bumblebee.\n\nHalf the time, no one could quite figure out what was making them laugh (well … vibrate), but it seemed to be some blend of irony, brutal honesty and self-deprecation. I had studied all the recordings, and the biggest punchline had been delivered — unknowingly and nervously — by a special envoy addressing a room full of Primulans. He looked tiny in the video, clutching the sides of a massive podium emblazoned with the golden rose of Primula. A slight tremor in his voice, he began his speech with “I am so happy to be here with you”. In the cacophony of vibrations that followed, he looked around, confused, until an assistant had to usher him off stage.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nActually, there was another little problem, too: Primula had started building military vessels. Big ones — no joking matter. Bigger and more advanced than anything we had on Earth, and people were getting nervous.\n\nNo one was quite sure where things had gone wrong, but we all knew it was our fault. Maybe it was when a cruiser full of tourists from Earth had accidentally knocked one of Primula’s halo satellites out of orbit, throwing the planet’s weather systems into chaos for weeks.\n\nOr maybe it had been the diplomatic delegation that came afterwards to offer profuse apologies. It had seemed like a good idea. And maybe it would have worked, except that someone on the delegation hadn’t followed proper quarantine protocols. No one knew exactly what triggered it, but within days, the treasured golden roses of Primula all started to turn black, and hadn’t changed back again.\n\nSubsequent apologies had been beamed to Primula from Earth, but had gone unanswered.\n\nSo, I was as surprised as everyone else when a Primulan emissary arrived out of the blue to deliver a message to the Earth Council; relieved when it wasn’t a declaration of war; and surprised all over again that the Primulans were proposing a cultural summit to promote understanding.\n\nI guess they were right about that. We really didn’t understand each other. Didn’t then. Don’t now. But sometimes you need to give it a try anyway, and I guess that was why I ended up getting the phone call. After all, a shared laugh is the fastest way to bring everyone together, right? Could it work for Primulans, too?\n\nThat had been three weeks ago, and now I was here, clutching the sides of the same podium as that nervous diplomat all those years ago. I looked out at the audience — the left side of the hall entirely occupied by dignitaries from Earth, the right side entirely by Primulans.\n\nI started my routine.\n\nSafe material first — I needed to take my time, build things up bit-by-bit. Sure enough, I was getting polite laughs from the humans, but complete silence from the Primulans. As I continued, the laughs started to fade, grow uneasy — people were nervous that nothing was working for the Primulans. Not a single buzz, not one vibrating eye sac. It was the moment I had been waiting for: no more safe material. I switched to jokes about mouthless aliens, about failed diplomats, about the absurdity of a cultural summit between Primula and Earth.\n\nSilence. Well, not silence exactly. Something more than silence.",

          "abstract": "This year has seen a stunning collapse of ambition when it comes to assuring a sustainable future. Populism, short sightedness and scientific ignorance deserve blame. But so do the cost-of-living crisis and deepening inequality; environmental goals are often the first casualty of economic stagnation.\n\nGovernments and businesses should know better. Nature loss, volatile energy prices and air pollution all undermine productivity. Fail to address such issues and the resulting spiral will be vicious. So why is the business case for protecting nature not stronger? Or at least more familiar, made more forcefully, more regularly and by more captains of industry?\n\nWhile working on sustainable-finance projects with governments, banks and other financial institutions, I’ve found many smart, dedicated specialists. But, more widely, a basic grasp of natural capital is still lacking.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nOne reason is that agile global supply chains provide a false sense of security. War in Ukraine? Buy grain from India. Water levels low on the Mississippi River? Ship goods by road. It’s easy to conclude that risks apply only to ‘other’ sectors, such as agriculture, but not to ‘mine’.\n\nAnd some people fail to recognize the essential roles of nature in underpinning businesses. Natural capital provides environmental goods and services — raw materials, climate stability and flood protection. Depleting such assets means losing the economic benefits, too.\n\nBusiness schools must do more to be part of the solution. Climate and biodiversity are increasingly central to business risk and strategy, supply-chain management, regulatory and disclosure requirements, brand management and customer engagement. Bridging the science–business divide — through research, teaching, outreach and engagement — can equip graduates with the skills to create a net-zero, nature-positive economy.\n\nYet much of the talent and expertise found in business schools is rarely shared in mainstream scientific journals. Equally, the journals that determine career progression at these institutions — those ranked highly by the Chartered Association of Business Schools (CABS) or the Financial Times — have been slow to engage with topics such as climate change, biodiversity and infectious diseases.\n\nHere’s what business schools should do.\n\nAcknowledge that science is foundational to sustainability. Teaching and research must be integrated with ecological and planetary-systems sciences. Some of my favourite studies in biodiversity finance use machine-learning tools to link newspaper headlines about biodiversity to investor sentiment and stock-market performance. In others, researchers work with banks to analyse which characteristics of conservation interventions might unlock private finance. More such studies are needed. But responding to headlines is not the same as responding to ecological changes or biodiversity-related risks. And the fact that deals take place does not mean that nature has benefited. Financial researchers need to work with natural scientists to determine real-world outcomes.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them",

There have been many efforts to validate individual studies and key findings, some with shocking results.\n\nFor example in 2015, it was reported that more than half of 100 psychology studies fail reproducibility tests3, and earlier this year, a coalition of 56 research teams surveyed dozens of Brazilian biomedical studies and could replicate the results of less than half of the tested experiments.\n\nHuge reproducibility project fails to validate dozens of biomedical studies\n\nIn the latest preprints, Hanson, with Bruno Lemaitre, a geneticist who studies fruit-fly immunity at the Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne (EPFL), and their colleagues tried to assess the reproducibility of their entire research field.\n\n“This started with the observation that there was no follow-up of a number of big claims in big papers,” says Lemaitre, who led the study.\n\nThe team looked at 1,006 results from 400 papers published in the field between 1959 and 2011 — up until Jules Hoffmann won a share of the 2011 medicine Nobel prize for work on the Drosophila immune response.\n\nThey then went through the published literature looking for later work that either supported or refuted each claim. Rather than looking for studies that exactly replicated the methods of an experiment behind a result, or reproduced an identical effect, they searched to see if the claims were successfully built on by other studies, were broadly reproduced using more-modern techniques or still stood up to scrutiny now that knowledge of the field has moved on.\n\nUsing their expertise of the field, the researchers classified claims as either verified, unchallenged by other papers, challenged or partly verified.\n\nThey found that 61% of the 1,006 claims were verifiable, whereas only 7% had been challenged and weren’t reproducible.\n\nReplication games: how to make reproducibility research more systematic\n\nOf the 240 claims that had never been independently tested, the team could further categorize a subset of 111 as consistent with current knowledge and 22 as inconsistent with it. They performed experiments to test a further 45 claims, and found 38 of them to be inconsistent with current knowledge. “These were claims that I knew were a bit fragile,” says Lemaitre.",

The research community has long sought such a system to help us understand the humble beginnings of our own. Using both ground- and space-based telescopes, the team zeroed in on the young star HOPS-315, 420 parsecs from Earth, at the start of a most exciting time: its planet-forming era.\n\nThe researchers report their discovery today in Nature1.\n\n“What we’ve been trying to do is find a baby version of our Solar System somewhere else,” says Merel van’t Hoff, an astronomer at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and a co-author of the study.\n\nThe team originally focused its attention on HOPS-315 after detecting crystalline silicate minerals around it — a telltale sign of early planet formation. (Planets form as mineral grains condense and then clump together in the hot disks of gas and dust swirling around newborn stars.)\n\nLocated in the Orion constellation, the baby, or protostar, also stood out because it was oriented such that astronomers could get a glimpse of its surrounding disk of gas and dust. This view is rare because jets of gas emitted by a newborn star, known as outflow, often block the disk, but HOPS-315’s was on full display.\n\nThis video describes how astronomers detected and interpreted chemical signatures from the HOPS-315 system. Credit: European Southern Observatory\n\nThe researchers used the James Webb Space Telescope to probe the chemical make-up of material around the star, and found the first-ever traces of warm silicon monoxide (SiO) in such a disk. They also noticed that the silicate minerals they detected were rich in SiO, and that the midsection of the star’s disk was ultra-hot.\n\nAlongside observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array in Chile, these findings suggest that HOPS-315’s scorching midsection vaporized rock surrounding the star, and that the gas cooled and condensed into planet-forming minerals. “This hot mineral is the first feedstock that you have to start growing things in the disk,” says lead author Melissa McClure, an astronomer at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nFresh insight",

It aims to prevent babies from inheriting harmful mutations from maternal mitochondrial DNA, which can cause debilitating diseases that particularly affect power-hungry tissues such as those of the heart, brain and muscles.\n\n“This is a landmark study on preventing mitochondrial disease,” says Dietrich Egli, a stem-cell scientist at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nThe procedure has been dubbed three-person in vitro fertilization (IVF), because the resulting children carry nuclear DNA from their biological mother and father, as well as mitochondrial DNA from a separate egg donor.\n\nRare procedure\n\nThe United Kingdom became the first country in the world to explicitly regulate mitochondrial donation in 2015, after more than a decade of research, discussion and debate. So far, just one UK clinic, the Newcastle Fertility Centre, has been licensed by the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, to carry out the procedure.\n\nThe latest studies — published in The New England Journal of Medicine1,2 — provide the first detailed reports of the Newcastle team’s efforts. In 2023, The Guardian newspaper revealed that up to five UK children had been born using mitochondrial donation. However, few details were revealed about the children’s health or questions surrounding the technique’s effectiveness.\n\nFirst UK children born using three-person IVF: what scientists want to know\n\nIn total, 22 women carrying disease-causing mitochondria went through a mitochondrial-donation procedure called pronuclear transfer, leading to the birth of eight babies (including a pair of twins) and one ongoing pregnancy, report reproductive biologist Mary Herbert, now at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and her team.\n\nThe children — four girls and four boys — were all born healthy and are developing normally. The oldest child is now over two years old; the youngest is under five months. Five children have had no health problems at all, one experienced muscle jerks that went away on their own, another was successfully treated for a high level of fat in their blood and a heart-rhythm disturbance, and a third had fever due to a urinary-tract infection.\n\n“We’re cautiously optimistic about these results,” Robert McFarland, a paediatric neurologist at Newcastle University, who co-led one of the studies, said at a press briefing. “To see babies born at the end of this is amazing, and to know there’s not going to be mitochondrial disease at the end of that.”\n\nMitochondrial donations have been performed in several other countries without explicit regulation — mostly as a fertility treatment, but, in at least one case, to prevent mitochondrial disease.",

The discovery has major implications for researchers’ understanding of how such bodies grow in the Universe.\n\n“It’s super exciting,” says Priyamvada Natarajan, a theoretical astrophysicist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who was not involved in the research. The merger was between black holes with masses too big for physicists to easily explain. “We’re seeing these forbidden high-mass black holes,” she says.\n\nThe discovery was made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), a facility involving two detectors in the United States. It comes at a time when US funding for gravitational-wave detection faces devastating cuts. The results, released as a preprint on the arXiv server1, were presented at the GR-Amaldi gravitational-waves meeting in Glasgow, UK, on 14 July.\n\nForbidden mass\n\nLIGO detects gravitational waves by firing lasers down long, L-shaped arms. Minuscule changes in arm length reveal the passage of gravitational waves through the planet. The waves are ripples in space-time, caused by massive bodies accelerating, such as when two inspiralling black holes or neutron stars merge.\n\nGravitational waves from giant black-hole collision reveal long-sought ‘ringing’\n\nHundreds of these mergers have been observed using gravitational waves since LIGO's first detection in 2015. But this latest detection, made in November 2023, is the biggest yet. By modelling the signal detected by LIGO, scientists have calculated that the event, dubbed GW231123, was caused by two black holes with masses of about 100 and 140 times that of the Sun merging to form a final black hole weighing in at some 225 solar masses.\n\n“It’s the most massive [merger] so far,” says Mark Hannam, a physicist at Cardiff University, UK, and part of the LVK Collaboration, a wider network of gravitational-wave detectors that encompasses LIGO, Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan. It’s “about 50% more than the previous record holder”, he says.\n\nMost of the events captured by LIGO involve stellar-mass black holes — those ranging from a few to 100 times the mass of the Sun — which are thought to form when massive stars end their lives as supernovae. However, the two black holes involved in GW231123 fall in or near a predicted range, of 60–130 solar masses, at which this process isn’t expected to work, with theories instead predicting that the stars should be blown apart. “So they probably didn’t form by this normal mechanism,” says Hannam.\n\nInstead, the two black holes probably formed from earlier merger events — hierarchical mergers of massive bodies that led to the event detected by LIGO, which is estimated to have happened 0.7 billion to 4.1 billion parsecs (2.3 billion to 13.4 billion light years) away.\n\nIt’s like “four grandparents merging into two parents merging into one baby black hole”, says Alan Weinstein, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and also part of the LVK Collaboration.\n\n‘It’s a dream’: JWST spies more black holes than astronomers predicted\n\nModels of the black holes also suggest that they were spinning exceedingly fast — about 40 times per second, which is near the limit of what Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicts black holes can reach while remaining stable. “They’re spinning very close to the maximal spin allowable,” says Weinstein.\n\nBoth the spin and the mass could provide clues to how black holes grow. One of the biggest questions in astronomy is how the largest black holes, the supermassive ones found at the centres of galaxies such as the Milky Way, grew in the early cosmos.\n\nAlthough there is plenty of evidence for the existence of stellar-mass black holes and supermassive black holes — those of more than a million solar masses — intermediate-mass black holes in the range of 100 to 100,000 solar masses have been harder to find. “We don’t see them,” says Natarajan.",

For families with three girls, there was a 58% chance that the next child would be female.\n\nThe findings challenge what people have been told about their baby’s sex, which is that for each pregnancy, there is an equal chance of having either a boy or a girl, says Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and researcher at the University of Melbourne, Australia. “Based on these findings, you have to tell couples that their chance of having a different-sex child from what they already have is actually less than 50:50,” he says.\n\nAge influences sex\n\nResearchers at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, looked at the sex of children born to 58,007 female nurses in the United States between 1956 and 2015, and the different factors that might explain why some had only boys and others only girls.\n\nThey found that in two-child families, having one child of each sex was more common than two boys or two girls, but in families with three or more children, siblings of the same sex were more common than a mix of both. In their analysis, the researchers excluded the last birth of each woman to reduce the influence of parental choice — for instance, some people choose to stop having children once they have both boys and girls.\n\nThe team also found that women aged 29 or older when they had their first child had a 13% higher chance of giving birth to only male or only female children than did women younger than 23.\n\nThe authors note that changes in vaginal pH as women age could explain this phenomenon. For instance, the changes could influence the sex of the child by affecting whether sperm carrying the X chromosome or the Y chromosome are more successful at fertilizing the egg, says Polyakov.\n\nGenetic influence\n\nA genomic analysis also showed that some women had one of two common genetic variants that were associated with having children of a particular sex. A change in chromosome 10, in a gene called NSUN6, was associated with a higher probability of having only girls, whereas women with a change in a single DNA letter on chromosome 18, near a gene called TSHZ1, were more likely to have only boys.",

          "authors": "Oliver P. Hauser, Miriam Light, Lizzie Shelmerdine, Jack Blumenau",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be a transformative force in science, society and the economy. However, much remains unknown about the broader implications of widespread AI use.\n\nFor instance, AI technologies can enhance as well as impede the performance of knowledge workers. They can boost productivity for routine tasks, such as idea generation and writing, but might introduce bottlenecks and errors in more-complex tasks when AI advice is adopted blindly1. Chatbots can aid individual people’s creativity, yet overreliance on them might reduce the overall diversity of original ideas2.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nUnderstanding how users engage with the technology — and the outcomes that follow — requires careful, systematic study to differentiate between the positive and negative impacts. For instance, in education, it’s crucial to test whether students use AI tools to deepen their understanding of a topic, or whether they simply use the technology as a crutch, hindering real learning.\n\nControlled studies can reveal areas to which AI truly adds value and when its risks outweigh the benefits. Randomized controlled trials — in which a randomly selected group of participants receives an intervention while a control group operates under business-as-usual conditions — might be particularly valuable for assessing AI’s impact in public-sector settings. For example, can a chatbot deliver factual and actionable advice to citizens seeking tax-related information, ultimately promoting accurate and timely tax filing? Will partially automating eligibility assessments for social benefits lead to fair, efficient outcomes at reduced cost? Understanding when, how and for whom AI works is crucial to ensuring positive results and a meaningful return on investment.\n\nHere, we introduce an AI impact-evaluation framework3 developed for the UK public sector, providing a potential blueprint for public organizations as well as the private sector.\n\nThe need to test\n\nWhat do we mean by evaluating AI? Evaluation refers to assessing an intervention’s design, implementation and impact4 — in other words, understanding how and to what extent it changes the outcome of interest.\n\nAI companies currently undertake model evaluations — testing the performance of large language models (LLMs) against benchmarks to assess their capabilities in areas such as language, mathematics, reasoning and problem-solving. Furthermore, over the past 18 months, leading AI-security institutes in the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan have advocated for testing frontier AI models to ensure they are safe to use before public release. However, although model evaluation and safety protocols are necessary, they are not sufficient.\n\nThis is because evaluating a model’s technical performance is not the same as assessing its real-world economic and societal impacts. For instance, many organizations now use customized LLMs as internal chatbots to help employees to access organization-wide materials or summarize large volumes of information — from meeting notes and market research to sector-wide consultations. Others are using AI tools to create slide decks, reports and business plans.\n\nMedical AI can transform medicine — but only if we carefully track the data it touches\n\nConventional AI-model evaluation will ensure that the outputs are reasonably accurate and safe. But such assessments do not tell us whether these tools to improve users’ decision-making, increase their efficiency or redirect their time towards more-useful activities. Or, in the public sector, whether they lead to improved services and better outcomes for citizens.\n\nAlthough some organizations conduct small pilot studies and collect user feedback, such tests rarely have the quality, scale and independence required. Our guidance recommends incorporating evaluation into the design of the AI tool itself.\n\nBecause most AI tools are hosted online, it’s relatively easy to test new features by comparing how various user groups respond5. For example, a government website might randomly show some users a new LLM-powered interactive chatbot, whereas others continue to use a simpler, rules-based one. The new tool’s impact can then be assessed by tracking whether users in the LLM group are less likely to request human assistance or call the help centre — signs that their queries are being resolved more effectively than those of the other group.\n\nPeople can monitor their blood glucose levels continuously using a smartphone app.Credit: Getty\n\nSurveys can provide useful feedback on user experience for both groups, helping evaluators to understand what worked and why. But it’s important to not rely on self-reports alone. Observing actual behaviour — what people do, not just what they say — provides stronger evidence of impact.\n\nMore-complex AI projects require proportionately scaled evaluation designs. Consider a hypothetical scenario in which the UK National Health Service provides people with an AI-powered wearable device to help them to manage a chronic condition. The technology monitors the person’s health and sends automated alerts to their physician if it detects signs that medical attention might be needed. A robust evaluation could randomly assign the AI-enabled wearable to some people, whereas others (serving as a control group) could receive a version without such features.\n\nKey outcomes might include a reduction in the number of hospital admissions through more timely preventative care. But the evaluation should also explore potential unintended consequences — for instance, whether physicians become overly reliant on the AI tool and reduce the frequency of in-person consultations or other standard care practices.\n\nContinuous evaluation\n\nOur AI-evaluation guidance not just builds on the UK government’s Magenta Book4, which outlines its evaluation standards, but calls for updating conventional approaches. Most policies are typically evaluated only once. For AI, however, this needs to change.\n\nAI models are fast-evolving, and their output and performance can change quickly. Many AI systems adapt through user interactions, meaning that their behaviour can change over time — or differ across user groups. Evaluation strategies must therefore be as dynamic and responsive as the technology itself.\n\nOur guidance highlights the need for continuous, iterative evaluation. Instead of relying on a single assessment, setting up regular checkpoints — or better yet, adopting a system that continuously updates the evidence base as data become available — can be much more effective. This kind of flexible approach enables decision makers to adapt quickly and make informed choices as the technology and its impacts evolve.",

          "authors": "Ananyo Bhattacharya",
          "abstract": "One of the biggest stories in science is quietly playing out in the world of abstract mathematics. Over the course of last year, researchers fulfilled a decades-old dream when they unveiled a proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture — a key piece of a group of interconnected problems called the Langlands programme. The proof — a gargantuan effort — validates the intricate and far-reaching Langlands programme, which is often hailed as the grand unified theory of mathematics but remains largely unproven. Yet the work’s true impact might lie not in what it settles, but in the new avenues of inquiry it reveals.\n\n“It’s a huge triumph. But rather than closing a door, this proof throws open a dozen others,” says David Ben-Zvi at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved with the work.\n\n‘Mind blowing’: quantum computer untangles the mathematics of knots\n\nProving the geometric Langlands conjecture has long been considered one of the deepest and most enigmatic pursuits in modern mathematics. Ultimately, it took a team of nine mathematicians to crack the problem, in a series of five papers spanning almost 1,000 pages1–5. The group was led by Dennis Gaitsgory at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, and Sam Raskin at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who completed his PhD with Gaitsgory in 2014.\n\nThe magnitude of their accomplishment was quickly recognized by the mathematical community: in April, Gaitsgory received the US$3-million Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics, and Raskin was awarded a New Horizons prize for promising early-career mathematicians. Like many landmark results in mathematics, the proof promises to forge bridges between different areas, allowing the tools of one domain to tackle intractable problems in another. All told, it’s a heady time for researchers in these fields.\n\n“It gives us the strongest evidence yet that something we’ve believed in for decades is true,” says Ben-Zvi. “Now we can finally ask: what does it really mean?”\n\nThe hole story\n\nThe Langlands programme traces its origins back 60 years, to the work of a young Canadian mathematician named Robert Langlands, who set out his vision in a handwritten letter to the leading mathematician André Weil. Over the decades, the programme attracted increasing attention from mathematicians, who marvelled at how all-encompassing it was. It was that feature that led Edward Frenkel at the University of California, Berkeley, who has made key contributions to the geometric side, to call it the grand unified theory of mathematics.\n\nLanglands’ aim was to connect two very separate major branches of mathematics — number theory (the study of integers) and harmonic analysis (the study of how complicated signals or functions break down into simple waves). A special case of the Langlands programme is the epic proof that Andrew Wiles published, in 1995, of Fermat’s last theorem — that no three positive integers a, b and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn if n is an integer greater than 2.\n\nRobert Langlands discussed his ideas in a letter to André Weil in 1967. On the cover page to the letter (left), Langlands says, “If you are willing to read it as pure speculation I would appreciate that; if not — I am sure you have a waste basket handy.”Credit: Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton, N.J.) Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center\n\nThe geometric Langlands conjecture was first developed in the 1980s by Vladimir Drinfeld, then at the B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Like the original or arithmetic form of the Langlands conjecture, the geometric conjecture also makes a type of connection: it suggests a correspondence between two different sets of mathematical objects. Although the fields linked by the arithmetic form of Langlands are separate mathematical ‘worlds’, the differences between the two sides of the geometric conjecture are not so pronounced. Both concern properties of Riemann surfaces, which are ‘complex manifolds’ — structures with coordinates that are complex numbers (with real and imaginary parts). These manifolds can take the form of spheres, doughnuts or pretzel-like shapes with two or more holes.\n\nMany mathematicians strongly suspect that the ‘closeness’ of the two sides means the proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture could eventually offer some traction for furthering the arithmetic version, in which the relationships are more mysterious. “To truly understand the Langlands correspondence, we have to realize that the ‘two worlds’ in it are not that different — rather, they are two facets of one and the same world,” says Frenkel. “Seeing this unity requires a new vision, a new understanding. We are still far from it in the original formulation. But the fact that, for Riemann surfaces, the two worlds sort of coalesce means that we are getting closer to finding this secret unity underlying the whole programme,” he adds.\n\nObesity-drug pioneers and 13,508 physicists win US$3-million Breakthrough Prizes\n\nOne side of the geometric Langlands conjecture concerns a characteristic called a fundamental group. In basic terms, the fundamental group of a Riemann surface describes all the distinct ways in which loops can be tied around it. With a doughnut, for example, a loop can run horizontally around the outer edge or vertically through the hole and around the outside. The geometric Langlands deals with the ‘representation’ of a surface’s fundamental group, which expresses the group’s properties as matrices (grids of numbers).\n\nThe other side of the geometric Langlands programme has to do with special kinds of ‘sheaves’. These tools of algebraic geometry are rules that allot ‘vector spaces’ (where vectors — arrows — can be added and multiplied) to points on a manifold in much the same way as a function describing a gravitational field, say, can assign numbers for the strength of the field to points in standard 3D space.\n\nBridgework in progress\n\nWork on bridging this divide began back in the 1990s. Using earlier work on Kac–Moody algebras, which ‘translate’ between representations and sheaves, Drinfeld and Alexander Beilinson, both now at the University of Chicago, Illinois, described how to build the right kind of sheaves to make the connection. Their paper (see go.nature.com/4ndp5ev), nearly 400 pages long, has never been formally published. Gaitsgory, together with Dima Arinkin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, made this relationship more precise in 20126; then, working alone, Gaitsgory followed up with a step-by-step outline of how the geometric Langlands might be proved7.\n\n“The conjecture as such sounds pretty baroque — and not just to outsiders,” says Ben-Zvi. “I think people are much more excited about the proof of geometric Langlands now than they would have been a decade ago, because we understand better why it’s the right kind of question to ask, and why it might be useful for things in number theory.”\n\nOne of the most immediate consequences of the new proof is the boost it provides to research on ‘local’ versions of the different Langlands conjectures, which ‘zoom in’ on particular objects in the ‘global’ settings. In the case of the geometric Langlands programme, for example, the local version is concerned with the properties of objects associated with discs around points on a Riemann surface — rather than the whole manifold, which is the domain of the ‘global’ version.\n\nRobert Langlands in 2016.Credit: Dan Komoda, Institute for Advanced Study\n\nPeter Scholze, at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, has been instrumental in forging connections between the local and global Langlands programmes. But initially, even he was daunted by the geometric side.\n\n“To tell the truth,” Scholze says, “until around 2014, the geometric Langlands programme looked incomprehensible to me.” That changed when Laurent Fargues at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris proposed a reimagining of the local arithmetic Langlands conjectures in geometrical terms8. Working together, Scholze and Fargues spent seven years showing that this strategy could help to make progress on proving a version of the local arithmetic Langlands conjecture9 concerning the p-adic numbers, which involve the primes and their powers. They connected it to the global geometric version that the team led by Gaitsgory and Raskin later proved.\n\nThe papers by Scholze and Fargues built what Scholze describes as a “wormhole” between the two areas, allowing methods and structures from the global geometric Langlands programme to be imported into the local arithmetic context. “So I’m really happy about the proof,” Scholze says. “I think it’s a tremendous achievement and am mining it for parts.”\n\nQuantum connection\n\nAccording to some researchers, one of the most surprising bridges that the geometric Langlands programme has built is to theoretical physics. Since the 1970s, physicists have explored a quantum analogue of a classical symmetry: that swapping electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations, which describe how the two fields interact, leaves the equations unchanged. This elegant symmetry underpins a broader idea in quantum field theory, known as S-duality.\n\n‘Grand unified theory of maths’ nets Abel Prize\n\nIn 2007, Edward Witten at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, and Anton Kapustin at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena were able to show10 that S-duality in certain four-dimensional gauge theories — a class of theories that includes the standard model of particle physics — possesses the same symmetry that appears in the geometric Langlands correspondence. “Seemingly esoteric notions of the geometric Langlands program,” the pair wrote, “arise naturally from the physics.”\n\nAlthough their theories include hypothetical particles, called superpartners, that have never been observed, their insight suggests that geometric Langlands is not just a rarefied idea in pure mathematics; instead, it can be seen as a shadow of a deep symmetry in quantum physics. “I do think it is fascinating that the Langlands programme has this counterpart in quantum field theory,” says Witten. “And I think this might eventually be important in the mathematical development of the Langlands programme.”\n\nAmong the first to take that possibility seriously was Minhyong Kim, director of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, UK. “Even simple-sounding problems in number theory — like Fermat’s last theorem — are hard,” he says. One way to make headway is by using ideas from physics, like those in Witten and Kapustin’s work, as a sort of metaphor for number-theoretic problems, such as the arithmetic Langlands conjecture. Kim is working on making these metaphors more rigorous. “I take various constructions in quantum field theory and try to cook up precise number-theoretic analogues,” he says.\n\nSam Raskin (left) and Dennis Gaitsgory led the team that proved the geometric Langlands conjecture.Credit: Dan Renzetti/Yale University, Lester Cohen/Getty Images for Breakthrough Prize",

Credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty\n\nExcitement is growing among researchers about another powerful artificial intelligence (AI) model to emerge from China, after DeepSeek shocked the world with its launch of R1 in January.\n\nThe performance of Kimi K2, launched on 11 July by Beijing-based company Moonshot AI, matches or surpasses that of Western rivals, as well as some DeepSeek models, across various benchmarks, according to the firm. In particular, it seems to excel at coding and scoring high in tests such as LiveCodeBench.\n\nScientists flock to DeepSeek: how they’re using the blockbuster AI model\n\nAs with DeepSeek’s models, Kimi K2 is open-weight, meaning it can be downloaded and built on by researchers for free. It can be accessed through an application programming interface (API) for a fraction of the price of leading proprietary models, such as Claude 4 from Anthropic in San Francisco, California.\n\n“The community can freely use it, fine-tune it and build on it without training their own model from scratch,” says Adina Yakefu, an AI researcher at the open-science platform Hugging Face in New York City. Just one day after its launch, Kimi K2 was downloaded at a rate higher than that for any other model on the platform, Hugging Face data show. Its release is “another ‘DeepSeek moment’”, Yakefu says.\n\nUnlike many other powerful models, K2 is not a ‘reasoner’ — a model trained to approach queries using step-by-step logic. Instead, it specializes in being an agentic large language model (LLM), meaning that it promises to carry out multi-step tasks using a variety of tools, such as browsing the web or calling on mathematics software. Some models, including some versions of ChatGPT, can already do this, but they are proprietary. AI researchers are still checking whether they can replicate examples of agentic behaviour that Moonshot AI says Kimi K2 can do.\n\nThe next top model\n\nHaving a second impressive model emerge from China in six months suggests that the feat was not an anomaly. “The DeepSeek R1 release earlier this year was more of a prequel than a one-off fluke in the trajectory of AI,” wrote Nathan Lambert, a machine-learning researcher at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, Washington, in his newsletter, Interconnects. Kimi K2 is “the new best open model in the world”, he posted on the social-media site Bluesky.\n\nMoonshot AI, founded in March 2023, is a start-up organization that, until now, has been little known in the West. But its Kimi chatbot, based on a previous LLM, was already the third-most-used in China by November, according to Counterpoint, a marketing-research firm in Hong Kong. Chinese technology giants Alibaba and Tencent are reportedly among its investors.\n\nNEWS 10 July 2025 OpenAI’s o3 tops new AI league table for answering scientific questions",

          "abstract": "Data from large, open databases appear in hundreds of low quality, repetitive papers. Credit: Artem Cherednik/iStock via Getty\n\nData from five large open-access health databases are being used to generate thousands of poor-quality, formulaic papers, an analysis has found. Its authors say that the surge in publications could indicate the exploitation of these databases by people using large language models (LLMs) to mass-produce scholarly articles, or even by paper mills — companies that churn out papers to order.\n\nAI linked to explosion of low-quality biomedical research papers\n\nThe findings, posted as a preprint on medRxiv on 9 July1, follow an earlier study2 that highlighted an explosion of such papers that used data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The latest analysis flags a rising number of studies featuring data from other large health databases, including the UK Biobank and the US Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which documents the side effects of drugs.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2024, the number of papers using data from these databases rose from around 4,000 to 11,500 — around 5,000 more papers than expected on the basis of previous publication trends.\n\nThe study’s authors warn that a large number of these papers — many of which have repetitive, template-like titles — are likely to be of low quality and could flood the scientific literature. Their analysis is intended as “an early warning system … so that peer reviewers, editors and researchers can understand where the vulnerabilities in the system lie”, says co-author Matt Spick, a biomedical scientist at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK.\n\nUnexpected growth\n\nSpick and his colleagues analysed changes in publication counts, title wording and author affiliations for papers that were based on data from 34 open-access health databases. The team used an algorithm to predict the growth in the numbers of papers expected for each data set from 2014 to 2024 — a period during which text-generating LLM tools such as ChatGPT and Gemini became mainstream.\n\nBiomedical paper retractions have quadrupled in 20 years — why?\n\nWhen they compared their predictions with actual publication rates, the researchers identified six data sets that had significantly exceeded the growth rates predicted by the algorithm. All but one also showed a rise in the number of papers with ‘template-like’ titles. These data sets were NHANES, UK Biobank, FAERS, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and the Finnish genetic database FinnGen. By 2024, the number of papers using FinnGen data grew by nearly 15 times from 2021, for example, while those using FAERS increased by nearly 4 times and UK Biobank by 2.4 times over the same period.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered some dubious papers, which often linked complex health conditions to a single variable. One paper used Mendelian randomization — a technique that helps to determine whether a particular health risk factor causes a disease — to study whether drinking semi-skimmed milk could protect against depression, whereas another looked into how education levels affect someone’s chances of developing a hernia after surgery.\n\n“A lot of those findings might be unsafe, and yet they’re also accessible to the public, and that really worries me,” says Spick.",

          "title": "How your research can survive a US federal grant termination",
          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "Seven weeks after being awarded a US$12.9-million grant to assess dementia risks in vulnerable populations, Briana Mezuk received an e-mail informing her that it was being terminated.\n\nMezuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, had honed her federal grant application over two years to take advantage of the National Survey of American Life — a seminal study of 7,000 participants that examined racial, ethnic and cultural influences on mental health1. Started by Mezuk’s mentor, James S. Jackson, a former director of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, it is the only nationally representative sample of the mental health of Black Americans, who are twice as likely as their white counterparts to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Mezuk planned to follow up with those participants 25 years after the first interviews took place and examine how their life experiences and mental health had contributed to their dementia risk.\n\nThe five-year grant was awarded on 1 February by the National Institute on Aging, a division of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), based in Bethesda, Maryland. But on 21 March, it fell foul of the disdain that the administration of US President Donald Trump has expressed for projects including the terms diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\nHarvard researchers devastated as Trump team cuts nearly 1,000 grants\n\nAccording to Grant Watch, a database tracking terminated grants from the NIH and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) — the country’s independent federal science-funding agency — more than 4,500 NIH grants awarded to US institutions have been terminated, representing some $6.1 billion of lost funding. And according to its 27 May account, a total of 1,752 grants, amounting to roughly $1.5 billion, had by then been terminated at the NSF.\n\n“The largest studies on dementia risk only have 800 Black participants. We were going to have 3,000,” says Mezuk, who appealed through the NIH against her grant cancellation. “It is critically important that a diverse set of experiences are represented. If we keep asking the same question in the same populations, we will get the same answer.” Her planned research aimed to glean fresh insights to help ‘baby boomers’, referring to the generation born between 1946 and 1964, to manage dementia risks.\n\nEpidemiologist Briana Mezuk’s grant to study dementia risk in older Black people was reinstated after her appeal. Credit: University of Michigan School of Public Health\n\nBut such terminations don’t just affect the research team involved. Many grant cancellations affect community research partners. Adelia Cooley is a member of the community advisory board for the Healthier Black Elders Center, an outreach programme that includes researchers at three Michigan universities working to improve the health of older Black adults in Detroit and Flint. Cooley says her biggest concern is the impact that the cuts will have on Black Americans, a demographic in which the risk of dementia (in those aged 55 or over) is roughly 45%2. “To say this is irrelevant or not necessary is horrible.”\n\nAgency appeals, however, as well as multi-complaint lawsuits, are getting some terminations reversed. On 16 June, a judge in Maryland ruled that NIH grants in two lawsuits — one filed by 16 state attorneys-general, the other by four researchers and three organizations with scientific members — were terminated unlawfully. The ruling reinstates roughly 800 grants and subawards named in the lawsuits. A follow-up ruling on 2 July suggests that the NIH cannot use discriminatory directives to terminate grants. But the Trump administration is likely to appeal against the decision, extending delays and confusion over terminated grants.\n\nMezuk’s grant was not part of any lawsuit, but she received a 19 June memo from the NIH stating that her appeal “has convinced them that, with revision, the grant is likely allowable”. The vaguely worded correspondence offered her a piece of guidance: remove participant-survey questions about experiences of discrimination. On 10 July, she received notice that her grant had been fully reinstated.\n\nNature’s Careers team spoke to 20 researchers who have lost grants from the NIH, the NSF, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Defense, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NASA. Mezuk, for one, is lucky in that her institution supported her appeal. Some universities forbid such attempts.\n\n#OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers\n\nDuring the reporting of this article, several interviewees had their grants reinstated, offering hope amid the chaos — although only about one-fifth of NIH-terminated grants have been flagged by Grant Watch as possibly reinstated through appeals or court cases so far. Many researchers are spending the bulk of their time frantically applying for grants to secure enough funding just to keep their work going. But the amounts they can hope to gain pale in comparison with the money lost through the federal-government cuts. Others are exploring new fund-raising strategies altogether – including campaigning through GoFundMe, the world’s largest fundraising platform.\n\nCollateral community damage\n\nMara Freilich, an environmental scientist who started her research group at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in 2023, lost her first federally funded grant from NASA on 21 March because it was considered “radical and wasteful DEI” spending, according to the e-mail she received from the agency. The funding had been helping a multi-institutional team working with community advocates and citizen scientists to analyse air quality around the Salton Sea, a large, landlocked and highly saline lake in southern California. “One of my big concerns is that the trust in science and in scientists is broken,” says Freilich. It weighs on her that scientists might not be able to follow through on the promises they made to community partners, such as sharing the air-quality findings in a timely manner.\n\nThe Salton Sea field site in California, where Mara Freilich’s group studied air-pollution emissions; the project was funded by a now-terminated NASA grant. Credit: Ryan Sinclair, Loma Linda University\n\nIn a study published on 31 May3, Freilich and her collaborators identified hydrogen sulfide emissions from the Salton Sea as an air pollutant of concern. The research was funded, in part, by the terminated NASA grant, which was also intended to develop innovative ways of using satellite data to predict hydrogen sulfide emissions. Freilich’s appeal against the cancellation was unsuccessful.\n\nThe grant terminations for Mezuk, Freilich and others have had a domino effect. Big studies often involve collaborations between several institutions. Freilich’s grant termination compromises funding for research partners at the University of California, Los Angeles; Loma Linda University in southern California; and Alianza Coachella Valley, a community group that aims to improve environmental conditions in the region.\n\nAlida Cantor, a geographer at Portland State University in Oregon, is also trying hard to maintain ties with community partners. Cantor lost two grants, from the NSF and the EPA, because her research included the banned term “environmental justice”, as related to the intersection between energy development and water availability in the western United States. The funding loss affects four academic institutions, as well as community partners. “Out of respect for our research participants, I’m not going to chuck the data,” says Cantor. “My priority is just being ethical in my relationships with research collaborators, participants, community partners and students.” Oregon was one of 16 states that sued the government to get terminated grants reinstated, and although Cantor is hopeful, she hasn’t heard anything more.\n\nAppeals for some\n\nAppealing against a grant termination usually entails assembling a dossier of evidence to submit to the funder. But success rates have been difficult to determine. The University of Utah’s $38 million Clinical and Translational Science Award, a seven-year grant first awarded by the NIH in 2023, was reinstated on 29 March. Grant Watch states on its website that it thinks the government “has restored a limited number of NIH grants that it previously terminated, often without providing public notice”.\n\nCharles DeCarli, director of the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center, is another of the few people known to have succeeded in an appeal. DeCarli was in the fifth year of a $36-million NIH grant programme to study the vascular factors that lead to dementia in a diverse population. Currently, he and his team have around 1,700 participants enrolled out of a hoped-for total of 2,250. (They lost around 100 participants in the weeks after the grant was initially terminated). DeCarli says his wife summarized the recipe for success best: support from university, peers, the NIH, the Alzheimer’s Association and the American Heart Association, and a dash of pixie dust. “We don’t really know why our appeal was successful,” he says.\n\nDeCarli took three weeks to put together a 41-page appeal that contained 16–18 pages of justification, with 50 references; the rest he describes as “legalese”. He emphasized all the ways in which his work furthered NIH priorities to study chronic illness as promoted by Make America Healthy Again, Trump’s populist campaign tailored to promote the aims of the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. DeCarli also pointed out that he had been awarded the grant in 2020, during the first Trump administration. He received a grant-reinstatement notification just a few days after he submitted his appeal.\n\n“If at all possible, push back,” he advises. “Seek the support of your institution. Seek the support of the free press, colleagues, programme officers. Researchers are “a small group”, he adds. “We should organize.”\n\nEarly-career researchers who appeal against the termination of training awards earmarked for diverse candidates are on particularly uncertain terrain – especially if the funding mechanism is terminated. For example, the NIH’s F31 training grants are coveted awards designed to support an individual’s PhD training and research. Since 2002, there have been two options: a standard F31 and a diversity-focused F31, designed to bolster candidates from marginalized or low-income backgrounds. About 30% of the 1,000 or so F31 training grants awarded in 2024 were funded by the diversity mechanism. Patrick Kelly, a third-year PhD candidate at Brown University, was awarded one of them. Kelly’s grant was cancelled in May, along with other diversity-specific F31 awards. Still, he wrote an appeal emphasizing how his dissertation research focused on drug use and drug-related harm from fentanyl, a priority of the HHS.\n\nKelly, a white man, qualified for the award because he is a first-generation student from a low-income background. On 27 June, he was notified that his grant had been reinstated and that funds were available for him to continue the research proposed in the grant. “I remain cautiously optimistic that the remaining years of the fellowship will also be awarded,” he says, but he acknowledges there’s no guarantee of that.\n\nScientists who might be political targets themselves — notably those at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and at Columbia University in New York City — also hold out little hope for appeals. Trump has cut federal funding and contracts at both institutions, claiming that student protests in support of Palestinian people are evidence that the establishments “tolerate antisemitism”. On 16 June, a judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by faculty members at Columbia University over Trump-administration funding cuts — because the university itself was not a plaintiff.\n\nNIH grant cuts will axe clinical trials abroad — and could leave thousands without care\n\nColumbia pulmonologist Jeanine D’Armiento had one time point left to collect data related to diagnosing a rare genetic disorder that affects the lungs and liver. But on 28 March, she lost her NIH funding for the study. Without those final data “everything we’d done for the last four years was wasted”, she says. At the same time, she lost funding for research on another rare lung disease; both grants were terminated weeks after the initial wave of $400 million in grant losses at Columbia in mid-March.\n\nD’Armiento, who chairs the executive committee of Columbia’s university senate, says her grants have none of the “bad” phrases, such as DEI, that are red flags for the Trump administration. Her trial was designed to recruit individuals in often-overlooked rural settings, among others, she says. She thinks she’s been targeted because the senate supported due process for student protesters. “I’m saddened by the loss of so much of my work,” she says. As it stands, she hopes that patient advocacy groups will help to raise money for her to finish the research. In fact, one trial participant asked her wedding guests to donate to D’Armiento’s research — and raised roughly $13,000.\n\nPhilanthropic life support\n\nBeyond federal funding sources, many turned immediately to philanthropic institutes — notably, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJ) in Princeton, New Jersey, which is the largest such organization focused solely on health in the country. So far, the RWJ has put together several pools of money to keep terminated research “on life support”, says Alonzo Plough, the foundation’s chief science officer and vice-president for research evaluation and learning.\n\n“What philanthropy can do is important, but it is orders of magnitude less than the billions in federal funding,” says Plough. “We fund in the serious millions, but what has been cut has been serious billions,” he adds.",

          "authors": "Brian M. Lucey, Andrew Urquhart, Samuel A. Vigne",
          "abstract": "Financial models can fail when unprecedented events hit.Credit: Getty\n\nAmid wars, political earthquakes, the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accelerating effects of climate change, the future seems more unpredictable than ever. That is true even though our ability to predict it — using simulations, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data — has never been so great.\n\nBut could part of the problem be part of the solution? Financial markets have developed ways to hedge against risks, to keep the global economy stable. Insurers foresee and cover costs of rare events, such as natural disasters. But risk tools fail when uncertainties get so great that no predictions can hold.\n\nWe argue that a fresh set of financial tools must be designed to hedge against uncertainty. It’s crucial if the world’s systems are to bear the brunt of unexpected crises in the future. And we set out pointers here.\n\nBut, to understand this problem, a crucial distinction needs to be grasped: the difference between risk and uncertainty. This isn’t just academic hair-splitting — it shapes how society tackles challenges ranging from climate change to AI to the future of the planet.\n\nManaging risk\n\nIn 1921, economist Frank Knight made an observation that would transform how people think about the unknown. Risk, he suggested, is quantifiable. It is like a game of dice, in which we can calculate the exact probability of rolling a six.\n\nWhy probability probably doesn’t exist (but it is useful to act like it does)\n\nProbability tools have been developed to analyse risk. Actuaries, insurers and sports bookmakers all work with them. As long as these professionals have a reasonable forecast, based on historical data, of how likely something is to happen, they can make an informed decision on whether to put aside money to cover the event or not.\n\nFinancial markets also have sophisticated tools to handle risk. The Black–Scholes model for pricing stock options1, for instance, is based on analyses of historical risk. Banks use ‘value at risk’ models to estimate their potential losses with statistical confidence2.\n\nInsurance companies increasingly use climate models to factor in how global warming will affect their bottom line, even in conditions that are unprecedented. For example, by 2030, more than 500,000 homes in Australia, out of 3 million at risk, might face annual flood threats so high that they become uninsurable3.\n\nBut it’s not always possible to calculate the odds. And that’s where uncertainty steps in. Some events have elements of both risk and uncertainty. For example, an earthquake, pandemic or flood might be known to happen once a decade or once a century on average. But it’s impossible to predict precisely when, where and how bad it will be.\n\nAt other times, outcomes are impossible to foresee. For example, researchers can speculate on the range of disruption AI might cause to industry sectors, but they cannot pin down the likelihoods in a meaningful way. Such events are ‘known unknowns’, in that scientists are aware of them but it is impossible to fully encapsulate them.\n\nTrain passengers were stranded when a massive power cut hit Spain in April.Credit: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty\n\nCompanies struggle to hedge against truly uncertain events. Businesses can find their factories destroyed by war, industries might be undercut by AI or changes in immigration policy could affect labour forces. Ultimately, these unforeseen events lead to financial losses, and fresh approaches to cushion these losses are sorely needed.\n\nNo current trading instruments enable us to tame uncertainty. The Cboe Volatility Index (see go.nature.com/4l6zau4), for instance, often called the ‘fear index’, measures asset-price volatility, which is a quantifiable risk. Catastrophe bonds4 pay out to insurers when unexpected but predictable events, such as hurricanes, happen. But they don’t cover unpredictable events.\n\nGrowing uncertainty\n\nUncertainty seems to be on the rise. Society has never before witnessed conditions like those now emerging. Researchers lack adequate models of how society, the environment and cutting-edge technologies work, in isolation or together.\n\nClimate change, for example, presents a parade of unknowns. How will shifting weather affect agriculture? How will coastal cities adapt to rising seas? What industries will emerge or vanish in a zero-carbon economy? The variables interact in ways too complex for conventional risk models to capture.\n\nHurricane risk in a changing climate — the role of uncertainty\n\nSimilarly, AI introduces more uncertainties. How will it reshape education, jobs and creative work? What will be the role of humans if AI exceeds our capabilities? What forms of cyber vulnerabilities might emerge? People have no idea how humans and machines will or even can co-evolve.\n\nPolitical and economic uncertainty is also soaring. Conventional models struggle to account for the impact of social media on political movements, the fragmentation of global trade networks or the emergence of digital currencies. We’re no longer just dealing with known unknowns, but are in the dead space of unknown unknowns.\n\nFinancial norms are shifting\n\nThe everyday workings of the financial sector are much more uncertain today than they were even a year ago. Basic assumptions no longer hold. For example, since US President Donald Trump took office in January, the role of US government debt as a fundamental, safe macroeconomic benchmark has been challenged.\n\nThe value of a financial asset is usually set using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)5. But this model is designed to always grant an investor a pay-off in relation to the risk of the asset itself — the riskier the stock you invest in, the higher the return you should receive.\n\nUsing the CAPM, the minimum level of return has been tacitly agreed to be that of a short-dated investment called a US government treasury bill — essentially a loan from an investor that the treasury promises to repay. Before January, this instrument was seen as ‘risk free’ — there was almost no chance of the US treasury being unable to pay back the monies borrowed in 90 or 180 days. But uncertainty around the US economy means that capital is draining from the United States to Europe because global investors no longer think that US debt is the least risky investment in the world.\n\nAs well as devaluing the dollar and moving to a tariff-based trading world, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Accord proposes levying a charge on foreign owners of US debt and dictating repayment terms of 100 years. If that happened, it would render US treasury bills financially worthless to investors. Investors from different countries might value US investments differently from each other, because each would rely on their own understanding of the risk of holding US debt6. The CAPM would no longer apply.\n\nWhen there is uncertainty, but no way to price it, the danger of catastrophic falls in asset values is there but cannot be computed. Investors will move to assets with lower degrees of uncertainty6 and interest rates will come under strain.\n\nA devastating earthquake in Myanmar killed thousands of people in March.Credit: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty\n\nTechnology offers some ways to assess uncertainty. By harnessing computing power and AI, scientists can scan millions of news articles, political speeches, social-media posts and financial reports for words, sentiments and tones that are associated with uncertainty7. Such analyses have been used to develop real-time measures of economic and cryptocurrency pricing and policy uncertainty8,9. Central banks also scrape product-price information from the Internet to give real-time inflation measures (see go.nature.com/4ll5cew).\n\nYet, like conventional risk models, these big-data tools are subject to the ‘garbage in, garbage out’ problem. They depend on human inputs and can add yet more uncertainty, rather than measure it.\n\nFinance experts need to think more radically.\n\nThree pricing tools\n\nTransforming uncertainty into something that can be managed requires building a financial architecture that explicitly prices, transfers and rewards adaptive capacity — the ability to thrive under the challenges of uncertainty — rather than merely dealing with known risks.\n\nThe approach we propose rests on three pillars: instruments in which prices and pay-offs vary with real-time uncertainty; markets that monetize resilience; and governance frameworks that ensure integrity and liquidity (ease of transferring an asset to cash). Here we sketch potential features of some assets that might be developed.\n\nUncertainty bonds. Many organizations issue debt (essentially a loan) with an interest rate that varies relative to a benchmark, such as another interest rate, inflation or profitability. We propose that uncertainty bonds fix their payout on the basis of an independently governed and calculated uncertainty index.\n\nThe index would need to capture elements such as policy volatility, market sentiment swings and supply-chain disruption signals. It must have strict safeguards, including governance by independent regulators, regular data audits and transparent methodologies to prevent financial gaming.\n\nWhen uncertainty (economic, trade or geopolitical, for example) is deemed high, companies would be able to withhold part of the payments they have promised, to ease financial strain. They would also have more money at hand to deal with issues arising during spikes in uncertainty.\n\nInvestors (banks, insurers or private individuals) would earn a premium for bearing the ambiguity; they would put their money at risk by loaning it to companies, with the payout dependent on the level of global uncertainty.\n\nHow to navigate uncertainty in an unpredictable world\n\nAlthough this arrangement would not eliminate uncertainty, it would transform it into risk: a quantifiable situation in which companies insure themselves by getting a financial reward if a specific negative event occurs.\n\nThink of it like insuring a home against fire damage: the fire is a spike in global uncertainty, the bond-issuing company is the owner of the house and the investor is the insurance company that insures the house. If there is no fire, the owner of the house pays an insurance premium to the insurance company for peace of mind. If, however, a fire burns down the house, the owner of the house delegates the financial burden of reconstruction to the insurance company, so that the owner doesn’t go bankrupt on top of losing their house.",

          "abstract": "Theoretical models have been developed to understand how social class influences individual thoughts, feelings and behaviours. However, the validity of these models is threatened by the prevailing use of small, non-diverse samples and flexible measurement practices. We preregistered replications of 35 key hypotheses from 17 correlational and 5 experimental studies, and collected large, quota-based or probability samples from the USA, France, Switzerland and India ( N total = 33,536). Our analysis yielded three central findings: (1) ~50% of the effects were successfully replicated; (2) conclusions were consistent across different operationalizations of social class, although objective indicators yielded smaller estimates (for example, income and education); and (3) half of the effects were moderated—mostly strengthened—by social class identification, system-justification beliefs or local income inequality. Overall, hypotheses based on differences between social class contexts in terms of constraints, uncertainty and status were well supported. However, hypotheses based on models positing social class differences in psychological orientations towards ‘the self’ versus ‘others and the environment’ received less support. We conclude that these models need to be reassessed as individuals from higher social classes seem more oriented towards both themselves and others.

          "abstract": "Predicting human decisions under risk and uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge across disciplines. Existing models often struggle even in highly stylized tasks like choice between lotteries. Here we introduce BEAST gradient boosting (BEAST-GB), a hybrid model integrating behavioural theory (BEAST) with machine learning. We first present CPC18, a competition for predicting risky choice, in which BEAST-GB won. Then, using two large datasets, we demonstrate that BEAST-GB predicts more accurately than neural networks trained on extensive data and dozens of existing behavioural models. BEAST-GB also generalizes robustly across unseen experimental contexts, surpassing direct empirical generalization, and helps to refine and improve the behavioural theory itself. Our analyses highlight the potential of anchoring predictions on behavioural theory even in data-rich settings and even when the theory alone falters. Our results underscore how integrating machine learning with theoretical frameworks, especially those—like BEAST—designed for prediction, can improve our ability to predict and understand human behaviour.",

Here we study how an organization-wide 4-day workweek intervention—with no reduction in pay—affects workers’ well-being. Organizations undergo pre-trial work reorganization to improve efficiency and collaboration, followed by a 6-month trial. Analysis of pre- and post-trial data from 2,896 employees across 141 organizations in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the USA shows improvements in burnout, job satisfaction, mental health and physical health—a pattern not observed in 12 control companies. Both company-level and individual-level reductions in hours are correlated with well-being gains, with larger individual-level (but not company-level) reductions associated with greater improvements in well-being. Three key factors mediate the relationship: improved self-reported work ability, reduced sleep problems and decreased fatigue. The results indicate that income-preserving 4-day workweeks are an effective organizational intervention for enhancing workers’ well-being.",

          "abstract": "The occupational specialization of social groups is closely tied to gender, racial and class identities, segmenting the labour market into perceived White/Black and male/female roles and skill sets. Using data from 100 million formal workers in Brazil (2003–2019), we examine patterns of occupational segmentation across 426 occupations, identifying distinct skill demands and socio-economic statuses linked to race/skin colour and gender. Classifications of ‘male’ or ‘female’ occupations are shaped by required skills, whereas distinctions between ‘White’ and ‘Black’ occupations reflect socio-economic status and historical inequalities. Women and men are segmented by gender-associated skill sets, such as engineering versus caregiving skills. Within these skill sets, strong hierarchical segregation persists, with Black individuals disproportionately concentrated in positions of lower socio-economic status. Despite recent socio-economic changes, occupational specialization patterns have remained stable. Our findings highlight that the strong association between race and lower-status occupations must be addressed for a more inclusive society.",

Here we used high-density direct cortical recordings while 14 participants spoke utterances with varying phonemic and syllabic sequence complexity after reading a target sequence and a delay period. Phasic activations corresponding to speech production and auditory feedback were observed, but also sustained neural activity that persisted throughout all task phases including the target presentation, the delay period and production of the sequence. Furthermore, sustained activity in a specific area, the middle precentral gyrus (mPrCG), was both modulated by sequence complexity and predicted reaction time, suggesting a role in speech-motor sequencing. Electrocortical stimulation of the mPrCG caused speech disfluencies resembling those seen in apraxia of speech. These results suggest that speech-motor sequencing is mediated by a distributed cortical network in which the mPrCG plays a central role.",

Human brain regions develop at different rates, with many regions developing into the third and fourth decades of life. Here, in this preregistered study (https://osf.io/gsru7), we analysed intracranial electroencephalography recordings from widespread brain regions in a large developmental cohort. Using task-based (that is, attention to to-be-remembered visual stimuli) and task-free (resting-state) data from 101 children and adults (5.93–54.00 years, 63 males; n electrodes = 5,691), we mapped aperiodic (1/ƒ-like) activity, a proxy of neural noise, where steeper slopes indicate less noise and flatter slopes indicate more noise. We reveal that aperiodic slopes flatten with age into young adulthood in both association and sensorimotor cortices, challenging models of early sensorimotor development based on brain structure. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), attentional state modulated age effects, revealing steeper task-based than task-free slopes in adults and the opposite in children, consistent with the development of cognitive control. Age-related differences in task-based slopes also explained age-related gains in memory performance, linking the development of PFC cognitive control to the development of memory. Last, with additional structural imaging measures, we reveal that age-related differences in grey matter volume are similarly associated with aperiodic slopes in association and sensorimotor cortices. Our findings establish developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity in localized brain regions and illuminate the development of PFC control during adolescence in the development of attention and memory.",

The state-of-the-art PM stains are bright, specific, fluorogenic, and compatible with superresolution imaging. However, when recording membrane dynamics using advanced fluorescence microscopes, PM is prone to photodynamic damage introduced by dyes due to its phospholipid bilayer nature. Here, we introduce PK Mem dyes tailored for time-lapse fluorescence imaging. By integrating triplet-state quenchers into the MemBright dyes featuring cyanine chromophores and amphiphilic zwitterion anchors, PK Mem dyes exhibited a three-fold reduction in phototoxicity and a more than four-fold improvement in photostability in imaging experiments compared to MemBright prototypes. These dyes enable 2D and 3D imaging of live or fixed cancer cell lines and a wide range of primary cells, at the same time pair well with various fluorescent markers. PK Mem dyes can be applied to neuronal imaging in brain slices and in vivo two-photon imaging. The gentle nature of PK Mem palette enables ultralong-term recording of cell migration, cardiomyocyte beating, spermiogenesis, and axonal growth cone dynamics, which are prohibitively challenging using traditional PM dyes. Notably, PK Mem dyes are optically compatible with STED/SIM imaging, which can handily upgrade the routine of time-lapse neuronal imaging, such as growth cone tracking and mitochondrial transportations, into nanoscopic resolutions.",

          "abstract": "Impairment of mitochondrial protein stability is associated with neurodegeneration in Huntington’s disease (HD). However, the E3 ligase responsible for maintaining mitochondrial protein homeostasis in HD remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that NEDD4L protein levels are elevated in human striatal organoids (hSOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of patients as well as in a mouse model of HD. Overexpression of NEDD4L leads to degeneration and cell death of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), along with a reduction in motor activities. Conversely, deletion of NEDD4L restores abnormal MSN morphology, corrects deficits in calcium signaling, alleviates neurodegeneration in HD-hSOs, and improves motor dysfunction observed in YAC128 mice. Mechanistically, NEDD4L disrupts mitochondrial function by binding to lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase 2 (LIPT2) and promoting its degradation through ubiquitination and lysosomal pathways. This process impairs lipoic acid biosynthesis and the lipoylation of E2 subunits of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH E2). Furthermore, either overexpressing LIPT2 or administering lipoic acid mitigates neurodegeneration and rectifies deficits in motor coordination activity. These findings unveil a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of lipoic acid metabolism and underscore the potential therapeutic role of protein lipoylation in the treatment of HD.",

The parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis infects an estimated 600 million people worldwide and is one of the soil-transmitted helminthiases, a WHO-defined neglected tropical disease. It has long been suggested that human S. stercoralis infection may be a zoonosis from dogs. We investigated this by whole genome sequence analysis of S. stercoralis from sympatric human and dog populations in Asia. We find that human- and dog-derived S. stercoralis have genetically distinct nuclear genomes, but we also find evidence of rare cross-infection. Analysis of the S. stercoralis mitochondrial genome reveals evidence of historical introgression between human- and dog-derived parasites. Based on these data, we suggest that S. stercoralis was originally a parasite of canids, that began to infect humans when people domesticated dogs, since when human- and dog-derived parasites have differentiated, but have not become separate species.",

          "abstract": "Cellular DNA is wrapped about an octamer composed of four histone proteins forming the fundamental unit of chromatin structure, the nucleosome core particle (NCP). The intrinsically disordered tails of the histones serve as scaffolds for binding an array of proteins that regulate the fidelity of the genome and gene expression. A variety of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on the tails have been characterized, including some that alter their overall charge; however, per-residue changes in tail electrostatic potentials for different PTMs have not been reported. Here, using a solution NMR approach in which enhancements of transverse relaxation rates of tail amide and methyl group protons are quantified through the addition of paramagnetic cosolutes, we examine how acetylation and PARylation modulate histone tail electrostatic potentials. Notably, even though both PTMs decrease the net positive charge carried by each tail, their electrostatic potentials either increase or decrease in a tail-specific manner relative to an unmodified NCP. A simple model of tail–DNA interactions is presented to explain these results.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the drivers of spatial patterns in fossil communities is fundamental to paleoecology, yet direct evidence for biological mechanisms regulating interindividual spacing remains elusive. Brachiopod setae, hypothesized to function in feeding or defense, are exceedingly rare in the fossil record, especially among post-Cambrian taxa. Here, we present the report of exquisitely preserved setae from an exceptional in situ fossil assemblage of the early Silurian rhynchonelliform brachiopod Nucleospira calypta . Multiproxy analyses (scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and microcomputed tomography) revealed intricate ultrastructural details and diverse taphonomic pathways, leading to a reinterpretation of apparent calcitic preservation as primarily iron oxides with subsequent coating. Critically, the undisturbed nature of this aggregation allowed rigorous spatial point pattern analysis (Nearest-Neighbor Analysis, Thiessen polygons). This revealed a statistically significant, nonrandom, checkerboard-like distribution among individuals within the studied fossil deposit, indicative of active spacing regulation. Strikingly, the measured average interindividual spacing quantitatively relates to the length of the preserved setae. This provides the direct paleontological evidence demonstrating that these subtle morphological structures could have actively mediated spatial organization within a dense benthic community. Our findings illustrate a biological mechanism capable of shaping community structure, operating beyond passive environmental constraints or initial larval settlement preferences, and highlight the potential for subtle anatomical features to exert significant ecological influence in deep time.",

          "abstract": "The retinal photoreceptors possess specialized sensory cilia critical for phototransduction while the nonphotoreceptor cells typically exhibit simpler primary cilia or lack them altogether. This dichotomy in ciliary architecture underpins the functional specialization of retinal cell types, but how this dichotomy arises and is maintained remains elusive. This study explores the role of the transcription factor Foxn3 in establishing and maintaining this divergence. We generated retina-specific Foxn3 conditional knockout (Foxn3CKO) mice, which show that Foxn3 is essential for repressing ciliary gene expression in nonphotoreceptor cells, such as bipolar and amacrine cells. Foxn3CKO mice exhibit significant reductions in electroretinogram b-wave amplitudes and oscillatory potentials, indicating functional impairments in inner retinal neurons. Loss of Foxn3 leads to ectopic ciliary gene expression and abnormal ciliogenesis in nonphotoreceptor neurons, without affecting retinal cell specification and differentiation. Single-Cell RNA Sequencing, chromatin profiling, and transcription assays reveal that Foxn3 directly binds to and represses the promoters of ciliary genes and their transactivators, including Foxj1 and Rfx family members. Our data together highlight Foxn3 as a key transcriptional repressor that may function to ensure the proper ciliary architecture of retinal neurons by preventing nonphotoreceptor neurons from adopting photoreceptor-like ciliary features and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms governing retinal development and ciliopathies.",

          "abstract": "Most breast cancers depend on hormone-stimulated estrogen receptor alpha (ER) activity and are sensitive to ER inhibition. Resistance can arise from activating mutations in the gene encoding ER ( ESR1 ) or from reactivation of downstream targets. Newer ER antagonists occasionally show efficacy but are largely ineffective as single agents in the long term. Here, we show that ER translation is eIF4E/cap-independent yet sensitive to inhibitors of the translation initiation factor eIF4A. EIF4A inhibition reduces the expression of ER and cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1. This leads to growth suppression in ligand-independent breast cancer models, including those driven by ER mutants and fusion proteins. Efficacy is enhanced by adding the ER degrader, fulvestrant. The combination further lowers ER expression and blocks tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In an early clinical trial (NCT04092673), the eIF4A inhibitor zotatifin was combined with either fulvestrant or fulvestrant plus CDK4 inhibitor, abemaciclib, in patients with acquired resistance to these agents. Multiple clinical responses including a handful of durable regressions were observed, with little toxicity. Thus, eIF4A inhibition could be useful for treating ER+ breast cancer resistant to other modalities.",

          "abstract": "Prion diseases can manifest with distinct phenotypes in a single species, a phenomenon known as prion strains. Upon cross-species transmission, alterations in the disease phenotype can occur, interpreted as the emergence of a new strain. Two main and non–mutually exclusive evolutionary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon: the “conformational shift” or “deformed templating” and the “conformational selection.” The conformational shift hypothesis proposes that the introduction of a new host prion protein (PrP C ) forces a change in the conformation of the pathological prion protein (PrP Sc ), causing the new prion strain emergence. On the contrary, the conformational selection model postulates that prion isolates are a conglomerate of PrP Sc conformations with relative distribution frequencies, wherein the species barrier acts as a filter selecting the one fittest for the new species environment. Previous studies reported the emergence of the classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent (c-BSE) upon transmission of Nor98/atypical scrapie (AS) onto a bovine PrP. This study investigates the evolutionary dichotomy of this c-BSE emergence by using prion strain thermostability combined with protein misfolding cyclic amplification to distinguish between both strains. Our results suggest that the conformational shift could be the principal mechanism responsible for the c-BSE emergence. Furthermore, the selection model was dismissed as the key mechanism based on the analysis of an artificial c-BSE and AS mixture. The ability of the AS conformers to shift conformation to a c-BSE one supports the hypothesis that the epidemic c-BSE prion may have originated from the transmission of AS in cattle.",

          "abstract": "Forests are potential carbon (C) sinks that partially offset anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions via enhanced C assimilation and productivity. However, the question remains whether mature trees will express sufficient plasticity in nutrient acquisition strategies to support enhanced growth under elevated CO 2 (eCO 2 ). Trees may sustain growth by investing C belowground to enhance nutrient acquisition, e.g., by increasing root absorptive surfaces for greater soil available resource exploration (a “do-it-yourself” strategy) or utilizing C exudation or mycorrhizal associations as priming mechanisms for nutrient acquisition (“outsourcing”). We show that 4 y of eCO 2 (+140 ± 38 ppm; i.e., +35% above ambient) altered the relative belowground C investment strategies of mature oak ( Quercus robur L.) in a 180-y-old temperate forest. Fine-root branching frequency increased 73% under eCO 2 . Specific root C exudation was enhanced under eCO 2 (63%), particularly outside the peak growing season, and the exudate C to nitrogen (N) ratio was increased (28%). Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) biomass production increased during leaf fall (17%) while ECM turnover increased almost fourfold under eCO 2 . The exudate and root metabolome composition were considerably altered during the late growing season under eCO 2 . We find, therefore, that a broad suite of nutrient acquisition strategies are upregulated under eCO 2 , with dynamic shifting between different outsourcing and do-it-yourself elements at different times of the year. These belowground changes support the increase in net primary productivity observed in this forest, with implications for the role of mature temperate forests in the global carbon sink.",

          "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten many wildlife populations, yet the impacts of pathogens vary considerably both within and among host species. The environmental tolerance mismatch hypothesis (ETMH) suggests that this variability stems in part from differences in the relative performance of hosts and pathogens under varying environmental conditions. According to the ETMH, pathogen impacts should be more severe in environments where pathogen performance is high and host performance is low, and vice versa. However, testing the ETMH with field data is challenging due to the difficulty of measuring host and pathogen performance among locations and quantifying performance mismatches. Here, we demonstrate that a measure of thermal mismatch, based on species realized thermal niches derived from species occurrence data, can reliably predict variation in the prevalence of the amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd—chytrid fungus) within and among 42 frog host species in Australia. Specifically, we show that 1) within species, more warm-adapted host species show a steeper decline in Bd prevalence with increasing mean annual temperature, potentially reflecting greater host advantage at warmer temperatures; and 2) among host species, mean pathogen prevalence declines as the thermal affinity of hosts diverges from that of the pathogen. Our findings strongly support the ETMH and, importantly, offer a promising approach to predicting pathogen outcomes both spatially and temporally using species occurrence data. This approach enhances our understanding of variability in pathogen impacts and could inform management actions to mitigate these effects.",

          "abstract": "Biota could be ecosystem engineers in generating an intrinsic heterogeneous landscape through scale-dependent feedbacks. Thereby, they can form resource-enriched patchiness or islands of fertility, comprising self-organizing spatial patterns. Research so far has largely focused on the self-organized spatial patterns of plant communities in drylands. It, however, remains unclear whether and how biocrusts having distinct morphology and life history from plant communities could self-organize themselves and form unique spatial patterns. Here, we conducted field observations of biocrusts across successional stages and employed a probabilistic cellular automaton model to investigate the distinct self-organized spatial patterns exhibited by mosaic patches of mosses and lichens with different patch size distributions (PSDs). Our study demonstrates that short-range positive feedbacks initially promote the development of patches, featured with a heavy-tailed PSD, while long-range negative feedbacks subsequently curtail further expansion of big patches, thereby establishing a characteristic patch scale with regular PSDs. Strikingly, only lichens reverted back to the heavy-tailed PSD in the late succession stage, presumably implying self-organized critical fragmentation of lichen patches. Field measurements of biocrust performance at the center and edge of patches of varying sizes along succession stages further support the classic scale-dependent feedback mechanism for Turing pattern formation. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate the capability of the biocrust communities to self-organize themselves to form distinct spatial patterns governed by the spatial and temporal scale–dependent feedbacks, potentially impacting dryland ecosystem functions and resilience.",

Multiple mechanisms including biochemical signaling pathways and biophysical forces help drive these morphology changes, but it has been difficult to tease apart their contributions, especially from tissue-scale dynamic forces that are typically ignored. We use a combination of mathematical models and in vivo experiments to study a simple organ in the zebrafish embryo called Kupffer’s vesicle (KV). Modeling indicates that dynamic forces generated by tissue movements in the embryo produce shape changes in KV that are observed during development. Laser ablations in the zebrafish embryo that alter these forces result in altered organ shapes matching model predictions.

How does the brain represent idiosyncratic differences in episodic future thinking that are modulated by optimism? In two functional MRI (fMRI) studies, participants were scanned during an episodic future thinking task in which they were presented with a series of episodic scenarios with different emotional valence and prompted to imagine themself (or their partner) in the situation. Intersubject representational similarity analysis revealed that more optimistic individuals had similar neural representations in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), while less optimistic individuals exhibited more idiosyncratic neural representations in the MPFC. Additionally, individual difference multidimensional scaling of MPFC activity revealed that the referential target and emotional valence of imagined events were clearly mapped onto different dimensions. Notably, the weights along the emotional dimension were closely linked to the optimism scores of participants, suggesting that optimistic individuals imagine positive events as more distinct from negative events. These results suggest that shared neural processing of the MPFC among optimistic individuals supports episodic future thinking that facilitates psychological differentiation between positive and negative future events.",

          "abstract": "The link between form and function of an organism’s morphology is usually apparent or intuitive. However, some clades of organisms show remarkable diversity in their form, often exhibiting extreme morphologies, but with no obvious functional explanation. Treehoppers (Membracidae) are a family of insects that exemplify this, displaying an astounding morphological diversity, resulting in a plethora of extreme forms. The function of these morphological extremities and the reasons for their evolution have thus far remained largely enigmatic. However, this mystery can be considered in light of the capacity of many animals to detect electric fields in air via electrostatic actuation of mechanosensory structures on their body. Importantly, the strength of the electric field experienced by these mechanosensory structures is expected by physics to depend on the animal’s geometry, with sharp and elongated features producing the highest electric fields. Therefore, we hypothesize that the extreme morphologies of treehoppers increase their electrical sensitivity. Here, we show that treehoppers, along with their predators and mutualists, produce electric fields and that the treehopper Poppea capricornis can detect electric fields, responding behaviorally. We also demonstrate that predatory wasps and mutualist bees differ significantly in their electrostatic profiles, pointing to the sophistication of electrical information potentially available to treehoppers. Biophysical, computational, and mathematical techniques are then utilized to provide evidence that the pronotum of treehoppers is the site of electroreception and that its extreme shapes may enhance its sensitivity to electricity.",

Much less is known about the extent to which these novel crops were consumed and incorporated into everyday culinary practices. In Japan, agriculturalists moving from Korea would have encountered large, sedentary Final Jomon populations who had well-established hunting, foraging, and cultivation strategies for exploiting indigenous fauna and flora. The degree to which these encounters hindered or enhanced the emergence of agriculture is a key question. To investigate potential changes in food exploitation, we analyzed the contents of pottery through lipid residue analysis of 260 vessels from Bronze Age (Mumun) Korea and contemporary Jomon and Yayoi pottery from Northern Kyushu. A lipid biomarker for broomcorn millet was only found in samples from Korea, suggesting that this crop was not routinely prepared in early agricultural pottery from Japan, despite some botanical evidence for its cultivation. Instead, aquatic products continued to be used in early agricultural pottery, pointing to continuity from the Jomon period despite the arrival of new “continental” ceramic forms. Rice remains difficult to identify conclusively, but by modeling carbon isotope values, we were able to determine the maximum extent that rice may have contributed. Overall, we show that there was a change in culinary practices as agriculture dispersed from Korea to Japan, most likely influenced by different long-standing traditions of preparing and cooking foods in each locality.",

          "abstract": "Theories of adaptive radiation propose predictable trajectories in which diversity accumulates rapidly in newly formed or colonized environments with underexploited niche space and few competing species, before slowing down as competition intensifies, and speciation and extinction rates approach equilibrium. This historical perspective on diversity may be more important than current environmental variation for explaining today’s biodiversity, but this has been difficult to determine because of the complexity of diversification dynamics and the challenges of relating diversification processes to past environmental change. Here we unravel the complex and heterogenous diversification dynamics of Proteaceae (subfamily Grevilleoideae), a large Gondwanan plant clade, to investigate how the expansion and contraction of biomes since the Cretaceous has shaped its current megadiversity across the Sahul region (Australia and New Guinea). We modeled paleobiome dynamics over a 120 Ma period and produced a nuclear phylogenomic dataset of 458 loci for ~700 species (~74%) to show that historical diversification rates across the Grevilleoideae phylogeny are closely associated with ecological opportunity provided by emerging and expanding biomes. Diversification is rapid in emerging and expanding biomes, while long-occupied biomes tend to have higher species richness but lower diversification rates, as expected if these biomes have approached equilibrium diversity. Our results reveal a strong and heterogeneous legacy of climatic and geological history on today’s floristic diversity and explain why diversity is often decoupled from expectations based on measures of ecological “carrying capacity” such as the area or climate of present-day biomes.",

          "abstract": "The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel is expressed in primary nociceptive afferents, which participate in processes such as pain and inflammation. Considerable efforts have been directed toward finding inhibitors of TRPV1 and understanding the molecular details of their interactions with this channel. α-humulene (AH) is a sesquiterpene derived from plants such as hops and other members of Cannabaceae family, with a long history of popular use as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory. Using a combination of behavioral assays, electrophysiology, site-directed mutagenesis, cryo-EM, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that AH inhibits TRPV1-related pain responses and currents by interacting with a region composed of the S2, S2-S3 linker, and S3 transmembrane segments and stabilizing the closed conformation of the channel. The interaction of ligands in this region of the TRPV1 channel has not been previously described and the results of the present study highlight that it may constitute part of a negative regulatory region. These findings allow us to understand the molecular basis by which substances such as some sesquiterpenes, abundantly found in medicinal plants used by humans for hundreds of years, reduce pain. Pain management can include the use of opioids, which results in hepatic and renal damage and possible addiction. Our study offers insight into a poorly understood group of compounds that could be used as scaffold to produce novel nonopioid analgesic therapies and clarifies the molecular mechanisms that underlie the effects of these analgesic molecules.",

Using electroencephalography (EEG), we characterized the brain’s response to critical in-game events, focusing on the response magnitude and adaptation. Data from a large participant cohort (n = 140 for game tasks, n = 200 for nongame tasks) revealed a clear, definite, and consistent temporospatial structure of brain response patterns triggered by critical in-game events. Most notably, this response displayed unusually large magnitudes and a lack of adaptation over repeated exposures—markedly different from the observed neural responses to typical events in lab-based tasks (e.g., regarding novelty, unexpected events or errors). The identification of this distinctive response component in gaming contexts may inspire further research into fundamental cognitive systems, such as motivation, reward, emotional engagement, and their dynamic interplay in gaming environments.",

Here, we characterize a group of excitatory reticular interneurons located in the supratrigeminal area that express the homeodomain transcription factor Phox2b . This nucleus—Sup5 Phox2b —is premotor to both jaw-closing and jaw-opening motoneurons and receives direct input from cranial sensory afferents, motor cortex, and satiation related nuclei. Its activity differentially tracks lapping, biting, and chewing movements, suggesting its involvement in the elaboration of distinct orofacial motor patterns in vivo. Acute global activation or inhibition of Sup5 Phox2b by optogenetics interrupt volitional feeding sequences.

Here, we report the growth of spontaneously bent and twisted ammonium urate crystals induced by the keto–enol tautomerism of the urate molecule. The major tautomer is native to biogenic crystals, whereas the minor tautomer functions as an effective crystal growth modifier to induce naturally bent and twisted ammonium urate crystals. We show that the degree of curvature can be tailored based on the judicious selection of growth conditions. A combination of state-of-the-art microscopy and spectroscopy techniques are used to characterize the origin of bending. Spatially resolved nano-electron diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy of naturally bent crystals show nearly single crystallinity with local lattice deformations generated by a combination of screw and edge dislocations. These observations are consistent with photoinduced force microscopy and contact resonance atomic force microscopy, which confirmed spatially resolved changes in the intermolecular interactions and the mechanical properties throughout the cross-sectional and axial regions of bent crystals. A mechanism of bending involving the generation of regionally specific dislocations is proposed as an alternative to more commonly reported models. These findings highlight a unique characteristic of tautomeric crystals that may have broader implications for other biogenic materials.",

Within these communities, polymer degraders facilitate the growth of nondegraders by breaking down polymers through extracellular enzymes. However, the contributions of nondegraders to community dynamics, as well as the mechanisms that limit their access to degradation products, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate EMSD5, a lignocellulose-degrading microbial community that efficiently converts corncob into isopropanol. We demonstrate that nondegraders, such as Escherichia coli , enable the growth of degraders (e.g., Lachnoclostridium sp. and Clostridium beijerinckii ) by creating anaerobic conditions and supplying biotin. Within such expanded niches, lignocellulose degradation proceeds sequentially, and the availability of breakdown products to E . coli is constrained by two interlinked processes. Specifically, Lachnoclostridium sp. produces oligosaccharides that are largely inaccessible to E . coli . A subset of these oligosaccharides is utilized by C . beijerinckii to produce monosaccharides that support E . coli growth, while glycosidase secretion by C . beijerinckii is reduced under coculture conditions. Building on these findings, we designed a synthetic consortium by coculturing C. beijerinckii with an engineered E . coli strain that expresses xylanase genes from an unculturable Lachnoclostridium . This consortium achieved isopropanol production from hemicellulose without requiring anaerobic conditions. Our findings reveal the niche-expanding role of nondegraders and the processes that constrain their access to degradation products, offering insights into maintaining stable cooperation in biopolymer-degrading communities and designing efficient consortia for biopolymer conversion.",

          "abstract": "Climate-driven variation in traits is crucial for predicting ecological responses to environmental change, yet global patterns and drivers of microbial trait variation remain poorly understood. Using global datasets of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal observations linked to spore morphological traits, we show that climate shapes spore trait variation and functional diversity. Larger spore volumes were more prevalent in warm, wet climates but were associated with smaller species range sizes, suggesting a trade-off between persistence and dispersal potential. Similarly, ornamented spores were more common in warm, wet climates and were associated with narrower range sizes. Cell wall investment (i.e., wall thickness relative to volume) decreased in warmer, wetter climates compared to cooler, drier ones and was the strongest predictor of species range size, with intermediate investment associated with larger geographic distributions. Spore shape and color (i.e., melanin pigmentation) also exhibited climate-driven patterns, with spherical spores and greater pigmentation more common in warm, wet climates. Phylogenetic analyses revealed high conservatism for spore ornamentation, moderate for volume, low for color, and none for shape and cell wall investment. Additionally, functional diversity analyses showed that warm, wet climates promote higher within-community trait richness but lower trait divergence, while broader climatic variability drives higher beta diversity. These findings support growing evidence that trait–environment relationships extend to microbial communities, reflecting ecological principles such as environmental filtering, evolutionary constraint, and dispersal–persistence trade-offs. Incorporating microbial traits improves predictions of biogeographic shifts and their cascading effects on plant–microbe interactions and ecosystem stability under climate change.",

Rodent models of Angelman syndrome do not fully recapitulate all the symptoms associated with the condition and are limited as a preclinical model for therapeutic development. Here, we show that pigs ( Sus scrofa ) with a maternally inherited deletion of UBE3A ( UBE3A -/+ ) have altered postnatal behaviors, impaired vocalizations, reduced brain growth, motor incoordination, and ataxia. Neonatal UBE3A -/+ pigs exhibited several symptoms observed in infants with Angelman syndrome, including hypotonia, suckling deficits, and failure to thrive.

According to predictive coding, optimal learning, which maximizes epistemic value, depends on balancing predictability and uncertainty, implying that musical pleasure should also reflect this equilibrium. We tested this idea in two independent large samples using a novel decision-making paradigm, where participants indicated preferences for melodies varying in surprise and entropy. Consistent with prior research, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between predictability and preference. Moreover, our results revealed an interaction between predictability and entropy, with smaller surprises preferred in low-entropy melodies and larger surprises favored in high-entropy music, consistent with predictive coding principles. Computational models incorporating this interaction predicted individuals’ genre preferences and pleasure responses to real compositions, highlighting its applicability to real-world music experiences.

Here, we show how to upgrade a class of self-propelled particles into electronically integrated microrobots, reaping the best of both platforms in a single design. Inspired by electrokinetic micromotors, these robots generate electric fields in a surrounding fluid, and by extension propulsive electrokinetic flows. The underlying physics is captured by a model in which robot speed is proportional to applied current, making design and control straightforward. As proof, we build basic robots at the 100-micron scale that use rudimentary, on-board photovoltaic circuits and a closed-loop optical control scheme to navigate waypoints and move in coordinated swarms at speeds of up to one body length per second. Broadly, the unification of micromotor propulsion with on-robot electronics invites future work to realize robust, fast, easy to manufacture, electronically programmable microrobots that remain operationally viable for months to years.",

With the assistance of hyaluronidase and preternatural oxidative stress within tumor cells, SWITCH undergoes enzyme-responsive disassembly, charge reversal, rapid lysosomal escape, and efficient disruption of PD-L1 and PCSK9 orderly. This dual-action mechanism simultaneously blocks PD-1/PD-L1 immunosuppression while restoring MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation, resulting in enhanced the susceptibility and visibility of tumors to the immune system.

          "abstract": "Characterizing the morphology of lithium (Li) is crucial for developing long-lasting lithium metal batteries. It is well established that more uniform Li deposition correlates with better cell performance. Li morphology is often characterized through qualitative analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images; however, there are no widely accepted metrics to quantitatively describe deposition uniformity. Here, we propose a framework to quantify uniformity through SEM image analysis via the index of dispersion ( ID ) metric, which is defined and presented in the context of Li metal batteries. We also explore experimental impacts of sampling protocols on ID measurements. Our results demonstrate that the ID metric is highly sensitive to variations in deposition uniformity, including the coexistence and uniformity of multiple morphologies, uniformity within a single morphology, and particle size distribution uniformity. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that uniformity, as measured by the ID , can be related to the average potential of Li||Li symmetric cells over cycling. Higher capacity cycling leads to more pronounced changes in both ID and average cell potential. Local minima/maxima are found consistently in both ID and average cell potential immediately before cells short-circuit, which we suggest may indicate a collapse of the microstructure prior to failure. We put forward this framework as a more robust approach to quantify Li deposition uniformity, advancing the development of Li metal batteries that are safer and longer lasting.",

          "abstract": "The self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins into biomolecular condensates depends on their primary sequence, leading to sequence-dependent phase separation. Computational methods to study this behavior often rely on residue-level interaction potentials that estimate the propensity of amino acids to partition between the dilute and dense phases. While distribution coefficients would provide the most direct measure of these potentials, their unavailability has led to the use of proxies, most notably, hydropathy. However, recent studies have highlighted limitations in hydropathy-based models. Here, we address this fundamental gap by calculating the transfer free energies for amino acid side chain analogs moving from the dilute phase to the dense phase of biomolecular condensates. We find that, net transfer free energies arise from a balance between favorable protein-mediated and unfavorable water-mediated interactions, with a striking asymmetry between the contributions of positive and negatively charged residues. This asymmetry originates from the stronger solvation of negatively charged species, and extends to modified amino acids. We further demonstrate that the sequence features of the condensate-forming protein modulate these transfer free energies in a context-dependent, but qualitatively similar manner. These findings help explain nontrivial experimental trends and provide a foundation for interpreting the sequence-dependent driving forces underlying condensate formation.",

          "abstract": "Light eyes, hair, and skins probably evolved several times as Homo sapiens dispersed from Africa. In areas with lower UV radiation, light pigmentation alleles increased in frequency because of their adaptive advantage and of other contingent factors such as migration and drift. However, the tempo and mode of their spread is not known. Phenotypic inference from ancient DNA is complicated, both because these traits are polygenic and because of low sequence depth. We evaluated the effects of the latter by randomly removing reads in three high-coverage ancient samples, the Paleolithic Ust’-Ishim from Russia, the Mesolithic SF12 from Sweden, and the Neolithic I5077 from current Croatia. We could thus compare three approaches to pigmentation inference, concluding that for suboptimal levels of coverage (&lt;8×), a probabilistic method estimating genotype likelihoods leads to the most robust predictions. We then applied that protocol to 348 ancient genomes from Eurasia, describing how skin, eye, and hair color evolved over the past 45,000 y. The shift toward lighter pigmentations turned out to be all but linear in time and place, and slower than expected, with half of the individuals showing dark or intermediate skin colors well into the Bronze and Iron ages. We also observed a peak of light eye pigmentation in Mesolithic times, and an accelerated change during the spread of Neolithic farmers over Western Eurasia, although localized processes of gene flow and admixture, or lack thereof, also played a significant role.",

          "abstract": "To persist under unprecedented rates of global change, populations can adapt or acclimate. However, how these resilience mechanisms interact, particularly the role of epigenetic variation in long-term adaptation, is unknown. To address this gap, we experimentally evolved the foundational marine copepod Acartia tonsa for 25 generations under ocean acidification, warming, and their combination and then measured epigenomic, genomic, and transcriptomic responses. We observed clear and consistent epigenomic and genomic divergence between treatments, with epigenomic divergence concentrated in genes related to stress response and the regulation of transposable elements. However, epigenetic and genetic changes were inversely related and occurred in different regions of the genome; levels of genetic differentiation (F ST ) were up to 2.5× higher in regions where methylation did not differ between treatments compared to regions with significant methylation changes. This negative relationship between epigenetic and genetic divergence could be driven by local inhibition of one another or distinct functional targets of selection. Finally, epigenetic divergence was positively, though weakly, associated with gene expression divergence, suggesting that epigenetic changes may facilitate phenotypic change. Taken together, these results suggest that unique, complementary genetic and epigenetic mechanisms promote resilience to global change.",

Here, we show that forest disturbance due to fire is growing globally, with the most dramatic increases in intact forest landscapes, highlighting an existential threat to remaining high biomass, high biodiversity forests. The global annual area of forest disturbance due to fire for 2023 and 2024 was highest since the beginning of monitoring in 2001. Compared to 2002–2022 average annual forest disturbance due to fire, the 2023–2024 average was 2.2 times higher globally and 3 times higher in the Tropics. More than ¼ of all 2024 forest disturbance from fire occurred in tropical forests. We found a statistically significant increasing trend of forest disturbance due to fire from 2002 to 2024 in all climate domains except Subtropical. High forest, low deforestation tropical countries were not exempt, with Guyana and the Republic of the Congo experiencing record forest disturbance due to fire. Our results agree with recently estimated increases in global forest fire emissions and active fire detections. The unprecedented scale of fires in the world’s most remote forests is a potential harbinger of ecosystem tipping points. Protecting these remaining unfragmented high conservation value forests from this threat poses a daunting and as yet undeveloped policy and capacity challenge.",

Our analysis revealed extensive transcriptional alterations across retinal cell types with aging. HP experiments demonstrated that systemic factors from young mice rejuvenated aged retinas and alleviated senescent phenotypes, while aged blood accelerated aging in young mice. Integrative analysis pinpointed adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and the downstream adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway as central to the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal rejuvenation. Treatment with the AdipoR1 agonist AdipoRon reversed retinal aging. Mechanistically, AdipoR1-AMPK activation promoted mitochondrial function, contributing to the restoration of youthful cellular phenotypes.

In contrast, cytokine responses from in vitro stimulations appeared mainly shaped by environmental exposures. Regarding associations with atopy, greater abundance of both B cells and basophils were observed in atopic individuals as well as increased expression of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor.

We find that within a range of anchor stiffnesses around 1 micronewton per micrometer, the homeostatic tension in muscle is insensitive to stiffness, offering greater design flexibility. The proximity of motor neurons results in a fourfold improvement in muscle contractility. Improved contractility and nonlinear design allow for a peak swimming speed about two orders of magnitude higher than previous biohybrid flagellate swimmers, reaching 0.58 body lengths per minute (86.8 micrometers per second), by a mechanism involving inertia that we verify through flow field imaging.

This screen revealed a notable synthetic lethality when MYC inhibition was paired with disruption of mitochondrial complex I components, but not other complexes. Mechanistically, MYC inhibition reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, triggering a compensatory up-regulation of complex I genes. Consequently, genetic or pharmacological targeting of complex I sensitized tumors to MYCi975 treatment, leading to increased purine catabolism and infiltration of CD8 + T cells and macrophages into tumors. Additionally, a wide range of tumor cells with lower complex I expression showed increased MYC dependency.

We demonstrated that a Notch signaling center is required for the formation of this novelty and identified enhancers of the ligand Delta , which allowed us to track the evolutionary history of this signaling center. Unexpectedly, we found that the posterior lobe signaling center emerged from a preexisting role in genital disc eversion. We provide a likely mechanism by which Delta contributes to genital eversion through a network of apical extracellular matrix, which also became integrated into the posterior lobe program.

Overexpression of one such AP2/ERF , ISSUNBOSHI1 ( IBSH1 ; gene ID =  Pp3c1_32440 ), in P. patens phenocopied plants grown at 10 gravity, and the dominant repressor form of IBSH1 suppressed 10 gravity responses. These results provide evidence that the proliferation of AP2/ERF transcription factors and the establishment of a notable gene network may have been important in adaptation to the terrestrial environment during land plant evolution.",

          "abstract": "The demand for advanced human-machine interfaces (HMIs) highlights the need for accurate measurement of muscle contraction states. Traditional methods, such as electromyography, cannot measure passive muscle contraction states, while optical and ultrasonic techniques suffer from motion artifacts due to their rigid transducers. To overcome these limitations, we developed a flexible multichannel electrical impedance sensor (FMEIS) for noninvasive detection of skeletal muscle contractions. By applying an imperceptible current, the FMEIS can target multiple deep muscles by capturing electric-field ripples generated by their contractions. With an ultrathin profile (~220 micrometers), a low elastic modulus (212.8 kilopascals) closely matching human skin, and engineered adhesive sensor surfaces, the FMEIS conforms nicely to human skin with minimized motion artifacts. The FMEIS achieved high accuracy in both hand gesture recognition and muscle force prediction using machine learning models. With demonstrated performance across multiple HMI applications, including human-robot collaboration, exoskeleton control, and virtual surgery, FMEIS shows great potential for future real-time collaborative HMI systems.",

          "abstract": "Multidimensional optical data storage is a critically needed technology in the digital era. To overcome the low data writing rate in the conventional systems, we present a parallel five-dimensional optical data writing method by projecting arrays of depth-resolved voxels of different shapes via a digital micromirror device and temporally focusing a femtosecond laser amplifier. This is more efficient than the conventional approach that serially creates birefringent voxels in glass (e.g., nanogratings or oblate nanopores) via scanning an ultrafast laser while varying its polarizations. We demonstrated parallel writing of 16 by 16 birefringent voxels with eight different slow-axis azimuths by controlling the shapes of the projected light spots. Next, we demonstrated five-layer parallel data writing with 100% readout accuracy and a 1.5-terabyte storage capacity per disc. With a high repetition rate femtosecond laser amplifier (e.g., 100 kilohertz), our method may achieve a theoretical writing speed of 7.5 megabytes per second, paving the way for high-speed, high-capacity optical data storage.",

Using a proximity labeling approach, we found that osmotic stress promotes the association of WNK1 with the NRBP1 pseudokinase and TSC22D2/4 adaptor proteins, results that are confirmed by immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting studies. NRBP1 pseudokinase is closely related to WNK isoforms and contains a RΦ-motif–binding conserved C-terminal (CCT) domain, like the CCT domains in WNKs, SPAK, and OXSR1. Knockdown or knockout of NRBP1 markedly inhibited basal as well as sorbitol-induced activation of WNK1 and downstream components. We demonstrate that recombinant NRBP1 can directly induce the activation of WNK4 in vitro. AlphaFold-3 modeling predicts that WNK1, SPAK, NRBP1, and TSC22D4 form a complex, in which two TSC22D4 RΦ-motifs interact with the CCTL1 domain of WNK1 and the CCT domain of NRBP1. Our data indicate that NRBP1 and likely its close homolog NRBP2 function as an upstream activator of the WNK pathway.",

Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS, we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Last, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency.

Ti-mitoEVs that contain abundant functional mitochondria can be highly efficiently isolated from muscles via an optimized method. In vitro, Ti-mitoEV treatment increased mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced mitochondrial damage in recipient cells, and these effects occurred at least partly via mitochondrial genome transfer. In vivo, Ti-mitoEV treatment attenuated diverse types of tissue injury (e.g., muscle and kidney) by rescuing mitochondrial injury and its associated inflammation. As natural nanovesicles, the therapeutic potency of mitoEVs can be further improved by integrating them with other engineering methods. This study highlights the promising role of Ti-mitoEVs in boosting mitochondrial biogenesis, positioning them as potential therapies for treating various types of tissue injury characterized by mitochondrial damage.",

There was no evidence to support the other hypotheses, although the possibility of microbubble formation due to bubble aggregation/coalescence or swelling due to gas absorption in vivo could not be completely ruled out. Nanobubbles may offer advantages in terms of circulatory stability and potential for therapeutic delivery compared with microbubbles, but these advantages must be weighed against the need to use higher bubble concentrations, higher ultrasound frequencies, and/or higher intensities to achieve equivalent imaging and/or therapeutic effects.",

While enabling smaller feature sizes, EUV lithography imposes increasingly stringent requirements on the comprehensive performance and stochastic defect suppression of photoresist. The widely recognized strategy to minimize these defects is a material that integrates high EUV absorption and energy utilization into a homogeneous system based on molecular building blocks—the ideal formulation for EUV photoresist. However, achieving these integrated characteristics within a single molecule has remained an unresolved challenge. Here, we address all these requirements by polytelluoxane using an organic telluride monomer polymerized via Te─O bonds. This polymeric photoresist, operating through a main chain scission mechanism, demonstrates high-performance positive-tone lithography. Attributed to this ideal formulation, our photoresist achieves a comprehensive 18-nm line width at a dose of 13.1 mJ/cm 2 with a line edge roughness of 1.97 nm. We believe that this strategy establishes a framework for the design of next-generation EUV photoresists.",

This study reveals how host-responsive cathepsin B (CathB) proteins in the oral secretions of M. persicae facilitate aphid survival by modulating plant immune responses. Host-responsive CathB proteins localize to plant processing bodies (p-bodies), cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules involved in messenger RNA storage or decay. Upon localization, these CathB proteins recruit key immune regulators EDS1, PAD4, and ADR1 to these bodies, suppressing plant defenses. A plant protein, Acd28.9 (Hsp20 family), counteracts this CathB activity and contributes to plant resistance to aphids.

These designs enable the creation of three-dimensional structures with spatially varying mechanical properties, ranging from tissue-like compliance to rigid, bone-like load-bearing capabilities.

We establish a positive correlation between the density of BDs, macroscopic polarization, and strain response. The BDs in BNT-based thin films leads to a remarkable enhancement in the strain response, reaching ~400% of the virgin state. This enhancement arises from the lower energy barriers for dipole flipping and domain switching associated with BDs, in comparison to conventional domain structures. Under an applied electric field, the rotation of polarized BDs, combined with a reduction in dipole flux due to the articulated rotation between BDs and surrounding domains, further amplifies the strain response. These findings advance our understanding of BDs in electromechanical materials and provide theoretical guidance for designing high-performance piezoelectrics with polar topologies.",

          "abstract": "Incorporating expected uncertainty into reward evaluation is critical for adaptive learning and behavior. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents reward attributes, such as delay and magnitude, alongside expected uncertainties about upcoming rewards, serving its established role in both value- and risk-based behaviors. However, the cellular basis of how reward and uncertainty interact remains unclear. To investigate, we trained rats on a task where odor cues predicted sucrose rewards with varying uncertainties in delay or magnitude. Single-unit recordings revealed that many OFC neurons encoded expected uncertainties related to reward delay or magnitude. Population-level analysis showed distinct neural codes for delay and magnitude uncertainties, separate from those for reward delay and magnitude. Signals for each reward attribute and associated uncertainty converged onto the same neurons, reducing the sensitivity of delay and magnitude encoding as uncertainty increased. These findings suggest a cellular-level computation in OFC neurons, whereby uncertainty signals are integrated into attribute-specific reward representations, potentially supporting flexible learning and risk control.",

          "abstract": "The with-no-lysine (K) (WNK) kinases regulate processes such as cell volume and epithelial ion transport through the modulation of cation chloride cotransporters such as the NaCl cotransporter (NCC) present in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) of the kidney. Recently, the interaction of WNKs with nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1) and transforming growth factor–β–stimulated clone 22 domain (TSC22D) proteins was reported. Here, we explored the effect of NRBP1 and TSC22Ds on WNK signaling in vitro and in the DCT. TSC22D1.1, TSC22D2, and NRBP1 are localized in DCT WNK bodies, which are cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates associated with WNK activation. In HEK293 cells, long TSC22D isoforms and NRBP1 increase WNK4 activity. DCT-specific NRBP1-knockout mice have reduced NCC phosphorylation and activate a compensatory response. Thus, NRBP1 and long TSC22D proteins are positive modulators of WNK signaling and modulate Na + reabsorption in the kidney. NRBP1 and TSC22Ds likely influence WNK signaling in other tissues, affecting various physiological processes.",

In contrast, robots today are primarily monolithic machines with limited ability to self-repair, physically develop, or incorporate material from their environments. While robot minds rapidly evolve new behaviors through artificial intelligence, their bodies remain closed systems, unable to systematically integrate material to grow or heal. We argue that open-ended physical adaptation is only possible when robots are designed using a small repertoire of simple modules. This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot platform. We show how robots can grow bigger, faster, and more capable by consuming materials from their environment and other robots. We suggest that machine metabolic processes like those demonstrated here will be an essential part of any sustained future robot ecology.",

          "abstract": "Human impacts on carnivores are a persistent conservation challenge worldwide. We present a global analysis showing the overlap of conservation lands and the cumulative impact of humans on the distribution ranges of 257 terrestrial carnivore species. Our findings reveal that 64% of carnivore ranges overlap with areas characterized by high human pressures. We found that Indigenous peoples’ lands emerge as crucial for carnivore population viability, potentially safeguarding 26% of carnivore ranges globally, while protected and wilderness areas cover roughly 10 and 16% of carnivore ranges, respectively. These three areas combined cover 35% of the global range of carnivores. Reducing human pressure on conservation lands and managing them to protect carnivores are therefore critical, yet challenging. The extent of carnivore ranges outside these areas underscores the necessity to expand the network of conservation lands, which are a pivotal component of global conservation planning, alongside broader proactive species-specific conservation measures.",

          "abstract": "Biohybrid actuators using muscle rings have been limited to twitching movements and are unsuitable for sustained contractile force applications. In this study, we developed muscle rings capable of generating high contractile forces under tetanus stimulation. By enhancing the rigidity of pillar-shaped supports and increasing myoblast density through reduced extracellular matrix, we promoted the formation of dense, well-aligned muscle fiber bundles. The optimized muscle rings exhibited higher contractile forces compared to traditional methods. Integrating these muscle rings with C-shaped anchors efficiently converted contractile force into bending motion. We demonstrated the application of these muscle rings in gripper- and slither-type biohybrid robots, achieving large deformation and undulatory movement. This work advances biohybrid robotics by enabling sophisticated movements requiring continuous and powerful muscle contractions.",

Current membranes demonstrate limited viability due to the lack of efficient Li + -selective architectures. We propose an electric field–assisted ion control hypothesis in reinforcing ultraefficient Li + -selective membranes, in which an ionized zeolitic imidazolate framework layer (Q-PEI@ZIF) is constructed via polyethylenimine (PEI) in situ confinement conversion and subsequent quaternization of 2,3-epoxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. In electrodialysis at 5 milliampere per square centimeter, the resulting membrane Q(5%)-PEI(1.0)@ZIF#CEM shows that the ion permeation rates follow the order of K +  ~ Li +  &gt; Na +  &gt; Ca 2+  ~ Mg 2+ , corresponding to 0.31, 0.30, 0.25, 0, and 0 mole per square meter per hour in 120 minutes, respectively. With a 25-millimolar Li + /Mg 2+ mixed solution, it exhibits an unprecedented Li + /Mg 2+ permselectivity of 20,000 and 99.99% purity of Li + product in 120 minutes.

          "abstract": "Glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) represents an economical pathway for transforming renewable feedstock to value-added chemicals. However, the inertness of C(sp 3 )─H bonds of glycerol and intermediates results in the high energy barrier of the dehydrogenation step, relating to poor product selectivity at high glycerol conversion. Here, a carbon nanotube–supported PdBO x @Pd heterostructure catalyst (PdBO x @Pd/CNTs) was synthesized in which in situ–exsoluted PdBO x clusters covalently covered Pd nanoparticles, thus yielding strong electronic interaction between Pd nanoparticles and PdBO x clusters. The strong electronic interaction in PdBO x @Pd/CNTs induces the hybridization between Pd(d), B(s, p), and O(s, p) atom orbits, optimizing the adsorption of reactants and intermediates, thus enhancing the activity for the GOR. The density functional theory calculation result reveals that the strong electronic interaction in PdBO x @Pd/CNTs facilitates the hydrogen transfer in the primary C─H bond of the CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 O* intermediate, thus reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step and improving glyceric acid selectivity toward the GOR.",

          "abstract": "Engineered skeletal muscle holds potential for tissue engineering and biohybrid robotics applications. However, current strategies face challenges in enhancing force generation while maintaining stability and scalability of the muscle, largely due to insufficient oxygenation and limited nutrient delivery. In this study, we present an engineering approach to address these limitations by coculturing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( C. reinhardtii ), a photosynthetic unicellular green microalga, with C2C12 myoblasts in a hydrogel matrix. Leveraging the photosynthetic activity of C. reinhardtii , our microalgae-empowered muscle (MAM) constructs exhibited superior contractility and almost three times higher active force generation compared to conventional muscle constructs. MAM showed higher cellular viability and reduced tissue damage, attributed to in situ oxygenation and nutrient supply provided by microalgal photosynthesis. In addition, improved myotube alignment was observed in MAM, which contributed to enhanced force generation. Our findings showcase the potential of photosynthetic microalgae as a functional component in engineered skeletal muscle, offering a solution to longstanding challenges in muscle engineering.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric methane concentration (AMC) surged by ~50% during the last deglaciation, with northern (&gt;30°N) sources accounting for ~40% of the rise. However, hypothesized sources including expanding lakes, peatlands, and destabilized permafrost or hydrates fail to explain this rapid increase. We use biomarkers, isotopes, and radiocarbon data to reconstruct temperature change, methane cycling, and permafrost thaw from a Tibetan thermokarst lake. Radiocarbon evidence and ultradepleted δ 13 C values (−80.3 per mil) of methane-diagnostic lipids indicate intense cycling of ancient (~2500-year-old) methane during the Younger Dryas–Preboreal transition, coeval with the AMC surge and the most rapid warming. By contrast, methane cycling was weak during the Holocene Climatic Optimum despite peak temperatures. These findings imply that anomalously high rates of warming, rather than absolute temperature alone, may play an important role in triggering enhanced paleo-methane cycling. Rapid warming likely intensified emissions from existing northern lakes, fueling the elusive yet clearly amplified northern methane source that contributed to the deglacial abrupt rise in AMC.",

Engineering muscle-tendon units in vitro is essential for replicating native musculoskeletal functions in biohybrid actuators. Here, we present a three-dimensionally bioprinted system integrating skeletal muscle tissue with tendon-mimicking anchors containing fibroblasts, forming a biomimetic interdigitated myotendinous junction. Using computational models, we optimized muscle geometries to enhance deformation and force generation. The engineered system improved mechanical stability, myofiber maturation, and force transmission, generating contractile forces of up to 350 micronewtons over a 3-month period.
