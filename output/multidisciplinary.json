          "abstract": "The neuromodulators dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) powerfully regulate associative learning1–8. Similarities in the activity and connectivity of these neuromodulatory systems have inspired competing models of how DA and 5HT interact to drive the formation of new associations9–14. However, these hypotheses have not been tested directly because it has not been possible to interrogate and manipulate multiple neuromodulatory systems in a single subject. Here, we establish a mouse model enabling simultaneous genetic access to the brain’s DA and 5HT neurons. Anterograde tracing revealed the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to be a putative hotspot for the integration of convergent DA and 5HT signals. Simultaneous recording of DA and 5HT axon activity, together with genetically encoded DA and 5HT sensor recordings, revealed that rewards increase DA signaling and decrease 5HT signaling in the NAc. Optogenetically dampening DA or 5HT reward responses individually produced modest behavioral deficits in an appetitive conditioning task, while blunting both signals together profoundly disrupted learning and reinforcement. Optogenetically reproducing DA and 5HT reward responses together was sufficient to drive acquisition of new associations and supported reinforcement more potently than either manipulation alone. Together, these results demonstrate that striatal DA and 5HT signals shape learning by exerting opponent control of reinforcement.",

          "abstract": "Multicomponent reactions – those where three or more substrates combine into a product – have been highly useful in rapidly building chemical building blocks of increased complexity4, but achieving this enzymatically has remained rare.5 This limitation primarily arises because an enzyme’s active site is not typically set up to address multiple substrates, especially in cases involving multiple radical intermediates6. Recently, chemical catalytic radical sorting has emerged as an enabling strategy for a variety of useful reactions7,8. However, making such processes enantioselective is highly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in the stereochemical control of radicals9. Here, we repurpose a thiamine-dependent enzyme10,11 through directed evolution, combine it with photoredox catalysis, to achieve a photobiocatalytic enantioselective three-component radical cross-coupling. This approach combines three readily available starting materials — aldehydes, α-bromo-carbonyls and alkenes — to give access to enantioenriched ketone products. Mechanistic investigations provide insights into how this dual photo-/enzyme system precisely directs the three distinct radicals involved in the transformation, unlocking new enzyme reactivity. Our approach has achieved exceptional stereoselectivity, with 25 out of 33 examples achieving ≥97% enantiomeric excess.",

Different types of atom might form different patterns, but the repetition of the pattern in space, and the number of times the pattern can be rotated about its centre and look the same (its rotational symmetry), were considered to be key defining features of a crystal. That understanding was shattered in 1984 by a paper1published in Physical Review Letters by Shechtman and colleagues. They reported a crystal that had no obvious repeating pattern, and which possessed rotational symmetries that violated the rules of crystallography. Their finding led the International Union of Crystallography to rewrite the definition of a crystal just eight years later2.",

In many of these regions, the pace of development is highest in areas that are most at risk of flooding1. To make such land available for urbanization, municipalities often turn to river engineering, building embankments that are designed to diminish this risk. But flooding is a multifaceted problem, and seemingly small factors can have dire consequences. Writing in Water Resources Research, Thapa et al.2 modelled the effects of embankments on flooding of the Nakkhu River, a small river in the Kathmandu Valley, and found that sediment movement has a profound impact on the effectiveness of these protective embankments.",

We assess this over four studies ( n = 1,145). We reveal that the valence of information sought affects mental health, which in turn influences the valence of information sought, forming a self-reinforcing loop. We quantified the valence of text on webpages participants chose to browse using natural language processing and found that browsing more negative information was associated with worse mental health and mood. By manipulating the webpages browsed and measuring mood and vice versa, we show that the relationship is causal and bidirectional. Finally, we developed an intervention that altered web-browsing patterns in a manner that improved mood. Together, the findings suggest that the information sought reflects mental state and shapes it, creating a loop that may perpetuate mental health problems. The results also provide a potential method for assessing and enhancing welfare in the digital age.",

Platforms and authorities must take action to change this or risk obstructing crucial scientific progress.\n\nAlthough online platforms offer many benefits (such as access to information, diverse perspectives and social connections), they also pose considerable dangers. The European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have identified multiple risks, which include spreading misinformation, monetizing harmful content and creating ‘rabbit holes’.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had profound impacts on tourist behaviour and psychology. Understanding tourists’ behavioural and psychological responses to the pandemic is crucial for tourism businesses to manage and sustain post-COVID-19 tourism recovery. To address whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced tourists’ thoughts and behaviours and the extent to which these changes might persist, we provide a narrative Review of the research on tourist behaviours and the psychological impacts of the pandemic. This Review delves into three themes: tourists’ decision-making behaviour; the psychological impacts of the pandemic on tourists; and tourists’ responses to crisis communication strategies. We argue that crisis communication strategies across sectors, pandemic-induced uncertainties and risks and psychological impacts were the predominant influences on tourists’ travel decisions during the pandemic. We conclude by discussing which changes are likely to be sustained.",

          "abstract": "In April 2022, mandatory kilocalorie (kcal) labelling in the out-of-home food sector was introduced as a policy to reduce obesity in England. Here we examined whether the implementation of this policy was associated with a consumer behaviour change. Large out-of-home food sector outlets subject to kcal labelling legislation were visited pre- and post-implementation, and customer exit surveys were conducted with 6,578 customers from 330 outlets. Kcals purchased and consumed, knowledge of purchased kcals and reported noticing and use of kcal labelling were examined. The results suggested that the introduction of the mandatory kcal labelling policy in England was not associated with a significant decrease in self-reported kcals purchased ( B = 11.31, P = 0.564, 95% confidence interval (CI) −27.15 to 49.77) or consumed ( B = 18.51, P = 0.279, 95% CI −15.01 to 38 52.03). Post-implementation, participants underestimated the energy content of their purchased meal less ( B = 61.21, P = 0.002, 95% CI 21.57 to 100.86) and were more likely to report noticing (odds ratio 2.25, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 1.84 to 2.73) and using (odds ratio 2.15, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.85) kcal labelling, which may have wider public health implications.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to test theoretical predictions over biological underpinnings of previously documented phenotypic correlations between human language-related and musical rhythm traits. Here, after identifying significant genetic correlations between rhythm, dyslexia and various language-related traits, we adapted multivariate methods to capture genetic signals common to genome-wide association studies of rhythm ( N = 606,825) and dyslexia ( N = 1,138,870). The results revealed 16 pleiotropic loci ( P &lt; 5 × 10 −8 ) jointly associated with rhythm impairment and dyslexia, and intricate shared genetic and neurobiological architectures. The joint genetic signal was enriched for foetal and adult brain cell-specific regulatory regions, highlighting complex cellular composition in their shared underpinnings. Local genetic correlation with a key white matter tract (the left superior longitudinal fasciculus-I) substantiated hypotheses about auditory–motor connectivity as a genetically influenced, evolutionarily relevant neural endophenotype common to rhythm and language processing. Overall, we provide empirical evidence of multiple aspects of shared biology linking language and musical rhythm, contributing novel insight into the evolutionary relationships between human musicality and linguistic communication traits.",

          "authors": "Mathias Kruse",
          "abstract": "In Europe, the tendency among immigrants and descendants to seek out and interact with other coethnics has raised concern for their integration as it can reduce contact with the ethnic majority. Though policymakers implement large-scale integration programs to counteract these trends, it remains empirically and theoretically ambiguous whether exposure to coethnic peers impedes integration, and causal evidence is more limited for the growing population of migrant children. In this article, I use high-quality Danish administrative panel data over 28 y to investigate whether the ethnic composition experienced in childhood among immigrants and descendants with a non-EU background affects a core behavioral indicator of integration: naturalization. To isolate the causal effect of the childhood ethnic composition, I use the quasi-experimental assignment of siblings into different school grades in the same school. I find that being exposed to coethnic peers in the school grade increases the probability of naturalizing later in life. The main explanation is that exposure to some coethnic peers improves academic skills which are positively correlated with citizenship acquisition. These findings demonstrate the causal importance of non-EU migrant children’s social environment for their later integration into the national community showing that the modest presence of coethnic peers can be a precondition for, not a barrier to, integration.",

          "abstract": "In response to the disruption of gas supplies from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, European politicians and public utilities appealed to citizens and customers to conserve natural gas. Moreover, they strengthened economic incentives for gas conservation. In fact, a substantial amount of natural gas was saved during the winter of 2022/23. This raises the question to what extent this success is attributable to government and corporate means to foster energy conservation in the crisis, including energy policies such as the German government’s “gas price brake,” gas-saving programs launched by public utilities, and consumers’ individual pricing schemes. We analyzed the effectiveness of these means using a survey and a field experiment with a German gas supplier and show that, while household savings during the crisis were substantial, economic incentives did not significantly change behavior. Indeed, demand for gas is largely price inelastic. A large majority of consumers do not understand the incentives arising from the gas price brake, and when they do, they do not respond. Likewise, consumers do not react to the design of the utilities’ gas-saving program. These findings suggest that i) citizens’ response to marginal individual economic incentives contributes little to overall gas savings, and ii) the crisis, along with the extensive societal engagement it generated, likely shifted the public’s mindset about energy consumption, making conservation a social priority.",

          "abstract": "Language is a productive system––we routinely produce well-formed utterances that we have never heard before. It is, however, difficult to assess when children first achieve linguistic productivity simply because we rarely know all the utterances a child has experienced. The onset of linguistic productivity has been at the heart of a long-standing theoretical question in language acquisition––do children come to language learning with abstract categories that they deploy from the earliest moments of acquisition? We address the problem of when linguistic productivity begins by marrying longitudinal behavioral observations and computational modeling to capitalize on the strengths of each. We used behavioral data to assess when a sample of 64 English-learning children began to productively combine determiners and nouns, a linguistic construction previously used to address this theoretical question. After the onset of productivity, the children produced determiner–noun combinations that were not attested in our sample of their linguistic input from caregivers. We used computational techniques to model the onsets and trajectories of determiner–noun combinations in these 64 children, as well as characteristics of their utterances in which the determiner was omitted. Because we knew exactly what input the model was trained on, we could, with confidence, know that the model had gone beyond its input. The parallels found between child and model in the timing and number of novel combinations suggest that the children too were creatively going beyond their input.",

          "abstract": "The attempted assassination of Donald Trump led to widespread concern that the event would escalate political violence between U.S. partisans. While some politicians pleaded for Americans to unite against political violence and “turn down the temperature” on partisan hostility, others continued to engage in inflammatory rhetoric and blame. Using a national survey in the field at the time of the assassination attempt, we take the temperature of America’s partisans before and after the event. We exploit the natural variation induced by the assassination attempt and large daily survey coverage (preattempt: 3,572; postattempt: 703; and 690 in a panel) in the days before and after the attempt to estimate the causal effects of extreme partisan violence on measures of partisan animosity and identity. Using panel and cross-sectional interrupted time series analysis, we find no evidence that the event increased tensions or support for retaliatory violence in the immediate aftermath. On the contrary, Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, became significantly less supportive of partisan violence against Democrats. Republicans also did not become more hostile toward Democrats; instead, their attachment to their own party significantly increased. Democrats experienced no change in attitudes. While nearly a third of Americans have no positive feelings toward the other party, and a supermajority have negative feelings, this animosity was not exacerbated by an extreme but salient instance of partisan violence. Despite the ills of modern political conflict, extreme partisan violence did not cause an immediate upsurge in support for violence.",

          "abstract": "Social rejection hurts, but it can also be informative: Through experiences of acceptance and rejection, people identify partners interested in connecting with them and choose which ties to cement or to sever. What is it that people actually learn from rejection? In social interactions, people can learn from two kinds of information. First, people generally learn from rewarding outcomes, which may include concrete opportunities for interaction. Second, people track the “relational value” others ascribe to them—an internal model of how much others value them. Here, we used computational neuroimaging to dissociate these forms of learning. Participants repeatedly tried to match with others in a social game. Feedback revealed whether they successfully matched (a rewarding outcome) and how much the other person wanted to play with them (relational value). A Bayesian cognitive model revealed that participants chose partners who provided rewarding outcomes and partners who valued them. Whereas learning from outcomes was linked to brain regions involved in reward-based reinforcement, learning about relational value was linked to brain regions previously associated with social rejection. These findings identify precise computations underlying brain responses to rejection and support a neurocomputational model of social affiliation in which people build an internal model of relational value and learn from rewarding outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity is a key explanation for the exceptional magnitude of cooperation among humans. This literature suggests that a large proportion of human cooperation is driven by social norms and individuals’ incentives to maintain a good reputation. This intuition has been formalized with two types of models. In public assessment models, all community members are assumed to agree on each others’ reputations; in private assessment models, people may have disagreements. Both types of models aim to understand the interplay of social norms and cooperation. Yet their results can be vastly different. Public assessment models argue that cooperation can evolve easily and that the most effective norms tend to be stern. Private assessment models often find cooperation to be unstable, and successful norms show some leniency. Here, we propose a model that can organize these differing results within a single framework. We show that the stability of cooperation depends on a single quantity: the extent to which individual opinions turn out to be correlated. This correlation is determined by a group’s norms and the structure of social interactions. In particular, we prove that no cooperative norm is evolutionarily stable when individual opinions are statistically independent. These results have important implications for our understanding of cooperation, conformity, and polarization.",

While these tools provide opportunities for improved teaching and education, they also pose significant challenges for assessment and learning outcomes. We conceptualize these challenges through the lens of vulnerability, the potential for university assessments and learning outcomes to be impacted by student use of generative AI. We investigate the potential scale of this vulnerability by measuring the degree to which AI assistants can complete assessment questions in standard university-level Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. Specifically, we compile a dataset of textual assessment questions from 50 courses at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and evaluate whether two AI assistants, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adequately answer these questions. We use eight prompting strategies to produce responses and find that GPT-4 answers an average of 65.8% of questions correctly, and can even produce the correct answer across at least one prompting strategy for 85.1% of questions. When grouping courses in our dataset by degree program, these systems already pass the nonproject assessments of large numbers of core courses in various degree programs, posing risks to higher education accreditation that will be amplified as these models improve. Our results call for revising program-level assessment design in higher education in light of advances in generative AI.",

          "abstract": "A subpopulation of human retinal ganglion cells contains the melanopsin photopigment, allowing them to act as a fifth photoreceptor class. These ganglion cells project to the visual cortex, but to reveal its intrinsic contribution to conscious vision is technically challenging as it requires melanopsin to be separated from the responses originating in the rods and three cone classes. Using a display engineered to isolate the melanopic visual response, we show that it detects lowpass spatial (≤0.35 cycles per degree) and temporal image content (≤1 Hz) but cannot reconstruct the stimulus form necessary for object recognition. We demonstrate that a model of the spatially diffuse intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells’ sampling structure is predictive of the measured image reconstruction limits of melanopic spatial vision. Separately, we find that under five-photoreceptor silent substitution conditions, rod pathways alone can support form vision in bright lighting when typically thought to be in saturation. Form vision that is absent from melanopsin can be only perceived in mixtures of both melanopsin and rod signals because it is the rod pathway that sees the form. Our findings show that melanopsin’s unique tuning to the diffuse and slow-changing elements in the world provides a stabilized reference point for vision.",

          "abstract": "The Bayesian confidence hypothesis (BCH), which postulates that confidence reflects the posterior probability that a decision is correct, is currently the most prominent theory of confidence. Although several recent studies have found evidence against it in the context of relatively complex tasks, BCH remains dominant for simpler tasks. The major alternative to BCH is the confidence in raw evidence space (CRES) hypothesis, according to which confidence is based directly on the raw sensory evidence without explicit probability computations. Here, we tested these competing hypotheses in the context of perceptual tasks that are assumed to induce Gaussian evidence distributions. We show that providing information about task difficulty gives rise to a basic behavioral signature that distinguishes BCH from CRES models even for simple 2-choice tasks. We examined this signature in three experiments and found that all experiments exhibited behavioral signatures in line with CRES computations but contrary to BCH ones. We further performed an extensive comparison of 16 models that implemented either BCH or CRES confidence computations and systematically differed in their auxiliary assumptions. These model comparisons provided overwhelming support for the CRES models over their BCH counterparts across all model variants and across all three experiments. These observations challenge BCH and instead suggest that humans may make confidence judgments by placing criteria directly in the space of the sensory evidence.",

          "abstract": "Why microbes harm their hosts is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology with broad relevance to our understanding of infectious diseases. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this \"evolution of virulence.\" In this perspective, we reexamine one of these hypotheses in the specific context of the human gut microbiome, namely short-sighted evolution. According to the short-sighted evolution hypothesis, virulence is a product of niche expansion within a colonized host, whereby variants of commensal microbes establish populations in tissues and sites where the infection causes morbidity or mortality. This evolution is short-sighted in that the evolved variants that infect those tissues and sites are not transmitted to other hosts. The specific hypothesis that we propose is that some bacteria responsible for invasive infections and disease are the products of the short-sighted evolution of commensal bacteria residing in the gut microbiota. We present observations in support of this hypothesis and discuss the challenges inherent in assessing its general application to infections and diseases associated with specific members of the gut microbiota. We then describe how this hypothesis can be tested using genomic data and animal model experiments and outline how such studies will serve to provide fundamental information about both the evolution and genetic basis of virulence, and the bacteria of intensively studied yet poorly understood habitats including the gut microbiomes of humans and other mammals.",

          "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is a wide-gap semiconductor with numerous applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and neuromorphic computing. The unique functional properties of this material critically depend on its ability to transport charge in the form of polarons, namely narrow electron wavepackets accompanied by local distortions of the crystal lattice. It is currently well established that the most important polymorphs of TiO 2 , the rutile and anatase phases, harbor small electron polarons and small hole polarons, respectively. However, whether additional polaronic species exist in TiO 2 , and under which conditions, remain open questions. Here, we provide definitive answers to these questions by exploring the rich landscape of polaron quasiparticles in TiO 2 via recently developed ab initio techniques. In addition to the already known small polarons, we identify three species, namely a large hole polaron in rutile, a large quasi-two-dimensional electron polaron in anatase, and a large exciton polaron in anatase. These findings complete the puzzle on the polaron physics of TiO 2 and pave the way for systematically probing and manipulating polarons in a broad class of complex oxides and quantum materials.",

Dissimilatory nitrate reduction is observed to have an 18 ε/ 15 ε proportionality of ~0.9 in marine and ~0.6 in freshwater/terrestrial ecosystems. The origins of this difference are uncertain, with both geochemical and biological factors conceivably at play. One potential factor is variation in the isotope effect of nitrate reduction among different forms of the nitrate reductase enzyme. NarG nitrate reductases are observed to typically have an 18 ε/ 15 ε of ~0.9. However, a recent study uncovered an exception, with Bacillus NarG enzymes having an 18 ε/ 15 ε proportionality of ~0.6. This provides an opportunity to investigate genetic controls on 18 ε/ 15 ε. Furthermore, this atypical NarG signature also raises the question of whether intrinsic isotope signatures can evolve as the enzymes that produce them accumulate mutations through time. Here, we present data from site-directed mutagenesis experiments of key NarG residues, which suggest that the distinct Bacillus 18 ε/ 15 ε cannot be caused by single mutations alone and is potentially uncommon in nature. Variation in the intrinsic isotope effects of an enzyme through time may thus require more extensive evolutionary changes.",

The light signaling transduction pathway during seedling establishment has been extensively studied, but little molecular evidence is available for light-regulated secondary growth, and how light regulates cambium-derived tissue production remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that CRYPTOCHROME (CRY)-dependent blue light signaling and the subsequent attenuation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) movement to hypocotyls are key inducers of xylem fiber differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using grafted chimeric plants and hypocotyl-specific transcriptome sequencing of light signaling mutants under controlled light conditions, we demonstrate that the perception of blue light by CRYs in shoots drives secondary cell wall (SCW) deposition at xylem fiber cells during the secondary growth of hypocotyls. We propose that HY5 is a blue light–responsive mobile protein that inhibits xylem fiber formation via direct transcriptional repression of NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING 3 ( NST3 ). CRYs retain HY5 in the nucleus, impede its long-distance transport from leaf to hypocotyl, and they initiate NST3- driven SCW gene expression, thereby triggering xylem fiber production. Our findings shed light on the long-range CRYs-HY5-NST3 signaling cascade that shapes xylem fiber development, highlighting the activity of HY5 as a transcriptional repressor during secondary growth.",

          "abstract": "Gustation is one of the five innate sensations for humans, distinguishing from vision, auditory, tactile, and olfaction, as which is a close and chemically induced sense. Despite the fact that a handful of gustation display technologies have been developed, the new technologies still pose significant challenges in miniaturization of the overall size for portability, enriching taste options within a limited working area, supporting natural human–device interaction, and achieving precisely controlled taste feedback. To address these issues, here, we report a set of intelligent and portable lollipop-shaped taste interfacing systems covering from 2 to 9 different taste options for establishing an adjustable taste platform in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) environments. Tasteful and food-grade chemicals embedded agarose hydrogels serve as taste sources based on iontophoresis operation principle, with an adjustable feedback intensity and independent operation time by tuning the voltage input. To achieve portability and user-friendly operation, the devices are miniaturized into a gustation interface with 9-channel taste generators in the dimension of 8 cm × 3 cm × 1 cm. To realize both gustation and olfaction feedbacks in Metaverse, an olfaction interface based on 7-channel odor generators is also introduced into the gustation interface system. As a result, the demonstrations of our gustation interface systems in intelligent medical gustation assessment, remote shopping, and mixed reality have proven their advances and great progress in various potential application areas, ranging from human–machine interfaces, to biomedical science, and to entertainment.",

          "abstract": "Variants in the gene NDP cause Norrie disease, a severe dual-sensory disorder characterized by congenital blindness due to disrupted retinal vascular development and progressive hearing loss accompanied by sensory hair cell death. NDP encodes the secreted signaling molecule norrin. The role of norrin in the cochlea is incompletely understood. We investigated whether the Norrie disease cochlear pathology can be ameliorated in an Ndp -knockout ( Ndp -KO) mouse model by conditional activation of stabilized β-catenin in vascular endothelial cells. We hypothesized that in the cochlea microvasculature, β-catenin is the primary downstream intracellular effector of norrin binding to endothelial cell surface receptors and that restoration of this signaling pathway is sufficient to prevent sensory hair cell death and hearing loss. We show that tamoxifen induction of Cdh5CreERT2;Ctnnb1 flex3/+ ;Ndp- KO mice stabilizing β-catenin in vascular endothelial cells alone rescued defects in cochlear vascular barrier function, restored dysregulated expression of endothelial cell disease biomarkers ( Cldn5, Abcb1a, Slc7a1, and Slc7a5 ), and prevented progressive outer hair cell death and hearing loss. Single-cell transcriptome profiling of human cochleas showed NDP expression by fibrocytes and glial cells while receptor gene expression ( FZD4, TSPAN12, LRP5, and LRP6 ) coincided in vascular endothelial cells. Our findings support the conclusion that vascular endothelial cells are a primary target of norrin signaling in the cochlea of mice and humans and restoration of β-catenin regulation of target gene expression within cochlear endothelial cells is sufficient to maintain a cochlear microenvironment critical for hair cell survival.",

The screening of approved and investigational drugs in cell-based phenotypic assays can provide evidence of drug activity, but alternative screening paradigms are needed to develop and optimize multidrug combination regimens. Here, we utilize in vitro screening outcomes across a panel of lymphoma cell lines to dissect the activity of four small-molecule drugs (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisolone, and Lenalidomide) currently under investigation within ongoing clinical trials in lymphoma. Data from multiple concentration ranges and time points show that synergistic drug combinations promote apoptosis and cytotoxicity responses at concentrations and time points that are consistent with in vivo drug exposures. To fully map the interaction landscape of these agents in relevant cell models, we developed an in vitro assay format that facilitated time-course evaluations involving concurrent multidrug exposure which further highlighted rapid, synergistic apoptosis induction as a central engine for the activity of this multicomponent targeted therapy. In addition to several instances of exceptional drug+drug synergy, the genetically similar diffuse large B cell lymphoma models also displayed substantial heterogeneity in the degree of synergism between drug pairs. A parallel survey of chemotherapies exhibited limited combination benefit, supporting recent findings that multicomponent chemotherapy outcomes are driven by individual drug activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate how in vitro drug screening data can identify multidrug combinations that exploit drug synergy to overcome the functional diversity of human malignancies.",

In enzymatic catalysis, one significant challenge is identifying the reactive conformations (RC) of the enzyme:substrate complex where the substrate assumes a precise arrangement in the active site necessary to initiate a reaction. Traditional methods are hindered by the complexity of the multidimensional free energy landscape involved in the transition from nonreactive to reactive conformations. Here, we applied ML techniques to address this challenge, focusing on human pancreatic α-amylase, a crucial enzyme in type-II diabetes treatment. Using ML-based collective variables (CVs), we correlated the probability of being in a RC with the experimental catalytic activity of several malto-oligosaccharide substrates. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable transferability of these CVs across various compounds, significantly streamlining the modeling process and reducing both computational demand and manual intervention in setting up simulations for new substrates. This approach not only advances our understanding of enzymatic processes but also holds substantial potential for accelerating drug discovery by enabling rapid and accurate evaluation of drug efficacy across different generations of inhibitors.",

Lehner, Patrick Lomonte",
          "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) latently infected neurons display diverse patterns in the distribution of the viral genomes within the nucleus. A key pattern involves quiescent HSV-1 genomes sequestered in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) forming viral DNA-containing PML-NBs (vDCP NBs). Using a cellular model that replicates vDCP NB formation, we previously demonstrated that these viral genomes are chromatinized with the H3.3 histone variant modified on its lysine 9 by trimethylation (H3.3K9me3), a mark associated with transcriptional repression. Here, we identify the HUSH complex and its effectors, SETDB1 and MORC2, as crucial for the acquisition of H3K9me3 on PML NB-associated HSV-1 and the maintenance of HSV-1 transcriptional repression. ChIP-seq analyses show H3K9me3 association with the entire viral genome. Inactivating the HUSH–SETDB1–MORC2 complex before infection significantly reduces H3K9me3 on the viral genome, with minimal impact on the cellular genome, aside from expected changes in LINE-1 retroelements. Depletion of HUSH, SETDB1, or MORC2 alleviates HSV-1 repression in infected primary human fibroblasts and human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived sensory neurons (hiPSDN). We found that the viral protein ICP0 induces MORC2 degradation via the proteasome machinery. This process is concurrent with ICP0 and MORC2 depletion capability to reactivate silenced HSV-1 in hiPSDN. Overall, our findings underscore the robust antiviral function of the HUSH–SETDB1–MORC2 repressor complex against a herpesvirus by modulating chromatin marks linked to repression, thus presenting promising avenues for anti-herpesvirus therapeutic strategies.",

Recently, chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis (Chinmo) has been proposed as a larval specifier in Drosophila melanogaste r. However, whether Chinmo is required for larval maintenance in lepidopteran insects, the underlying mechanisms involved in maintaining the larval stage, and its interactions with the JH signaling pathway are not well understood. Here, we used a binary transgenic CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockout Chinmo and Kr-h1 (primary response gene in the JH signaling pathway) in the fall armyworm (FAW). Kr-h1 knockout induced premature metamorphosis only after L5 (penultimate), whereas Chinmo and Kr-h1 double knockout induced premature metamorphosis in L3. Sequencing and differential gene expression (DEG) analysis of RNA isolated from mutants and single-cell multiome ATAC analysis of Chinmo , Kr-h1 , and Chinmo and Kr-h1 double knockout Sf9 cells revealed that Chinmo participates in chromatin modifications that prevent the promoter accessibility and expression of metamorphosis promoting genes. These results suggest that Chinmo is a larval specifier that plays a major role in preventing metamorphosis in early larval stages by controlling chromatin accessibility near the promoters of genes such as Br-C and E93 required for pupal and adult development.",

However, the identities of enzymes participating in the transfer of methyl groups are not well defined. To date, fibrillarin (FBL) is the only known small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) 2′-O-methyltransferase. Whether other snoRNP 2′-O-methyltransferases exist and their functions in targeting RNAs to determine cell differentiation and function need to be elucidated. Here, we identify FBL-like protein 1 (FBLL1) as a 2′-O-methyltransferase and find its function in promoting neuronal differentiation. We show that FBLL1 is a key snoRNP complex enzyme that transfers methyl groups to substrate RNAs both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, FBLL1 exhibits different 2′-O-methyltransferase site selectivity from FBL and tissue-specific distribution. FBLL1 is preferentially expressed in the brain, especially in human neuron cells, and promotes neuronal differentiation through 2′-O-methylation of GAP43 messenger RNA (mRNA). Knockdown of FBLL1, but not FBL, reduced 2′-O-methylation levels in GAP43 mRNA, decreased expression of GAP43 proteins, and eventually repressed neuronal differentiation. Our finding of neuron-specific FBLL1 adds insights into RNA modification in neurobiology and provides clues for understanding 2′-O-methylation in health and disease.",

          "abstract": "Odors are key signals for guiding spatial behaviors such as foraging and navigation in rodents. Recent findings reveal that odor representations in the piriform cortex (PCx) also encode spatial context information. However, the brain origins of this information and its integration into PCx microcircuitry remain unclear. This study investigates the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) as a potential source of spatial contextual information affecting the PCx microcircuit and its olfactory responses. Using mice brain slices, we performed patch-clamp recordings on superficial (SP) and deep (DP) pyramidal neurons, as well as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) inhibitory interneurons. Concurrently, we optogenetically stimulated excitatory LEC projections to observe their impact on PCx activity. Results show that LEC inputs are heterogeneously distributed in the PCx microcircuit, evoking larger excitatory currents in SP and PV neurons due to higher monosynaptic connectivity. LEC inputs also differentially affect inhibitory circuits, activating PV while suppressing SOM interneurons. Studying the interaction between LEC inputs and sensory signals from the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) revealed that simultaneous LEC and LOT activation increases spiking in SP and DP neurons, with DP neurons showing a sharpened response due to LEC-induced inhibition that suppresses delayed LOT-evoked spikes. This suggests a regulatory mechanism where LEC inputs inhibit recurrent activity by activating PV interneurons. Our findings demonstrate that LEC afferents reconfigure PCx activity, aiding the understanding of how odor objects form within the PCx by integrating olfactory and nonolfactory information.",

Existing methods to eliminate environmental confounding leverage random genetic variation resulting from recombination and require within-family dyadic genetic data (i.e., parent–child and/or sibling pairs), meaning they can only be applied in relatively small and selected samples. We introduce the phenotype differences model and provide derivations showing that it—under plausible assumptions—provides consistent (and, in certain cases, unbiased) estimates of genetic effects using just a single individual’s genotype. Then, leveraging distinct samples of fully and partially genotyped sibling pairs in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we use polygenic indices and phenotypic data for 24 different traits to empirically validate the phenotype differences model. Finally, we utilize the model to test the effects of 40 polygenic indices on lifespan. After a 10% false discovery rate correction, we find that polygenic indices for three traits—body mass index, self-rated health, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—have a statistically significant effect on an individual’s lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are well established as contributors to intermolecular interactions and the formation of biomolecular condensates. In particular, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) often harbor IDRs in addition to folded RNA-binding domains that contribute to RBP function. To understand the dynamic interactions of an IDR–RNA complex, we characterized the RNA-binding features of a small (68 residues), positively charged IDR-containing protein, Small ERDK-Rich Factor (SERF). At high concentrations, SERF and RNA undergo charge-driven associative phase separation to form a protein- and RNA-rich dense phase. A key advantage of this model system is that this threshold for demixing is sufficiently high that we could use solution-state biophysical methods to interrogate the stoichiometric complexes of SERF with RNA in the one-phase regime. Herein, we describe our comprehensive characterization of SERF alone and in complex with a small fragment of the HIV-1 Trans-Activation Response (TAR) RNA with complementary biophysical methods and molecular simulations. We find that this binding event is not accompanied by the acquisition of structure by either molecule; however, we see evidence for a modest global compaction of the SERF ensemble when bound to RNA. This behavior likely reflects attenuated charge repulsion within SERF via binding to the polyanionic RNA and provides a rationale for the higher-order assembly of SERF in the context of RNA. We envision that the SERF–RNA system will lower the barrier to accessing the details that support IDR–RNA interactions and likewise deepen our understanding of the role of IDR–RNA contacts in complex formation and liquid–liquid phase separation.",

S-palmitoylation is a PTM catalyzed by zinc finger DHHC domain containing (zDHHC) S-acyltransferases that affects both localization and activity of proteins regulating synaptic plasticity and amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolism. Here, we found significant increases of both zDHHC7 expression and protein S-palmitoylation in hippocampi of both 3×Tg-AD mice and post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Chronic intranasal administration of the S-palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate counteracted synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits, reduced the Aβ deposition in the hippocampus and extended the lifespan of both male and female 3×Tg-AD mice. Moreover, hippocampal silencing of zDHHC7 prevented the onset of cognitive deficits in the same experimental model. We also identified a FoxO1-mediated epigenetic mechanism inducing zDHHC7 expression, which was triggered by brain insulin resistance in 3×Tg-AD mice. Finally, in hippocampi of AD patients S-palmitoylation levels of Beta-Secretase 1 were associated with Aβ 1 to 42 load and they inversely correlated with Mini Mental State Examination scores.

Microtubules serve as polar tracks for the selective transport of specific molecular motors toward either their plus or minus ends. How both motors reciprocally move microtubules and organize the network’s arrangement and polarity is unknown. Here, we combined experiments on reconstituted systems and theory to study the interaction of microtubules with both plus- and minus-end directed motors bound to a fluid membrane. Depending on motor concentrations, the system could lead either to the constant transport of microtubules or to their alignment, stacking, and immobilization in regular bands that separate motors into domains of opposite polarities. In bands, microtubules shared the same polarity and segregated the two opposing motors accordingly. These regular patterns resulted from the balance of forces produced by the two motors as they walked in opposite directions along microtubules. The system was maintained in a dynamic steady state in which the directional transport of microtubule-bound motors compensates for the random diffusion of lipid-bound motors. The size of motor domains depended on their respective concentrations. The constant flow of motors allowed the system to respond to variations in motor concentrations by moving microtubules to adapt to the new force balance. The polar sorting and linear arrangement of microtubules associated with the segregation of motors of opposite polarity are typical of cellular architectures, which these data may help to better understand.",

However, knowledge of the range of the antigen(s) that can activate diverse MR1-reactive T cells remains incomplete.

Pyridoxal, and the related compound, pyridoxal 5-phosphate bound to MR1 and enabled cell surface upregulation of wild type MR1*01 and MR1 expressing the Arg9His polymorphism associated with the MR1*04 allotype in a manner dependent on Lys43-mediated Schiff-base formation. Crystal structures of MR1*01 in complex with pyridoxal and pyridoxal 5-phosphate showed how these ligands were accommodated within the A-pocket of MR1. T cell lines transduced with the 7.G5 TCR, which has reported “pan-cancer” specificity, were specifically activated by pyridoxal presented by antigen-presenting cells expressing MR1*01 and MR1 allotypes bearing the less common Arg9His polymorphism. 7.G5 T cells also recognized, to a lesser extent, pyridoxal 5-phosphate and, importantly, recognition of both vitamers was blocked by an anti-MR1 antibody. 7.G5 TCR reactivity toward pyridoxal was enhanced when presented by the Arg9His polymorphism-bearing MR1 allotypes. Vitamin B6, and vitamers thereof, have been associated with various cancers, and here we describe a link between this ligand, MR1, and its allomorphs, and the pan-cancer 7.G5 TCR.

We found that Native American ancestry was strongly associated with increased risk of MeN. We also identified candidate variants in the OPCML gene, which encodes a protein that binds opioid receptors, that were associated with ~sixfold reduced odds of MeN (allele frequency 0.029 in controls and 0.005 in cases, OR = 0.16; P = 4 × 10 −8 ).

          "abstract": "Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) play a crucial role in virology, antibody drug development, and vaccine research. In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of two hepatitis E virus (HEV) nAbs, 8H3, and 8C11, which have exhibited enhanced neutralizing activity in a rhesus monkey model. We presented crystal structures of 8H3 Fab alone and a triple complex of 8C11 Fab and 8H3 Fab simultaneously binding to the HEV E2s protein (8C11:E2s:8H3). Through structural analysis, we identified critical binding sites and fully elucidated the binding footprints of nAb 8H3 in the 8C11:E2s:8H3 complex using site-directed mutagenesis, pinpointing Ile 529, Glu 549, Lys 554, and Ser 566 in the E2s domain, and K66H, S67H, D88H in the 8C11 heavy chain. Interestingly, the synergetic enhancement of 8C11 to 8H3 converted to an antagonistic effect when 8C11 bound to E2s with pretreatment of 8H3, indicating a unidirectional synergistic effect associated with the sequence of antibody involvement. We demonstrated this phenomenon through structural comparisons of E2s:8C11 vs. 8C11:E2s:8H3 crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations, found that Ile 529 played a key role in the synergistic interplay between these two nAbs. The two-antibody combination showed a more potent antibody-imposed physical disruption mechanism and enhanced coneutralization in an authentic HEV-based cell model. Our study suggests a strategy for synergistic antibody cocktail design with antibody–antibody side-by-side interaction.",

Near the megadeltas, inland streamflow through large catchments plays a crucial role in mediating salinity. While some regional studies have investigated how SSS is impacted through water cycle and climate components, a global scale quantification of inland streamflow contribution on SSS variability is lacking. Here, we utilized remote sensing and observation-driven datasets to quantify the statistical associations between SSS and streamflow ( Q basin ) at 48 megadeltas worldwide. This study uncovers a robust negative association between Q basin and SSS , with correlation coefficients R less than - 0.6 for seasonal data found in 26 of the 48 megadeltas, and less than - 0.4 for deseasoned data in 21 megadeltas. The anticorrelation relationship is more pronounced in large deltas, particularly near tropical climates and in river-influenced deltas. The study also underscores the significant roles of climate, morphological, and anthropogenic stratification in impacting the natural influence of freshwater discharge on SSS . By highlighting the interconnected impacts of alterations in terrestrial water cycle upstream and SSS , this work contributes to enhancing our understanding of global ocean and climate circulation patterns and in tackling environmental issues pertaining to marine ecosystems.",

A particularly dramatic example of rapid motion in plants is the squirting cucumber ( Ecballium elaterium ) which launches its seeds explosively via a high-pressure jet. Despite intriguing scientists for centuries, the exact mechanism of seed dispersal and its effect on subsequent generations remain poorly understood. Here, through a combination of experimentation, high-speed videography, quantitative image analysis, and mathematical modeling, we develop a full mechanical description of the process. We quantify the turgor pressure driving ballistic ejection, and uncover key mechanical interactions between the fruit and stem both prior to and during seed ejection, including the unique feature that fluid is redistributed from fruit to stem prior to ejection, a developmental event that goes against the paradigm of rapid seed ejection but which is of key importance in successful dispersal for Ecballium . Combining modeling elements, we quantify and simulate the ballistic trajectories of seeds, which are dispersed over distances greater than 2,000 times their length. We demonstrate how together these mechanical features contribute to a nearly uniform distribution of seeds away from the parent plant. Parametric variation of key developmental events in the modeling framework indicates how a suite of adaptive features in combination drives the spatial distribution of offspring over consecutive generations, and suggests that ballistic seed dispersal has a stabilizing effect on population dynamics by reducing intraspecific competition.",

Two superconducting domes are commonly found in unconventional superconductors and exhibit unique normal states and electronic structures.

The normal state resistivity on SC1 shows the strange metal state, with a power exponent approximately equal to 1 ( ρ ( T ) ∝ T n with n ~ 1), whereas the exponent on SC2 is less than 1. A bulk Dirac state observed on SC1, completely synchronized with the strange metal behavior, indicating a close relationship between them. While a topological surface Dirac state is witnessed on SC2 and undergoes a sign change near the pure nematic quantum critical point. The evolution of the Dirac states indicates that the appearance of the two superconducting domes may originate from the Fermi surface reconstruction. Our findings highlight distinct Dirac states and normal state resistivity across the two superconducting domes, providing convincing evidence for the existence of the two different pairing mechanisms in FeSe-based superconductors.",

Across all global land area, models underestimate positive trends exceeding 0.5 °C per decade in widening of the upper tail of extreme surface temperature distributions by a factor of four compared to reanalysis data and exhibit a lower fraction of significantly increasing trends overall. To a lesser degree, models also underestimate observed strong trends of contraction of the upper tails in some areas, while moderate trends are well reproduced in a global perspective.

The postulated catalytic mechanism involves stabilization of a chiral DNA loop followed by the passage of the T-segment through the temporarily cleaved G-segment resulting in sign inversion. The molecular basis for this is poorly understood as the chiral loop has never been directly observed. We have obtained high-resolution cryoEM structures of Escherichia coli gyrase with chirally wrapped 217 bp DNA with and without the fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin (MFX). Each structure constrains a positively supercoiled figure-of-eight DNA loop stabilized by a GyrA β-pinwheel domain which has the structure of a flat disc. By comparing the catalytic site of the native drug-free and MFX-bound gyrase structures both of which contain a single metal ion, we demonstrate that the enzyme is observed in a native precatalytic state. Our data imply that T-segment trapping is not dependent on the dimerization of the ATPase domains which appears to only be possible after strand passage has taken place.",

We investigated how mitochondrial metabolism influences SCN cancer (SCNC) progression. Extensive bioinformatics analyses encompassing thousands of patient tumors and human cancer cell lines uncovered enhanced expression of proliferator-activatedreceptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), a potent regulator of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), across several SCNCs. PGC-1α correlated tightly with increased expression of the lineage marker Achaete-scute homolog 1, (ASCL1) through a positive feedback mechanism. Analyses using a human prostate tissue-based SCN transformation system showed that the ASCL1 subtype has heightened PGC-1α expression and OXPHOS activity. PGC-1α inhibition diminished OXPHOS, reduced SCNC cell proliferation, and blocked SCN prostate tumor formation. Conversely, PGC-1α overexpression enhanced OXPHOS, validated by small-animal Positron Emission Tomography mitochondrial imaging, tripled the SCN prostate tumor formation rate, and promoted commitment to the ASCL1 lineage. These results establish PGC-1α as a driver of SCNC progression and subtype determination, highlighting metabolic vulnerabilities in SCNCs across different tissues.",

          "abstract": "The Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (UPR mt ), a mitochondria-originated stress response to altered mitochondrial proteostasis, plays important roles in various pathophysiological processes. In this study, we revealed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-tethered stress sensor CREBH regulates UPR mt to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and function in the liver. CREBH is enriched in and required for hepatic Mitochondria-Associated Membrane (MAM) expansion induced by energy demands. Under a fasting challenge or during the circadian cycle, CREBH is activated to promote expression of the genes encoding the key enzymes, chaperones, and regulators of UPR mt in the liver. Activated CREBH, cooperating with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), activates expression of Activating Transcription Factor (ATF) 5 and ATF4, two major UPR mt transcriptional regulators, independent of the ER-originated UPR (UPR ER ) pathways. Hepatic CREBH deficiency leads to accumulation of mitochondrial unfolded proteins, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and elevated cellular redox state. Dysregulation of mitochondrial function caused by CREBH deficiency coincides with increased hepatic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) but decreased glycolysis. CREBH knockout mice display defects in fatty acid oxidation and increased reliance on carbohydrate oxidation for energy production. In summary, our studies uncover that hepatic UPR mt is activated through CREBH under physiological challenges, highlighting a molecular link between ER and mitochondria in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis and energy homeostasis under stress conditions.",

          "abstract": "Hinge sites of proteins play a key role in mediating conformational mechanics. Among them, those involved in the most collective modes of motion, also called global hinges, are of particular interest, as they support cooperative rearrangements that are often functional. Yet, the utility of targeting global hinges for modulating function remains to be established. We present here a systematic study of a series of proteins resolved in drug-bound forms to examine the probabilistic occurrence of spatial overlaps between hinge sites and drug-binding pockets. Our analysis reveals a high propensity of drug binding to hinge sites compared to random. Notably, one-third of currently approved drugs are colocalized with hinge sites. These mechanosensitive sites are predictable by simple models such as the Gaussian Network Model. Their targeting thus emerges as a viable strategy for developing a new class of drugs that would exploit and modulate the target proteins’ intrinsic dynamics, and potentially alleviate drug-resistance when used in combination with orthosteric or allosteric drugs.",

          "abstract": "The brain is thought to execute cognitive control by actively maintaining and flexibly updating patterns of neural activity that represent goals and rules. However, while actively maintaining patterns of activity requires robustness against noise and distractors, updating the activity requires sensitivity to task-relevant inputs. How these conflicting demands can be reconciled in a single neural system remains unclear. Here, we study the prefrontal cortex of monkeys maintaining a covert rule and integrating sensory inputs toward a choice. Following the onset of neural responses, sensory integration evolves with a 70 ms delay. Using a stability analysis and a recurrent neural network model trained to perform the task, we show that this delay enables a transient, system-level destabilization, opening a temporal window to selectively incorporate new information. This mechanism allows robustness and sensitivity to coexist in a neural system and hierarchically updates patterns of neural activity, providing a general framework for cognitive control. Furthermore, it reveals a learned, explicit rule representation, suggesting a reconciliation between the symbolic and connectionist approaches for building intelligent machines.",

Here, we identified a depupylation regulator, a protein called CoaX, through its copurification with the depupylase Dop. CoaX is a pseudopantothenate kinase that showed evidence of binding to pantothenate, an essential nutrient Mtb synthesizes, but not its phosphorylation. In a ∆ coaX mutant, pantothenate synthesis enzymes including PanB, a substrate of the Pup-proteasome system (PPS), were more abundant than in the parental strain. In vitro, CoaX specifically accelerated depupylation of Pup~PanB, while addition of pantothenate inhibited this reaction. In culture, media supplementation with pantothenate decreased PanB levels, which required CoaX. Collectively, we propose CoaX regulates PanB abundance in response to pantothenate levels by modulating its vulnerability to proteolysis by Mtb proteasomes.",

          "abstract": "The key first step in the oligomerization of monomers is to find an initiator, which is usually done by thermolysis or photolysis. We present a markedly different approach that initiates acid-catalyzed polymerization at the surface of water films or water droplets, which is the reactive phase during a wet–dry cycle in freshwater hot springs associated with subaerial volcanic landmasses. We apply this method to the oligomerization of different nucleic acids, a topic relevant to how it might be possible to go from simple nucleic acid monomers to long-chain polymers, a key step in forming the building blocks of life. It has long been known that dehydration at elevated temperatures can drive the synthesis of ester and peptide bonds, but this reaction has typically been carried out by incubating dry monomers at elevated temperatures. We report that single or multiple cycles of wetting and drying link mononucleotides by forming phosphodiester bonds. Mass spectrometric analysis reveals uridine monophosphate oligomers up to 53 nucleotides, with an abundance of 35 and 43 nt in length. Long-chain oligomers are also observed for thymidine monophosphate, adenosine monophosphate, and deoxyadenosine monophosphate after exposure to a few wet–dry cycles. Nanopore sequencing confirms that long linear chains are formed. Enzyme digestion shows that the linkage is the phosphodiester bond, which is further confirmed by 31 P NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This suggests that nucleic acid oligomers were likely to be present on early Earth in a steady state of synthesis and hydrolysis.",

Unlike cross-flow filtration, where permeability and selectivity are rationally designed following trade-off analyses, the driving forces underlying the evolution of mobula filter geometry have remained elusive. To bridge the principles of cross-flow and mobula filtration, we establish a universal framework for the permeability–selectivity trade-off in a leaky channel inspired by mobula filters, where permeability and selectivity are characterized by the pore-scale leaking rate and the cut-off particle size, respectively. Beyond the classic pore-flow regime in cross-flow filtration, we reveal transition and vortex regimes pertinent to mobula filtration. Combining theory, physical experiments, and simulations, we present distinct features of water permeability and particle selectivity across the three regimes. In particular, we identify an unreported 1/2-scaling law for the leaking rate in the vortex regime. We conclude by demonstrating that mobula filters strike an elegant balance between permeability and selectivity, which enables mobula rays to simultaneously satisfy biological requirements for breathing and filter feeding. By integrating cross-flow and mobula filtration into a universal framework, our findings provide fundamental insights into the physical constraints and evolutionary pressures associated with biological filtration geometries and lay the foundation for developing mobula-inspired filtration in industry.",

However, it remains unknown whether these small-scale experimental findings are relevant to the longer-term stability of natural forests. Using 7,500 natural forest plots across much of Canada, monitored over three to four decades on average, we provide strong evidence that higher temporal stability (defined as the mean productivity divided by its SD over time) is consistently associated with greater tree functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic diversity across all lengths of observations. Specifically, increasing functional diversity from its minimum to maximum values increases stability, mean productivity, and the temporal SD of productivity by 14%, 36%, and 28%, respectively. Our results highlight that the promotion of functionally, phylogenetically, and/or taxonomically diverse forests could enhance the long-term productivity and stability of natural forests.",

          "abstract": "The Voyager spacecraft discovered that the ice giants Uranus and Neptune have nondipolar magnetic fields, defying expectations that a thick interior layer of planetary ices would generate strong dipolar fields. Stanley and Bloxham showed that nondipolar fields emerge if the magnetic field is only generated in a thin outer layer. However, the origin and composition of this dynamo active layer has so far remained elusive. Here, we show with ab initio computer simulations that a mixture of H 2 O, CH 4 , and NH 3 will phase separate under the pressure–temperature condition in the interiors of Uranus and Neptune, forming a H 2 O-dominated fluid in the upper mantle and a CH 4 -NH 3 mixture below. We further demonstrate that with increasing pressure, the CH 4 -NH 3 mixture becomes increasingly hydrogen depleted as it assumes the state of a polymeric C-N-H fluid. Since the amount of hydrogen loss increases with pressure, we propose that the C-N-H fluid forms a stably stratified layer. The magnetic fields are primarily generated in an upper layer that is H 2 O-rich, homogeneous, convective, and electrically conducting. Under these assumptions, we construct ensembles of models for the interiors of Uranus and Neptune with the Concentric MacLaurin Spheroid method. We demonstrate that the phase separation of the solar-type H 2 O-CH 4 -NH 3 mixture leads to models that match the observed gravity field and to layer thicknesses that are compatible with magnetic field measurements.",

W. Arathorn, S. B. Stevenson, Q. Yang, P. Tiruveedhula, A. Roorda, J. Vis. 13 , 22 (2013)]. We asked: Is world-fixed retinal image background content necessary for the visual system to compute the direction of eye motion, and consequently generate stable percepts of images moving with amplified slip? Or, are nonvisual cues sufficient? Subjects adjusted the parameters of a stimulus moving in a random trajectory to match the perceived motion of images moving contingent to the retina. Experiments were done with and without retinal image background content. The perceived motion of stimuli moving with amplified retinal slip was suppressed in the presence of a visible background; however, higher magnitudes of motion were perceived under conditions when there was none. Our results demonstrate that the presence of retinal image background content is essential for the visual system to compute its direction of motion. The visual content that might be thought to provide a strong frame of reference to detect amplified retinal slips, instead paradoxically drives the misperception of relative motion.",

          "abstract": "Delineating a protein's essential and dispensable domains provides critical insight into how it carries out its function. Here, we developed a high-throughput method to synthesize and test the functionality of all possible in-frame and continuous deletions in a gene of interest, enabling rapid and unbiased determination of protein domain importance. Our approach generates precise deletions using a CRISPR library framework that is free from constraints of gRNA target site availability and efficacy. We applied our method to AcrIIA4, a phage-encoded anti-CRISPR protein that robustly inhibits SpCas9. Extensive structural characterization has shown that AcrIIA4 physically occupies the DNA-binding interfaces of several SpCas9 domains; nonetheless, the importance of each AcrIIA4 interaction for SpCas9 inhibition is unknown. We used our approach to determine the essential and dispensable regions of AcrIIA4. Surprisingly, not all contacts with SpCas9 were required, and in particular, we found that the AcrIIA4 loop that inserts into SpCas9’s RuvC catalytic domain can be deleted. Our results show that AcrIIA4 inhibits SpCas9 primarily by blocking PAM binding and that its interaction with the SpCas9 catalytic domain is inessential.",

To evaluate design rules, we reduced the problem of DNA strand routing to the known problem of shortest-path finding in a weighted graph. To score candidate DNA strand routes we used a thermodynamic model that accounts for enthalpic and entropic contributions of initial binding, hybridization, and DNA loop closure. We encoded and analyzed new and previously reported design heuristics. Using design principles emerging from this analysis, we redesigned and fabricated multiple shapes and compared their folding accuracy using electrophoretic mobility analysis and electron microscopy imaging. Redesigned shapes showed 6- to 30-fold improvements in yield compared to original designs. We demonstrate accurate folding can be achieved by optimizing staple routes using our model and provide a computational framework for applying our methodology to any design.",

To investigate this in more detail, we performed infection assays in engineered cells promoting ACE2-mediated entry with and without TMPRSS2 coexpression. Electron microscopy and inhibitor experiments indicated TMPRSS2-mediated cell entry was associated with increased virion internalization into endosomes, and partially dependent upon clathrin-mediated endocytosis. TMPRSS2 increased panvariant uptake efficiency and enhanced early rates of virus replication, transcription, and secretion, with variant-specific profiles observed. On the host side, transcriptional profiling confirmed the magnitude of infection-induced antiviral and proinflammatory responses were linked to uptake efficiency, with TMPRSS2-assisted entry boosting early antiviral responses. In addition, TMPRSS2-enhanced infections increased rates of cytopathology, apoptosis, and necrosis and modulated virus secretion kinetics in a variant-specific manner. On the virus side, convergent signatures of cell-uptake-dependent innate immune induction were recorded in viral genomes, manifesting as switches in dominant coupled Nsp3 residues whose frequencies were correlated to the magnitude of the cellular response to infection. Experimentally, we demonstrated that selected Nsp3 mutations conferred enhanced interferon antagonism. More broadly, we show that TMPRSS2 orthologues from evolutionarily diverse mammals facilitate panvariant enhancement of cell uptake. In summary, our study uncovers previously unreported associations, linking cell entry efficiency to innate immune activation kinetics, cell death rates, virus secretion dynamics, and convergent selection of viral mutations. These data expand our understanding of TMPRSS2’s role in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and confirm its broader significance in zoonotic reservoirs and animal models.",

To date, all studied cyanobacterial lineages encode carbon fixation machinery relying upon form I Rubiscos within a CO 2 -concentrating carboxysome. Here, we report that the uncultivated anoxic marine zone (AMZ) IB lineage of Prochlorococcus from pelagic oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) harbors both form I and form II Rubiscos, the latter of which are typically noncarboxysomal and possess biochemical properties tuned toward low-oxygen environments. We demonstrate that these cyanobacterial form II enzymes are functional in vitro and were likely acquired from proteobacteria. Metagenomic analysis reveals that AMZ IB are essentially restricted to ODZs in the Eastern Pacific, suggesting that form II acquisition may confer an advantage under low-O 2 conditions. AMZ IB populations express both forms of Rubisco in situ, with the highest form II expression at depths where oxygen and light are low, possibly as a mechanism to increase the efficiency of photoautotrophy under energy limitation. Our findings expand the diversity of carbon fixation configurations in the microbial world and may have implications for carbon sequestration in natural and engineered systems.",

Yet to date, most studies have approached VWM as just serving perception beyond the immediate. Whether and how prospective actions shape information in VWM remains largely unknown, in part because typical experimental setups limit behavior to simple button presses. In two experiments (one preregistered), using a novel interactive VWM task, we show that the similarity of the actions that we intend to perform on memory items adaptively distorts their representation. Participants memorized the orientation of two bars, after which they were informed as to which manual actions they should reproduce these orientations with in a memory recall test. We observed that perceptually similar items were remembered as more distinct when paired with different action plans versus the same action plan. A control experiment showed that this action-induced effect reflects a true change in the visual representation rather than a motor bias. These findings demonstrate that VWM representations are flexibly adapted to guide specific overt actions and provide evidence that action plans can retrospectively warp sensory feature space in VWM.",

However, AVP administration also increases aggression, at least in “neurotypical” animals with intact AVP signaling. Here, we tested the effects of a voluntary drug administration method in low-social male rhesus monkeys with high autistic-like trait burden. Monkeys received nebulized AVP or placebo, using a within-subjects design. Study 1 (N = 8) investigated the effects of AVP administration on social cognition in two tests comparing responses to social versus nonsocial stimuli. Test 1: Placebo-administered monkeys lacked face recognition memory, whereas face recognition memory was “rescued” following AVP administration. In contrast, object recognition memory was intact and did not differ between administration conditions. Test 2: Placebo-administered monkeys did not respond to conspecific social communication cues, whereas following AVP administration, they reciprocated affiliative communication cues with species-typical affiliative responses. Importantly, AVP administration did not increase aggressive responses to conspecific aggressive or affiliative overtures. Study 2 (N = 4) evaluated the pharmacokinetics of this administration method. Following AVP nebulization, we observed a linear increase in cisternal CSF AVP levels, and a quadratic rise and fall in blood AVP levels. These findings indicate that nebulized AVP likely penetrates the central nervous system, selectively promotes species-typical responses to social information, and does not induce aggression in low-social individuals. Nebulized AVP therefore may hold promise for managing similar social symptoms in people with autism, particularly in very young or lower functioning individuals.",

Activity-dependent developmental mechanisms impact refinement of sensory circuits, but whether leptin-mediated postnatal neuronal activity specifies hypothalamic neural projections is largely unexplored. Here, we used chemogenetics to manipulate the activity of AgRP neurons during a discrete postnatal critical period and evaluated the development of AgRP inputs to the PVH and descending efferent outflow to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). In leptin-deficient mice, targeting of AgRP neuronal outgrowth to PVH oxytocin neurons was reduced, and despite the lack of leptin receptors found on oxytocin neurons in the PVH, oxytocin-containing connections to the DVC were also impaired. Activation of AgRP neurons during early postnatal life not only normalized AgRP inputs to the PVH but also oxytocin outputs to the DVC in leptin-deficient mice. Blocking AgRP neuron activity during the same postnatal period reduced the density of AgRP inputs to the PVH of wild type mice, as well as the density of oxytocin-containing DVC fibers, and these innervation deficits were associated with dysregulated autonomic function. These findings suggest that leptin-mediated AgRP neuronal activity is required for the development of PVH connectivity and represents a unique activity-dependent mechanism for specification of neural pathways involved in the hypothalamic integration of autonomic responses.",

The hypothesized process of emergent evolution posits that evolutionary change in at least some collective behaviors will differ from evolutionary change in the corresponding intrinsic behaviors of isolated individuals. As a result, collective behavior might evolve more rapidly and diversify more between populations compared to individual behavior. To test whether collective behavior evolves emergently, we conducted a large comparative study using 22 ant species and gathered over 1,500 behavioral rhythm time series from hundreds of colonies and isolated individuals, totaling over 1.5 y of behavioral data. We show that analogous traits measured at individual and collective levels exhibit distinct evolutionary patterns. The estimated rates of phenotypic evolution for the rhythmicity of activity in ant colonies were faster than the evolutionary rates of the same behavior measured in isolated individual ants, and total variation across species in collective behavior was higher than variation in individual behavior. We hypothesize that more rapid evolution and higher variation is a widespread feature of emergent phenotypes relative to lower-level phenotypes across complex biological systems.",

Unexpectedly, coadministration of mRNA vaccines encoding RdRp or the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) dampens RBD-specific immune responses. Contralateral administration reduces the suppression of RBD-specific T cell responses while type I interferon signaling blockade restores RBD-specific antibodies. A staggered immunization strategy maintains both RBD vaccine-mediated antibody and T cell responses as well as protection against lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge in human ACE2 transgenic mice. In HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice, the RdRp vaccine elicits CD8+ T cell responses against HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes recognized by human donor T cells.

However, whether PBLD regulates innate immune responses and viral replication is unclear. In this study, although it was found that the activity of PBLD extends to other PRRs, we focused on the RLR pathway activated via the p53–USP4–MAVS axis in response to virus infections. We found that PBLD deubiquitinates and stabilizes MAVS through ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4) to promote antiviral innate immunity. Mechanistically, PBLD activates the transcription of USP4 via the upregulation of p53. USP4, which is a MAVS-interacting protein, substantially stabilizes the MAVS protein by deconjugating K48-linked ubiquitination chains from the MAVS protein at Lys461 during RNA virus infection. Most intriguingly, RNA virus-infected primary macrophages (peritoneal macrophages, PMs, and bone marrow–derived macrophages, BMDMs) and internal organ cells (lung and liver) from PBLD-deficient mice suppress the IFN-I response and promote viral replication. Notably, PBLD-deficient mice are more susceptible to RNA virus infection than their wild-type littermates. Our findings highlight a unique function of PBLD in antiviral innate immunity through the p53–USP4–MAVS signaling, providing a preliminary basis for research on PBLD as a target molecule for treating RNA virus infection.",

An essential regulator of neuronal health, the cAMP-dependent transcription factor CREB positively regulates synaptic growth, learning, and memory. Phosphorylation of CREB by protein kinase A (PKA) and other cellular kinases promotes neuronal survival and maturation via transcriptional activation of a wide range of downstream target genes. CREB pathway dysfunction has been strongly implicated in AD pathogenesis, and recent data suggest that impaired CREB activation may contribute to disease phenotypes in FTD/ALS as well. However, the mechanisms behind reduced CREB activity in FTD/ALS pathology are not clear. In this study, we found that cortical-like neurons derived from iPSC lines carrying the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene, a common genetic cause of FTD/ALS, displayed a diminished activation of CREB, resulting in decreased dendritic and synaptic health. Importantly, we determined such impairments to be mechanistically linked to an imbalance in the ratio of regulatory and catalytic subunits of the CREB activator PKA and to be conserved in C9-ALS patient’s postmortem tissue. Modulation of cAMP upstream of this impairment allowed for a rescue of CREB activity and an amelioration of dendritic morphology and synaptic protein levels. Our data elucidate the mechanism behind early CREB pathway dysfunction and discern a feasible therapeutic target for the treatment of FTD/ALS and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Hitherto, ordered polar structures have been restricted to a limited number of ferroelectric materials, and there is no effective scheme to induce and manipulate ordered polar patterns in centrosymmetric nonpolar nanofilms due to the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we circumvent these limitations by utilizing the wrinkle-induced strain gradient modulation associated with flexoelectricity as a general means of inducing and manipulating ordered polar patterns in nonpolar nanofilms. Leveraging the surface instability caused by strain mismatch between oxide nanofilms and pre-strained compliant substrate, we successfully fabricate striped SrTiO 3 wrinkles, where well-ordered strain gradients and corresponding periodic polar patterns are readily achieved. Through in-situ piezoresponse force microscopy experiments, we show that the generated polar patterns can be manipulated by varying strain boundaries. Furthermore, the atomistic resolution images and first-principles calculations reveal that such wrinkle-induced ordered polar patterns primarily emerge from the flexoelectric coupling between the local polarization and strain gradients. These findings provide implications for manipulating polar structures by strain gradient and flexoelectric engineering, which in turn enable the realization of nontrivial polar structures in a broader range of materials.",

We establish the operational principles experimentally and computationally and evaluate system functionalities with a wide range of targets including live animal models and human subjects.

Mrc1 action increases DNA topological stress during plasmid replication, while Mrc1 or Tof1 activity causes replication stress and DNA damage within topologically constrained regions. We show that the recruitment of Top1 to the fork by Tof1 suppresses the DNA damage generated in these loci. While FPC activity introduces some DNA damage due to increased topological stress, the FPC is also necessary to prevent DNA damage in long replicons across the genome, indicating that the FPC is required for complete and faithful genome duplication.

          "abstract": "Recent experiments revealed a new amorphous ice phase, medium-density amorphous ice (MDA), formed by ball-milling ice I h at 77 K [Rosu-Finsen et al. , Science 379 , 474–478 (2023)]. MDA has density between that of low-density amorphous (LDA) and high-density amorphous (HDA) ices, adding to the complexity of water’s phase diagram, known for its glass polyamorphism and two-state thermodynamics. The nature of MDA and its relation to other amorphous ices and liquid water remain unsolved. Here, we use molecular simulations under controlled pressure and shear rate at 77 K to produce and investigate MDA. We find that MDA formed at constant shear rate is a steady-state nonequilibrium shear-driven amorphous ice (SDA), that can be produced by shearing ice I h , LDA, or HDA. Our results suggest that MDA could be obtained by ball-milling water glasses without crystallization interference. Increasing the shear rate at ambient pressure produces SDAs with densities ranging from LDA to HDA, revealing shear rate as a new thermodynamic variable in the nonequilibrium phase diagram of water. Indeed, shearing provides access to amorphous states inaccessible by controlling pressure and temperature alone. SDAs produced with shearing rates as high as 10 6 s −1 sample the same region of the potential energy landscape than hyperquenched glasses with identical density, pressure, and temperature. Intriguingly, SDAs obtained by shearing at ~10 8 s −1 have density, enthalpy, and structure indistinguishable from those of water “instantaneously” quenched from room temperature to 77 K over 10 ps, making them good approximants for the “true glass” of ambient liquid water.",

          "abstract": "Actin cytoskeleton drives the targeted transport of cell wall components to sustain the tip growth of pollen tubes for double fertilization; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Arabidopsis formin 5 (AtFH5), an actin-nucleating protein, localizes at secretory vesicles and mediates actin polymerization-based vesicle trafficking in pollen. Here, we demonstrate that AtFH5 determines the recruitment and transport of cell wall components in AtFH5-labeled vesicles during the tip growth of pollen tubes. Through a screen of interacting proteins of AtFH5, we identify many cell wall–related proteins, with arabinogalactan protein 23 (AGP23) occupying the highest frequency. AtFH5 interacts with AGP23 via its N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and jointly regulate the pollen germination and tube growth process. Further observations reveal that AGP23 co-localizes with AtFH5 at moving vesicles, germination sites, and pollen tube tips, suggesting that AGP23 is delivered by AtFH5-labeled vesicles. Deletion of the ECD of AtFH5 interrupts the dynamic localization and cell-wall connection of AGP23 in pollen grains and tubes. Cytological and genetic evidence shows that AGP23 and AtFH5 work in the same pathway to modulate cell wall composition. Together, our data uncover a role of formin in directing the sorting and deposition of cell wall components via secretory vesicle trafficking during pollen germination and tube growth.",

          "abstract": "Over 50 hereditary degenerative disorders are caused by expansions of short tandem DNA repeats (STRs). (GAA) n repeat expansions are responsible for Friedreich’s ataxia as well as late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs). Thus, the mechanisms of (GAA) n repeat expansions attract broad scientific attention. To investigate the role of DNA nicks in this process, we utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase system to introduce targeted nicks adjacent to the (GAA) n repeat tract. We found that DNA nicks 5′ of the (GAA) 100 run led to a dramatic increase in both the rate and scale of its expansion in dividing cells. Strikingly, they also promoted large-scale expansions of carrier- and large normal-size (GAA) n repeats, recreating, in a model system, the expansion events that occur in human pedigrees. DNA nicks 3′ of the (GAA) 100 repeat led to a smaller but significant increase in the expansion rate as well. Our genetic analysis implies that in dividing cells, conversion of nicks into double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication followed by DSB or fork repair leads to repeat expansions. Finally, we showed that 5′ GAA-strand nicks increase expansion frequency in nondividing yeast cells, albeit to a lesser extent than in dividing cells.",

While most of the substrates and products are relatively small and can permeate the shell, many of the encapsulated enzymes require cofactors that must be regenerated inside. We have analyzed the occurrence of an enzyme previously assigned as a cobalamin (vitamin B 12 ) reductase and, curiously, found it in many unrelated BMC types that do not employ B 12 cofactors. We propose Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regeneration as the function of this enzyme and name it Metabolosome Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Hydrogen (NADH) dehydrogenase (MNdh). Its partner shell protein BMC-T SE (tandem domain BMC shell protein of the single layer type for electron transfer) assists in passing the generated electrons to the outside. We support this hypothesis with bioinformatic analysis, functional assays, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, protein voltammetry, and structural modeling verified with X-ray footprinting. This finding represents a paradigm for the BMC field, identifying a new, widely occurring route for cofactor recycling and a new function for the shell as separating redox environments.",

No study to date has however separated out the contributions of change through time within vs. between hominin species while simultaneously incorporating effects of body size. Using a phylogenetic approach never applied before to paleoanthropological data, we show that relative brain size increase across ~7 My of hominin evolution arose from increases within individual species which account for an observed overall increase in relative brain size. Variation among species in brain size after accounting for this effect is associated with body mass differences but not time. In addition, our analysis also reveals that the within-species trend escalated in more recent lineages, implying an overall pattern of accelerating relative brain size increase through time.",

This year’s results, released last week, give a small, but meaningful, reason to be optimistic: Trust in scientists, which took a substantial hit during the pandemic, is starting to recover. The survey, conducted in October 2024 with 9593 adults across the United States, estimates that 76% of Americans now have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in scientists to act in the public’s best interests. That’s a modest uptick from 73% last year and a hopeful sign that the page may be turning on some of the pandemic-era skepticism. Although the increase is barely outside the margin of error, it may mark the end of a troubling 3-year decline. However, the data reveal a persistent problem—a considerable portion of the public continues to harbor negative views of scientists’ personal qualities, particularly their communication skills. This reality should be worrisome to the scientific community and drive a collective conversation about rebuilding public confidence.",

These observations contrast with the senescence-focused paradigm of old age that has dominated the literature for over a century yet are consistent with findings from behavioral ecology and life-history theory. Here, we review why the global loss of old individuals can be particularly detrimental to long-lived animals with indeterminate growth, increasing reproductive output with age, and those dependent on migration, sociality and cultural transmission for survival. Longevity conservation is needed to protect the important ecological roles an ecosystem services provided by old animals.",

In this work, we report the noncovalent synthesis of unprecedented plastics that are mechanically strong yet metabolizable under biologically relevant conditions owing to their dissociative nature with electrolytes. Salt-bridging sodium hexametaphosphate with di- or tritopic guanidinium sulfate in water forms a cross-linked supramolecular network, which is stable unless electrolytes are resupplied. This unusual stability is caused by a liquid-liquid phase separation that expels sodium sulfate, generated upon salt bridging, into a water-rich phase. Drying the remaining condensed liquid phase yields glassy plastics that are thermally reshapable, such as thermoplastics, and usable even in aqueous media with hydrophobic parylene C coating. This approach can be extended to polysaccharide-based supramolecular plastics that are applicable for three-dimensional printing.",

We demonstrate that selective depletion of arginase I (Arg1)–expressing tumor-associated macrophages (Arg1 + TAMs) inhibits tumor growth and concurrently reduces the ratio of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. Arg1 + TAMs secrete the chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4), which reinforces interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–induced T reg cell polarization into T H 1-T reg cells in a manner dependent on CXCR3 and the IFN-γ receptor. Both genetic PF4 inactivation and PF4 neutralization hinder T H 1-T reg cell accumulation in the TME and reduce tumor growth.

This revealed that specific arginine codons in the P-site are strong signals for ribosomal recruitment of human CNOT3, a CCR4-NOT subunit. Cryo–electron microscopy and transfer RNA (tRNA) mutagenesis demonstrated that the D-arms of select arginine tRNAs interact with CNOT3 and promote its recruitment whereas other tRNA D-arms sterically clash with CNOT3.

Metal oxide supports can partially or fully encapsulate metal nanoparticles, altering their electronic structure and reactivity. Restructuring is a main approach to creating active catalytic sites. The rational design of catalysts must anticipate that such restructurings can occur under reaction or catalytic conditions and gain knowledge of how they occur.

However, a substantial gap remains in integrating RNA expression data with spatial context across organs, primarily owing to the challenges associated with RNA detection within intact tissue volumes. Here, we developed Tris buffer–mediated retention of in situ hybridization chain reaction signal in cleared organs (TRISCO), an effective tissue-clearing method designed for whole-brain spatial three-dimensional (3D) RNA imaging. TRISCO resolved several crucial issues, including the preservation of RNA integrity, achieving uniform RNA labeling, and enhancing tissue transparency. We tested TRISCO using a broad range of cell-identity markers, noncoding and activity-dependent RNAs, within diverse organs of varying sizes and species. TRISCO thus emerges as a powerful tool for single-cell, whole-brain, 3D imaging that enables comprehensive transcriptional spatial analysis across the entire brain.",

We developed a library of amidinium ligands, of interest for their resonance effect–enhanced N–H bonds that may resist deprotonation, to increase the thermal stability of passivation layers on perovskite surfaces. This strategy resulted in a &gt;10-fold reduction in the ligand deprotonation equilibrium constant and a twofold increase in the maintenance of photoluminescence quantum yield after aging at 85°C under illumination in air. Implementing this approach, we achieved a certified quasi–steady-state PCE of 26.3% for inverted PSCs; and we report retention of ≥90% PCE after 1100 hours of continuous 1-sun maximum power point operation at 85°C.",

We then combined &gt;35 billion positions from 176,000 ships to produce a global estimate of whale-ship collision risk.

The hippocampus is hypothesized to bind together otherwise abstract combinations of stimuli to represent such latent contexts, to support the process of hidden state inference. Yet evidence for a role of the hippocampus in hidden state inference remains limited. We found that the ventral hippocampus is required for mice to perform hidden state inference during a two-armed bandit task. Hippocampal neurons differentiate the two abstract contexts required for this strategy in a manner similar to the differentiation of spatial locations, and their activity is essential for appropriate dopamine dynamics. These findings offer insight into how latent contextual information is used to optimize decisions, and they emphasize a key role for the hippocampus in hidden state inference.",

Here, we investigated the evolutionary origins of chimpanzee cumulative culture and why it remained incipient. To trace cultural transmission among the four chimpanzee subspecies, we compared population networks based on genetic markers of recent migration and shared cultural traits. We show that limited levels of group connectivity favored the emergence of a few instances of cumulative culture in chimpanzees. As in humans, cultural complexification likely happened in steps, with transmission between populations, incremental changes, and repurposing of technologies. We propose that divergence in social patterns led to increased mobility between groups in the genus Homo , resulting in irreversible dependence on cultural exchange and complexification.",

Genomic analyses of these haplotypes in archaic hominins and ancient human genomes suggest that a common three-copy haplotype, dating as far back as 800,000 years ago, has seeded rapidly evolving rearrangements through recurrent nonallelic homologous recombination. Additionally, haplotypes with more than three AMY1 copies have significantly increased in frequency among European farmers over the past 4000 years, potentially as an adaptive response to increased starch digestion.",

          "abstract": "Reasoning about someone’s thoughts and intentions—i.e., forming a “theory of mind”—is a core aspect of social cognition and relies on association areas of the brain that have expanded disproportionately in the human lineage. We recently showed that these association zones comprise parallel distributed networks that, despite occupying adjacent and interdigitated regions, serve dissociable functions. One network is selectively recruited by social cognitive processes. What circuit properties differentiate these parallel networks? Here, we show that social cognitive association areas are intrinsically and selectively connected to anterior regions of the medial temporal lobe that are implicated in emotional learning and social behaviors, including the amygdala at or near the basolateral complex and medial nucleus. The results suggest that social cognitive functions emerge through coordinated activity between internal circuits of the amygdala and a broader distributed association network, and indicate the medial nucleus may play an important role in social cognition in humans.",

To identify sleep drive neurons, we imaged Drosophila brains with calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI). The results indicate that the activity of the protocerebral bridge (PB) correlates with sleep drive. We further identified a key three-layer PB circuit, EPG-SpsP-PEcG, in which the four SpsP neurons in the PB respond to ellipsoid body (EB) signals from EPG neurons and send signals back to the EB through PEcG neurons. This circuit is strengthened by sleep deprivation, indicating a plasticity response to sleep drive. SpsP neurons also receive inputs from the sensorimotor brain region, suggesting that they may encode sleep drive by integrating sensorimotor and navigation cues. Together, our experiments show that the four SpsP neurons and their sleep regulatory circuit play an important and dynamic role in sleep regulation.",

This is the earliest large-scale Archaic fish-trapping facility recorded in ancient Mesoamerica. We suggest that such landscape-scale intensification may have been a response to long-term climate disturbance recorded between 2200 and 1900 BCE. Agricultural intensification after 2000 BCE has been credited for supporting the rise of pre-Columbian civilizations in Formative Mesoamerica, but we suggest that some groups relied more heavily on the mass harvesting of aquatic resources. We argue that such early intensification of aquatic food production offered a high value subsistence strategy that was instrumental in the emergence of Formative period sedentarism and the development of complexity among pre-Columbian civilizations like the Maya.",

LRRK2 is a guanine nucleotide–binding protein, but the mechanism of direct regulation of its GTPase activity remains unclear and its physiological GEF is not known. Here, we identified CalDAG-GEFI (CDGI) as a physiological GEF for LRRK2. CDGI interacts with LRRK2 and increases its GDP to GTP exchange activity. CDGI modulates LRRK2 cellular functions and LRRK2-induced neurodegeneration in both LRRK2 Drosophila and mouse models. Together, this study identified the physiological GEF for LRRK2 and provides strong evidence that LRRK2 GTPase is regulated by GAPs and GEFs. The LRRK2 GTPase, GAP, or GEF activities have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets, which is distinct from the direct LRRK2 kinase inhibition.",

          "abstract": "To date, the understanding of various modes of CO 2 mass transport remains incomplete, impeding the transfer of catalysts identified in the more accessible electrochemical batch cells to high-performance flow cells. In this work, we demonstrate that the meniscus region formed between the electrode and the convex liquid level due to the electrowetting of the catalyst plays a vital role in the CO 2 RR in batch cells. CO 2 RR in the meniscus region in batch cells exhibits similar performance with that in flow cells, and the performance disparity between these two configurations largely disappears when conducting CO 2 RR primarily in the meniscus region. An assembled double-sided gas diffusion electrode with a gas channel is developed to maximize the meniscus-like region, achieving a CO 2 RR partial current density of 640 mA/cm 2 geo on commercial Cu in the KHCO 3 electrolyte. This performance represents the highest CO 2 RR activity in neutral buffered media.",

Micro- to nanoscale microscopy of a unique impact-shocked zircon from the regolith breccia meteorite NWA7034 reveals textural and chemical indicators of hydrothermal conditions on Mars during crystallization 4.45 billion years ago. Element distribution maps show sharp alternating zoning defined by marked enrichments of non-formula elements, such as Fe, Al, and Na, and ubiquitous nanoscale magnetite inclusions. The zoning and inclusions are similar to those reported in terrestrial zircon crystallizing in the presence of aqueous fluid and are here interpreted as primary features recording zircon growth from exsolved hydrous fluids at ~4.45 billion years. The unique record of crustal processes preserved in this grain survived early impact bombardment and provides previously unidentified petrological evidence for a wet pre-Noachian martian crust.",

We assessed the topography of focused ultrasound subthalamotomy ( n = 39) by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to identify statistically validated brain voxels with the optimal effect against each cardinal feature and their respective cortical connectivity patterns by diffusion-weighted tractography. Bradykinesia and rigidity amelioration were associated with ablation of the rostral motor STN subregion connected to the supplementary motor and premotor cortices, whereas antitremor effect was explained by lesioning the posterolateral STN projection to the primary motor cortex. These findings were corroborated prospectively in another PD cohort ( n = 12). This work concurs with recent deep brain stimulation findings that suggest different corticosubthalamic circuits underlying each PD cardinal feature. Our results provide sound evidence in humans of segregated anatomy of subthalamic-cortical connections and their distinct role in PD pathophysiology and normal motor control.",

Genome-wide analysis revealed that this score is highly heritable, identifying loci associated with iron homeostasis, and driven by peripheral iron levels. Our score predicted gait abnormalities and showed a U-shaped relationship with PD risk, identifying individuals with threefold increased risk. These results establish a hormetic relationship between brain iron and PD risk, where central iron levels are strongly determined by genetics via peripheral iron.

Cell-surface expression of transporters is regulated by substrates and intracellular signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that substrates of the dopamine transporter (DAT), amphetamine and dopamine, synergize with protein kinase C (PKC)–dependent DAT ubiquitination to markedly elevate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of DAT, which is accompanied by DAT movement out of plasma membrane protrusions with a negative curvature. Disruption of the outward-open (OO) DAT conformation or its stabilization in the inward-open (IO) conformation recapitulates substrate effects on DAT endocytosis. Amphetamine strongly increases PKC-dependent endocytosis of norepinephrine transporter (NET) but not of serotonin transporter (SERT), correlating with a substantially weaker ubiquitination of SERT compared to NET. We propose a “shape-transition” model whereby shifting from convex-shaped OO conformers to IO conformers minimizes retention of transporters in negatively curved membranes, which facilitates their PKC-dependent ubiquitination and recruitment to positively invaginated clathrin-coated membranes, driving robust transporter endocytosis.",

The distinguished aspects of this method include the exceptional stability of the dearomatized products and impressive versatility of the recovered substrates in the construction of enantioenriched helical frameworks.

We prove that, as the strength of quantum noise continuously increases from 0, the quantum advantage diminishes gradually and eventually vanishes. Unexpectedly, in some cases, we observe the phenomenon of a sudden death of quantum advantage: When the noise strength exceeds a certain threshold, the quantum advantage abruptly disappears from a substantial level.

Tumor cells infiltrating PTB from TC behave more like oligodendrocyte progenitor cells than astrocytes at the transcriptome level. Dual-omics analyses further suggest that the distal regulatory regions in the tumor genome and specific transcription factors are potential determinants of regional heterogeneity. Notably, while activator protein 1 (AP-1) is active in all GBM states, its activity declines from TC to PTB, with another transcription factor, BACH1, showing the opposite trend.

Here, we propose a high-order direct modulation terahertz communication framework using a wideband time-coding metachip modulator. The modulator leverages the electromagnetic resonance properties within the metaunit structure, with control enabled by gallium arsenide Schottky diodes. By manipulating the timing of voltage pulses applied to these diodes, the equivalent electromagnetic resonance distributions can be precisely regulated in the time domain. This enables independent and accurate control over the amplitude and phase of terahertz harmonics. Leveraging this technique, three high-order modulation schemes—quadrature phase-shift keying, 16-phase-shift keying, and 16-quadrature amplitude modulation— are achieved in a direct modulation and direct detection system, demonstrating the real-time image transmission.

          "abstract": "Considering the characteristics and operating environment of remotely controlled miniature soft robots, achieving delicate adhesion control over various target surfaces is a substantial challenge. In particular, the ability to delicately grasp wrinkled and soft biological and nonbiological surfaces with low preload without causing damage is essential. The proposed adhesive robotic system, inspired by the secretions from a velvet worm, uses a structured magnetorheological material that exhibits precise adhesion control with stability and repeatability by the rapid stiffness change controlled by an external magnetic field. The proposed adhesion protocol involves controlling soft-state adhesion, maintaining a large contact area, and enhancing the elastic modulus, and the mechanical structure enhances the effectiveness of this protocol. Demonstrations of the remote adhesive robot include stable transportation in soft and wet organs, unscrewing a nut from a bolt, and supporting mouse tumor removal surgery. These results indicate the potential applicability of the soft adhesive robot in biomedical engineering, especially for targeting small-scale biological tissues and organisms.",

          "abstract": "A dynamic equilibrium between dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) is essential for striatal circuitry and motor function, as imbalances are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Conventional theories posit that cholinergic signaling is pathologically elevated in PD as a result of increased ACh release, which contributes to motor deficits. However, using approaches to measure receptor-mediated signaling, we found that, rather than the predicted enhancement, the strength of cholinergic transmission at muscarinic M4 receptor synapses on direct pathway medium spiny neurons was decreased in dopamine-depleted mice. This adaptation was due to a reduced postsynaptic M4 receptor function, resulting from down-regulated receptors and downstream signaling. Restoring M4 transmission unexpectedly led to a partial alleviation of motor deficits and LID dyskinetic behavior, revealing an unexpected prokinetic effect in addition to the canonical antikinetic role of M4 receptors. These findings indicate that decreased M4 function differentially contributes to parkinsonian and LID pathophysiology, representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention.",

Crucial is the molecular dynamics of the supramolecular polymers: They dictate the interaction strength with the stress-stiffening polymer and the subsequent dynamic mechanical properties of the mixed networks.

We determine that the carotenoid lutein underlies the yellow phenotype and describe microstructural feather features likely to enhance color appearance. These same features reduce predicted water shedding capacity of feathers, a potential liability in the tropics. Through genome-scale DNA sequencing of hybrids and each species in the genus, we identify BCO2 as the major gene responsible for the color polymorphism. The BCO2 gene tree and genome-wide allele frequency patterns suggest that carotenoid-pigmented collars initially arose in a third species and reached the hybrid zone through historical gene flow. Complex interplay between sexual selection and hybridization has thus shaped phenotypes of these species, where conspicuous sexual traits are key to male reproductive success.",

Here, we overcome a high degree of continuous conformational heterogeneity to determine the 2.8-Å cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the complete human TSC in complex with the lysosomal recruitment factor WD repeat domain phosphoinositide–interacting protein 3 (WIPI3). We discover a previously undetected amino-terminal TSC1 HEAT repeat dimer that clamps onto a single TSC wing and forms a phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)–binding pocket, which specifically binds monophosphorylated PIPs. These structural advances provide a model by which WIPI3 and PIP-signaling networks coordinate to recruit TSC to the lysosomal membrane to inhibit mTORC1. The high-resolution TSC structure reveals previously unrecognized mutational hotspots and uncovers crucial insights into the mechanisms of TSC dysregulation in disease.",

Because experimental and computational studies identify undercoordinated Ni step sites as most active toward CH 4 formation, we eliminate Ni step sites by atomically dispersing Ni into networked, nanoparticulate CeO 2 aerogels. The mesoporous catalyst with 2.5 atomic % Ni in CeO 2 is highly active for WGS, converting near-equilibrium levels of CO at 350°C, while no CH 4 is detected at the limit of detection (&lt;2 parts per million). In contrast, supporting low weight percentages of Ni clusters or nanoparticles on CeO 2 aerogels leads to methanation. The CH 4 yield produced by the atomically dispersed Ni-substituted CeO 2 aerogel is over an order of magnitude lower than previously reported Ni-based catalysts claiming methane suppression, marking an important advance in the development of WGS catalysts.",

Here, we describe how pseudokinase serine threonine kinase 40 (STK40) facilitates T H 1/T H 17 differentiation under pathological conditions. STK40 in T cells is dispensable for immune homeostasis in resting mice. However, mice with T cell–specific deletion of STK40 exhibit attenuated symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis, accompanied by diminished T H 1 and T H 17 cell differentiation. Mechanistically, STK40 facilitates K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of FOXO1/4 through promoting their interaction with E3 ligase COP1. Inhibition of FOXO4 or FOXO1, respectively, restores differentiation potential of STK40-deficient T H 1/T H 17 cells. Together, our data suggest a crucial role of STK40 in T H 1 and T H 17 cell differentiation, thereby enabling better understanding of the molecular regulatory network of CD4 + T cell differentiation and providing effective targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

Using a state-of-the-art global climate model, we conduct freshwater hosing experiments to reexamine AMOC sensitivity and its climate impacts. The Irminger basin emerges as the most effective region for additional freshwater fluxes, causing the greatest AMOC weakening. While global temperature and precipitation responses are relatively homogeneous, subcontinental responses—especially in the northern mid-latitudes—are heterogeneous. At high latitudes, sea ice responses to freshwater fluxes and associated ice-albedo feedbacks determine temperature changes. In tropical and extratropical regions, temperature dynamics are shaped by atmospheric circulation and oceanic heat transport. Precipitation shows seasonal and regional variability due to altered surface turbulent heat flux and the southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The widespread heterogeneity in climate extremes underscores the need to monitor freshwater release regions linked to AMOC slowdown. These findings hold vital implications for understanding paleoclimate and future AMOC impacts.",

Here, we present an approach that allows the adaptation of well-established reflection matrix techniques to scattering compensation in incoherent fluorescence imaging. We experimentally demonstrate that a small number of conventional wide-field fluorescence microscope images acquired under unknown random illuminations can effectively be used to construct a virtual fluorescence-based reflection matrix.

In the eye, however, CMV retinitis is thought to result from virus-driven necrosis in the absence of T cell responses. We found that MCMV infection of newborn mice recapitulates human eye disease after congenital CMV infection, including focal chorioretinitis, inflamed vasculature, and disrupted blood-retinal barriers. Moreover, infection drove extensive T cell infiltration of the retina and marked gliosis. Blocking immune responses generally, or via targeting the chemokine receptor CXCR3, did not exacerbate retinal disease but instead prevented pathology despite retinal MCMV infection.

The vortex pattern in the twisted BaTiO 3 bilayer supports localized electronic states with quasi-flat bands, associated with the interlayer hybridization of oxygen p z orbitals. We found that the associated bandwidth reaches a minimum at ∼19 ∘ twisting, configuring the largest magic angle in moiré systems reported so far.

          "abstract": "It remains a grand challenge to develop electrocatalysts with simultaneously high activity, long durability, and low cost for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), originating from two competing reaction pathways and often trade-off performances. The adsorbed evolution mechanism (AEM) suffers from sluggish kinetics due to a linear scaling relationship, while the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) causes unstable structures due to lattice oxygen escape. We propose a MoZnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) incorporating AEM-promoter Mo and LOM-active Zn to achieve dual activation and stabilization for efficient and durable OER. Density functional theory and chemical probe experiments confirmed dual-mechanism activation, with representative Co-Co † -Mo sites facilitating AEM and Zn-O † -Ni sites enhancing LOM, resulting in an ultralow OER overpotential (η 10 = 221 mV). The multielement interaction, high-entropy structure, and carbon network notably enhance structural stability for durable catalysis (&gt;1500 hours at 100 mA cm −2 ). Our work offers a viable approach to concurrently enhance OER activity and stability by designing HEA catalysts to enable dual-mechanism synergy.",

          "abstract": "Dendrite growth in solid-state sodium batteries (SSBs) is one of the most concerned issues that critically affect the battery efficiency and cycling performance. Here, by designing a fluorescent Eu 3+ -doped Na 3 Zr 2 Si 2 PO 12 solid electrolyte (SE) to facilitate three-dimensional (3D) optical imaging on a confocal laser scanning microscopy, a fluorescence tomography (FT) method is developed for observing the sodium dendrite growth during charge/discharge cycles of the SSBs in a 3D view. It is quantitatively revealed that small-size sodium islands appear after several cycles, and with the cycles increasing, large-size dendrites in tens of micrometers gradually form until a critical sodium dendrite volume arrives where a short circuit or severe performance deterioration occurs. Furthermore, by regulating the Eu 3+ doping ratio, a record-high sodium plating/stripping cycling stability for more than 1 year (487.5 days) is achieved at 25°C. This work demonstrates an FT method observing sodium dendrite growth in SSBs and will promote the functional design of high-performance SEs.",

          "abstract": "The timing, tempo, and causative mechanisms of Ocean Anoxic Event 1a (OAE1a), one of several such abrupt perturbations of the Mesozoic global carbon cycle, remain uncertain. Mudstones interbedded with tuffs in Hokkaido, Japan preserve carbon and osmium isotope shifts recording OAE1a. U-Pb zircon ages of tuffs constrain the OAE1a onset to 119.55 +0.072/−0.079 million years ago (Ma) and its duration to 1116 +87/−93 thousand years (kyr). Isotopic excursions of osmium followed by carbon that mark the rapid onset of OAE1a each lasted ~115 kyr. Critically, the occurrence of index fossil Leupoldina cabri in the Hokkaido OAE1a section, which also caps and thus postdate Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) basalts, has a U-Pb zircon age of ~118.7 to 118.4 Ma. Therefore, OJP volcanism remains a probable source of unradiogenic osmium and light carbon and a causative mechanism of OAE1a.",

          "abstract": "Plasmon resonance represents the collective oscillation of free electron gas density and enables enhanced light-matter interactions in nanoscale dimensions. Traditionally, the classical Drude model describes plasmonic excitation, wherein plasma frequency exhibits no spatial dispersion. Here, we show conclusive experimental evidence of the breakdown of plasmon resonance and a consequent metal-insulator transition in an ultrathin refractory plasmonic material, hafnium nitride (HfN). Epitaxial HfN thick films exhibit a low-loss and high-quality Drude-like plasmon resonance in the visible spectral range. However, as the film thickness is reduced to nanoscale dimensions, Coulomb interaction among electrons increases because of electron confinement, leading to the spatial dispersion of plasma frequency. With a further decrease in thickness, electrons lose their ability to shield the incident electric field, turning the medium into a dielectric. The observed metal-insulator transition might carry some signatures of Wigner crystallization and indicates that such transdimensional, between 2D and 3D, films can serve as a promising playground to study strongly correlated electron systems.",
