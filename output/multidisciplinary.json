          "abstract": "Prevailing frameworks to address planetary environmental challenges tend to focus on setting goals, targets, or boundaries to limit human harm to ecosystems or species. Here we propose an aspirational approach aimed at empowering people to shape a better future for all of life on Earth. We do this by building on the human development approach and its supporting metrics, especially the Human Development Index (HDI), a broadly influential framework that has contributed to decades of human progress by measuring and promoting people’s capabilities to lead the lives that they value. Rather than assessing the state or dynamics of the biosphere, we propose the Nature Relationship Index (NRI), which would focus on measuring the progress of nations towards delivering mutually beneficial relationships among people and the rest of the living world in terms that people widely understand and value. Through an open-ended process informed by expert consultation, international concept testing and indicator development, the NRI could help to incentivize progress towards a world in which humanity thrives together with the rest of life on Earth. We explore the challenges and opportunities of developing a robust NRI and invite broader participation to facilitate this development in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report.",

          "abstract": "The dendritic cell (DC)-initiated and sustained cancer immunity cycle is indispensable for effective endogenous and therapeutically mobilized antitumour T cell responses1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. This necessitates the continuous migration of antigen-carrying DCs from the tumour microenvironment (TME) to the tumour draining lymph nodes (tdLNs)7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Here, through longitudinal analysis of human and mouse tumours, we observed a progressive decrease in migratory conventional DCs (mig-cDCs) in the tdLNs during tumour progression. This decline compromised tumour-specific T cell priming and subsequent T cell supply to the TME. Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and its substrate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as key modulators of DC migration. Advanced tumours disrupted cGMP synthesis in DCs to decrease their motility, while PDE5 perturbation preserved the cGMP pool to restore DC migration. Mechanistically, cGMP enhanced myosin-II activity through Rho-associated factors, extending the paradigm of cGMP-regulated amoeboid migration from Dictyostelium to mammalian immune cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 using sildenafil restored mig-cDC homing to late-stage tdLNs and sustained antitumour immunity in a DC-dependent manner. Our findings bridge fundamental DC interstitial motility to antitumour immunity, revealing that its disruption in chaotic TME promotes immune evasion, and its enhancement offers a promising direction for DC-centric immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "The Tweety homologues (TTYHs) constitute a family of eukaryotic membrane proteins that, on the basis of structural features, were recently proposed to contribute to lipid transfer between soluble carriers and cellular membranes 1 . However, in the absence of supporting data, this function was hypothetical. Here through pull-down of endogenous proteins, we identify APOE as the interaction partner of human TTYH2. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry assays showed that both proteins colocalize in endosomal compartments. Characterization of the specific interaction between APOE and TTYH2 through binding assays and structural studies enabled us to identify an epitope in an extended domain of TTYH2 that faces the endosomal lumen. Structures of complexes with APOE-containing lipoprotein particles revealed a binding mode that places lipids in a suitable position to facilitate their diffusion into the membrane. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed that lipid transfer is accelerated by TTYH2. Collectively, our findings indicate that TTYH2 has a role in the unloading of APOE-containing lipoproteins after they are endocytosed. These results define a new protein class that facilitates the extraction of lipids from and their insertion into cellular membranes. Although ubiquitous, this process could be of particular relevance in the brain, where APOE is involved in the transfer of lipids between astrocytes and neurons.",

          "abstract": "Postmitotic neurons have high levels of methylated cytosine and its oxidized intermediates such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine1. However, the functional relevance of these epigenetic modifications of DNA are poorly understood. Here we show that some cytidine analogues, such as cytarabine, cause DNA double-strand breaks during TET-mediated active 5-methylcytosine demethylation by interrupting TDG-dependent base excision repair. These double-strand breaks are frequently converted into deletions and translocations by DNA ligase 4. In vivo, Purkinje and Golgi cells in the cerebellum are the only neuronal populations that exhibit high levels of DNA damage due to cytarabine. In Purkinje cells, TET targets highly expressed gene bodies marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. Many of these genes control movement coordination, which explains the long-recognized cerebellar neurotoxicity of cytarabine2. We show that other cytidine analogues, such as gemcitabine, cause only single-strand breaks in neurons, which are repaired by DNA ligase 3 with minimal toxicity. Our findings uncover a mechanistic link between TET-mediated DNA demethylation, base excision repair and gene expression in neurons. The results also provide a rational explanation for the different neurotoxicity profiles of an important class of antineoplastic agents.",

Whether the same coding principle holds for dynamic cognitive variables remains unknown because internal cognitive processes unfold with a unique time course on single trials observed only in the irregular spiking of heterogeneous neural populations 3–8 . Here we show the existence of such a population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex. We developed an approach to simultaneously infer population dynamics and tuning functions of single neurons to the population state. Applied to spike data recorded during decision-making, our model revealed that populations of neurons encoded the same dynamic variable predicting choices, and heterogeneous firing rates resulted from the diverse tuning of single neurons to this decision variable. The inferred dynamics indicated an attractor mechanism for decision computation. Our results reveal a unifying geometric principle for neural encoding of sensory and dynamic cognitive variables.",

          "abstract": "Tailoring magnetic ordering in solid-state materials is essential for emerging spintronics1,2. However, substitutional lattice doping in magnetic semiconductors is often constrained by the low solubility of magnetic elements3,4,5, limiting the maximum achievable doping concentration (for example, less than 5%) and ferromagnetic ordering temperature6. The intercalation of magnetic elements in layered two-dimensional atomic crystals (2DACs) without breaking in-plane covalent bonds offers an alternative approach to incorporate a much higher concentration of magnetic atoms (for example, up to 50%) beyond the typical solubility limit. However, commonly used chemical and electrochemical intercalation methods are largely confined to a few isolated examples so far. Here we report a general two-step intercalation and cation-exchange strategy to produce a library of highly ordered magnetic intercalation superlattices (MISLs) with tunable magnetic ordering. Monovalent transition-metal cations Cu+ and Ag+, divalent magnetic cations Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+, and trivalent rare-earth cations Eu3+ and Gd3+ have been successfully incorporated into group-VIB 2DACs, including MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2, and group-IVB, -VB, -IIIA, -IVA and -VA 2DACs, including TiS2, NbS2, NbSe2, TaS2, In2Se3, SnSe2, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. We show that these MISLs can be prepared with tunable concentrations of magnetic intercalants, enabling tailored magnetic ordering across a diverse array of functional 2DACs, including semiconductors, topological insulators, and superconductors. This work establishes a versatile material platform for both fundamental investigations and spintronics applications.",

          "abstract": "All-solid-state batteries require advanced cathode designs to realize their potential for high energy density and economic viability1,2,3. Integrated all-in-one cathodes, which eliminate inactive conductive additives and heterogeneous interfaces, hold promise for substantial energy and stability gains but are hindered by materials lacking sufficient Li+/e− conductivity, mechanical robustness and structural stability4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we present Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4, a cost-effective halide material that overcomes these challenges. Leveraging reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox and rapid Li+/e− transport within its framework, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 achieves an electrode energy density of 529.3 Wh kg−1 versus Li+/Li. Critically, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 shows unique dynamic properties during cycling, including reversible local Fe migration and a brittle-to-ductile transition that confers self-healing behaviour. This enables exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 90% capacity retention for 3,000 cycles at a rate of 5 C. Integration of Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 with a nickel-rich layered oxide further increases the energy density to 725.6 Wh kg−1. By harnessing the advantageous dynamic mechanical and diffusion properties of all-in-one halides, this work establishes all-in-one halides as an avenue for energy-dense, durable cathodes in next-generation all-solid-state batteries.",

It has been predicted that linear dysprosium(III) compounds could deliver greater m J (the projection of the total angular momentum, J , on a quantization axis labelled z ) state splitting and therefore higher U eff and hysteresis temperatures 18–21 , but as lanthanide bonding is predominantly ionic 22,23 , so far dysprosium bis(amide) complexes have shown highly bent geometries that promote fast magnetic reversal 24,25 .

Calculations show that the U eff value for 1-Dy arises from the charge-dense amide ligands, with a pendant alkene taking a structural role to enforce a large N–Dy–N angle while imposing only a weak equatorial interaction. This leads to molecular spin dynamics up to 100 times slower than the current best single-molecule magnets above 90 K.",

However, the precise impact of cancer-associated neurons and the communication channels at the nerve–cancer interface remain poorly understood. Previous cancer denervation models in rodents and humans have highlighted robust cancer dependency on nerves, but the underlying mechanisms that drive nerve-mediated cancer aggressivity remain unknown2,3. Here we show that cancer-associated neurons enhance cancer metabolic plasticity by transferring mitochondria to cancer cells. Breast cancer denervation and nerve–cancer coculture models confirmed that neurons significantly improve tumour energetics. Neurons cocultured with cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, resulting in increased mitochondrial mass and subsequent transfer of mitochondria to adjacent cancer cells. To precisely track the fate of recipient cells, we developed MitoTRACER, a reporter of cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer that permanently labels recipient cancer cells and their progeny. Lineage tracing and fate mapping of cancer cells acquiring neuronal mitochondria in primary tumours revealed their selective enrichment at metastatic sites following dissemination. Collectively, our data highlight the enhanced metastatic capabilities of cancer cells that receive mitochondria from neurons in primary tumours, shedding new light on how the nervous system supports cancer metabolism and metastatic dissemination.",

However, established methods for time-resolved CPL (TRCPL) characterization have notable limitations 8–17 , generally requiring a compromise between sensitivity, accessible timescales and spectral information. This has limited the acquisition of in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. Here we demonstrate a high-sensitivity (noise level of the order of 10 −4 ), broadband (about 400–900 nm), transient (nanosecond resolution, millisecond range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. The achieved combination of high-sensitivity, broad wavelength response and flexible time ranges represents a substantial advancement over previous TRCPL approaches. As a result, TRCPL measurements are shown to be applicable to hitherto inaccessible material systems and photophysical processes, including systems with low (10 −3 ) dissymmetry factors and luminescence pathways spanning nanosecond to millisecond time ranges. Finally, full-Stokes measurements allow tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components, of interest by themselves, but especially relevant in the context of controlling for associated CPL artefacts 18,19 in the time domain.",

However, the lack of three-dimensional structures hinders our understanding of its precise working mechanism.

These structures reveal a distinct asymmetric heterodimer architecture, with sucralose binding exclusively to the Venus flytrap domain of TAS1R2. Combining mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations, this work delineates the sweeteners recognition modes in TAS1R2.

          "abstract": "Aggregation pheromone, 4-vinylanisole (4VA), is specifically released by gregarious migratory locusts, and is crucial in forming locust swarms that cause destructive plagues1. Control of locust plagues relies heavily on the extensive application of chemical pesticides, which has led to severe environmental and health issues2. As pheromones are primary mediators of insect communication and behaviour3, exploring their biosynthesis can provide important cues to develop innovative behavioural regulators, potentially reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Here we resolve the biosynthesis of 4VA and behavioural responses of locusts when enzymes in the 4VA biosynthetic pathway are manipulated. The process initiates with phenylalanine derived from food plants and proceeds through three precursors: cinnamic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid and 4-vinylphenol (4VP). Notably, the conversion from 4VP to 4VA through methylation is unique to gregarious locusts. This step is catalysed by two crucial methyltransferases, 4VPMT1 and 4VPMT2. Guided by the X-ray co-crystal structure of 4VPMT2 bound with 4VP and S-adenosyl-l-methionine, we developed 4-nitrophenol as a substrate surrogate. We identified several chemicals that can block 4VA production by inhibiting the enzymatic activities of 4VPMT proteins, thereby suppressing locust aggregative behaviour. The findings uncover the chemical logic behind 4VA biosynthesis and pinpoint two crucial enzymes as novel targets for locust swarm management.",

However, with each physical qubit needing multiple control lines, a fundamental barrier to scale is the extreme density of connections that bridge quantum devices to their external control and readout hardware 4–6 . A promising solution is to co-locate the control system proximal to the qubit platform at milli-kelvin temperatures, wired up by miniaturized interconnects 7–10 . Even so, heat and crosstalk from closely integrated control have the potential to degrade qubit performance, particularly for two-qubit entangling gates based on exchange coupling that are sensitive to electrical noise 11,12 . Here we benchmark silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-style electron spin qubits controlled by heterogeneously integrated cryo-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cryo-CMOS) circuits with a power density sufficiently low to enable scale-up. Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently perform universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that milli-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates. Given the complexity of our sub-kelvin CMOS platform, with about 100,000 transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a ‘chiplet-style’ control architecture.",

Through an analysis of computer-vision research papers and citing patents, we found that most of these documents enable the targeting of human bodies and body parts. Comparing the 1990s to the 2010s, we observed a fivefold increase in the number of these computer-vision papers linked to downstream surveillance-enabling patents. Additionally, our findings challenge the notion that only a few rogue entities enable surveillance. Rather, we found that the normalization of targeting humans permeates the field. This normalization is especially striking given patterns of obfuscation. We reveal obfuscating language that allows documents to avoid direct mention of targeting humans, for example, by normalizing the referring to of humans as ‘objects’ to be studied without special consideration. Our results indicate the extensive ties between computer-vision research and surveillance.",

          "abstract": "The broad bandgap tunability of both perovskites and organic semiconductors enables the development of perovskite–organic tandem solar cells with promising theoretical efficiency. However, the certified efficiencies of reported perovskite–organic tandem solar cells remain lower than those of single-junction perovskite solar cells, primarily because of insufficient near-infrared photocurrent in narrow-bandgap organic subcells1,2,3. Here we design and synthesize an asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), P2EH-1V, featuring a unilateral conjugated π-bridge to reduce the optical bandgap to 1.27 eV while maintaining ideal exciton dissociation and nanomorphology. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms efficient hole transfer from P2EH-1V to the donor PM6. Devices based on P2EH-1V exhibit reduced non-radiative voltage losses of 0.20 eV without compromising charge-generation efficiency. We achieve a 17.9% efficiency for the organic bottom cell, with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 28.60 mA cm−2. Furthermore, we minimize interface recombination losses, enabling the perovskite top cell to achieve an impressive open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.37 V and a fill factor (FF) of 85.5%. These advancements result in perovskite–organic tandem solar cells achieving a record efficiency of 26.7% (certified at 26.4%) over an aperture area greater than 1 cm2.",

          "abstract": "Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics 1–4 . Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware 5–8 , but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modelled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities and may change their material properties with use 9–12 . Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot’s actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots’ materials, actuation or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.",

Aged a few million up to a few billion years, debris disks have lost their primordial gas, and their dust is produced by steady-state collisions between larger, rocky bodies1,2. Tens of debris disks, with sizes of tens, sometimes hundreds, of astronomical units have been resolved with high-spatial-resolution, high-contrast imagers at optical and near-infrared or (sub)millimetre interferometers3,4. They commonly show cavities, ring-like structures and gaps, which are often regarded as indirect signatures of the presence of planets that gravitationally interact with unseen planetesimals2,5. However, no planet responsible for these features has been detected yet, probably because of the limited sensitivity (typically 2–10 MJ) of high-contrast imaging instruments (see, for example, refs. 6,7,8,9) before the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we have used the unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument10,11 in the thermal infrared to search for such planets in the disk of the approximately 6.4-Myr-old star TWA 7. With its pole-on orientation, this three-ring debris disk is indeed ideally suited for such a detection. We unambiguously detected a source 1.5 arcsec from the star, which is best interpreted as a cold, sub-Jupiter-mass planet. Its estimated mass (about 0.3 MJ) and position (about 52 au, de-projected) can thoroughly account for the main disk structures.",

Genetic code expansion offers a general approach for ncAA encoding by reassigning stop codons as the ‘blank’ codon; however, it is not completely orthogonal to translation termination for cellular transcripts. Here, to generate more bona fide blank codons, we developed an RNA codon-expansion (RCE) strategy that introduces and decodes bioorthogonally assignable pseudouridine (Ψ) codons (ΨGA, ΨAA or ΨAG) on specified mRNA transcripts to incorporate ncAAs in mammalian cells. The RCE strategy comprises a programmable guide RNA4, an engineered decoder tRNA, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. We first developed the RCE(ΨGA) system, which incorporates functional ncAAs into proteins via the ΨGA codon, demonstrating a higher translatome-wide and proteomic specificity compared with the genetic code expansion system. We further expanded our strategy to produce the RCE(ΨAA) and RCE(ΨAG) systems, with all three Ψ codon:(Ψ codon)-tRNAPyl pairs exhibiting mutual orthogonality. Moreover, we demonstrated that the RCE system cooperates compatibly with the genetic code expansion strategy for dual ncAA encoding. In sum, the RCE method utilized Ψ as a post-transcriptional ‘letter’ to encode and decode RNA codons in specific mRNA transcripts, opening a new route for genetic alphabet expansion and site-specific ncAA incorporation in eukaryotic cells.",

Catalytic processes that convert plastic waste into valuable chemicals and fuels offer promising solutions2. Recycling or upcycling of real-life plastic mixtures is challenging owing to their diverse composition and structure3. Here we propose a product-oriented strategy leveraging the orthogonality in reactivities of different functional groups in plastic mixtures to yield valuable products. This approach involves identifying functional groups followed by converting a selective component in the mixture to valuable products. We use mixtures of polystyrene, polylactic acid, polyurethane, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as real-life plastics, to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The diverse physical and chemical properties of these components, which typically hinder direct recovery, offer opportunities for extraction and transformation with the proposed strategy. From a 20-g mixture of real-life plastics, including polystyrene foam, a polylactic acid straw, a polyurethane tube, a polycarbonate mask, a polyvinyl chloride bag, a polyethylene terephthalate bottle, a polyethylene dropper and a polypropylene bottle, we obtained more than 8 separate chemicals: 1.3 g of benzoic acid, 0.5 g of plasticizer, 0.7 g of alanine, 0.7 g of lactic acid, 1.4 g of aromatic amine salt, 2.1 g of bisphenol A, 2.0 g of terephthalic acid and 3.5 g of C3–C6 alkanes.

          "abstract": "Mitotic onset is a critical transition for eukaryotic cell proliferation. The commonly held view of mitotic control is that the master regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), is first activated in the cytoplasm, at the centrosome, initiating mitosis 1–3 . Bistability in CDK activation ensures that the transition is irreversible, but how this unfolds in a spatially compartmentalized cell is unknown 4–8 . Here, using fission yeast, we show that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, and that the bistable responses differ markedly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a stronger response in the nucleus driving mitotic signal propagation from there to the cytoplasm. Abolishing cyclin–CDK localization to the centrosome led to activation occurring only in the nucleus, spatially uncoupling the nucleus and cytoplasm mitotically, suggesting that centrosomal cyclin–CDK acts as a ‘signal relayer’. We propose that the key mitotic regulatory system operates in the nucleus in proximity to DNA, which enables incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage to be effectively monitored to preserve genome integrity and to integrate ploidy within the CDK control network. This spatiotemporal regulatory framework establishes core principles for control of the onset of mitosis and highlights that the CDK control system operates within distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm.",

Recently, our interferometry experiments with several ‘particle states’ reported flux periods of ΔΦ = (e/e*)Φ0 (with Φ0 the flux quantum) at moderate temperatures16. Here we report interference measurements of ‘particle–hole conjugated’ states at filling factors ν = 2/3, 3/5 and 4/7, which revealed unexpected flux periodicities of ΔΦ = ν−1Φ0. The measured shot-noise Fano factor (F) of the partitioned quasiparticles in each of the quantum point contacts of the interferometer was F = ν (ref. 17) rather than that of the elementary charge F = e*/e (refs. 18,19). These observations indicate that the interference of bunched (clustered) elementary quasiparticles occurred for coherent pairs, triples and quadruplets, respectively. A small metallic gate (top gate), deposited in the centre of the interferometer bulk, formed an antidot (or a dot) when charged, thus introducing local quasiparticles at the perimeter of the (anti)dot. Surprisingly, such charging led to a dissociation of the ‘bunched quasiparticles’ and, thus, recovered the conventional flux periodicity set by the elementary charge of the quasiparticles. However, the shot-noise Fano factor (of each quantum point contact) consistently remained at F = ν, possibly due to the neutral modes accompanying the conjugated states. The two observations—bunching and debunching (or dissociation)—were not expected by current theories. Similar effects may arise in Jain’s ‘particle states’ (at lower temperatures) and at even denominator fractional quantum Hall states20.",

We combine it with single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing analyses, human organotypic GBM cultures, in vivo cell-specific CRISPR–Cas9-driven genetic perturbations as well as human and mouse experimental systems to identify an annexin A1–formyl peptide receptor 1 (ANXA1–FPR1) bidirectional astrocyte–GBM communication pathway that limits tumour-specific immunity. FPR1 inhibits immunogenic necroptosis in tumour cells, and ANXA1 suppresses NF-κB and inflammasome activation in astrocytes. ANXA1 expression in astrocytes and FPR1 expression in cancer cells are associated with poor outcomes in individuals with GBM. The inactivation of astrocyte–glioma ANXA1–FPR1 signalling enhanced dendritic cell, T cell and macrophage responses, increasing infiltration by tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and limiting T cell exhaustion. In summary, we have developed a method to analyse TME cell–cell interactions at single-cell resolution in clinical samples and preclinical models, and used it to identify bidirectional astrocyte–GBM communication through ANXA1–FPR1 as a driver of immune evasion and tumour progression.",

In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter, such as deconfined quark–gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions 2 or expanding quantum degenerate gases 3,4 . Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges 5,6 , levitons 7 and anyon statistics 8 . Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity 9 as the number of interacting particles increases 10 remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analysing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit at which the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet scattering experiments illustrate how coordinated behaviour emerges through interactions of only a few elementary constituents. Studying similar signatures in other physical platforms such as cold-atom simulators 4,11 or collections of anyonic excitations 8,12 may help identify emergence of exotic phases and, more broadly, advance understanding of matter engineering.",

But addressing many of the most destabilizing challenges of our time requires building resilient societies, not weapons.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States has suspended multiple foreign-aid programmes and taken steps to withdraw from the World Health Organization. Trump is proposing discretionary-budget increases of 13% for the defence department and 65% for homeland security.\n\nOther countries have likewise signalled a retreat from multilateral development. The United Kingdom plans to reduce its official development assistance from 0.7% of its gross national income to just 0.3% from 2027; France has cut its aid budget by 35%; and Germany’s incoming coalition plans to reduce humanitarian aid by 50%.\n\nTrump’s cuts to international aid are stifling Africa’s HIV research\n\nAt the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), countries pledged to mobilize US$1.3 trillion annually by 2035 to fund efforts to address climate change. Yet, without robust development support, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will lack the institutional infrastructure to access, deploy or govern these funds effectively.\n\nIn global health, these cuts are coming as the consequences of previous reductions in aid are already being felt. A 70% decline in official development assistance to Africa since 2021 has contributed to a $220-million funding deficit for countries’ response to the mpox outbreak of the past few years.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the United States approved funding — which would eventually rise to more than $12 billion — for the rebuilding of western Europe. Known as the Marshall Plan, it was not merely an act of generosity. It was a calculated effort to rebuild economies, stabilize democracies and contain the spread of extremism.\n\nBuilding resilient societies abroad will similarly make people safer in their own nations today. No missile-defence system could have stopped the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, which destabilized economies and overwhelmed health systems, including in militarily powerful nations. Similarly, climate-related disasters, environmental degradation and lack of investment in education are driving armed conflict and contributing to a global rise in nationalist political movements.\n\nTrump blew up the global fight against AIDS. Can it recover?\n\nDevelopment must be reclaimed as a crucial means for sustaining long-term global and national security.\n\nThis means world leaders and societies recognizing that investments in public-health infrastructure, education and climate adaptation are not acts of charity or means to exert soft power, but essential strategic investments. It means treating development as a cornerstone of global security in national budgets and shielding development finance from short-term political pressures. This could be done, for instance, by codifying aid targets into law.\n\nSome countries, such as Sweden and Norway, have consistently upheld high levels of official development assistance through long-standing political consensus, even without legal mandates. But in many HICs, development assistance is often subject to cuts when domestic priorities shift or fiscal pressures mount.",

As students, we develop skills for managing our time, which we hone throughout our careers as responsibilities change. We are often quick to adopt new technologies that lighten the load. From statistical software and digital typesetting to online literature searches and high-throughput data collection, technology helps us to do more, faster. Yet some aspects of our jobs seem resistant to automation: reading the literature, drafting manuscripts and engaging in peer review, for example.\n\nAdvances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the past few years hint at the possibility of automating these time-consuming tasks. Proposals for adopting AI into scientific processes have run the gamut from generating hypotheses and collecting data to performing analyses, writing papers, conducting review, detecting errors and evaluating the reliability of published work. Some have even suggested that AI could do PhD-level research or operate as a fully autonomous scientist.\n\nThree AI-powered steps to faster, smarter peer review\n\nAs researchers who study how digital information technologies affect society, we find ourselves grappling with whether and how to adopt AI into our research workflows. We face the same time pressures as everyone else, but ethical concerns — and questions of accuracy — loom large. AI-use policies continue to shift as journals and funders struggle to keep pace. Prominent researchers, including AI experts, have already run into trouble.\n\nThese are all important, practical matters. But a deeper issue lurks beneath the surface. The reason these aspects of our jobs have been so challenging to automate is that they rely on something even more precious than our time: namely, our capacity for scientific decision-making. It is worth considering what we lose when we cede that — and our agency — to machines.\n\nPeer review\n\nOver the past decade, the number of published articles has grown much faster than the number of scientists. The peer-review system is strained to near breaking point. As editors, we find it harder than ever to secure willing referees; as authors, we watch our manuscripts languish in editorial limbo; as reviewers, we receive many more requests than we can possibly accept.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Carl Bergstrom.Credit: Kris Tsujikawa\n\nWe (C.T.B. and J.B.-C.) have collaborated for the better part of a decade and have come to realize that we share an approach to writing referee reports. We begin with an initial read of the paper, taking notes along the way. With a sense of the full arc, we reread the paper, refining our notes and diving deeper: searching the literature, checking code, sketching diagrams or doing a bit of analysis, for example. Eventually, we cull, organize and expand our notes into the prose that constitutes the final report. The process — which is entirely uncompensated and mostly unrecognized — takes hours or even days.\n\nCould a large language model (LLM) accelerate the process? Some engineers are trying to build entirely automated peer-review systems, but that goal strikes us as patently silly: it is peer review, after all, emphasis on ‘peer’.\n\nAttempting a more moderate position, one Nature columnist suggested that reviewers first use auto-dictation tools to compile notes during an initial read and then feed those notes into an LLM to organize their feedback. The author says they can complete a review using this approach in 30–40 minutes, or even faster if the paper is obviously flawed.\n\nAI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried\n\nBut in our view, writing a good peer review is not rote work. Like any kind of critical analysis, it requires that we triage, rank and organize our unstructured thoughts. We perhaps start with praise, then raise a few of the most pressing issues that need to be addressed. From there, we enumerate quick fixes, minor concerns and points of confusion. The whole process constitutes a negotiation with ourselves over what is important enough to mention, so that we can negotiate with the editors and authors over what should be changed. We might discover that our original impressions were misguided; that some of our comments need to be revised or omitted; or that seemingly minor issues are, in fact, fundamental flaws. The process of summarizing and synthesizing helps us to engage more deeply with the manuscript.\n\nWriting a peer review, then, or even going from initial notes to the final text, requires capacities that an LLM simply lacks: our unique perspective, training, values, ethics, domain expertise, understanding of editorial priorities and perceptions of the authors. Even if an AI tool could write a review, it would never be able to write your review — or any peer’s review, for that matter. If we cede this process to LLMs, we relinquish our agency to improve the scientific literature. As historian David McCullough expressed in a 2003 interview: “Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.”\n\nAI science, automation and de-skilling\n\nThe implications extend well beyond peer review. Proponents of AI-assisted science argue that AI can increase productivity by freeing researchers from the drudgery of routine tasks. Where these tasks are entirely rote — formatting a bibliography, for example — we agree. But, more often than not, they include crucial aspects of doing science.",

          "abstract": "The US National Institutes of Health’s Gateway Center is the main visitor entrance to the agency’s campus in Bethesda, Maryland.Credit: Briscoe Savoy for Nature\n\nFrom 1 July, researchers funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be required to make their scientific papers available to read for free as soon as they are published in a peer-reviewed journal. That’s according to the agency’s latest public-access policy, aimed at making federally funded research accessible to taxpayers.\n\nUS government reveals big changes to open-access policy\n\nEstablished under former US president Joe Biden, the policy was originally set to take effect on 31 December for all US agencies, but the administration of Biden’s successor, Donald Trump, has accelerated its implementation for the NIH, a move that has surprised some scholars. That’s because, although the Trump team has declared itself a defender of taxpayer dollars, it has also targeted programmes and research projects focused on equity and inclusion for elimination. And one of the policy’s main goals is to ensure equitable access to federally funded research.\n\nThe move means that universities will have less time to advise their researchers on how to comply with the policy, says Peter Suber, director of the Harvard Open Access Project in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There is usually “some confusion or even some non-compliance after a new policy takes effect, but I think universities will eventually get on top of that”, he says.\n\nThe NIH policy has been welcomed by open-access (OA) advocates, and reflects a global shift towards making publicly funded research freely available. Since 2021, several European science agencies that provide funding for researchers have required grant holders to make their papers OA immediately.\n\nHere, Nature asks publishing specialists what researchers need to know about the NIH policy.\n\nWhat is the new policy?\n\nScientific papers that result from projects funded by the NIH must be deposited in the agency’s digital repository, PubMed Central, and made freely available there immediately after publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Previously, the NIH, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, allowed journals to restrict access to papers for an embargo period of up to 12 months before making them publicly available in PubMed Central. The policy applies to manuscripts accepted for publication on or after 1 July, and the version deposited can be either the ‘accepted’ manuscript (including all revisions resulting from the peer-review process) or the final published article.\n\nWhat options do authors have?\n\nScientists can take one of several routes to make their papers immediately free to read. For authors already publishing in an OA journal (or the OA portion of a hybrid journal), the policy brings little change: when researchers’ papers are posted online by the journal, they are made freely available to readers. These authors just need to ensure that their papers are deposited in PubMed Central as soon as they are published. And “if you’re publishing open access, a lot of those publishers have mechanisms in place to do the deposit for you”, says Lisa Hinchliffe, a librarian and academic at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign.\n\nAuthors publishing in closed-access journals (or the closed sections of hybrid journals), which require people to have a subscription to read papers, will be most affected by the change, Hinchliffe says. Researchers will have to make sure that the agreement they sign with the publisher complies with the NIH policy, meaning that they are allowed to deposit the full version of the paper in PubMed Central without embargo. They might also need to submit the paper to PubMed Central themselves, because some publishers have indicated that they will not offer this service.\n\nWhat issues might researchers encounter?\n\nSeveral publishers, including Elsevier and Springer Nature, require that papers published in closed-access journals remain available only to subscribers for an embargo period — 6 or 12 months, for instance — before they can be placed in repositories such as PubMed Central (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher, Springer Nature). “It’s very likely that not all publisher agreements will be compatible with the new policy, and that creates a difficult situation — both for the publisher and for the author,” Suber says.\n\nHow can I publish open access when I can’t afford the fees?\n\nThese publishers might steer authors towards their OA journals (or the OA parts of their hybrid journals) to comply with the policy. However, OA journals make their money by asking for article-processing charges (APCs), which can be anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Authors switching to publishing in an OA journal would be responsible for paying those APCs. This is what happened when Plan S — an OA initiative launched by a coalition of mostly European funders — went into effect, Hinchliffe says.\n\n“Authors should know that in advance, and if they don’t want to pay the APC, but still want to comply with the NIH policy, then they have to go somewhere else,” Suber says.\n\nSome authors might not need to worry about APCs, however. In preparation for the NIH policy coming into effect, some universities have been putting in place agreements with publishers that allow their researchers to publish OA papers at no cost to them, generally through contracts where universities shift funds previously spent on subscriptions to supporting OA publishing. The Big Ten Academic Alliance, a consortium of US research universities, announced one such agreement with Springer Nature last month. Not only are we prepared for the transition to OA, says Maurice York, director of Library Initiatives for the Big Ten alliance, but “it’s what we’ve been pushing for”.\n\nFurthermore, some funders cover APCs. According to the NIH’s policy, the agency will allow authors to include ‘reasonable costs’ associated with publication, such as APCs, in their project budgets.",

          "abstract": "Whether for hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires or floods, preparing for disasters and issuing warnings and evacuation orders are essential to save lives. However, not everyone is able to respond to the same degree. Illness, disability, lack of transport and financial constraints can all exacerbate the risk for people in vulnerable groups. This can lead to disproportionate consequences. For example, between 1930 and 2015, people aged over 65 accounted for 46% of excess deaths associated with hurricanes in the United States (R. Young and S. Hsiang Nature 635, 121–128; 2024).\n\nTo help the people most at risk, local authorities and first responders need to know in advance who lives in the areas most affected, so they can deploy targeted resources. But they cannot easily access this information.\n\nHow AI is improving climate forecasts\n\nTo demonstrate what could be possible, my colleagues and I at the Environmental Inequality Lab have developed a framework for rapid-response analysis. Using the best available data, this method can deliver timely insights to local authorities and first responders before, during and after disasters.\n\nOur approach combines demographic and socio-economic data provided by the US Census Bureau with forecasts released by the US National Hurricane Center and Weather Prediction Center. The population data are privacy-protected and consist of aggregated counts by age, race, sex and income decile, mapped in grid cells of approximately one square kilometre. This provides localized insights while ensuring that no individual or household can be identified.\n\nBringing these data sets together tells us in real time where and when a disaster is expected to strike, as well as who is likely to be most exposed to risks such as high winds, storm surges and flooding. We are developing similar tools to evaluate the risks of wildfires and heatwaves.\n\nWe tested our work flow during Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on Florida’s west coast late on 9 October 2024. On 8 and 9 October, we released a report (see go.nature.com/4jwkuro) showing who was forecast to be exposed to the greatest hazards. The next week, we released a follow-up report (see go.nature.com/3hicifv) comparing the forecasts with data on the storm’s actual extent. In this case, the forecasts turned out to be a reasonable guide to what happened.\n\nHurricane risk in a changing climate — the role of uncertainty\n\nOur analysis highlighted how different populations faced different levels of risk. The people who experienced hurricane-force winds and excessive rainfall during Milton were disproportionately older, disproportionately Hispanic and disproportionately relatively poor (falling in the bottom 20% of the national income distribution).",

This means that the motions of the electrons are correlated — what one electron does depends on what the others are doing. Shaju et al. studied the emergence of the Coulomb liquid in objects called electron droplets, which comprise small numbers (in this work, between two and five) of interacting electrons confined in a small space.

          "abstract": "Is Anyone Listening?: What Animals Are Saying to Each Other and to Us Denise L. Herzing Univ. Chicago Press (2024)\n\nThe summer of 1985 marked Denise Herzing’s first time swimming with wild Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis), in the “gin-clear” waters of the Bahamas. Planning to study their behaviour during a six-week trip, the marine biologist realized within just a few days that she would need to spend decades with these long-lived animals to fully document how they communicate with one another. She decided to dedicate the rest of her career to “trying to crack the code” of dolphin signals.\n\nIn Is Anyone Listening?, Herzing describes the 40 years of research that followed and discusses how dolphins and other animal species communicate. Her engaging book is peppered with stories that give readers a peek into her life and research philosophy.\n\nMarine trials and tribulations\n\nHerzing’s tales bring to life the challenges of her fieldwork. Salt water and electronics make for a testing combination, and the author discusses hearing her collaborators’ concerns about “not blowing Denise up” if the batteries in her devices explode underwater. And dolphins don’t always behave how you expect. For example, when she and her team arrive at a field site in 2013 to trial a communication device, they discover that most of the dolphins have disappeared, moving elsewhere in search of food. The researchers have to abandon the tests until the next year.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nHerzing recalls telling naturalist David Attenborough, during a visit to her research vessel, that she sometimes tries to communicate with the dolphins by mimicking their head nods. She offers to try to encourage a pod of dolphins swimming by to come closer to the boat so he can meet them. “What was I even thinking?,” she asks herself as she heads into the water. The animals do come over — but whether it was down to true communication or just luck, she will never know, she admits.\n\nOver the years, Herzing has gained many insights into dolphin communication. For instance, she emphasizes the importance of examining sequences of vocalizations, which have often been overlooked in studies of dolphin communication. She observes that a small repertoire of sounds can be combined and used differently in distinct circumstances, and that prosody, including rhythm, is a key component of animal communication. She highlights the importance of recognizing that the distinct experiences and personalities of individual animals can alter behaviour.\n\nDenise Herzing (right) and her team develop technology to try to ‘translate’ dolphin sounds.Credit: Brian Skerry/Nature Picture Library\n\nThe author also notes that nothing can replace getting to know one’s own data, and letting the data guide the research — even if it means that discoveries take a long time. I agree heartily. Scientists, like Herzing, who spend many years studying a particular species or system earn the right to intuit and speculate about their speciality.\n\nHer points are especially relevant now that artificial-intelligence tools are being used to help researchers to decipher animal communication. Although useful tools, it is impossible to know whether any patterns they detect in animal signals are meaningful to the animals without knowing the context in which the sounds were produced. As Herzing observes, “Throwing a bunch of sounds into a computer … and hoping it will pull out biologically significant patterns does not work so well yet.”\n\nChatting with dolphins\n\nHerzing and her team have made impressive efforts to uncover language-like components in dolphins’ vocalizations and to initiate human–dolphin communication. She describes some of the devices that they’ve developed, including a two-way technology called CHAT that aims to ‘translate’ and produce specific dolphin sounds, and a mobile system called UDDAS that can record synchronized sound and video underwater.",

A study now suggests they are at least 4.16 billion years old — 160 million years older than any others recorded, and the only piece of Earth's crust known to have survived from the planet’s earliest eon1.\n\nIn 2008, researchers reported that these rocks dated back 4.3 billion years2, a claim that other scientists contested. Work reported today in Science1 seems to confirm that the rocks, known as the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt, are record-breakers.\n\nResearchers say the rock formation offers a unique window into early Earth, after the planet cooled from its fiery birth 4.5 billion years ago.\n\n“It’s not a matter of ‘my rock is older than yours’,” says Jonathan O’Neil, a geologist at Ottawa University who leads the research team. “It’s just that this is a unique opportunity to understand what was going on during that time.”\n\nThe ‘oldest rocks’ label has sometimes backfired. In the past few years, other teams have chiselled many samples out of the Nuvvuagittuq belt, leaving the landscape scarred. Last year, the local Inuit community closed access to the rocks to prevent further despoliation.\n\nOnly a handful of geological samples in the world date back to 3.8 billion years or older. Of those, the oldest undisputed rocks are found in the Acasta gneiss formation in Canada’s Northwest Territories; at 4 billion years old, they mark the boundary between Earth’s first geological eon, the Hadean, and the following one, the Archaean. Geologists have also found tiny mineral crystals dating back to the Hadean — such as 4.4-billion-year-old zircon crystals from Western Australia — that have become embedded into newer rock. But there are no known surviving chunks of crust from the Hadean — except, perhaps, the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt. It consists primarily of material that started out as volcanic basalt before undergoing various modifications during Earth’s tortured history.\n\nThe dark rock of Canada's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt could have originated from the basaltic lava of a volcano that erupted some 4.3 billion years ago.Credit: Jonathan O’Neil\n\nIn their 2008 work, O’Neil and his colleagues analysed the chemical imprint left by the radioactive decay of the isotope samarium-146 into neodymium-142 to calculate that the Nuvvuagittuq rocks were 4.3 billion years old. (Samarium-146 is a short-lived isotope that was depleted in Earth’s first 500 million years, and none was left after about 4 billion years ago.) Other scientists challenged that work, arguing, for instance, that Hadean-age crust had become mixed into younger crust, contaminating the results3,4.\n\nFor the latest work, O’Neil’s team analysed some once-molten rocks that had intruded into the main Nuvvuagittuq rocks like a knife cutting into a cake. By dating the intruded rocks, O’Neil and his colleagues were able to establish a minimum age for the cake itself. They used two radioactive clocks: the decay of samarium-146 into neodymium-142 and that of samarium-147 into neodymium-143. Both yielded ages of around 4.16 billion years for the intruded rocks. “If you don’t agree with this, then you need a very speculative, intricate model to get to the same answer,” says O’Neil.",

Credit: Willice Obonyo\nRadioastronomy in Africa\n\nIn 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world’s largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array, the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital development programme to develop talent to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research-chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million).\n\nNow, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa now owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and students at universities and institutions in African countries.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to grow Africa’s radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. In the second of a short series of articles investigating the growth of the discipline on the continent, Willice Obonyo, a lecturer in astronomy and space sciences at the Technical University of Kenya in Nairobi, talks about the importance of hands-on training.\n\nI had always loved space. At school, at about age 12, we were told about constellations and stars, but I didn’t know someone could pursue it as a career. Even when I went to university, there was no option to study astronomy, let alone radioastronomy, which uses radio waves to observe parts of the Universe that are invisible to the naked eye. I ended up earning a bachelor’s of science degree in 2006, and then becoming a mathematics and physics teacher at a secondary school.\n\nIn 2011, I went back to Moi University in Eldoret, Kenya, for a master’s in theoretical nuclear physics, and when I was finishing up, a friend told me about the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) scholarships to study astronomy. I asked him about it, then googled ‘astronomy’, and I realized that this was an opportunity to study the Universe. I applied and was accepted into an astrophysics and space science master’s programme at the University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa.\n\nDeveloping astronomers in Africa: ‘We wanted to create a discipline’\n\nThe SARAO scholarship gave me an enormous opportunity. It was the first time that I used a telescope: a 1.9-metre optical telescope. In fact, it was the first scientific equipment that I had used hands-on. My education had mostly been theoretical to that point. At the UCT, I could test theories, observe celestial objects for the first time and then process and analyse the data. It was inspiring and it gave me an opportunity to be confident in science and feel that I could be trusted with data for research and interact with leading researchers.\n\nI met and was taught by world-class scholars from various continents. It was a steep learning curve, but there was a lot of help from colleagues and other students. I also received a lot of support from my supervisor Vanessa McBride, who is now the science director at the International Science Council in Paris, an organization that brings global science councils, unions and academies together.\n\nThen, in 2015, South Africa and the United Kingdom were piloting the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (DARA) project in African countries, which offered eight weeks of training in basic radioastronomy. It trained me and the other students in the science and technical engineering aspects of radioastronomy, as well as the processing of data.

          "authors": "Starre Vartan, Sandy Ong",
          "abstract": "The foundations of many market-leading innovations can be traced to fundamental research done at universities. The science-led start-ups highlighted below show the importance of a strong pipeline from academia to industry, as they make their mark in clean energy, climate monitoring and health care.\n\nTWELVE: Portable power\nEtosha Cave, co-founder of carbon-conversion company Twelve, wants to expand her firm globally to tackle the climate crisis.Credit: Mark Leong for Nature Index\n\nEtosha Cave, co-founder and chief science officer at Twelve, a start-up based in Berkeley, California, hopes to reduce the reliance of industry on fossil fuels by providing a more sustainable option. Twelve’s business centres on converting carbon dioxide from industrial waste streams into carbon monoxide, which can then be combined with green hydrogen — made by splitting water using renewable energy — and used to make synthetic fuels.\n\nThe firm’s technology can be traced back to Cave’s PhD research on the electroreduction of CO2 — which essentially uses electricity to convert CO2 into other molecules — at Stanford University in California. The work felt urgent and meaningful, she says, given the threat that fossil-fuel extraction and CO2 emissions pose to the environment. She wanted to take her research to the market as soon as possible — and that meant taking it beyond the bounds of academia. “It was going to die if we didn’t bring it outside,” says Cave.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science Inc.\n\nAfter completing her PhD in 2015, Cave teamed up with fellow Stanford chemist, Kendra Kuhl, and Nicholas Flanders, an engineer and Stanford alumnus, with hopes of establishing a CO2-conversion start-up. They joined the first cohort of a US Department of Energy-sponsored programme called the Cyclotron Road Project, which aimed to help entrepreneurs working in advanced manufacturing, clean power or electronics launch their business. Run at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory — about an hour’s drive from Stanford — Cyclotron Road provided lab space and funding to help push the trio’s CO2-conversion science towards commercialization. The support was invaluable in turning their idea into reality, says Cave of the early stages of Twelve. At the time, venture capitalists in the science and technology space were funding things that could scale quickly and deliver fast returns, such as software and biotechnology, she says. “What we were doing — fundamental chemistry and electrochemical engineering — didn’t look anything like those sectors. Deep, lab-based research didn’t fit the typical venture-capitalist mould. Back then, very few investors were willing to take that kind of long view.”\n\nTwelve’s technology, particularly its Opus system, is powered by renewable energy, and uses proprietary metal catalysts to speed up the conversion of CO2 into carbon monoxide, which can be used to make base chemicals and materials for industry. By 2021, the company had raised US$57 million in venture-capital funding and had collaborated with several multinational companies, including Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Mercedes-Benz, which wanted to use Twelve’s technology in pilot projects to create materials for their products.\n\nTwelve is preparing to flip the switch on its first commercial-scale plant, AirPlant. Located in Moses Lake, Washington, the facility runs on hydropower and converts CO2 captured from a nearby ethanol plant into aviation fuel, called E-Jet, which can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft. Last year, Twelve announced that it had raised US$645 million from investors, including San Francisco-based private-equity firm TPG and Alaska Airlines, to develop sustainable jet fuel. Now with a team of 175 employees, Twelve’s ascent comes after nearly a decade of scientific hurdles and pivots and relentless fundraising, says Cave. “CO2 is a very stubborn molecule to convert, and it took a lot of iteration, and a lot of capital to scale up. It’s been really challenging to do.”\n\nFor underrepresented founders, the climb can be even steeper. As a Black woman, Cave reflects that she “stood out a lot of times in the room”. She recalls how she and her co-founder Kuhl were an unusual sight in meetings. “People would remember our team — me and Kendra, the only women in the room.” In 2024, only 0.4% of US start-up funding went to companies with Black founders, according to Crunchbase, a data-analytics firm in San Francisco.\n\nAs Twelve continues to expand, Cave hopes to see it scale fast enough to make a real impact on the global emissions crisis. “With our technology, you can make fuel anywhere in the world where you have direct air capture of CO2,” she says. — Starre Vartan\n\nRIVERKIN: Against the flow\nRiverkin co-founder Jessica Droujko.Credit: Ruben Stadler\n\nSwitzerland relies on hydropower to provide more than half of its energy needs — but there’s a problem. Rising temperatures and melting glaciers in the country’s mountainous regions are causing the surrounding landscapes to erode more quickly, sending increased amounts of gravel, sand and other debris into the rivers that feed the country’s hydroelectric plants. These sediments are damaging turbines and pipes and accumulating in reservoirs at an alarming rate, says Nitin Kumar, a data scientist and co-founder of Zurich-based start-up company, Riverkin.\n\nOver the past few decades, Switzerland has lost around 28% of its hydroelectric energy capacity as a result of these changes, says Kumar. It’s a challenge that he and his Riverkin co-founder Jessica Droujko, an environmental engineer, hope to solve by installing sensors in rivers to alert hydropower operators when the water quality falls, such as after a flood (J. Droujko and P. Molnar Nature Water 1, 758–759; 2023). The notifications would allow users to react, shutting down turbines to prevent damage when sediment levels are high, for example.\n\nEstablished in 2024, Riverkin grew with help from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), Switzerland’s leading university in the Nature Index. It is one of more than 600 companies that have been incubated by ETH Zurich, which has a reputation for its spin-off success. The university is ranked second in Europe, after the University of Cambridge, UK, for the economic value generated by its spin-off companies, according to a report by Dutch analytics firm, Dealroom. “At ETH, they’re highly supportive,” says Kumar.\n\nHaving moved from India to do a PhD at the University of Zurich, Kumar met Droujko, who had moved from Canada to pursue a PhD at ETH Zurich. Droujko developed the sensor hardware as part of her PhD research — work that was accelerated by a fellowship that she won from ETH Zurich worth 150,000 Swiss francs (US$182,000) in 2023. In 2024, she teamed up with Kumar, who developed the software that accompanies the sensor. Riverkin’s sensor can measure water level, temperature, turbidity and fine sediment concentration remotely and in real time, and is cheaper and more efficient than similar devices, according to the company.\n\nKumar says the things that attracted him to Switzerland were its leading universities, stable political and economic environment, and “a culture of science-based innovation”. He adds that diversity is also a big draw that is often overlooked. Foreigners comprise more than one-quarter of Switzerland’s population and having access to such a diverse workforce allows companies to “approach challenges from entirely different angles”, says Kumar. In his experience at Riverkin, this “leads to fresh, focused thinking and a more holistic understanding of every problem we tackle”, he says.\n\nTo expand Riverkin, Kumar and Droujko are taking things one step at a time. A large-scale validation study of Riverkin’s sensor is under way, which involves testing how reliably it connects to satellites so it can transmit real-time data to users, even in remote locations with no phone coverage. The team also wants to start collecting global water-quality data to check for patterns linked to climate change.\n\nIn addition, there are plans to extend Riverkin’s services beyond the energy sector to make an impact in wastewater management and mining, which is also affected by sedimentation. The goal, Kumar says, is one day to make water data as accessible and actionable as weather data, so that we can “make our waters cleaner for future generations”. — Sandy Ong\n\nNALAGENETICS: Disease detector\nNalaGenetics co-founders (left to right) Astrid Irwanto, Alexander Lezhava and Levana Sani.Credit: NalaGenetics",

It is produced from molecules derived from fossil fuels, but researchers are working to develop processes that use more sustainable source molecules, such as plastic waste.\n\n“We’re able to transform a prolific environmental and societal waste into such a globally important medication in a way that’s completely impossible using chemistry alone or using biology alone,” says co-author Stephen Wallace, a chemical biotechnologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nCentral to the project’s success was the discovery by Wallace and his team that a synthetic chemical reaction that typically requires conditions that are toxic to cells can occur in their presence. The reaction, called the Lossen rearrangement, has been known for more than a century, but had previously been observed only in a test tube or a flask, says Wallace.\n\nPlastic unpacked\n\nTo convert plastic waste into paracetamol, the researchers used conventional chemical methods to degrade and modify polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a plastic used in food packaging and textiles, into a precursor molecule. They added this molecule into a culture of Escherichia coli cells, where the Lossen rearrangement transformed it into a biologically relevant molecule. The reaction also occurred, to a lesser extent, in the experiment’s negative control, which contained only the precursor molecule and growth medium. The team later discovered that phosphate, an ion found in all organisms, catalysed the reaction.\n\nThe authors also modified the E. coli, introducing the genes for enzymes able to catalyse reactions that use the product of the Lossen rearrangement. The enzymes produced by the modified E. coli carried out the remaining synthetic steps needed to create paracetamol. When the researchers gave the degraded PET to these bacteria, 92% was converted into paracetamol.",

          "abstract": "Next generation weight-loss drugs are being developed and tested in China.Credit: Science Photo Library\n\nA drug that outperforms placebo in helping people to lose weight is one of a growing number of next-generation obesity drugs being produced in China.\n\nAt first, Chinese pharmaceutical companies rushed to make similar versions of blockbuster weight-loss drugs, such as Wegovy and Ozempic, that have taken the world by storm. Nowadays, China is emerging as important innovator for new drug discovery in this field, says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nResults from a phase III trial of ecnoglutide show that people receiving a weekly injection of the drug lost up to 13.8 kilograms over 48 weeks of treatment. By contrast, people given placebo injections lost around 200 grams. The results were published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology on 21 June.\n\nEcnoglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist analogue, similar to the blockbuster obesity drug semaglutide. These drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1, which is involved in regulating appetite and managing blood-sugar levels. Unlike semaglutide, ecnoglutide preferentially targets the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a messenger molecule associated with regulating glycogen, sugar and lipid metabolism, which helps to control blood-sugar levels, as well as weight loss.\n\nThe study, funded by drug manufacturer Sciwind Biosciences, based in Hangzhou, China, included 664 people given either a weekly injection of a placebo, or one of three doses of ecnoglutide. At the maximum dose of 2.4 milligrams, 92.8% of people lost at least 5% of their body weight, compared with 14% of people receiving placebo injections. People receiving ecnoglutide were also able to maintain their reduced weight after stopping treatment, regaining around 1% of their body weight over a 7-week period.\n\nLinong Ji, a co-author and a diabetes researcher at Peking University People’s Hospital in Beijing, says ecnoglutide also improved risk factors for heart disease and diabetes, and reduced the amount of fat in people’s livers.\n\nMore drugs to come\n\nDozens of GLP-1 drugs are being developed and tested in China, with “many more to come”, says Drucker.\n\nAmong them is mazdutide, which mimics GLP-1 and glucagon, a hormone involved in blood-sugar levels. In trial results published in May, a weekly injection helped more people to lose up to 15% of their body weight over 36 weeks and reduced the risk of cardiovascular diseases compared with a placebo treatment.\n\nDeveloped by Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, mazdutide is manufactured by Innovent Biologics in Suzhou, China, under an exclusive licence. Other trials are testing whether the drug can treat sleep apnoea or type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe growing number of new GLP-1 drugs target multiple pathways at the same time so will result in more-tailored treatments, says Sof Andrikopoulos, a diabetes researcher at the University of Melbourne. The next generation of drugs will target specific conditions associated with diabetes and obesity, such as sleep apnoea, fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease and heart disease, he adds. “It’ll give us options and it will make personalized medicine in obesity and diabetes more accessible.”\n\nTriple threat",

The investigation is part of a broader movement to assess whether artificial intelligence (AI) is making us cognitively lazy.\n\nHow close is AI to human-level intelligence?\n\nComputer scientist Nataliya Kosmyna at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and her colleagues measured brain-wave activity in university students as they wrote essays either using a chatbot or an Internet search tool, or without any Internet at all. Although the main result is unsurprising, some of the study’s findings are more intriguing: for instance, the team saw hints that relying on a chatbot for initial tasks might lead to relatively low levels of brain engagement even when the tool is later taken away.\n\nEchoing some posts about the study on online platforms, Kosmyna is careful to say that the results shouldn’t be overinterpreted. This study cannot and did not show “dumbness in the brain, no stupidity, no brain on vacation”, Kosmyna laughs. It involved only a few dozen participants over a short time and cannot address whether habitual chatbot use reshapes our thinking in the long-term, or how the brain might respond during other AI-assisted tasks. “We don’t have any of these answers in this paper,” Kosmyna says. The work was posted ahead of peer review on the preprint server arXiv on 10 June1.\n\nEasy essays\n\nKosmyna’s team recruited 60 students, aged 18 to 39, from five universities around the city of Boston, Massachusetts. The researchers asked them to spend 20 minutes crafting a short essay answering questions, such as “should we always think before we speak?”, that appear on Scholastic Assessment Tests, or SATs.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nThe participants were divided into three groups: one used ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI’s large language model GPT-4o, as the sole source of information for their essays; another used Google to search for material (without any AI-assisted answers); and the third was forbidden to go online at all. In the end, 54 participants wrote essays answering three questions while in their assigned group, and then 18 were re-assigned to a new group to write a fourth essay, on one of the topics that they had tackled previously.\n\nEach student wore a commercial electrode-covered cap, which collected electroencephalography (EEG) readings as they wrote. These headsets measure tiny voltage changes from brain activity and can show which broad regions of the brain are ‘talking’ to each other.\n\nThe students who wrote essays using only their brains showed the strongest, widest-ranging connectivity among brain regions, and had more activity going from the back of their brains to the front, decision-making area. They were also, unsurprisingly, better able to quote from their own essays when questioned by the researchers afterwards.\n\nThe Google group, by comparison, had stronger activation in areas known to be involved with visual processing and memory. And the chatbot group displayed the least brain connectivity during the task.\n\nMore brain connectivity isn’t necessarily good or bad, Kosmyna says. In general, more brain activity might be a sign that someone is engaging more deeply with a task, or it might be a sign of inefficiency in thinking, or an indication that the person is overwhelmed by ‘cognitive overload’.",

Credit: Corey Allard\n\n‘Solar-powered’ sea slugs have specialized depots in their cells that store photosynthetic equipment looted from algae, a study1 reports. These depots provide just the right chemical environment to keep the stolen apparatus, called chloroplasts, alive and working to turn sunlight into nutrients.\n\n“It was the wildest thing that we had seen,” says study co-author Nicholas Bellono, a biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The authors also found that, in lean times, the slugs can raid these compartments to consume chloroplasts.\n\nThe compartment “is basically like a moving refrigerator of chloroplasts where, after a period of starvation, the slugs can switch from storage to consumption to survive”, Bellono says.\n\nThe findings were published in Cell.\n\nGreen grazer\n\nScientists discovered decades ago that certain species of sea slug store chloroplasts from the algae they eat, a diet that can turn the slugs bright green. But no one understood how the slugs keep these foreign organelles alive without the support of the rest of the algal cell.\n\nNow that’s using your head: a sea slug’s severed noggin sprouts a new body\n\nBellono and his team added chemical tags to proteins newly made by the slugs’ own cells. They found that most of the proteins in a slug’s chloroplasts were made by the slug — not by the original algae. That meant the slug was helping to maintain the chloroplasts.\n\nWhen the scientists looked at the chloroplasts under a microscope, they found that the organelles were housed in special compartments in the slugs’ guts. Each compartment was surrounded by a membrane that tested positive for markers typically found in cellular structures called phagosomes, which fuse with other structures called lysomes to digest unneeded organelles. The researchers named this structure the kleptosome, after a Greek word that means to steal.\n\nLife of crime\n\nThe team also found that these organelles contained ion channels — receptors that convert chemical messages into electrical signals. Among them is one called P2X4, which opens in response to the presence of ATP, an energy-carrying molecule produced during photosynthesis.",

This act of thievery seems to give cancer cells a boost to help them survive when they metastasize, or spread to distant organs.\n\nThe findings show that cancer cells siphon off neurons’ mitochondria — organelles that generate most of a cell’s energy — through ultrathin tubes that grow between the two types of cell. The purloined mitochondria increase cancer cells’ ability to withstand the stress of shooting through blood vessels during metastasis.\n\n“Now we have a new culprit for metastasis, which means we have a new target to block metastasis,” says study co-author Simon Grelet, a cancer neurobiologist at the University of South Alabama in Mobile. “And metastasis is what make cancers so deadly.”\n\nEnergy theft\n\nScientists have long known that cancer co-opts the nervous system to fuel its growth. To learn more about the process, Grelet and his colleagues worked with mice that had a rodent version of aggressive breast cancer. The authors treated the mice with a chemical agent that blocks nerve function and saw that the metabolic activity in the animals’ cancer cells fell, confirming that neurons influence tumours’ metabolism.\n\nCells are swapping their mitochondria. What does this mean for our health?\n\nObservations of cancer cells growing in a laboratory dish revealed that they extend drinking-straw-like tubes through which they drain neurons’ mitochondria. Other experiments showed that cancer cells with ‘stolen’ mitochondria generate more energy than do cancer cells without them.\n\nThe researchers wanted to see how the turbocharged cancer cells would fare during a simulated trip from an original ‘primary’ tumour to a metastatic site in a new tissue. So they pushed some cells through a needle and syringe to simulate the buffeting that they would encounter in the blood stream during the journey, and exposed others to hydrogen peroxide to mimic the potentially damaging chemical environment they would meet. The team found that the cells were much more likely to survive than those lacking extra mitochondria.",

          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Union members protest against federal cuts at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, in April 2025.Credit: Jim West/Getty\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump is hacking away at funding for research institutions — aiming, it says, to eliminate waste and bias in government-funded research. This is disrupting science in ways that are rippling well beyond laboratories and lecture halls. Here, Nature’s Careers team looks into some of the figures that might indicate wider disruptions to the scientific enterprise.\n\nThe number of active grants awarded by federal funding bodies has fallen strikingly, and companies that provide products to scientists — from basic vials to sophisticated cell analysers — are reporting a downturn in demand from academic and government customers. Their concerns are exacerbated by the president’s announcements of tariffs on foreign imports, which have triggered retaliatory trade restrictions in other countries. Some companies are predicting price rises fuelled by increased import costs.\n\nMost of the people who have directly lost grants are principal investigators, but early-career researchers are being affected as well, warns Jason Owen-Smith, a sociologist who leads the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science (IRIS) consortium at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Drawing on IRIS data, Owen-Smith estimates that nationwide, federal grants to universities support about 646,000 researchers. About 48% of those are students and trainees, he says.\n\nPeople outside academia will also be affected. “A whole lot of businesses in a really wide range of industries, from local restaurants to construction companies to specialized manufacturing companies,” Owen-Smith says, “are going to see a hit to their bottom line as a result of the cuts.”\n\nHowever, not all areas of scientific activity have declined in the first quarter of 2025 — some have even picked up. For instance, the US National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, published more working papers in January, February and March this year than in the same period of 2024. Globally, publication rates for preprints, journal articles and other research content also continue to increase, consistent with long-term trends. But publication takes time, so this method of measuring scientific output will be slower to reflect trends than will some other metrics.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, just a few months into the Trump administration, uncertainty about the future of US science reigned, as Nature’s charts show. Some statistics are pulled from small subsections of the scientific enterprise, such as sales from a single supplier. Others, including the number of federal grants awarded to US scientists, reflect more fundamental shifts.\n\nOverall, the picture is gloomy, says Andrew Castaldi, a market specialist at Temblor, a risk-assessment company based in Redwood City, California. “To me, the federal science funding cuts will make it harder for any industry to build off the work done by the scientists employed by the government,” he says. “No single entity has the capacity to make up what is lost. In effect, the private sector’s innovations will diminish.”\n\nGrants withdrawn\n\nUS federal science agencies have retracted many grants (see ‘Funding’). More than 1,000 grants were terminated between 20 January and the end of March at three government agencies: the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA. Many more have been flagged for scrutiny on the grounds that they promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), or because research in areas including vaccines and HIV is being de-emphasized. This is destabilizing careers.\n\nSource: NIH Reporter; nsf.gov\n\nThe situation is changing fast, however. Since the end of March, many more grants have been cancelled. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), of which the NIH is part, now lists more than 7,000 terminated contracts. But on 16 June, a US judge ruled that many of these cancellations were illegal, and ordered that they be restored. And Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachussetts, is locked in an ongoing legal battle with the federal government after its research funding was specifically targeted.\n\nSupplier and demand\n\nFalling revenues have affected scientific-product suppliers of every size (see ‘Lab equipment’). For some, a drop in US academic and government sales is offset by other sectors, so overall revenues have not declined. But even these companies are predicting future losses, which might have spooked investors.\n\nSource: Agilent; Addgene; Avantor; Waters; BD; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Illumina; Bruker\nLet’s get together\n\nSome international researchers are reluctant to travel to the United States amid increases in border controls. Even US researchers are travelling less, given cuts in travel budgets at some institutions. And some conference organizers have had to postpone or cancel events, or relocate them to other countries. However, in the first three months of 2025, not all US-based scientific conferences had yet been affected (see ‘Conferences’).\n\nSource: APS; ABRF\nLease on life sciences\n\nNationwide, science-related buildings are standing empty (see ‘Property’). This is particularly notable in Boston, Massachusetts, where 25% of the lab or research and development (R&D) property inventory is vacant, compared with 14% in the previous year, according to the commercial property firm CBRE in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe Boston–Cambridge area has a high concentration of universities, life-sciences companies and related vendors, and is the biggest US market for life-sciences property. Across the United States, demand for such buildings started to fall during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has intensified in 2025. Companies are delaying leasing decisions owing to uncertainty, although some are looking to increase their US operations in response to tariffs on foreign manufacturing.\n\nThe effects will probably cascade into residential housing. Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, anticipates a downturn in the property market, saying: “If you have fewer graduate students, it’s going to affect housing demand.”\n\nSource: CBRE Insights report\nJob cuts\n\nWhen it comes to employment, the larger effects of funding cuts and tariffs will take time to materialize, Ginther says. Thousands of staff positions have been cut from federal science agencies including the NIH, based in Bethesda, Maryland; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia; and the Food and Drug Administration, based in Silver Spring, Maryland. Yet overall R&D-related employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics barely shifted between the first three months of 2024 and the first three months of 2025 (see ‘Employment’).\n\nSource: BLS Employment Statistics survey\n\nChange might be coming. A spokesperson for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston notes: “Payroll employment in the Boston–Cambridge–Newton metro area, which has a tech-heavy economy, is down 0.3% in March 2025 from one year earlier.” And some universities are cutting staff, students and programmes, whereas others are seeking stopgap solutions to funding shortfalls.\n\nMoney, money, money",

          "title": "Here’s why China’s science and innovation model is thriving",
          "authors": "Jacob Dreyer",
          "abstract": "An increasing number of Chinese companies are grabbing the headlines with new technologies rolled out at scale. The most prominent example in 2025 has been DeepSeek and its low-cost large language models, but others include electric-vehicle (EV) maker BYD — which this year launched its ‘God’s Eye’ intelligent driving system as a standard feature on most of its models — and battery manufacturer CATL, which is planning a major expansion of ‘swapping stations’ in China that allow quick battery replacement in EVs.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science Inc.\n\nUnderlying such roll-outs is a commitment to research and development and an increasing synergy between China’s top universities and its private sector. In many ways, collaboration between academia and industry in China, especially when it comes to launching new companies and products, is similar to how things work in the West. It is increasingly structured around a high-risk, high-reward funding philosophy in which promising ideas originating in academia are given investment, even if the vast majority of them fail. But unlike well-established university–industry ecosystems such as Silicon Valley, where private investors typically dominate and accept the risk of most start-up businesses failing, in China, the state plays a pivotal role. National government departments, including the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), and local innovation funds are pouring billions of yuan into university-affiliated businesses, knowing most will not achieve commercial success. However, those that do can go on to redefine whole industries.\n\nChinese policy has explicitly sought to create synergies between researchers and companies since the launch of a MOST initiative in 1988 called the Torch Programme. It sought to commercialize research outputs from universities and institutes and set up special research zones — such as Zhongguancun in Beijing — that provide incentives for start-ups such as tax breaks, easier access to credit, land and infrastructure. This was followed in 2014 by the Mass Innovation and Entrepreneurship plan, which sought to spark grassroots innovation and start-up activity across China — not just in elite labs or giant companies, but among ordinary citizens, students, small firms and rural entrepreneurs. The plan has funded innovation spaces and incubators, and expanded access to venture capital, angel funding and government support. It also explicitly encouraged universities to spin off research into new companies, with scientists taking equity stakes in the firms.\n\nAs well as schemes to boost funding, the government can act as facilitator, reducing bureaucratic hurdles to accelerate lab-to-market transitions. One example is China’s National Medical Products Administration, formerly the China Food and Drug Administration, which has undergone major reforms in the past decade to speed up drug approvals and clinical trials. A priority review pathway was established for especially promising medicines; China joined the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use in 2017 so that Chinese clinical trials would be accepted in other countries and cut backlogs of clinical-trial applications, partly through digitalized submission systems and more staff.\n\nThe Chinese model is evident in companies such as Beijing-based Likang Life Sciences, an mRNA cancer vaccine start-up with links to Tsinghua University, also based in China’s capital. Likang is making use of Tsinghua’s pool of researchers by jointly establishing an AI for Medicine laboratory to promote an mRNA vaccine that can be tailored to individual patients using genetic sequencing.\n\nAlthough its vaccine technology is still in early clinical trials, Likang represents the ambition of the country’s health innovation system. Yet the challenges are immense. Cancer vaccines using mRNA technology are still unproven at scale, and Likang is competing with well-known global companies such as Moderna in Boston, Massachusetts, and BioNTech in Mainz, Germany. But the rewards for Chinese policymakers, who see biotechnology as a strategic priority, are potentially huge. If only one such company succeeds, it could position China as a leader in precision medicine.\n\nAnother example of China’s approach is the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer based in Wuxi, which was developed with public money by the National Research Center of Parallel Computer Engineering & Technology with close involvement from Tsinghua University. Rather than being used purely for academic computation, the supercomputer has been used by private Chinese companies in domains such as weather forecasting, materials simulation and drug discovery. Unlike Western supercomputers, which often rely on corporate partnerships to be built before they are then made available to researchers, China’s approach is seeking to integrate academic research with state-backed industrial policy. The project’s success has spurred further partnerships with companies, including in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.\n\nThe possibilities of AI in education, a hot topic in China, provides a different template for the Chinese innovation model. Researchers in machine learning and cognitive science have spun off companies such as Liulishuo, an AI language tutor, and Squirrel AI, which adapts lessons to an individual student’s needs. Such start-ups are often founded using grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, then attract private capital.",

          "abstract": "Grant reviewers at the US National Institutes of Health are still following screening guidelines that a judge declared illegal.Credit: Getty\n\nThe US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has not yet rescinded directives that led to the cancellation of more than 2,400 research projects it funded, NIH staff members say, even though a US judge last week called the directives “bereft of reasoning” and ruled them illegal.\n\nNIH employees, who had been instructed to screen thousands of grants on a rolling weekly basis to assess their compliance with “agency priorities”, have continued to do so after the court ruling on 16 June. This has left many confused and worried about the legality of their actions, according to eight NIH employees who spoke to Nature and were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with the press. The directives were issued by the administration of US President Donald Trump, a Republican, after he took office in January.\n\nSamuel Bagenstos, who until December 2024 was the top lawyer for NIH’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), told Nature that his office was responsible for sending out guidance to staff on how to comply with court orders — often within hours or by the next business day at latest.\n\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\n\n“This is not the way things normally go,” says Bagenstos, who worked at HHS under former president Joe Biden, a Democrat. “You would not want to leave the people responsible for complying [with court orders] hanging out in the wind, trying to figure out what they’re supposed to do.”\n\nThe NIH, HHS and White House did not immediately respond to Nature’s queries about their plans to rescind these directives, the allegations by NIH staff members that the administration is disregarding a court order or NIH employees’ concerns about the continued screening of grants.\n\nThe NIH has made some progress in complying with the court’s orders. It has begun to reinstate about 900 projects covered by the judge’s ruling, and it has directed staff to cease any further terminations, according to emails that Nature obtained. A top NIH official wrote in one of the emails that these actions are “part of the first phase of our compliance with the court’s judgment” and “additional information is forthcoming”.\n\nFar-reaching cancellations\n\nSince Trump took office earlier this year, the NIH has cancelled funding for thousands of projects, including research on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+) and COVID-19.\n\nRepresentatives of the HHS and billionaire Elon Musk’s US Department of Government Efficiency issued directives to NIH staff members to slash grants on disfavoured topics, and they provided boilerplate language for the employees to use in termination letters to scientists, Nature previously reported.\n\nNIH grant cuts will axe clinical trials abroad — and could leave thousands without care\n\nLawsuits filed in early April challenged these cuts, arguing that they were unlawful because the NIH did not follow proper procedures and did not give adequate reasoning for their cancellation. Last week, Judge William Young of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston ruled that the directives were “arbitrary and capricious” and thus illegal and void. He also delivered a blistering rebuke after his ruling, excoriating the Trump administration for targeting research on the health of LGBTQ+ individuals and people from minority ethnic groups.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "It has been difficult to gather reliable estimates of deaths during the war in Gaza.Credit: Abdalhkem Abu Riash/Anadolu via Getty\n\nAlmost 84,000 people died in Gaza between October 2023 and early January 2025 as a result of the Hamas–Israel war, estimates the first independent survey of deaths. More than half of the people killed were women aged 18–64, children or people over 65, reports the study, which was posted on the preprint server medRxiv last week1. It has not been peer reviewed.\n\nSince the start of the war, the Palestinian Ministry of Health — Gaza has been the main institution counting mortality in the region: it regularly publishes detailed lists of people who have died. The most recent count, on 25 June, reported 56,200 deaths. But some people have questioned the reliability of the ministry’s figures — and studies based on them — particularly as the conflict has progressed and medical centres, which the ministry relies on for its mortality data, have come under attack.\n\nThe latest figures do not rely on ministry data but could contain uncertainties given the challenges of counting fatalities in a conflict zone. But the numbers are similar to those reported by another research group, who used a different counting method, earlier this year, says Patrick Ball, a statistician and director of research at the non-profit Human Rights Data Analysis Group in San Francisco, California. That increases Ball’s confidence in the latest work.\n\nIndependent survey\n\nTo conduct an independent survey of fatalities, researchers worked with the non-profit Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, based in Ramallah, to survey randomly selected households representative of the population across the Gaza Strip. This included people living in makeshift shelters and tents. The survey team was not able to enter Northern Gaza, Gaza City or Rafah owing to active conflict and evacuation orders, but many people living in those areas have fled to the surveyed areas.\n\nOver a week, starting on 30 December 2024, pairs of surveyors visited 2,000 households and interviewed adults. Respondents, who were granted anonymity, were asked to list how many individuals were in their household on 6 October 2023 and children who had been born since then, and then to report the fate of all household members since then as alive, dead or missing. For those who had died, respondents were asked to clarify whether they had died of violent or non-violent causes.\n\n“The strength of this comes from the fieldwork,” says Ball, who found it extraordinary that the team was able to do such a detailed survey amid the conflict.\n\nViolent and non-violent deaths\n\nThe researchers estimate that in the 15 months up to 5 January, there were around 75,200 violent deaths in Gaza. Another 8,540 people died of non-violent causes as a result of the war.\n\nBut there could have been more non-violent deaths since the survey was conducted, says study co-author Michael Spagat, an economics researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London, in Egham. The health status of Palestinians and their access to health care was good before the war, but that has probably changed as the conflict has dragged on, says co-author Debarati Guha-Sapir, an epidemiologist who specializes in civil conflicts at the University of Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, and is based in Brussels.\n\nSix months have passed since the survey was conducted, but that doesn’t diminish its relevance, says Laith Jamal Abu-Raddad, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar in Doha. “On the contrary, it remains timely, as the crisis persists — and has arguably intensified over the past three months.”\n\nA two-month ceasefire between Hamas and Israel ended on 18 March. Since then, critical infrastructure, including hospitals, has been severely damaged on the Gaza Strip; hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes; and humanitarian aid has been restricted.\n\nDifferent methods\n\nThe latest count aligns with an estimate of 64,260 violent deaths up to the end of June 2024, reported2 earlier this year by another research team.\n\nThat work, led by Zeina Jamaluddine, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, used a method known as capture–recapture analysis, in which the overlap between multiple lists of fatalities is used to calculate mortality. Jamaluddine and her colleagues used health-ministry data and other sources.",

But Yousuke Kaifu wanted to “know the story behind those lines”.\n\nIn a detailed re-enactment of the perilous journey, Kaifu, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University Museum of the University of Tokyo, and his collaborators demonstrated how Palaeolithic people could have travelled huge distances with the tools, materials, techniques and navigational skills available at the time. They described their feat in Science Advances on 25 June1.\n\nThe study highlights that “these journeys are definitely much more epic than we give them credit for”, says Eleanor Scerri, an archaeological scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.\n\nPalaeolithic sites in the Ryukyu Islands — a chain that extends for around 1,200 kilometres and includes Okinawa — contain human remains and stone tools dating to some 30,000 years ago. This suggests that the islands’ early settlers navigated there successfully from Taiwan by crossing the Kuroshio, one of the world’s strongest ocean currents.\n\nBut exactly how they did this remains a mystery. Any boat carcasses have long since rotted away, so researchers instead try to recreate the voyage experimentally, using the kinds of tool and material that humans were known to have access to at the time. Kaifu and his team have been trying to travel from Taiwan to the Ryukyu Islands since 2013, partly financing their research through crowdfunding. Their first attempts, using rafts made of reeds or bamboo, were unsuccessful.\n\nSlash and burn",

          "title": "How to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "Since taking over as the top US health official in February, Robert F. Kennedy Jr has overseen radical changes that have alarmed many public-health experts. The agency he leads announced that it would cut its workforce by 20,000, and cancelled billions of dollars in federal funding for research and public health. Earlier this month, Kennedy replaced all the members of an influential vaccine advisory committee with hand-picked ones, including some who have expressed scepticism about vaccines. His mission, he says, is to ‘Make America Healthy Again’. “We are the sickest nation in the world,” he said in March, “and we have the highest rate of chronic disease.”\n\nWho is on RFK Jr’s new vaccine panel — and what will they do?\n\nHis diagnosis holds some truth, say public-health specialists and analysts. Relative to other similarly wealthy nations, the United States has the shortest life expectancy despite spending the most on health care. It “has the highest rates of preventable and treatable deaths”, says Reginald Williams, a health-policy specialist at the Commonwealth Fund, a think tank in New York City that publishes regular comparisons of health-care systems around the world. And researchers agree that high rates of chronic disease, including heart disease and obesity, are key contributors to Americans’ higher death rates, as Kennedy emphasizes.\n\nBut researchers say that Kennedy — widely known as RFK Jr — has mostly ignored other leading causes of death and ill health, including car accidents, drug overdoses and gun violence. In these areas, the United States “is a really clear outlier”, says Colin Angus, who studies health policy at the University of Sheffield, UK. “But, you know, I don’t see RFK talking about those things.” Kennedy has also promoted medical misinformation and conspiracy theories — particularly with regards to the safety of vaccines.\n\nWith Kennedy’s plans for US health beginning to come into focus, Nature has dug into the data to explore how unhealthy America is, how it got there and why many researchers say that some of Kennedy’s proposed solutions are misguided.\n\nShorter lives\n\nTo gauge US health, life expectancy — the average number of years a person is expected to live — is a good place to start. Many analyses show that the United States has lower life expectancy than most similar nations. A comparison by KFF, a non-profit health-policy research organization based in San Francisco, California, shows that US life expectancy at birth in 2023 was 78.4 years. This is 4.1 years shorter than the average of 11 comparably large wealthy countries, including Australia, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom (see ‘Low expectations’). “The US is just like nothing else. It’s shocking,” says Angus.\n\nSource: Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker\n\nPeople in the United States also spend fewer of their years in good shape. Healthy life expectancy — the average number of years lived in good health — was 64.4 years in 2021. This ranks below that of almost all other high-income countries, according to data from the Global Burden of Disease study1, a massive epidemiological project to measure health loss.\n\nThe gap wasn’t always so wide. Life expectancy in the United States was closer to the average for its peers around 1980 and gradually improved, according to KFF’s analyses. The gains were driven partly by a drop in smoking and increased use of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins, which cut deaths from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases, says Thomas Bollyky, who directs the global-health programme at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank headquartered in New York City.\n\nAlthough that trend continued in most peer nations, improvements in life expectancy gradually slowed in the United States, plateauing around 2010. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily widened the gap, because of higher excess mortality in the United States compared with its peers. So what’s going on?\n\nTo find out, KFF researchers looked at death data across age groups. The biggest difference in death rates has been in people aged 15–49 (see ‘Early deaths’). Among these younger people, the death rate has been falling much more slowly in the United States than in peer countries — and it spiked drastically owing to COVID-19. “More people die younger,” says Lynne Cotter, a senior health-policy researcher at KFF. And because young deaths erase more years of life than do older ones, they drag down overall life expectancy.\n\nSource: Human Mortality Database\n\nHow much does chronic disease contribute to the high US death rate? A lot. Overall, chronic conditions — heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory disease — take up four out of five spots on the country’s list of biggest killers. Cotter attributes about one-third of excess premature deaths in people under the age of 70 to cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and kidney disease. “Chronic conditions certainly make up a large portion,” she says. KFF estimates that Americans are about twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease before reaching 70 as are people in similar countries.\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal\n\nOne of the biggest drivers of those deadly conditions is obesity, say researchers. As of 2022, about 42% of adults were considered obese in the United States, compared with 27% in the United Kingdom and 5.5% in Japan. Obesity increases the risks of developing diabetes, heart disease, cancer and many other conditions. “The US has, particularly around diet, obesity and overweight, adopted unhealthier lifestyles at a higher rate than our country peers,” Bollyky says.\n\nIn a May report2, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission, which Kennedy leads, blamed childhood chronic disease mainly on ultra-processed foods, excessive screen time, lack of physical activity, exposure to chemicals and overprescription of medications. A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which Kennedy leads, did not directly address the criticisms and questions raised by sources in this article. They said that the MAHA report focuses on “a disturbing reality unfolding across the nation — the scale of the chronic disease epidemic and the institutional failures that allowed it to grow unchecked for decades”, and that the agency will next publish a report outlining policy recommendations. Americans “elected President Trump and put Kennedy in office — to Make America Healthy Again — and that’s exactly what we’re doing”, they said.\n\nUnhealthy diets are one factor driving obesity-related chronic conditions in the United States. Credit: Derek Davis/Portland Press Herald/Getty\n\nResearch supports Kennedy’s argument that ultra-processed foods might be partly to blame for poor health. Their consumption has been linked to increased risks of obesity and some other chronic diseases, and is relatively high in the United States. Such foods comprise an estimated 58% of US daily energy intake — similar to that in the United Kingdom, but greater than the 48% in Canada and 31% in France3.\n\nWilliams says that the problems caused by chronic disease are compounded by poor health care. Compared with a group of similar high-income countries, the United States is the only one that lacks universal health-insurance coverage. “We have still 26 million people that remain uninsured,” Williams says. Lack of health insurance, high costs and other barriers prevent people from getting diagnoses and treatment early on. “And then when they do seek care, they’re at a place where their disease or needs are much higher.”\n\nBy contrast, death rates from cancer in the under 70s have remained similar in the United States and other countries, probably because of widespread cancer screening and proactive cancer care, say public-health specialists. “Cancer has moved from basically a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease,” says Williams. “So we need to have that same level of engagement around obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular care.”\n\nThe other big contributors to lower life expectancy in the United States — and what really sets the country apart, researchers say — are high death rates from substance misuse, car accidents, suicide and homicide (see ‘Varied causes’). These tend to kill people of working age.\n\nSource: Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker\n\nDeaths from substance misuse are explained mainly by overdoses of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl — part of the US opioid crisis. Many Americans are killed in traffic accidents, partly because they tend to spend proportionately more time driving, and in bigger cars, than people in many other nations. “We’re a very car-centric society,” says Mary Pat Campbell, a life-insurance specialist who works at the investment-management firm Conning in Hartford, Connecticut, and blogs about mortality data. “We don’t have a lot of good mass-transit alternatives.”\n\nGun deaths account for about 80% of US murders and 55% of suicides. This led physician Vivek Murthy to call gun violence a public-health crisis in 2024, when he was US surgeon-general, and to highlight that it was the leading cause of death in children and adolescents. (The HHS removed this advisory from its website in March, according to news reports.) More gun deaths are suicides than homicides, says Campbell. “It gets very bleak thinking about some of these things,” she says.\n\nIt gets bleaker. All told, the death rates in working-age people mean that one 5-year-old out of every 20 — or roughly one in every school class — will die before the age of 45, according to Angus’s calculations. The comparable figure is one in 50 in the United Kingdom and one in 100 in Switzerland.\n\nRegional differences\n\nAlthough the life expectancy for the United States suggests that the country is relatively unhealthy, the average masks a more complex picture. Closer examination reveals that the figure varies drastically across the country.",

It can be used to spot cancerous cells, classify animal species or in robot vision. But much of the time, the technologies are used to identify and track people, suggests the study published in Nature on 25 June1.\n\nComputer scientists need to “wake up” and consider the moral implications of their work, says Yves Moreau, a computational biologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, who studies the ethics of human data.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nHuman-surveillance technologies have advanced in the past few years with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and imaging capabilities. The technologies can recognize humans and their behaviour, for instance, through face or gait recognition and monitoring for certain actions.\n\nPolice forces and governments say that AI-powered surveillance allows them to better protect the public. But critics say that the systems are prone to error, disproportionately affect minority populations and can be used to suppress protest.\n\nImaging humans\n\nThe analysis assessed 19,000 computer-vision papers published between 1990 and 2020 at the leading Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, as well as 23,000 patents that cited them. The researchers looked in depth at a random sample of 100 papers and 100 patents and found that 90% of the studies and 86% of the patents that cited those papers involved data relating to imaging humans and their spaces. Just 1% of the papers and 1% of the patents were designed to extract only non-human data.\n\nThe ethical questions that haunt facial-recognition research\n\nAnd the trend has increased. In a wider analysis, the researchers searched all the patents for a list of keywords linked to surveillance, such as ‘iris’, ‘criminal’ and ‘facial recognition’. They found that in the 2010s, 78% of computer-vision papers that led to patents produced ones related to surveillance, compared with 53% in the 1990s (see ‘Surveillance-enabling research’). Almost “the entire field is working on faces and gaits, on detecting people in images, and nobody seems to be saying, ‘Wait, what are we doing here?’” says Moreau.\n\nAlthough many have assumed that there was a pipeline from computer-vision research to surveillance, that is “very different than having actual empirical evidence”, says Sandra Wachter, who studies technology and regulation at the University of Oxford, UK.",

That is not to say that companies don’t disseminate the results of their research. Results are often shared in company annual reports, investor prospectuses and white papers. And US publicly traded firms produce around 30,000 peer-reviewed scientific publications a year, says Dror Shvadron, a researcher at the University of Toronto in Canada who studies how companies approach scientific research. “It’s a big activity that firms are involved in,” he says.\n\nBut even that relatively large number of publications represents a small fraction of the research that firms do. Amazon, for example, has a research and development (R&D) budget of about US$85 billion, says Jungkyu Suh, an economist at New York University. In 2024, the company published just over 200 research articles that were indexed in the Web of Science database, owned by analytics firm Clarivate.\n\nData prepared for Nature Index by Sydney-based firm League of Scholars, which tracks recruitment across the public and private research sectors, suggest that other big-tech companies, such as Apple and Meta, are even less likely to publish, despite being among the top ten corporations globally for researcher headcount (see ‘Papers vs patents’).\n\nThis trend is due in part to a change in how companies approach science, especially in the United States, says Suh. In the first part of the twentieth century, firms tended to invest heavily in science in areas where US academia was lagging behind Europe, such as organic chemistry, polymers and electrical engineering. “AT&T Bell Labs, Dupont Experimental Station, Kodak Research Labs, were all huge labs that dwarfed what American universities were able to provide in the 1920s and ’30s,” he says.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science Inc.\n\nBut by the 1950s and ’60s, universities in the United States had improved a lot, and that led to the rise of a different kind of corporate research lab, what Suh and Shvadron call an “absorptive” lab — one that absorbs the knowledge produced in universities, and builds on it, rather than creating its own.\n\nThe main reason for firms to invest in science of any kind is to create products that boost profits, so the question is, why do they publish their research at all? And, if governments or society want them to publish more, what incentives might help? “Whether to publish new knowledge is always a tough strategic decision for a company,” says Katrin Hussinger, an economist at the University of Luxembourg. “They have to consider what they could potentially win or lose.” Some fruits of internal research are such important company secrets that they will never be published — Google’s search algorithm, for instance, or the recipe for Coca-Cola — but other discoveries might serve a strategic purpose if they are shared, says Hussinger.\n\nSometimes firms will decide to give up their exclusive knowledge of a technology as a way to shape the market, influence regulation and build standards, she says. Automaker Toyota shared the technology behind its hydrogen fuel cells, not out of altruism, but because it wanted to accelerate the adoption of the technology and make its version the industry standard, says Hussinger. Tesla did something similar by opening up its electric-vehicle charging network to other companies. “That can be a win, because the whole ecosystem grows” around a product, says Hussinger, which potentially increases customer demand.\n\nIn some industries, such as pharmaceuticals, publishing the results of clinical trials is a regulatory requirement, says David Wehrheim, who studies business strategy at the University of Navarra in Spain. Doctors use these findings to decide which treatments to prescribe. Research papers can also be a marketing device to communicate with markets, investors and customers. This not only signals what the company is working on, but also shows that the work has been certified by others through peer review. Getting research published in a big-name journal “is better than any marketing” message, says Daniele Rotolo, who studies corporate science at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. “It’s a more credible source.”\n\nResearch publications can also support a company’s intellectual-property (IP) strategy, even if protecting IP might seem like a good reason for keeping results secret, says Rotolo. Companies often try to protect their patents on inventions by pursuing related patenting claims, he says, to prevent competitors from attempting to claim their own patents on incremental changes or improvements. But that can be an expensive strategy. It’s much cheaper to make their additional research publicly available through publications. This allows them to demonstrate that they have changed the state of the art — a term used in IP circles to mean everything about a technology that has been made public — and makes it much more difficult for competitors to claim incremental patents because they can’t show novelty.\n\nA similar strategy can be at play when competitors are racing to claim a patent, says Rotolo. A firm in the lead might publish some of its results to discourage the laggards by showing how close they are to winning. Or those falling behind might publish their research to make it more difficult for the leader to receive a patent or to reduce its expected value. A company might even decide to completely disclose a particular technology (essentially renouncing its claim on a patent) to stop others from patenting it, while preserving its ability to exploit that technology in the future. “A classic example of this is pharmaceutical company, Merck, disclosing all their human gene sequences”, which has been seen as a way to avoid the privatization of that knowledge, so that the company could still use the information later for drug development, says Rotolo. Publishing can also give companies a competitive edge: access to new ideas and recruits from academia, says Scott Stern, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. “They spill a little knowledge to get access to more. It’s the ticket of admission to a scientific community they can draw from.”\n\nThe ability to publish their work is often an incentive for prospective employees. Stern’s work has shown that scientists are even willing to accept a lower salary for jobs that offer the freedom to publish and set their own research agenda. Looking at roles being advertised in the life sciences, Stern found that jobs that allowed more publishing had starting salaries that were on average 20% lower than more restrictive positions, a trend that has also been seen in other fields. “The ongoing competition for talent plays a role,” says Hussinger. Allowing employees “to publish, go to conferences and build their reputation keeps people motivated”.\n\nDespite these incentives, publishing by firms seems to be on the decline. US companies are spending less of their R&D budgets on the research side, according to work by Ashish Arora, who studies innovation at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. The share of fundamental and applied research in corporate R&D declined from 28% in 1985 to 20% in 2015. Less of that research is being published, as well. Since the 1980s, publicly traded companies have spent more on science and research, but the rate of patenting remains relatively stable, and the number of scientific publications they produce is falling.",

          "abstract": "Researchers feed vast quantities of genomic data into machine-learning systems to train them to predict the role of non-coding sequences.Credit: JuSun/iStock via Getty\n\nNearly 25 years after scientists completed a draft human genome sequence, many of its 3.1 billion letters remain a puzzle. The 98% of the genome that is not made of protein-coding genes — but which can influence their activity — is especially vexing.\n\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by Google DeepMind in London could help scientists to make sense of this ‘dark matter’, and see how it might contribute to diseases such as cancer and influence the inner workings of cells. The model, called AlphaGenome, is described in a 25 June preprint.\n\n“This is one of the most fundamental problems not just in biology — in all of science,” said Pushmeet Kohli, the company’s head of AI for science, at a press briefing.\n\nThe ‘sequence to function’ model takes long stretches of DNA and predicts various properties, such as the expression levels of the genes they contain and how those levels could be affected by mutations.\n\n“I think it is an exciting leap forward,” says Anshul Kundaje, a computational genomicist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who has had early access to AlphaGenome. “It is a genuine improvement in pretty much all current state-of-the-art sequence-to-function models.”\n\nAn ‘all in one’ approach\n\nWhen DeepMind unveiled AlphaFold 2 in 2020, it went a long way towards solving a problem that had challenged researchers for decades: determining how a protein’s sequence contributes to its 3D shape.\n\nWorking out what DNA sequences do is different, because there is no one answer, as in a 3D structure that AlphaFold delivers. A single DNA stretch will have numerous, interconnected roles — from attracting one set of cellular machinery to latch onto a particular section of a chromosome and turn a nearby gene into an RNA molecule, to attracting protein-transcription factors that influence where, when and to what extent gene expression occurs. Many DNA sequences, for example, influence gene activity by altering a chromosome’s 3D shape, either restricting or easing access for the machinery that does the transcription.\n\nBiologists have been chipping away at this question for decades with various kinds of computational tool. In the past decade or so, scientists have developed dozens of AI models to make sense of the genome. Many of these have focused on an individual task, such as predicting levels of gene expression or determining how modular segments of individual genes, called exons, are cut-and-pasted into distinct proteins. But scientists are increasingly interested in ‘all in one’ tools for interpreting DNA sequences.\n\nAlphaGenome is one such model. It can take inputs of up to one million DNA letters — a stretch that could include a gene and myriad regulatory elements — and make thousands of predictions about numerous biological properties. In many cases, AlphaGenome’s predictions are sensitive to single-DNA-letter changes, which means that scientists can predict the consequences of mutations.\n\nIn one example, DeepMind researchers applied the AlphaGenome model to diverse mutations identified in previous studies in people with a type of leukaemia. The model accurately predicted that the non-coding mutations indirectly activated a nearby gene that is a common driver of this cancer.\n\nStill limited",

The latest findings, published in Nature Aging on 30 June1, show that chronic inflammation — which has been long considered a hallmark of ageing — could be a feature of industrialized living.\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\nResearchers analysed eight inflammation-linked proteins in blood samples from people living in Italy and Singapore, along with those from Indigenous participants from Bolivia and Malaysia. They found that inflammation levels increased with age and were linked with illnesses such as chronic kidney disease in the Italian and Singaporean groups. But in the two Indigenous groups, inflammation did not increase with age or lead to health conditions.\n\nThis suggests that “our assumption that inflammation is an inexorable, inevitable part of ageing is not true”, says Thomas McDade, a biological anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “We shouldn’t assume that the links between inflammation and ageing are universal.”\n\n“We’re at a point where we're rethinking the whole nature of inflammation,” says study co-author Alan Cohen, who researches ageing at Columbia University in New York City. “The things that we think of as universal based on a lot of studies in Western industrialized populations are probably just particular to our environment.”\n\nChallenging assumptions\n\nMuch of what researchers know about the biological processes that underlie ageing is based on research in wealthy countries, which suggests that inflammation increases with age and can contribute to health conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes and heart problems. But these conditions are rare in Indigenous populations.\n\nTo explore how inflammation might affect ageing in different environments, Cohen and his colleagues analysed blood samples from 1,041 participants in Italy, 941 from Singapore, 536 Tsimane people from the Bolivian Amazon and 358 Orang Asli individuals from Peninsular Malaysia. More than 50% of the people in each group were female.\n\nAgeing studies in five animals suggest how to reverse decline\n\nThe researchers measured how eight types of proteins called cytokines — molecules released by immune cells that are involved in inflammation — changed with age in each group, and whether their levels were associated with age-related health problems.",

Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library\n\nIf Stephen Quake gets his way, biologists in the future will spend a lot less time wielding pipettes. “Our goal,” he says, “is to create computational tools so that cell biology goes from being 90% experimental and 10% computational to the other way around.”\n\nQuake, head of science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) in Redwood City, California, is among the researchers leading a charge to create virtual cells. These are artificial intelligence (AI) models that can generate the kinds of insight that currently take weeks of experiments to answer — such as how tumour cells will respond to a particular drug.\n\n“It’s going to be a very powerful tool for understanding what goes wrong in disease,” says Quake, who envisions that scientists will use experiments mainly to validate predictions made by virtual cells.\n\nI told AI to make me a protein. Here’s what it came up with\n\nEfforts to create virtual cells are in their early days, but the idea has attracted intense interest in both academic and industry laboratories worldwide. CZI, a non-profit organization that develops open data sets and tools, is planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on creating virtual cells over the next decade. Google DeepMind, in London, has a virtual-cell project too, its chief executive Demis Hassabis said earlier this year.\n\n“This is a gigantic task,” says Jan Ellenberg, a molecular biologist at the Science for Life Laboratory, a national research organization in Solna, Sweden. He is co-leading the lab’s own virtual-cell model called Alpha Cell, which will launch in 2026. “What is possible now and needed now is to have the first pioneering projects that show this can, in principle, work.”\n\nBut some scientists say that the rush to develop virtual cells — although an important long-term goal for biology — has a lot of hype, but not a lot of concrete results or a clear path to success.\n\n“It’s primarily being used as a rallying cry and a funding mechanism, and it’s working,” says Anshul Kundaje, a computational biologist at Stanford University in California. “Investors are putting a huge amount of funding into this space.”\n\nBugs in the machine\n\nBiologists have been using computers to model cellular behaviour for decades. In 2012, scientists created the first computational model of an entire cell, capturing the inner workings of the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium, which has just 525 genes1.\n\nBut these and other early efforts “were often trying to really build a full mechanistic model of the cell”, says Silvana Konermann, a computational biologist at the Arc Institute in Palo Alto, California.\n\nBy contrast, the current push to develop virtual cells takes advantage of advances in AI that allow it to develop sophisticated representations of data, such as text in the case of large language models, when fed vast quantities of it. “Building models that learn from data is revolutionary,” says Quake.\n\nFive protein-design questions that still challenge AI\n\nEarly virtual-cell offerings have focused largely on one type of data: that from experiments that sequence all of the messenger-RNA molecules in individual cells, amounting to a catalogue of gene activity and a snapshot of the cell’s current state.\n\nThese data form the basis of ‘atlases’ that map different cell types across humans and other organisms, revealing underappreciated diversity. Researchers are now churning out ‘single-cell sequencing’ data sets to help power their virtual cells. CZI has plans to release sequencing data from one billion cells (expanding a database of more than 100 million), and in February, Arc released sequencing data from 100 million cancer cells treated with hundreds of drugs.\n\nSingle-cell sequencing data is appealing, says systems biologist Hani Goodarzi at the Arc Institute, because it can be affordably generated at a similar scale to that at which large language models start to gain sophisticated capabilities — in the hundreds of billions of datapoints.",

          "title": "’We couldn’t live without it’: the UCSC Genome Browser turns 25",
          "authors": "Michael Eisenstein",
          "abstract": "Jim Kent knew a thing or two about coding. A veteran of the early days of personal computing, Kent developed software for Amiga, Atari and IBM computers throughout the 1980s, including pioneering tools for computer animation.\n\nBy 2000, Kent had made the leap to bioinformatics, developing the computational genome-navigation system that would become known as the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. But his expectations were tinted by his industry experience. “I was really used to software lasting about three years,” says Kent. His latest creation, he predicted, would fare no differently.\n\nEvery base everywhere all at once: pangenomics comes of age\n\n“It didn’t happen,” says geneticist David Haussler, scientific director of the UCSC Genomics Institute that runs the Genome Browser. This month marks the 25th anniversary of the browser, which has blossomed into an essential resource for biologists around the world. On any given day, more than 7,000 unique users engage with the site, which hosts genome data from humans, mice and more than 100 other animal species and viruses, and allows researchers to annotate and interrogate those sequences in countless ways.\n\nComparative genomicist Michael Hiller at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, relies on the browser to investigate patterns of genome change across animal species to identify signatures of evolution. “Looking at the Genome Browser is a large part of what we and the other lab members do on a daily basis,” he says. He has even incorporated the tool into a course he teaches. “That’s part of the exercises,” he says.\n\nWith a steady stream of updates and user-generated annotation tools, the Genome Browser shows no signs of slowing down. “The website took on a life of its own,” says Max Haeussler, the project’s principal investigator. But as with many US-based scientific projects in 2025, the real threat to its longevity comes from tightening of the purse strings, with massive cuts and restructuring at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) putting this essential resource at risk.\n\nHitting the ground running\n\nIt began with the Human Genome Project. Haussler joined the effort in late 1999, with the goal of developing software that could identify and annotate genes in the newly assembled genome. But there was an issue. “It became clear to me very quickly that this problem of assembling the human genome from small pieces of sequenced DNA was extremely difficult, and they had no serious plan to do it,” Haussler recalls. He turned to Kent, a skilled coder who was completing a PhD at UCSC focused on developing the Intronerator, a genome browser for mapping gene expression in the worm model species Caenorhabditis elegans.\n\nIn a frenetic programming crunch that spanned several weeks in 2000, Kent developed GigAssembler — 10,000 lines of code that Haussler describes as “the assembler that saved the day”. It enabled the Human Genome Project to complete its first draft in time for its official unveiling on 26 June 2000.\n\nBioinformatician Jim Kent, who helped to develop the UCSC Genome Browser.Credit: Don Harris/UC Santa Cruz Photo Services\n\nKent’s initial interest was mostly pragmatic. “I wanted to get the human genome browser up just so that I could double-check my assembly more easily,” he says. But when he and Haussler launched the first iteration of the UCSC Genome Browser on 7 July 2000, it was an instant success. The scientific community collectively downloaded roughly half a terabyte of data in the first 24 hours of the browser’s operation, the team estimates — a staggering amount at the time.\n\nThe genome was then only about 90% complete and rife with gaps, but the world finally had a freely available window for surveying it. “Just being able to go to a browser view of early gene annotations or early cloning enterprises was like a magnet,” says Barbara Wold, a molecular biologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. “It drew everybody into the community of users.” Importantly, the browser also established objective ‘mile markers’ that researchers could use to map discoveries and variants in individual genomes.\n\nIan Holmes, a computational biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, also credits Kent and the UCSC team for normalizing the idea that genomic data should be free and easy to engage with and reuse. “The idea that everything should be available on the web and not desktop applications was still an extremely radical idea then,” says Holmes. “They invented a tonne of file formats and just ways of storing data that we are widely using today.”\n\nSenator Tom Harkin (Democrat) helped to secure funding for the Human Genome Project, which was able to assemble the sequence using code from the UCSC Genome Browser team.Credit: NHGRI/NIH\n\nOver the next few years, the Genome Browser updated its maps with the latest data from the Human Genome Project, as well as from other popular model species, including the mouse and rat. Kent also introduced a defining feature, based on his experience with the Intronerator: the ability for users to generate and share custom ‘tracks’ that selectively annotate key features of the genome. Tracks are interactive visual road maps, presented alongside the genome, that chart the location of important features such as regulatory elements and disease-associated gene variants. “We were way ahead of everybody with that feature, and I think that’s really kind of why we ended up so much in the middle of the ecosystem,” says Kent.\n\nThe effort gained early momentum thanks to buy-in from key international consortia such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. ENCODE was focused on the functional motifs that populate the 98.5% of the human genome that does not contain protein-coding gene sequences. Haussler says that the Genome Browser’s roster of custom tracks “grew dramatically” during the ENCODE team’s work, allowing users to visualize the many promoters, enhancers and non-protein-coding RNAs that the consortium uncovered.\n\nA durable resource\n\nStill, Kent’s initial gloomy prediction of the browser’s life expectancy was not unreasonable — such narratives are typical in academia. “Imagine if Microsoft Office disappears every three years,” says Haeussler. “This is the case for most bioinformatics-software packages.” Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers move on, and platforms stagnate even as new data accumulate, until somebody else is compelled to develop a replacement.\n\nHow the human genome transformed study of rare diseases\n\nAnd the data have steadily poured in. “There are no White House meetings any more when you publish a genome,” says Haeussler, referring to the announcement of the first human genome draft. “Now we get one a day, or even ten a day.” And it isn’t only genomes, but also new layers of information that people want to map on top of them, such as full-length RNA transcripts and epigenetic signals that play a central part in gene regulation. At the same time, the tool’s user base has grown steadily.\n\nThe UCSC Genome Browser’s ability to survive and accommodate this growth is partly attributable to the early decision to build a team of dedicated programmers and engineers. Many of these were seasoned Silicon Valley veterans impressed by the browser’s ambitions and scrappy origin story. “I kind of crashed [Kent’s] PhD defence,” says Angie Hinrichs, a former microchip designer who had minimal biology expertise but nevertheless volunteered for the Genome Browser team in early 2002. “And then, in May, when they were hiring, I just barely managed to squeak in over their requirements.” She would be one of the first new hires on a team that swelled to roughly 30 people at its peak.\n\nOutput from the UCSC Genome Browser showing information for the human SHH gene, which is involved in embryonic development.Credit: Perez et al. The UCSC Genome Browser database: 2025 update. Nucleic Acids Research 2025 PMID\n\nAccess to affordable and powerful computing infrastructure hasn’t hurt, either. “In the early days, it probably seemed like a lot to have 32 processors, and now our development machine has 192,” says Hinrichs. The data themselves, as well as the code to run the browser, reside on petabyte-scale arrays that include numerous super-speedy, solid-state hard drives, she adds.\n\nThe Genome Browser’s codebase has grown from just 10,000 lines to more than three million, Haussler says. But its fundamental architecture has not changed much in 25 years. Hinrichs says: “There have been many chefs in the kitchen, and it’s gotten a little messy, but the core structure of it was so clean that it has actually worked and we can still develop on it. I credit Jim Kent for that.”\n\nFrom Kent’s perspective, this durability is attributable to his focus on creating modular code that can be tweaked without bringing down the whole edifice, as well as a dedicated testing corps. “We had a quality-assurance team that was about half the size of the software-development team,” he says. “I think we only had to roll back a previous version once.”\n\nHuman Genome Project - Nature’s editor-in-chief reflects 20 years on\n\nThe team has had to devise more efficient ways to handle data, however. In 2011, for example, it introduced the ‘track hub’ format as a solution to the increasingly large and complex custom tracks that external laboratories were developing for genome annotation. Track hubs comprise sets of relatively compact binary files that are hosted by the data creators themselves, rather than at UCSC. The data are streamed on demand, and “Jim’s file formats are designed so you can jump between them,” says Haeussler. The ability to rapidly and selectively access the relevant parts of the remotely hosted data minimizes the amount that needs to flow back and forth between the user and the Genome Browser. This maintains performance speed even as the number of tracks rises. “We have thousands of labs making them, but most of them we never see,” says Haeussler.\n\nAnd in 2023, the team launched the initiative GenArk (Genome Archive) to accommodate the unending influx of new genome sequences (H. Clawson et al. Genome Biol. 24, 217; 2023). This system makes it straightforward for the Genome Browser to pluck newly uploaded genomes from the Assembly database hosted by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), allowing researchers to view and annotate those genomes. GenArk currently hosts more than 6,000 genomes, ranging from bacteria to primates.\n\nSomething for everyone",

          "authors": "Humberto Basilio",
          "abstract": "After being charged last month with trying to smuggle frog embryos into the United States, Kseniia Petrova, a Russian bioinformatician, was indicted on 25 June on additional charges by a grand jury in Boston, Massachusetts — including making a false statement to customs agents. Petrova is one of at least four foreign scientists facing criminal charges for attempting to bring biological material into the country, adding to the anxiety rippling through the research community as the administration of US President Donald Trump slashes science spending and cracks down on immigration.\n\nInternational PhD students make emergency plans in fear of US immigration raids\n\nNature talked to research and legal specialists to understand whether these cases cropping up is unusual and how lab materials should be transported. Detentions for carrying undocumented biological material into the United States happen every year, says Jonathan Grode, an attorney at the immigration law firm Green and Spiegel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who is not involved in any of the cases.\n\nTypically, if a person enters the country with a non-hazardous item that is either prohibited or lacks the proper documentation, the authorities confiscate the item, inform the individual of the proper procedure to retrieve it and issue a fine for failing to follow protocol, Grode says. If something is considered hazardous, that changes the calculus, as does being a repeat offender. If you’re both of those things “you are going to get arrested, you are going to be fined and you are going to be denied entry to the country”, he adds.\n\n“The rules have not changed” under the Trump administration, Grode says. What has is the “sensationalism” around any foreigner who has problems at the border, whether from the media or from the Trump team highlighting the case in its deportation efforts, he adds.\n\nCustoms violations\n\nPetrova, who had been working at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, was arrested in February for allegedly failing to declare the embryos when transporting them to Harvard from France. At a hearing on 18 June, Brian Goldsworthy, an agent for the US Department of Homeland Security, testified that border agents at Boston’s Logan International Airport asked Petrova whether she had food in her bag and she said no — but she was actually carrying a foam box containing the embryos.\n\nPetrova’s immigration attorney, Gregory Romanowsky, contends that border agents broke protocol, because the alleged customs violation should have triggered a civil process rather than a criminal one. Instead, agents treated the issue as an immigration violation, revoked Petrova’s visa and started deportation proceedings, he says. She spent 116 days in detention before her release from federal custody on bail on 12 June.\n\nKseniia Petrova was released on bail from federal custody on 12 June.Credit: Leah Willingham/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nPetrova might be able to avoid some of the criminal charges, because there are questions about whether the embryos were hazardous, Grode says, but her mistake was not to tell the authorities about the embryos in the first place. “That is the number-one way you can find yourself in trouble,” he says.\n\nIn another case, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested Yunqing Jian, a Chinese postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, earlier this month. According to court documents, in July last year, her partner, Zunyong Liu, a researcher at Zhejiang University in China, tried to bring samples of a fungus known as Fusarium graminearum, which can harm cereal crops such as wheat, into the United States. He initially denied carrying the fungus in his backpack, the documents say, but then admitted he was taking it to Jian’s university, where he said he planned to study it during his visit. Following an investigation by the FBI, both plant pathologists have been charged with conspiracy, smuggling and making false statements, and Liu has also been charged with visa fraud. Jian remains in custody in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed by FBI agent Edward Nieh on 2 June, phone records show that this wasn’t the first time Jian and Liu had smuggled biological materials into the United States.\n\n‘Another blow’: how Trump’s latest travel ban could harm research\n\nOn 8 June, another Chinese scientist, Chengxuan Han, was arrested at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Han, a biologist at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, was planning to spend a year conducting research at the University of Michigan, according to a criminal complaint filed as part of the case. The authorities detained her and charged her, alleging that she had, on four occasions, sent staff members at the University of Michigan “concealed biological materials” that were “related to round worms”, according to a press release issued by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told Nature that parasitic roundworms can cause significant damage to crops, leading to economic hardship for farmers. The criminal complaint filed with the case doesn’t mention parasitic roundworms — only Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of roundworm frequently used in the laboratory as a model organism.\n\nThe hazardousness of the materials that the scientists sent will need to be assessed in each case, as will the scientists’ intent in using the materials, but their lack of transparency will make their cases more difficult, Grode says. “It’s not so much what was being sent, but the effort to conceal what was being sent,” he says.",

          "authors": "Meghie Rodrigues",
          "abstract": "Credit: Lena Trindade/BrazilPhotos/Alamy\n\nNiède Guidon, a Brazilian archaeologist, was one of the first researchers to challenge a long-standing consensus on when and how early humans arrived in the Americas. The Clovis-first theory — popularized by US archaeologists in the mid-twentieth century — posited that people first migrated from Asia to the Americas across the Bering Strait about 11,500 years ago. They then moved southwards, colonizing first North America and then South America. But Guidon, who studied cave paintings, hearths and worked stones in the state of Piauí in northeastern Brazil, found evidence that the region might have been occupied more than 30,000 years ago. Her conclusions caused uproar in the scientific community. Guidon has died aged 92.\n\nBorn in the city of Jaú in São Paulo state, Guidon had a French grandfather who taught her his language when she was a child. In 1961, after receiving her diploma in natural history at the University of São Paulo, she went to the Paris Panthéon-Sorbonne University to study prehistoric archaeology. Returning to Brazil, she worked at the Paulista Museum in São Paulo, where she first learnt about the ancient rock paintings in Piauí.\n\nWho were the ancient Denisovans? Fossils reveal secrets about the mysterious humans\n\nDespite having no political affiliations, Guidon was anonymously denounced as a communist under the Brazilian military dictatorship that began in 1964. She went back to Paris and lived there until 1986. There, she became a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and obtained her PhD at the Sorbonne in 1975. In 1970, she made her first trip to Piauí. She was so impressed with the ancient art that, in 1973, she organized a Franco-Brazilian expedition to the region. The team found 55 archaeological sites, including some scattered with flaked and polished pebbles that she attributed to human action.\n\n“We thought, then, that these sites were recent,” she wrote in a 2003 account for ComCiência magazine, “because, like all American archaeologists, we believed that the Americas had been populated late.” But what Guidon and her team found in a collection of rock shelters called the Toca do Boqueirão da Pedra Furada suggested otherwise. Over decades, the researchers carbon-dated hearths at several stratigraphic levels, finding that some were more than 50,000 years old. Her 1986 Nature paper, written with Georgette Délibrias, one of France’s leading radiocarbon researchers at the time, presented charcoal dated to 32,000 years before the present — more than twice the age of any other known human settlement in the Americas (N. Guidon and G. Delibrias Nature 321, 769–771; 1986).\n\nGuidon’s work was met with scepticism in the United States, and heated debates ran for decades. Her critics argued that the dated hearth remains resulted from natural fires and that the flaked pebbles had been formed naturally in rockfalls. Still, Guidon’s relentlessness eventually convinced even some of her detractors to take her evidence seriously. In 2013, Walter Neves, a bioanthropologist at the University of São Paulo, told Pesquisa Fapesp magazine that he had analysed the Pedra Furada pebbles at Guidon’s invitation. He was “99% convinced that the artefacts were in fact produced by men”.\n\nOldest stone tools in Europe hint at ancient humans’ route there\n\nGradually, a body of research corroborating Guidon’s theory began to take shape — including pre-Clovis findings elsewhere in the Americas and doubts that the route across the Bering Strait was ice-free during the time frame required in the Clovis-first hypothesis. Acceptance of the Clovis-first model has continued to decline, despite occasional findings that seem to support it.",

          "abstract": "Students rally in Westwood, California, in protest against funding cuts and job losses in science.Credit: Myung J. Chun/LA Times/Getty\n\nResearch is under attack in the United States. The availability of grant funding from institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Science Foundation (NSF) — especially for anything remotely related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) — is now in question, at least for the next few years. This will result in many researchers having to find alternative income streams, or even leaving science altogether.\n\nOne of the programmes that I oversee on my campus was terminated last month. The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) provided students from under-represented groups with extra funding and mentorship on a weekly basis. Now, fewer opportunities are available for these mostly first-generation students from low-income backgrounds and lower-performing schools. The funding was provided by the NSF, and supported professional development activities for emerging leaders in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. LSAMP is just one such programme; many more are on the chopping block.\n\nHow Trump is following Project 2025’s radical roadmap to defund science\n\nSome states, including my home state of California, are being specifically targeted for large-scale funding cancellations, so things are escalating quickly. For example, a few weeks ago, the news outlet Politico reported that the federal government was considering cutting education and research funds for California, thanks to a continuing feud over immigration.\n\nIn total, billions of dollars’ worth of grants are being terminated. One colleague working for the US Agency for International Development has had their position ended. Another worked at the NIH as an adviser on health disparities and has also lost their job. Many of my colleagues at universities in California have had their grants wrapped up early, especially those who focus on health disparities and DEI. As a result, they have had to look elsewhere for financial support.\n\nBrandon and his family have planted fruit trees, and he hopes that selling their produce could provide him with a secondary source of income should he lose his grant funding.Credit: Brandon Brown\n\nThe grant funding I receive from various sources covers part of my salary, which is guaranteed by the state because of my tenured position. But many states, including Hawaii, Texas and Ohio, are now considering bans and limits on tenure. If this were to happen in California, I would be particularly at risk given that my work focuses on health-disparity topics that are being targeted for cancellation: HIV, global research ethics and supporting emerging faculty members who are conducting research into the challenges faced by ageing adults in minority groups.\n\nIt would be naive to think that this won’t affect the job market: I expect many researchers to lose their salaries, jobs and health-care insurance as grants and funding dry up. This is already starting to happen. Frankly, it’s time for many scientists to start thinking about a career change, or at least how they might diversify their income streams to protect themselves against a loss of funding or a period of unemployment.\n\nMany think that the current challenges will be reversed after a few years, but that is a long time to be without an income. And even if most scientists were able or willing to move abroad, it’s unlikely that there would be enough overseas funding to make up for cuts to science here in the United States.\n\nOne way to protect against these cuts might be to develop other streams of income while still pursuing a scientific career. Each of us has things we are good at apart outside scientific area of expertise. For example, my family and I have planted fruit trees and grown tomato plants, and we keep chickens that lay eggs, and my network allows me to sell those products. Other colleagues are generating cash from pet sitting and copyediting, working as a paid nanny or a personal chef, picking up paid teaching opportunities in schools and consulting for community-based organizations.",

And at least two government agencies say they are terminating all their contracts with the company.\n\n‘Totally broken’: how Trump 2.0 has paralysed work at US science agencies\n\nThe move comes amid criticisms of top academic journals by high-ranking Trump officials, and will mean that staff members at the affected agencies will no longer be able to easily access the company’s more than 3,000 journals, including the flagship title Nature. (The Nature news team is editorially independent of its publisher, Springer Nature.)\n\nAlthough it’s unclear precisely how many contracts the Trump administration is terminating, the government-spending database USASpending.gov shows that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US Department of Energy (DOE) cut US$3 million in contracts with the company earlier this month. A spokesperson for the USDA told Nature's news team that it “has cancelled all contracts and subscriptions to Springer Nature. The journal [sic] is exorbitantly expensive and is not a good use of taxpayer funds”. NASA also confirmed that it is cancelling its subscriptions.\n\nWhen the news team reached out to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — the world’s largest funder of biomedical science — asking whether its subscriptions were still intact, a spokesperson initially said they were and that use of these resources helps staff members to “promote transparency and replicability in research”.\n\nHours later, Andrew Nixon, the top spokesperson for the NIH’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said: “All contracts with Springer Nature are terminated or no longer active. Precious taxpayer dollars should be [sic] not be used on unused subscriptions to junk science.”\n\nNIH-funded science must now be free to read instantly: what you should know\n\nThe HHS did not answer Nature’s follow-up queries about whether it intended to cut contracts with other large academic publishers, whether this move would prevent government scientists from publishing in journals that charge article-processing fees and whether it could provide examples of “junk science” published by Springer Nature.\n\nA Springer Nature spokesperson said in a statement that the company “continues to have good relationships with U.S. federal agencies” and that it doesn’t comment on individual contracts. “Across our U.S. business there is no material change to our customers or their spend,” they added. So far, the USASpending.gov database doesn’t show any terminations for the NIH, the HHS or NASA. In total, the database shows that seven government agencies have contracts meant to pay more than $20 million to Springer Nature this year.\n\nThe White House and the DOE did not respond to Nature’s queries. The US National Science Foundation, one of the world’s biggest funders of basic research, told Nature’s news team that its subscriptions with Springer Nature remain active and declined to comment further.\n\n“When they say, ‘junk science’, it’s not clear what they mean,” says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and co-founder of the media organization Retraction Watch. With the lack of details justifying the cuts and because several of Springer Nature’s journals are considered prestigious, Oransky says, “I’m having a hard time taking at face value that this is not political”. It would be unprecedented for a prominent subscriber to make a “sweeping move like this for political reasons”, he adds.\n\nJournals under fire\n\nLate last month, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr called top medical journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, “corrupt”, suggesting that they have ties to pharmaceutical companies, and he threatened to bar government scientists from publishing in them.

Results published on 25 June in Cell show that consistent exercise raises levels of the compound, at least in young men. The study also found that feeding betaine to aged mice boosts their immune health and grip strength.\n\nWhether it will have similar beneficial effects in people remains to be seen. But there is a need for treatments that can mimic the effects of exercise, says Christiane Wrann, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “There are people in the ageing population who don’t have the capacity any more to exercise to the extent they need,” she says.\n\nNo pill measures up\n\nFor now, there is no drug like exercise. It can sharpen the mind, soothe inflammation and rally cells to repair damaged tissue. It helps to keep some diseases at bay or ease their symptoms. “Physical activity is a recognized efficient and low-cost way to promote health and fight ageing,” says Guanghui Liu, who studies regenerative medicine at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. “But its deep-level molecular mechanisms are still not fully clear.”\n\nAgeing studies in five animals suggest how to reverse decline\n\nTo learn more, Liu and his colleagues enlisted the aid of 13 healthy young men willing to put their fitness goals on hold and lounge about for 45 days of limited physical activity. After that, the volunteers ran 5 kilometres every one or two days. The researchers took blood and stool samples and various physiological measurements from the men after their 45-day rest, and again after 25 days of their new running routine.\n\nA detailed analysis of those samples revealed the extent to which exercise reshapes the body at a molecular level. After 25 days of regular running, there were changes in immune cells, lipid metabolism, the gut microbiome and more.\n\nOne of the biggest changes was in the abundance of betaine. Following up on these results in mice, the team found that exercise induced betaine production mainly in their kidneys. They also found that the molecule binds to and inhibits a protein called TBK1, which is known to promote ageing in cells and organs.\n\nFurthermore, old mice that drank water spiked with betaine had stronger muscles, less inflammation and more-youthful skin than did their counterparts that did not get the supplement.",

Kennedy Jr have recommended against the use of influenza vaccines containing a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal — fulfilling a long-held goal of the anti-vaccine movement.\n\nThe vote’s practical effects in the United States are limited, because most US flu vaccine doses are already free of thimerosal, which is present only in multi-dose vials, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And the ingredient was removed from all childhood vaccines in 2001. The committee, which includes a number of members who are sceptical of vaccines, also approved several measures supporting vaccination.\n\nTrump team vows to improve kids‘ health: scientists are sceptical\n\nThimerosal has long been a target of the anti-vaccine movement, despite strong evidence supporting its safety in the low doses found in vaccines. Public-health officials and scientists say that the vote’s symbolic effects are powerful as they struggle to maintain public confidence in vaccines. “We are talking about such a small amount of vaccine” containing thimerosal, says Chrissie Juliano, executive director of Big Cities Health Coalition, an association of US health departments in Takoma Park, Maryland. “What this does is sow mistrust. It confuses the public.”\n\n“It was an anti-science recommendation,” says Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. “We have the information we need to tell us that thimerosal, at the level contained in vaccines, is a trivial contribution to the mercury that we’re exposed to every day.”\n\nAfter the meeting, members of the committee published a joint statement saying that they strongly support the “use of vaccines and other countermeasures, predicated on evidence-based medicine ...We came to this meeting with no pre-determined ideas”.\n\nHandpicked panel\n\nThe decision came today during the first meeting of the newly chosen Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel that recommends which vaccines US residents should receive and when. Most US health-insurance programmes, which fund health care for US residents, are required to provide vaccines recommended by the ACIP at no cost. Earlier this month, Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, fired all 17 members of the committee and appointed eight new ones, some of whom have publicly cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines. (One new member stepped down shortly before the meeting.)\n\nBefore the vote, the committee heard a presentation by Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner and president emeritus of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, founded by Kennedy. She advocated for the removal of the ingredient from US vaccines, pointing to various studies to make her case.\n\nWill RFK Jr’s vaccine agenda make America contagious again?\n\nOffit, who is a former member of the ACIP, says that subject-matter experts typically vet presentations before the meeting — a step that was not followed in this case — and would probably have flagged some of the data that Redwood presented as inaccurate. A version of Redwood’s slides posted before the meeting contained a reference to a paper that doesn’t exist, according to Reuters. The reference was later removed.\n\nSome members of the committee echoed Redwood’s claims about the safety of thimerosal, but member Cody Meissner, a paediatrics researcher at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine in Lebanon, New Hampshire, criticized the meeting’s focus on the compound. “I’m not quite sure how to respond to this presentation. This is an old issue that has been addressed in the past,” he said. “Of all the issues that ACIP needs to focus on, this is not a big issue,” he added. His was the only dissenting vote on the recommendation against thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nMeissner expressed concerns that the ACIP’s recommendation could affect access to vaccines in other countries. “The recommendations that the ACIP makes are followed among many countries around the world,” he noted, and removing thimerosal from all vaccines could increase costs. Multi-dose vials, which are the ones that still contain the ingredient, are generally cheaper and easier to store and use in mass vaccination programmes.",

          "title": "Harvard vs Trump: what this epic battle means for science",
          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "Mary Rice was among hundreds of scientists at Harvard University who watched helplessly as millions of dollars in research funds disappeared in an instant in mid-May. Two of the pulmonologist’s grants were formally cancelled as part of a series of punitive actions taken by the administration of US President Donald Trump against the university. Little justification was given to Rice aside from a statement that her research does not align with government priorities.\n\nThe cuts imperil Rice’s work at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, including a US$2.5-million clinical trial designed to test whether air purifiers benefit people with lung disease. Terminating that trial, she says, would waste millions of dollars in taxpayer money that have already been spent, as well as the time, blood and nasal tissues that nearly 180 people contributed to the study. “If we were to just close up shop completely today, we would not get an answer.”\n\nHarvard researchers devastated as Trump team cuts nearly 1,000 grants\n\nRice is on the front lines as Harvard seeks to navigate its new relationship with the US government, which has shifted from long-standing partner to hostile adversary. The Trump administration alleged that Harvard has failed to protect against antisemitism, and the government has demanded changes to the university’s curriculum as well as hiring and enrolment procedures that it says promote a liberal political agenda. The administration has terminated grants worth more than $2.4 billion over multiple years and sought to ban international students from attending the institution. Harvard is fighting both actions in court.\n\nLegal experts argue that Harvard is ultimately likely to prevail in its challenges to the Trump administration’s latest attacks, but how and when remains unclear. Trump has said that the government is nearing a deal with the university, but researchers told Nature that long-term threats to science at Harvard are likely to remain no matter what kind of deal emerges. For example, the administration is pushing broader efforts to increase taxes on university endowments and slash ‘indirect’ funds in research grants, which pay for infrastructure at the institutions that host the grants. The government has taken similar punitive measures against other elite universities, such as Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island; Columbia University in New York City; Cornell University in Ithaca, New York; and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nBut the Trump administration has aimed its harshest actions at Harvard — arguably the most prestigious US university and the one with the largest endowment, a $53-billion pot of money that comes from donations and helps to fund university activities. The issues facing Harvard, say researcher leaders, are harbingers of what could come for scores of other US universities as the government seeks to slash funding for scientific research and increase oversight of educational institutions.\n\nIn June, a federal judge ruled that hundreds of National Institutes of Health grant terminations by the government were illegal and discriminatory, and that they had to be reinstated. Some of these include grants to Harvard.\n\nResponding to allegations in this article, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Harvard has failed “to create a safe campus environment”, refused to share information about foreign students’ “illegal or dangerous activities” and flouted the civil rights of students and faculty members. “Suggestions that there will be economic impacts for enforcing federal law and holding institutions accountable for their failure to protect civil liberties miss the forest for the trees and completely neglect the human cost of allowing dangerous ideologies like antisemitism to fester in America.”\n\nScientists and academics who spoke to Nature say that the Trump administration has, in the space of five months, upended a science and innovation system that dates back to the Second World War and has helped the United States to become a scientific and economic powerhouse. Like their counterparts at other universities, Harvard leaders are now thinking about how to design a viable — and probably smaller — institution that is less reliant on federal support.\n\n“The uncertainties are immense,” says John Holdren, a physicist at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and science adviser during the presidency of Barack Obama. “If federal funding is substantially reduced over any significant period of time, it’s going change the institution in substantial ways.”\n\nFinancing the future\n\nWith its vast endowment, Harvard has more resources than other universities to withstand the unprecedented cuts in federal funding. Federal grants supplied $686 million in fiscal year 2024, accounting for nearly three-quarters of research revenue and 11% of the total for the university (see ‘Harvard’s revenue’).\n\nSource: Harvard Univ. Financial Report Fiscal Year 2024\n\nAlthough much of the endowment is locked up in long-term investments and legally dedicated to a variety of specific causes, university leaders have been busy looking for ways to tap into those funds, including seeking permission from donors to use the money to help solve the immediate crisis. Since March, the university has also raised $1.2 billion by issuing bonds. So far, Harvard has announced that it will spend $250 million to help cushion the blow to its schools as federal funding disappears; resources will be allocated in proportion to the amount lost.\n\nThe US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?\n\nIn a 3 June e-mail to faculty, George Daley, dean of the medical school, said it will receive $90 million. The medical school will then contribute a further $120 million to fund research over the coming fiscal year, which begins on 1 July. All told, Daley, said in the e-mail, the medical school expects to be able to cover 74% of the cancelled federal grants over the coming year. He promised to work with department chairs and school leadership “to adjust and support the research as much as we can”.\n\nNow it’s up to department chairs to determine how the money is distributed and which positions and projects get cut. But alternative funding mechanisms — such as borrowing money and tapping into the endowment — cannot continue indefinitely, says Jeffrey Flier, an endocrinologist and former dean of the medical school. Without a restoration of federal funding or a significant increase in investments from philanthropic organizations and industry, he adds, “Harvard Medical School’s research programmes will look drastically different in four years.”\n\nStay or go\n\nThe situation is even more dire at the Chan school of public health. More than $200 million in federal research grants account for nearly half of its budget this year, and international students comprise 40% of the student body. Around 21% of the budget comes from the school’s share of the Harvard endowment, but researchers fear that this revenue could also drop if the Trump administration and fellow Republicans in Congress increase the tax on university endowments, as expected. Another 12% comes from student tuition fees.",

          "title": "Eureka! The brain science behind lightbulb moments",
          "authors": "Humberto Basilio",
          "abstract": "Mindia Wichert has taken part in plenty of brain experiments as a cognitive-neuroscience graduate student at the Humboldt University of Berlin, but none was as challenging as one he faced in 2023. Inside a stark white room, he stared at a flickering screen that flashed a different image every 10 seconds. His task was to determine what familiar object appeared in each image. But, at least at first, the images looked like nothing more than a jumble of black and white patches.\n\n“I’m very competitive with myself,” says Wichert. “I felt really frustrated.”\n\nCognitive neuroscientist Maxi Becker, now at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, chose the images in an attempt to spark a fleeting mental phenomenon that people often experience but can’t control or fully explain. Study participants puzzling out what is depicted in the images — known as Mooney images, after a researcher who published a set of them in the 1950s1 — can’t rely on analytical thinking. Instead, the answer must arrive all at once, like a flash of lightning in the dark (take Nature’s Mooney-images quiz below).\n\nBecker asked some of the participants to view the images while lying inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, so she could track tiny shifts in blood flow corresponding to brain activity. She hoped to determine which regions produce ‘aha!’ moments.\n\nOver the past two decades, scientists studying such moments of insight — also known as eureka moments — have used the tools of neuroscience to reveal which regions of the brain are active and how they interact when discovery strikes. They’ve refined the puzzles they use to trigger insight and the measurements they take, in an attempt to turn a self-reported, subjective experience into something that can be documented and rigorously studied. This foundational work has led to new questions, including why some people are more insightful than others, what mental states could encourage insight and how insight might boost memory.\n\nBecker’s study aimed to find out how the rapid reorganization and integration of knowledge that she and others think is a defining feature of insight happens in the brain and whether it’s linked to memory2. Through such work, researchers could better explore memory and learning more generally, and perhaps find ways to enhance both.\n\n“We are at this extremely exciting verge, where we can get closer to insight than we have ever come before,” says Becker.\n\nCapturing the flash\n\nWhereas analytical thinking involves using logic and reasoning to arrive at a solution in a step-by-step way, insight is a sudden realization that seems to pop into conscious awareness. These mental leaps can lead to a grand discovery or solution, or something more mundane — the answer to a daily word puzzle, for example.\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, cognitive psychologists wrestled with how to distinguish insight from analytical problem solving. Although consensus was growing that insight was distinct, not everyone agreed. Cognitive psychologist Robert Weisberg at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has argued, for example, that insight might not be as different from analytical thinking as it seems. He has suggested that insight, too, comes from the brain gradually building on what it already knows — incorporating new information with each failed attempt. For him, the main feature of insight is the emotion that someone feels after finding an answer or creating something that seems new.\n\n“It’s true that we get aha! experiences,” says Weisberg. “But that doesn’t mean the underlying process is different. It just means the outcome knocks your socks off.”\n\nCognitive neuroscientist John Kounios, who began studying insight in the 1990s at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, has a different view. For him, insight isn’t about adding up knowledge to arrive at an answer. Instead, it’s when a person spontaneously forms new knowledge. Sometimes, says Kounios, now at Drexel University in Philadelphia, “it’s the solution to a problem they didn’t even know they had”.\n\nMost early insight research was based on self-reports alone. Kounios decided to bring a different type of data into the field. In the early 2000s, he began using technologies including fMRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) — which captures electrical activity — to look for a distinct signature of insight in the brain. “We were prepared to be proven wrong,” he says.\n\nIn the laboratory, he and cognitive neuroscientist Mark Beeman at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, used what are known as remote associate problems to trigger aha! moments. Participants were tasked with finding a word that connects three seemingly unconnected ones, such as ‘home’, ‘sea’ and ‘bed’. (The answer is ‘sick’.) After each attempt, they reported whether the solution came with an aha! feeling. If so, they rated the strength of the feeling. Kounios and Beeman used fMRI scans and EEGs to monitor participants’ brains as they solved the puzzles.\n\nIn their early experiments3, Kounios, Beeman and their colleagues found that insight was accompanied by a burst of activity and blood-flow changes in the right side of the brain, in a region called the right superior temporal gyrus, which is associated with learning, memory and language processing. This activity occurred just 300 milliseconds before participants pressed a button to report being consciously aware of the answer. Kounios and Beeman had detected an aha! signal in the brain.\n\nThe consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?\n\nThe pair also found that neural activation linked to insight is more sudden and localized than that for analytical problem-solving, supporting the notion that insight is an abrupt realization of knowledge rather than a gradual accumulation.\n\nFurther studies have shown that insight consistently includes a burst of high-frequency gamma waves that can involve different areas of the brain. Another common region of activity is the anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in attention, emotion and decision-making.\n\nKounios, Beeman and others have done “really rigorous research” to demonstrate how insight is grounded in brain activity, says cognitive psychologist Daniel Schacter at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, adding that such work will improve our understanding of other forms of creative cognition.\n\nIn 2020, cognitive neuroscientist Carola Salvi at John Cabot University in Rome reported another line of evidence supporting the idea that insight and analytical problem-solving are distinct processes. In an experiment with 38 participants, Salvi discovered that people’s pupils rapidly dilated about 500 milliseconds before they reported having an insight — signalling a shift in awareness4. When participants solved problems analytically, their eyes instead made tiny, rapid movements known as microsaccades.\n\nEarly cognitive psychologists who described insight as a distinct process were onto something, says Salvi. “A hundred years later, we were finally able to say they were right,” she says.\n\nMemory follows insight\n\nSalvi thinks that pupil dilation reflects a shift in cognitive processing linked to activity in a brain network involved in regulating attention and arousal, which might also influence memory formation.\n\nA link to memory would make sense, Salvi says. Psychologists have observed that people tend to better remember moments of their lives marked by strong emotions. “That’s why you can remember a lot of details of events like your first date or your wedding,” says Salvi.\n\nFor the past decade, cognitive psychologist Amory Danek at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, has been studying whether such a memory boost also comes with the emotional experience of insight.\n\nShe decided to move away from the three-word puzzles that other researchers had been using. She suggests that these stimuli lack an element present in real-world aha! moments: an initial false representation that forced people to restructure the problem to solve it. “They were quite boring,” says Danek. “I was not satisfied with that.”\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nInstead, Danek decided to collaborate with a professional magician for her experiments. After showing study participants videos of a magician performing tricks, she asks the participants to attempt to work out how the tricks were done. Participants come up with a solution and report whether they arrived at it through insight. “Magicians put the observers in the wrong mental set before they do a trick,” says Danek. “Observers have to break free from this initial wrong problem representation in order to understand how it’s done.”\n\nDanek also thought magic tricks would elicit more intense emotions, which people easily recognize and can thus reliably report. She asks study participants reporting a solution to rate on a scale from 0 to 100 their feelings of suddenness, certainty and pleasure, for example.\n\nIn one experiment, participants tried to remember the solutions two weeks after watching the tricks5. Danek found that people who reported discovering how a magic trick was achieved through insight were better able to remember the solution than were those who didn’t experience insight. She calls this memory boost the “insight memory advantage”6.\n\nCognitive neuroscientist Roberto Cabeza at Duke University says that insight often comes with mental processes related to memory, such as semantic learning — when people find that solutions align well with what they already know — and emotional memory, which strengthens recall through emotional engagement.\n\nOther research hints that people are better at remembering unrelated, random information that they encounter around the time of aha! moments, as well as ‘d’oh!’ moments, when a solution is revealed and suddenly feels obvious7.",

After all, typical EF measures require forms of decontextualized/arbitrary processing which decades of cross-cultural work indicate develop primarily in “schooled worlds”–industrialized societies with universal schooling. Here, we report comparisons of performance on typical EF tasks by children inside, and wholly outside schooled worlds. Namely, children ages 5 to 18 from a postindustrial context with universal schooling (UK) and their peers in a rural, nonindustrialized context with no exposure to schooling (Kunene region, Namibia/Angola), as well as two samples with intermediate exposure to schooled worlds. In line with extensive previous work on decontextualized/arbitrary processing across such groups, we find skills measured by typical EF tasks do not develop universally: Children from rural groups with limited or no formal schooling show profound, sometimes qualitative, differences in performance compared to their schooled peers and, especially, compared to a “typical” schooled-world sample. In sum, some form of latent cognitive control capacities are obviously crucial in all cultural contexts. However, typical EF tasks almost certainly reflect culturally specific forms of cognitive development. This suggests we must decide between using the term EF to describe 1) universal capacities or 2) the culturally specific skill set reflected in performance on typical tasks. Either option warrants revisiting how we understand what has been measured as EF to date, and what we wish to measure going forward.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Y. Lee",
          "abstract": "In recent years, trust in US public health and science institutions has faced unprecedented declines, particularly among Republicans/conservatives. To what extent might institutional criticism on social media be responsible for such politically polarized declines in institutional trust? Two online survey experiments (total N = 6,800), using samples roughly reflective of the US adult population, examined the effects of key types of criticism against the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results suggest that just a single exposure to any of the key types of criticism was sufficient to undermine institutional trust. While an institutional rebuttal was partially able to reverse these effects, residual declines in trust were substantial enough to cause decreased intentions to adhere to the AHRQ/CDC health recommendation featured in the experiments. While institutions should, therefore, be concerned about all types of social media criticism, those featuring morally charged trust-undermining narratives attacking the integrity of the AHRQ/CDC generated dramatically more anger (i.e., moral outrage), which in turn attracted social media engagement preferences likely to promote viral spread and exacerbate preexisting institutional politicization and issue polarization. These results suggest that efforts to bolster institutional trust should pay special attention to criticisms featuring integrity-based trust-undermining narratives.",

Here, we outline how the public sphere for science is transforming as media evolve, and we connect these changes to the high-stakes issue context of COVID-19. We argue that scientific organizations’ struggles to adapt to evolving media are linked, in part, to asymmetries in which social media platforms prevent researchers from producing reliable data that could inform institutional change and improve science communication. This has been apparent in studies of echo chambers and filter bubbles. Producing a more usable evidence base, we conclude, will require that scholars a) obtain access to proprietary data, b) reconceptualize information ecologies as social systems, c) avoid ceding core research tasks to platforms, d) address ethical issues, and e) grapple with the urgency of moving forward productively.",

Community-engaged science, which focuses on shared leadership and mutual benefit in scientific partnership with communities, has the potential to transform science, communities, and even society. Despite this promise, however, community-engaged science is not always transformative. Presentations and discussions at the 5th National Academies Science Communication Colloquium demonstrated the importance of creating structures, practices, and a culture of science engagement that prioritizes listening and learning from communities. Based on presentations at the colloquium, research publications, and our own experiences, we share a set of evidence-informed principles that are common to successful community-engaged science across many contexts: respect, humility, listening, reciprocity, mutuality, and reflexivity. We also offer steps the scientific community can take to advance and improve the transformative practice of community-engaged science as part of a productive ecosystem of scientific activities: evolving norms and culture, integrating community science into current systems, building incentives and structures to support community-engaged science, developing a workforce skilled in community engagement, and investing in a coordinated research-to-practice agenda.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human productivity. A key question is how generative AI affects learning—namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. Learning is critical to long-term productivity, especially since generative AI is fallible and users must check its outputs. We study this question via a field experiment where we provide nearly a thousand high school math students with access to generative AI tutors. To understand the differential impact of tool design on learning, we deploy two generative AI tutors: one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (“GPT Base”) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (“GPT Tutor”). Consistent with prior work, our results show that having GPT-4 access while solving problems significantly improves performance (48% improvement in grades for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction in grades for GPT Base)—i.e., unfettered access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards in GPT Tutor. Without guardrails, students attempt to use GPT-4 as a “crutch” during practice problem sessions, and subsequently perform worse on their own. Thus, decision-makers must be cautious about design choices underlying generative AI deployments to preserve skill learning and long-term productivity.",

          "abstract": "Collective cooperation maintains the function of many natural and social systems, making understanding the evolution of cooperation a central question of modern science. Although human interactions involve complex contact networks, current explorations are limited to static networks, where social ties are permanent and do not change over time. In reality, human activities often involve temporal interactions, where links are impermanent, and understanding the evolution of cooperation on such temporal networks is an open problem. Here, we systematically analyze how cooperation spreads on arbitrary temporal networks, and we distill our results down to a concise condition, which integrates evolutionary game dynamics with both static and temporal interactions. We find that the emergence of cooperation is facilitated by a simple rule of thumb: Hubs (individuals with many social ties) should be temporally deprioritized in interactions. For empirical applications, we further provide a quantitative metric capturing the priority of hubs, which is validated on empirical datasets based on its effectiveness in orchestrating the ordering of interactions to best promote cooperation. Our findings unveil the fundamental advantages conferred by temporal interactions for promoting collective cooperation, transcending the specific insights gleaned from studying static networks.",

          "abstract": "Empirical social networks are characterized by a high degree of triadic closure (i.e., transitivity, clustering): network neighbors of the same individual are also likely to be directly connected. It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form such ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se versus other processes such as homophily and more opportunities for exposure. These mechanisms are difficult to disentangle in many settings. On social media, however, they can be decomposed - and platforms frequently make decisions that depend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we randomize the existing network structure that a user faces when they are followed by a target account that we control. We then examine whether the user reciprocates this tie formation. Being randomly assigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie formation by 35%. Through multiple control conditions, we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that indicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure should be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and accordingly we find larger effects when the subject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial role for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what might be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these tendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and information diffusion in online networks.",

Using data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, we examined a developmental cascade model in which shifts in pubertal tempo following early caregiving disruptions come at an epigenetic cost. Among 115 individuals, all of whom experienced severe deprivation early in life, we tracked caregiving disruptions across childhood; assessed pubertal timing and tempo across adolescence; and quantified the pace of cellular aging via telomere erosion across the second decade of life. We demonstrate that a greater number of caregiving disruptions is associated with delayed pubertal timing and an acceleration of pubertal tempo. In turn, accelerations in pubertal tempo are associated with significantly greater telomere erosion across time. A formal mediation model indicated that greater caregiving disruptions during childhood predicted greater telomere erosion through an acceleration of pubertal tempo. By documenting the impact of caregiving disruptions on pubertal development and ultimately biological aging, these findings highlight the importance of the stability of the caregiving context and the critical need to ensure that organizations caring for vulnerable children establish programs and policies to minimize unnecessary disruptions.",

We begin with an overview of research demonstrating that when scientists’ identities or ideologies align (or are perceived to align) with those of the public, trust in science increases. We then highlight intellectual humility as a potential tool for cultivating trust in the social sciences even when social scientists’ and the public’s identities or ideologies do not match. Specifically, intellectual humility among social scientists predicts less bias toward one another’s research and hence may increase the diversity of perspectives to which the public is exposed and shift public perceptions of social scientists.

Another emphasizes participation and engagement with the goal of improving public understanding of science and scientists’ understanding of the public’s concerns, needs, and values. We argue that participatory approaches better address contemporary challenges concerning scientific uncertainty, politicized science, artificial value neutrality, and a reactive science communication infrastructure. These approaches though need to move away from transactional partnerships toward more cocreation and coproduction of knowledge. They also need to focus more on less motivated and/or engaged populations.

          "abstract": "The contact between two rough surfaces has been a topic of significant interest since early studies on Coulombic friction and remains crucial for numerous technological applications. However, theoretical progress has outpaced experiments due to the challenges in measuring contact areas across scales ranging from subnanometers to macroscopic dimensions. Here, we demonstrate the use of commonly available infrared-based (IR) spectroscopy in combination with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical simulations to measure separation gaps and contact areas for glassy polymers ranging in roughness over two orders in magnitude. With the combined IR and FDTD simulations, we can overcome the optical diffraction limits and take advantage of the chemical specificity of IR spectroscopy to overcome limitations due to scattering. The scaling of the contact area ratio as a function of pressure illustrated the limitations of using pure elastic or plastic deformation in explaining the results. At both low and high pressures, the contact area ratios scale linearly with pressure as expected for purely elastic deformations at low pressures or plastic deformations at high pressures. However, if analyzed over a broad range of pressure, the power laws we observe are much larger than 1, exemplifying the need to consider elastoplastic models in explaining results for softer polymer contacts compared to other brittle, glassy materials. In comparison, the separation gaps scale exponentially with pressure, as expected. These results have important implications for the interpretation of properties such as friction, adhesion, and conductivity for softer, glassy contact interfaces.",

          "abstract": "Regulation of proteome homeostasis is crucial for the survival and adaptation to changing environments for all species. In eukaryotes, this process is finely tuned through regulation at the level of transcription, translation, protein modification, and protein degradation. The phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAA) is present in all eukaryotes and believed to be a key player in ubiquitin-dependent protein sorting and degradation via its interactions with ubiquitin and/or the AAA+ ATPase, valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97). PLAA’s molecular targets and interaction network remain unclear. We used Caenorhabditis elegans and unbiased proteome-scale approaches to investigate neuronal specific interactors of the C. elegans PLAA ortholog UFD-3 (ubiquitin fusion degradation 3), its effect on ubiquitinated proteins, and global protein expression changes in an ufd-3 mutant. We found that PLAA may play a unique role in cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) processing bodies (P-bodies). Using biochemical analysis in vitro and fluorescence imaging in C. elegans , we show that UFD-3 directly interacts with the mRNA decapping complex regulatory subunit DCAP-1. UFD-3's intrinsic disordered region (IDR), which contains conserved amino acid motifs, is important for the recruitment of DCAP-1 to P-bodies. Finally, we show that loss of the IDR does not affect UFD-3's role in sorting ubiquitinated proteins through the multivesicular body pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that UFD-3's role in P-bodies is distinct from its role in the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway and the IDR is only critical for UFD-3-regulated P-bodies pathways. Thus, PLAA/UFD-3 might regulate the proteome via two distinct pathways: ubiquitinated protein turnover, as well as mRNA regulation through P-bodies.",

          "abstract": "The endosomal–lysosomal network is a hub of organelles that orchestrate the dynamic sorting of hundreds of integral membrane proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. VPS29 is a central conductor of this network through its assembly into Retromer, Retriever, and Commander endosomal sorting complexes, and its role in regulating RAB GTPase activity. Two VPS29 isoforms have been described, VPS29A and VPS29B, that differ solely in their amino-terminal sequences. Here, we identify a third VPS29 isoform, which we term VPS29C, that harbors an extended amino-terminal sequence compared to VPS29A and VPS29B. Through a combination of AlphaFold predictive modeling, in vitro complex reconstitution, mass spectrometry, and molecular cell biology, we find that the amino-terminal VPS29C extension constitutes an autoinhibitory sequence that limits access to a hydrophobic groove necessary for effector protein recruitment to Retromer, and association with Retriever and Commander. VPS29C is therefore unique in its ability to uncouple Retromer-dependent cargo sorting from the broader roles of VPS29A and VPS29B in regulating the endosomal–lysosomal network through accessory protein recruitment. Our identification and characterization of VPS29C points to additional complexity in the differential subunit assembly of Retromer, an important consideration given the increasing interest in Retromer as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "The cerebellar cortex is organized into discrete regions populated by molecularly distinct Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole cortical output neurons. While studies in animal models have shown that PC subtypes differ in their vulnerability to disease, our understanding of human PC subtype and vulnerability remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that human cerebellar regions specialized for motor vs. cognitive functions (lobule HV vs. Crus I) contain distinct PC populations characterized by specific molecular and anatomical features, which show selective vulnerability in essential tremor (ET), a cerebellar degenerative disorder. Using a known PC subtype marker, neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH), we found that motor lobule HV contains PCs with high NEFH expression, while cognitive lobule Crus I contains PCs with low NEFH expression in postmortem samples from healthy controls. In the same cerebella, PC axons in lobule HV were 2.2-fold thicker than those in Crus I. Across lobules, axon caliber positively correlated with NEFH expression. In ET cerebella, we identified motor lobule-specific PC axon pathology with a 1.5-fold reduction in caliber and increased axon variability in lobule HV, while Crus I axons were unaffected. Tremor severity and duration in ET correlated with axon diameter variability selectively in lobule HV PCs. Given that axonal caliber is a major determinant of neural signaling capacity, our results 1) suggest that disrupted cerebellar corticonuclear signaling is occurring in ET, and 2) provide evidence of region-specific PC populations in the human cerebellum and offer insight into how different PC subpopulations may contribute to the pathophysiology of cerebellar degeneration.",

          "abstract": "The fossil record often creates an illusion of sudden evolutionary bursts, which may reflect preservation biases rather than actual biological events. The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) appears to mark the abrupt rise of diverse reef-building metazoans during the late Darriwilian (~460 Ma), seemingly contradicting gradual evolutionary models. Here, we demonstrate this apparent burst is largely an artifact of a global sea-level fall (~475 to 460 Ma) that produced widespread unconformities. Integrated stratigraphic and fossil occurrence data reveal early reef-builders likely appeared earlier than the late Middle Ordovician, but their record was erased by sea-level-driven erosion. During the peak of this sea-level fall (Dapingian Stage, 471 to 469 Ma), both carbonate deposition and fossil occurrences were minimal, with significant correlation between carbonate preservation and reef-builder occurrences. The subsequent transgression enabled these already-diversified organisms to recolonize shallow-water environments simultaneously across multiple regions, generating a misleading impression of sudden diversification. This “Sppil–Rongis effect” biased our understanding of the GOBE in reef ecosystems, illustrating how stratigraphic incompleteness can distort evolutionary patterns. Rather than a discrete evolutionary event, the GOBE reflects a continuous trajectory, interrupted and reshaped by sea-level fluctuations.",

One promising strategy is analyzing the spatial pattern of activity correlations across cell populations. In the primary auditory cortex (A1), cells respond to different sound features. On the large scale, there exists a tonotopic map, which is fractured at the small scale, raising the question of whether functional connections are spatially ordered or disordered. To test whether functional connectivity on a local and a global scale is also disordered, we first designed a robust statistical model to estimate parameters and test for the significance of the estimated correlation maps. We developed an inference method that allows efficient model fitting and statistical testing to project the correlation maps to 2D space. We then performed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layer 2/3 of A1 with pure tones (PT) or a combination of two tones (TT; harmonically related or not). We found that the spatial patterns of signal correlations (SCs) depend on the type of sound stimuli that were presented. The functional 2D maps of PT-driven SCs are more restricted to local neurons than TT signal correlations which showed more global textures. 2D SC patterns for harmonic stimuli showed spatially distinct relationships. TT SCs revealed spatially precise functional connectivity between harmonically related neurons. Thus, even though the frequency preference of neighboring neurons in A1 is functionally diverse, the functional connection pattern of these neurons is functionally precise and harmonically related.",

To fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated testicular cell maturation at weeks 5 (W5), W6, W8, W15, and W19 postconception using a rhesus macaque model. Our data identify a major transcriptional change in the somatic cells of the testis (Sertoli cells, interstitial cells and fetal Leydig cells) between W8 and W15, and this is associated with the maturation of seminiferous cords and maturation of PGCs into fetal spermatogonia.

          "abstract": "Hydrocephalus, a neurological condition characterized by an excessive buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, affects millions worldwide and leads to severe consequences. Current treatments, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunts, divert excess CSF from the brain but often face complications, mainly due to shunt obstructions caused by biological matter accumulation. While previous shunt designs aimed to improve fluid flow and reduce occlusion, they often lacked the precision needed for real-world applications due to simplified simulation models that did not fully capture the dynamics of the cerebral ventricular system. Here, we introduce BrainFlow, a computational model that integrates detailed anatomical and physiological features to simulate CSF dynamics in the presence of shunt implants. BrainFlow incorporates patient-specific medical imaging data, pulsatile flow to mimic cardiac cycles, adjustable parameters for various hydrocephalus conditions, and a biomolecule tracking feature to evaluate the long-term risk of shunt occlusion due to flow-mediated biomolecular transport. This model provides a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to shunt obstruction, offering insights into optimal shunt placement, design, and materials choice. Through validation against four-dimensional MRI flow data, BrainFlow demonstrates robust accuracy across multiple flow metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for the development of next-generation shunts tailored to individual patient anatomy and pathology, ultimately aiming to improve hydrocephalus treatment through informed, patient-specific design strategies.",

          "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that causes life-threatening infections. Its cell envelope contains anionic polymers called teichoic acids that are required for cell viability. Teichoic acids come in two forms and are made by different biosynthetic pathways. One form, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), is anchored in the cell membrane; the other form, wall teichoic acid (WTA), is covalently linked to the peptidoglycan cell wall. Although the LTA and WTA biosynthetic pathways have been characterized, regulation of teichoic acid production is not well understood. Here, we identified SpbR ( SAOUHSC_00965 ), a polytopic membrane protein similar to a eukaryotic CAAX protease, as a factor that controls LTA levels in S. aureus cells. We show that loss of SpbR results in short LTAs and a synthetically sick phenotype when WTA biosynthesis is prevented, whereas overexpressing SpbR results in elongated LTAs. Mechanistically, we find that SpbR physically associates with the type I signal peptidase SpsB, which cleaves LtaS, the polymerase that assembles LTA on the extracellular side of the membrane, and we show that this physical interaction inhibits SpsB cleavage of LtaS both in vivo and in vitro. Although the phenotypes investigated here are dominated by SpbR’s effects on LtaS, it also inhibits cleavage of other SpsB substrates. Based on its role in regulating the activity of SpsB, we named this factor SpbR ( S ignal p eptidase b R egulator).",

In cyanobacteria, single RRM domain proteins are involved in mRNA targeting to the thylakoid membrane and acclimation to certain stress conditions, but many details of their physiological functions and molecular targets have remained unknown. The model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has a family of three genes encoding the RRM domain–containing proteins Rbp1, Rbp2, and Rbp3. Here, we verified the RNA-binding activity of Rbp3 in vivo and show that cells of a Δ rbp3 deletion strain had a lower photosystem (PS) I:PSII ratio and decreased pigment content and were significantly smaller than wild-type cells. To identify the set of interacting molecules, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with a strain expressing a C-terminally FLAG-tagged Rbp3. Mass spectrometry of the elution fraction suggested physical proximity between Rbp3, ribosomes, and a very small number of other proteins. The most highly enriched transcript in the coeluting RNA fraction was the psaAB mRNA. This was corroborated by fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses showing decreased psaA mRNA signals in Δ rbp3 , and colocalization with Rbp3 fusions to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the wild type. Other mRNAs coenriched with Rbp3 encode thylakoid, plasma membrane, and carboxysome proteins. Binding assays using Bio-layer Interferometry validated the Rbp3- psaAB mRNA interaction, indicating a preference for folded RNA segments near or overlapping the respective stop codons.",

In this study, we observed a continuous LLPT with an inversion of electronegativity in a K–Rb binary alloy. This uniquely exhibits a three-state system behavior. The transition, induced by pressure-driven reordering of electronic orbital energies, progresses through a sequence from s -metal to electride to d -metal, accompanied by a valence reversal: Potassium transitions from a negative to a positive valence, while rubidium undergoes the opposite shift. This process is marked by two successive anomalies in the alloy’s optical, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties over a broad pressure range. The observation of similar LLPT phenomena in other alkali and alkaline earth metal liquids suggests that this three-state system mechanism may provide broader insights into the nature of continuous phase transitions.",

This field is sufficiently strong to ionize water and produce the H 4 O 2 + cation, a hydroxyl radical adduct with a hydronium ion.

          "abstract": "Darwinian evolution results from an interplay between stochastic diversification of heritable phenotypes, impacting the chance of survival and reproduction, and fitness-based selection. The ability of populations to evolve and adapt to environmental changes depends on rates of mutational diversification and the distribution of fitness effects of random mutations. In turn, the distribution of fitness effects of stochastic mutations can be expected to depend on the adaptive state of a population. To systematically study the impact of the interplay between the adaptive state of a population on the ability of asexual populations to adapt, we used a spatial agent-based model of a neoplastic population adapting to a selection pressure of continuous exposure to targeted therapy. We found favorable mutations were overrepresented at the extinction bottleneck but depleted at the adaptive peak. The model-based predictions were tested using an experimental cancer model of an evolution of resistance to a targeted therapy. Consistent with the model’s prediction, we found that enhancement of the mutation rate was highly beneficial under therapy but moderately detrimental under the baseline conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering population fitness in evaluating the fitness distribution of random mutations and support the potential therapeutic utility of restricting mutational variability.",

Accumulating evidence from patients with PIK3CA -related disorders indicates that peripheral nerves are frequently affected, leading to severe neurological symptoms. However, the exact underlying mechanism of these disorders remains unclear. To address this, we developed a mouse model with a PIK3CA gain-of-function mutation specifically in Schwann cells, which successfully mirrored the clinical features observed in patients. In this model, we observed that PIK3CA -mutated cells communicate with neighboring healthy cells, such as adipocytes and hair follicles, through a unique crosstalk mechanism that triggers their growth, proliferation, and anagen phase expansion. Additionally, we demonstrated that PIK3CA mutation in peripheral nerves leads to a metabolic shift through glycolytic activation. We investigated the effects of alpelisib, an approved pharmacological inhibitor of PIK3CA, in the model. Early administration of alpelisib significantly improved the signs and symptoms in the mice. However, when treatment was delayed, its efficacy was diminished due to the drug’s inability to penetrate the myelin sheath effectively. In summary, our study offers a valuable mouse model for studying PIK3CA -related neuropathy, uncovers a unique communication between healthy and affected tissues, and highlights the potential benefits of early pharmacological intervention using alpelisib.",

          "abstract": "Morphine is a µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and potent analgesic. However, it displays several side effects including respiratory depression and addiction. Here, we show that a single heavy atom replacement in the morphine core structure (O to CH 2 exchange in the E-ring) prepared through a 15-step total synthesis displays a different pharmacological profile. The total synthesis features an intramolecular inverse electron-demand Diels−Alder cycloaddition and a stereoselective Giese radical addition to construct a quaternary carbon center. Unlike morphine, where the (–)-morphine enantiomer binds the MOR, both enantiomers of this “carba” variant, which we have named carbamorphine, possess activity as agonists of the MOR. Cell-based functional assays show that (+)-carbamorphine shows reduced G-protein as well as β-arrestin efficacy at the MOR. In mouse behavioral assays, (+)-carbamorphine exhibits MOR-selective antinociception while showing reduced respiratory depression and a lack of conditioned place preference at supratherapeutic doses. Overall, through a net “single-atom” change (i.e., O to CH 2 ) in the morphine framework, different pharmacological profiles have been realized. This work provides a basis for additional syntheses and the study of morphine analogs that incorporate atom changes in the core framework.",

Here, we extend and improve existing approaches and develop three novel landscape phylogeographic methods that can test the impact of continuous environmental factors on the diffusion velocity of viral lineages. In order to evaluate the different methods, we also implemented two simulation frameworks to test and compare their statistical performance. The results enable us to formulate clear guidelines for the use of three complementary landscape phylogeographic approaches that have sufficient statistical power and low rates of false positives.

Over the 1993–2022 altimetry era, the BSL change rate is 1.75 ± 0.59 mm/y (2σ) as observed by SLR. The rate increases to 2.16 ± 0.59 mm/y (SLR) and 2.13 ± 0.38 mm/y (GRACE/-FO) over 2003–2022, mainly due to accelerated ice loss in Greenland since the 2000s. The remarkable agreement between SLR and GRACE/-FO estimates over the joint period cross-validates each other, suggesting that both work well in monitoring BSL changes. We also compare our satellite gravimetry estimates with the sum of individual mass change components (ice sheets, glaciers, and land water storage) obtained from multisource datasets (in situ, remote sensing and geophysical modeling). The differences are within 0.2 mm/y over the three decades, highlighting the global consistency of different techniques for observing Earth’s surface mass changes. Moreover, we reconcile the global mean sea level (GMSL) rise budget using reprocessed altimetry data and updated thermosteric sea level ensembles. From 1993 to 2022, the sum of thermosteric and SLR-based barystatic contributions (3.16 ± 0.64 mm/y) agrees well with altimetry-observed GMSL rate (3.22 ± 0.28 mm/y), suggesting that the GMSL rise budget can be closed within uncertainties over the last three decades.",

This research aims to examine the independent and interactive between- and within-person associations of sleep duration and sleep onset timing on next-day PA duration in two large, longitudinal samples of adults under free-living conditions. In the primary study, participants (N = 19,963; 5,995,080 person-nights) wore a validated biometric device (WHOOP) for 1 y (01/09/2021 to 31/08/2022). Objective sleep and PA metrics were derived from the wrist-worn device. Generalized additive mixed models assessed between- and within-person associations between sleep and PA variables, adjusted for age, sex, Body Mass Index, weekday/weekend, seasonal effects, biometric feedback, and autocorrelated errors. Between participants, longer sleep duration and later sleep onset timing were associated with decreased moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and overall PA duration ( ps &lt; 0.001). Within participants, sleeping shorter-than-usual and falling asleep earlier-than-usual were associated with increased next-day MVPA and overall PA, whereas sleeping longer-than-usual, or falling asleep later-than-usual, showed the opposite relationship ( ps &lt; 0.001). Next-day MVPA duration was highest following earlier-than-usual sleep onset timing combined with one’s typical sleep duration. Results were consistent but smaller in magnitude in the external validation study (N = 5,898; 635,477 person-nights) using Fitbit data from the All of Us Research Program. Individuals may sacrifice time in one health behavior for time in the other. Interventions promoting exercise and holistic public health messaging should consider the temporal dynamics between sleep and next-day PA outcomes.",

The steroidogenic enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (3βHSD1) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target and the corresponding inhibitors, biochanin-A (BCA) and its derivatives, suppress tumor growth in preclinical models and patients. However, the poor oral bioavailability of BCA hinders its clinical application. Here, we employed a sophisticated computational approach to refine the structural design of 3βHSD1 inhibitors. AlphaFold2 was utilized to construct detailed models of 3βHSD1 binding to various substrates. These models, in conjunction with the elucidated enzymatic mechanism of 3βHSD1, guided the optimization of a series of BCA-related compounds. Our structure–activity relationship studies identified HEAL-116 as a potent 3βHSD1 inhibitor. HEAL-116 exhibited enhanced binding specificity to the substrate-binding pocket of 3βHSD1 and effectively neutralized the local charge environment. The incorporation of hydrophilic groups in its structure also markedly enhanced its oral bioavailability. HEAL-116 robustly inhibited 3βHSD1 activity and exerted pronounced antitumor effect in biochemical, cellular, and mouse models. Our findings lay the foundation for the clinical translation of 3βHSD1 inhibitors, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of prostate cancer and potentially other diseases.",

We further demonstrate that IFNε, a hormonally regulated cytokine produced in the human reproductive system, is protective against T. vaginalis cytoadherence and cytolysis of host cells.

          "abstract": "D-peptides hold great promise as therapeutics by alleviating the challenges of metabolic stability and immunogenicity in L-peptides. However, current D-peptide discovery methods are severely limited by specific size, structure, and the chemical synthesizability of their protein targets. Here, we describe a computational method for de novo design of D-peptides that bind to an epitope of interest on the target protein using Rosetta’s hotspot-centric approach. The approach comprises identifying hotspot sidechains in a functional protein–protein interaction and grafting these side chains onto much smaller structured peptide scaffolds of opposite chirality. The approach enables more facile design of D-peptides and its applicability is demonstrated by design of D-peptidic binders of influenza A virus hemagglutinin, resulting in identification of multiple D-peptide lead series. The X-ray structure of one of the leads at 2.38 Å resolution verifies the validity of the approach. This method should be generally applicable to targets with detailed structural information, independent of molecular size, and accelerate development of stable, peptide-based therapeutics.",

          "authors": "Kristin R. Osika, Matthew N. Gaynes, David W. Christianson",
          "abstract": "Drimenol synthase from Aquimarina spongiae (AsDMS) is a highly unusual chimera that integrates two distinct, sequential isoprenoid processing activities within a single polypeptide chain. AsDMS catalyzes the class II cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form drimenyl diphosphate, which then undergoes enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis to yield drimenol, a bioactive sesquiterpene alcohol with antifungal and anticancer properties. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of AsDMS and its complex with a sesquiterpene thiol. The AsDMS structure exhibits a didomain architecture consisting of a terpene cyclase β domain and a haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatase domain, with two distinct active sites located on opposite sides of the protein. Mechanistic studies show that dephosphorylation of the drimenyl diphosphate intermediate proceeds through stepwise hydrolysis such that two equivalents of inorganic phosphate rather than inorganic pyrophosphate are coproducts of the reaction sequence. When the AsDMS reaction is performed in H 2 18 O, 18 O is not incorporated into drimenol, indicating that the hydroxyl oxygen of drimenol originates from the prenyl oxygen of FPP rather than a water molecule from bulk solution. These results correct a mechanistic proposal previously advanced by another group. Surprisingly, AsDMS exhibits substrate promiscuity, catalyzing the conversion of the slowly reactive substrate mimic farnesyl- S -thiolodiphosphate into cyclic and linear sesquiterpene products. Structural and mechanistic insights gained from AsDMS illustrate the functional diversity of terpene biosynthetic enzymes and provide a foundation for engineering “designer cyclase” assemblies capable of generating a wide variety of terpenoid products.",

Furthermore, while metabolic homeostasis depends on the balance between the production and consumption of metabolites, there have been limited investigations into the mechanisms regulating their consumption. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism has diverse functions, including methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, and transsulfuration, making its regulation and control crucial. Recent studies have revealed the feedback regulation of SAM production; however, the mechanisms governing its consumption are still poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the stability of SAM levels in the fat body (FB) of Drosophila , which serves as a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver and adipose tissue, under conditions of SAM shortage, including nutrient deprivation. We found that glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), a major SAM-consuming methyltransferase in the FB, decreased via the nuclear ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS), along with the inhibition of SAM synthesis and starvation. The inhibition of Gnmt level reduction by suppression of the nuclear UPS causes starvation tolerance. Thus, the regulation of Gnmt levels through nuclear UPS-mediated reduction helps maintain SAM levels under SAM shortage conditions.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how humans have altered coral reef food webs remains challenging due to the absence of prehistoric baselines. Here, we use fish remains preserved in fossil and archaeological deposits from Panamá and the Dominican Republic to explore how Caribbean reef fish mortality patterns have changed over millennia. By quantifying accumulation rates of shark dermal denticles (scales) and bony fish otoliths (ear stones) in reef sediments, we assess relative fish abundance, while otolith size serves as a proxy for body size at death. Comparisons of these death assemblages suggest a 75% decline in shark-derived material and a 22% reduction in the sizes of human-targeted fishes—consistent with historical exploitation. This evidence of decline in large-bodied, higher trophic level fish remains coincided with a doubling in prey fish otolith accumulation and a 17% increase in their reconstructed body sizes. These patterns in time-averaged death assemblages align with effects of release from predation, documenting an often assumed (but rarely shown) cascading effect. In contrast, otoliths of predator-sheltered cryptobenthic fishes showed no change in either accumulation or size, suggesting that ‘‘bottom–up”environmental factors were not responsible for the observed changes. Together, these data indicate that pre-exploitation predator communities strongly controlled exposed prey fishes, but this “top–down” effect diminishes rapidly toward the food chain base, especially in predator-resistant groups. Understanding trophic cascades on Caribbean reefs requires studying systems before predator depletion.",

          "abstract": "The outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by diderm bacteria have important roles in cell envelope homeostasis, secretion, interbacterial communication, and pathogenesis. The facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STm) activates OMV biogenesis inside the acidic vacuoles of host cells by upregulating the expression of the OM protein PagC, one of the most robustly activated genes in a host environment. Here, we used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy (EM), with native bacterial OMVs, to demonstrate that three histidines, essential for the OMV biogenic function of PagC, constitute a key pH-sensing motif. The NMR spectra of PagC in OMVs show that they become protonated around pH 6, and His protonation is associated with specific perturbations of select regions of PagC. The use of bacterial OMVs is a key aspect of this work enabling NMR structural studies in the context of the physiological environment. PagC expression upregulates OMV production in Escherichia coli , replicating its function in STm. Moreover, the presence of PagC drives a striking aggregation of OMVs and increases bacterial cell pellicle formation at acidic pH, pointing to a potential role as an adhesin active in biofilm formation. The data provide experimental evidence for a pH-dependent mechanism of OMV biogenesis and aggregation driven by an OM protein.",

Here, we found that beyond the regulation of mRNA transcript abundance, light regulates alternative splicing (AS) in the filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans , Trichoderma guizhouense, and Neurospora crassa . Blue light-regulated AS was involved in ergothioneine biosynthesis and conidiation in T. guizhouense , which required the blue light receptor BLR1. Blue light activated the MAPK HOG (Sak) pathway which then transmitted the signal via the serine/threonine kinase SRK1 to the AS key regulator SRP1. SRK1 and SRP1 are important for light-induced conidiation. The light-activated HOG pathway led to an increase of the SRK1 protein level and its phosphorylation status. Phosphorylated SRK1 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to interact with SRP1, thereby regulating AS efficiency. This study unravels another level of complexity of fungal environmental sensing and responses and also first describes the entire cascade from an environmental signal to the splicing machinery.",

          "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) assimilation by the enzyme Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (Rubisco) underpins biomass accumulation in photosynthetic bacteria and eukaryotes. Despite its pivotal role, Rubisco has a slow carboxylation rate ( k cat CO 2 ) and is competitively inhibited by oxygen (O 2 ). These traits impose limitations on photosynthetic efficiency, making Rubisco a compelling target for improvement. Interest in Form II Rubisco from Gallionellaceae bacteria, which comprise a dimer or hexamer of large subunits, arises from their nearly fivefold higher k cat CO 2 than the average Rubisco enzyme. As well as having a fast k cat CO 2 (25.8 s − 1 at 25 °C), we show that Gallionellaceae Rubisco (GWS1B) is extremely sensitive to O 2 inhibition, consistent with its evolution under semianaerobic environments. We therefore used an in vivo mutagenesis-mediated screening pipeline to evolve GWS1B over six rounds under oxygenic selection, identifying three catalytic point mutants with improved ambient carboxylation efficiency: Thr-29-Ala (T29A), Glu-40-Lys (E40K), and Arg-337-Cys (R337C). Full kinetic characterization showed that each substitution enhanced the CO 2 affinity of GWS1B under oxygenic conditions by subduing oxygen affinity, leading to 25% (E40K), 11% (T29A), and 8% (R337C) enhancements in carboxylation efficiency under ambient O 2 at 25 °C. By contrast, under the near anaerobic natural environment of Gallionellaceae , the carboxylation efficiency of each mutant was impaired ~16%. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of artificial directed evolution to access distinctive regions of catalytic space in Rubisco.",

Here, we present a global kinetic model to describe lipid-induced amyloid aggregation of α -synuclein. Using this framework, we find that α -synuclein fibrils form via a two-step primary nucleation mechanism and that lipid molecules are directly involved in both the nucleation and fibril elongation steps, giving rise to lipid–protein coaggregates. To illustrate the applicability of this kinetic approach to drug discovery, we identify the mechanism of action of squalamine, a known inhibitor of lipid-induced α -synuclein aggregation, revealing that this small molecule reduces the rate of lipid-dependent primary nucleation.

          "abstract": "Insects frequently form associations with maternally transmitted symbiotic bacteria. This transmission mode ensures that symbiont-conferred effects, both beneficial and negative, are passed onto offspring. Here, we report an extreme example of symbiont-mediated temperature sensitivity imposed by a vertically transmitted, defensive symbiont. Pea aphids infected with the bacterial endosymbiont, Fukatsuia symbiotica, resist infection by fungal pathogens but produce few or no offspring when moved from cool (15 °C) to mildly warmer temperatures (20 °C). This temperature-dependent reduction in host fitness is associated with increased symbiont abundance, disordered symbiont localization, and high expression of a horizontally acquired nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) locus. This NRPS operon is syntenic with the locus responsible for the production of Herbicolin A, a known antifungal produced by some plant-associated Erwiniaceae . Activity of chemical extracts from infected aphids is predictive of in vivo protection against entomopathogenic fungi, indicating that an Herbicolin A–like molecule is the likely source of Fukatsuia’s protective effects against fungal pathogens. Injection of the same chemical extracts into naive aphids partially recapitulates developmental defects observed in natural infections at 20 °C, suggesting that increased levels of this compound contribute to disrupted embryonic development. Finally, the purification of the causal agent revealed Fukatsuia produces a compound similar but not identical to Herbicolin A, that exhibits both antifungal and hemolytic activity. These results suggest that F. symbiotica infection imposes a trade-off between antifungal defense and disrupted embryonic development, mediated by a single genetic locus.",

          "abstract": "There is overwhelming evidence that forest trees are locally adapted to climate. Thus, genecological models based on population phenotypes have been used to measure local adaptation, infer genetic maladaptation to climate, and guide assisted migration. However, instead of phenotypes, there is increasing interest in using genomic data for gene resource management. We used whole-genome resequencing and common-garden experiments to understand the genetic architecture of adaptive traits in black cottonwood. We studied the potential of using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic prediction to detect causal loci, identify climate-adapted phenotypes, and inform gene resource management. We analyzed population structure by partitioning phenotypic and genomic (single-nucleotide polymorphism) variation among 840 genotypes collected from 91 stands along 16 rivers. Most phenotypic variation (60 to 81%) occurred among populations and was strongly associated with climate. Population phenotypes were predicted well using genomic data (e.g., predictive ability r &gt; 0.9) but almost as well using climate or geography ( r &gt; 0.8). In contrast, genomic prediction within populations was poor ( r &lt; 0.2). We identified many GWAS associations among populations, but most appeared to be spurious based on pooled within-population analyses. Hierarchical partitioning of linkage disequilibrium and haplotype sharing suggested that within-population genomic prediction and GWAS were poor because allele frequencies of causal loci and linked markers differed among populations. Given the urgent need to conserve natural populations and ecosystems, our results suggest that climate variables alone can be used to predict population phenotypes, delineate seed zones and deployment zones, and guide assisted migration.",

While being more susceptible to extinction and as such potentially targeted for conservation interventions such as genetic rescue, small-island populations can experience relatively less anthropogenic habitat degradation than those on larger islands. Here, we determine the consequences and conservation implications of long-term isolation and recent human activities on genetic diversity of island populations of two forest-dependent mammals endemic to the Wallacea archipelago: the anoa ( Bubalus spp.) and babirusa ( Babyrousa spp.). Using genomic analyses and habitat suitability models, we show that, compared to closely related species, populations on mainland Sulawesi exhibit low heterozygosity, high inbreeding, a high proportion of deleterious alleles, and experience a high rate of anthropogenic disturbance. In contrast, populations on smaller islands occupy higher-quality habitats, possess fewer deleterious mutations despite exhibiting lower heterozygosity and higher inbreeding. Site frequency spectra indicate that these patterns reflect stronger, long-term purging in smaller-island populations. Our results thus suggest that conservation efforts should focus on protecting small-island high-quality habitats and avoiding translocations from mainland populations. This study highlights the crucial role of small offshore islands for the long-term survival of Wallacea’s iconic and indigenous mammals in the face of development on the mainland.",

          "abstract": "Antagonistic interactions are critical determinants of microbial community stability and composition, offering host benefits such as pathogen protection and providing avenues for antimicrobial control. While the ability to eliminate competitors confers an advantage to antagonistic microbes, it often incurs a fitness cost. Consequently, many microbes only produce toxins or engage in antagonistic behavior in response to specific cues like quorum sensing molecules or environmental stress. In laboratory settings, antagonistic microbes typically dominate over sensitive ones, raising the question of why both antagonistic and nonantagonistic microbes are found in natural environments and host microbiomes. Here, using both theoretical models and experiments with killer strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we show that “boom-and-bust” dynamics—periods of rapid growth punctuated by episodic mortality events—caused by temporal environmental fluctuations can favor nonantagonistic microbes that do not incur the growth rate cost of toxin production. Additionally, using control theory, we derive bounds on the competitive performance and identify optimal regulatory toxin-production strategies in various boom-and-bust environments where population dilutions occur either deterministically or stochastically over time. Our mathematical investigation reveals that optimal toxin regulation is much more beneficial to killers in stochastic, rather than deterministic, boom-and-bust environments. Overall, our findings show how both antagonistic and nonantagonistic microbes can thrive under varying environmental conditions.",

In Escherichia coli , it was shown that 1) FtsZ recruits all essential divisome proteins to the septum, including the core sPG synthase complex, FtsWIQLB, and its activator, FtsN; 2) FtsWIQLB must complex with FtsN to be activated to synthesize sPG under the wildtype background; and 3) the Brownian ratcheting by treadmilling FtsZ polymers drives the directional movements of sPG synthase proteins along the septum circumference; and 4) FtsZ is essential for the early stage, but dispensable for the late stage of cell wall constriction. However, it remains unclear how FtsZ spatial–temporally organizes the divisome for robust cell wall constriction during cytokinesis. Combining theoretical modeling with experiments in E. coli , we show that at the early stage during cell division, the Brownian ratcheting by FtsZ treadmilling acts both as a template to corral FtsWIQLB and FtsN into close contacts for FtsWIQLB-FtsN complex formation and as a conveyor to maximally homogenize the septal distribution of sPG synthesis activities to avoid uneven cell wall constriction. When the septum constricts progressively, the FtsN septal density increases via binding to denuded sPG (dnG) and serves as the template to activate FtsWIQLB for continued sPG synthesis, rendering FtsZ dispensable. Our work suggests an overarching framework for how FtsZ spatial–temporally regulates septal cell wall constriction, in which different bacteria species may operate in various parameter regimes to meet their distinct functional requirements.",

Myeloid-specific deletion of Setdb1 prolonged heart allograft survival but reversed immune exclusion in tumor tissues. Interestingly, myeloid-specific Setdb1-knockout led to lower fibrosis in heart allografts and tumor tissues in mice. Our single-cell sequencing data showed that Setdb1 ablation impaired Fn1 + and SPP1 + profibrogenic macrophage reprogramming. Mechanistically, Fn1, which was induced by the CCR2-Creb/Setdb1 axis, upregulated the expression of genes related to fibrosis in fibroblasts and macrophages via ITGA5 and PIRA receptors. Blocking the interaction between FN1 and these receptors inhibited fibrosis in allograft and tumor tissues.

This populational approach allowed us to distinguish parental legacy of inherited variation from postpolyploidy evolution, and our analyses revealed that whereas gene fractionation occurred in an early burst, accumulation of transposable elements (TEs) and homoeologous exchanges has been gradual. Patterns of homoeolog expression bias are highly variable across tissues, with no consistent subgenome expression bias. Our assessments of the impact of DNA methylation, TE distribution, and parental legacy on expression patterns provide some support for the TE load theory (the theory that the TE densities in flanking regions surrounding genes strongly influence expression levels), while also illustrating the complexity of transcription regulation.",

          "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease with no current cure. Drug discovery and repurposing are essential to enhance treatment efficacy and safety. We utilized summary statistics for protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) of 2,004 plasma and 1,443 brain proteins, a genome-wide association study of MS susceptibility with 14,802 cases and 26,703 controls, both bulk and cell-type specific transcriptome data, and external pQTL data in blood and brain. Our integrative analysis included a proteome-wide association study to identify MS-associated proteins, followed by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to determine potential causal associations. We used the HEIDI test and Bayesian colocalization analysis to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage. Proteins passing all analyses were prioritized as potential drug targets. We further conducted pathway annotations and protein–protein interaction network analysis (PPI) and verified our findings at mRNA and protein levels. We tested hundreds of MS-associated proteins and confirmed 18 potential causal proteins (nine in plasma and nine in brain). Among these, we found 78 annotated pathways and 16 existing non-MS drugs targeting six proteins. We also identified intricateAQ PPIs among seven potential drug targets and 19 existing MS drug targets, as well as PPIs of four targets across plasma and brain. We identified two targets using bulk mRNA expression data and four targets expressed in MS-related cell types. We finally verified 10 targets using external pQTL data. We prioritized 18 potential drug targets in plasma and brain, elucidating the underlying pathology and providing evidence for potential drug discovery and repurposing in MS.",

          "abstract": "For decades, the surface of the polar Southern Ocean (south of 50°S) has been freshening—an expected response to a warming climate. This freshening enhanced upper-ocean stratification, reducing the upward transport of subsurface heat and possibly contributing to sea ice expansion. It also limited the formation of open-ocean polynyas. Using satellite observations, we reveal a marked increase in surface salinity across the circumpolar Southern Ocean since 2015. This shift has weakened upper-ocean stratification, coinciding with a dramatic decline in Antarctic sea ice coverage. Additionally, rising salinity facilitated the reemergence of the Maud Rise polynya in the Weddell Sea, a phenomenon last observed in the mid-1970s. Crucially, we demonstrate that satellites can now monitor these changes in real time, providing essential evidence of the Southern Ocean’s potential transition toward persistently reduced sea ice coverage.",

          "abstract": "Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with over half the world’s population at risk. Infection with any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes is most often self-limiting, but a significant number of cases present with severe dengue characterized by vascular leakage that may be fatal. African ancestry is associated with protection against severe dengue, but the mechanisms are unknown. Using skin explants from genetically defined donors, we show that European ancestry skin has a much stronger inflammatory response to DENV than African ancestry skin, eliciting markedly increased infiltration, infection and migration of resident Langerhans cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The effect was seen with all dengue serotypes and Zika virus and in the presence of heterotypic immune serum. Genetic pathways associated with inflammation, interferon (IFN)-α, and inflammatory cytokine signaling were enriched in European relative to African ancestry skin following infection. Infiltration and infection of macrophages in African ancestry skin increased to that of European skin after blocking IFN-α and providing interleukin-1β. Polymorphic variants in RXRA , OAS1-3, and TGFB1 genes that were more frequent in European donors were associated with increased virus replication. Paradoxically, European ancestry skin cells had increased expression of OAS3 in response to virus and type I IFN. Thus, the limited inflammatory response of African ancestry skin to infection restricts replication and spread of dengue and other flaviviruses. Genetic ancestry should be considered when predicting a patient’s likelihood of severe dengue, and when assessing efficacy and adverse events associated with dengue vaccines.",

          "abstract": "Solar system gravitational interactions are embedded in Earth’s record of climate, providing a way to bypass the 60 Myr limit imposed by chaos. Presently with a 2.4 Myr period, the Mars–Earth beat cycle of orbital perihelion frequencies is particularly sensitive to chaotic diffusion, potentially varying by more than a million years. Early Mesozoic (252 to 145 Ma) strata provide some constraints on this cycle, with evidence of a swing through most of the solution space from 1.8 Myr at 210 Ma to 2.5 Myr at 190 Ma and back to 1.6 Myr at 180 Ma. However, only the 1.8 Myr cycle is corroborated by geochronologic data and the 1.6 Myr period is disputed. Here, we show that variations in land-plant-dominated stable carbon isotopic ratios (δ 13 C org ) from the lacustrine, paleo-high-latitude Sangonghe Formation (Junggar Basin, northwestern China), reveal at least three 1.6 Myr Mars–Earth beat cycles centered at 183 Ma, tracking atmospheric CO 2 isotopic composition in Earth’s exchangeable carbon reservoirs. Furthermore, the middle cycle includes the famous Jenkyns Event, expressed here by poleward migration of cheirolepidaceous conifers driven by CO 2 warming from the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province (LIP). Our data do not, however, support major, LIP-triggered input of isotopically light carbon and instead support CO 2 amplification of local processes via warming and ecosystem change. Although requiring additional independent geochronological support, Sangonghe data help provide empirical constraints for filtering orbital solutions, tightening initial conditions, and testing gravitational models, as well as showing how extrinsic cyclical processes interact with a tectonic event, the Karoo-Ferrar LIP.",

          "abstract": "Currently, catalytic recycling of polyethylene (PE) into high-value chemicals using solar energy often faces poor product selectivity and low efficiency. This is mainly due to the difficulty in effectively controlling the intermediates during PE photoreforming and the long-standing challenge of inefficient charge dynamics. Here, we present a solar-driven photothermal catalytic approach for the selective conversion of PE waste into propionic acid and hydrogen under ambient conditions. Atomically dispersed Ni sites supported on CeO 2 (Ni SA /CeO 2 ) achieve a propionic acid yield of 331 μmol h –1 with 94.8% selectivity in the photothermal reaction. This performance is 1.6 times higher than that of catalysts supported by Ni clusters (Ni NP /CeO 2 ). Additionally, Ni SA /CeO 2 exhibits a hydrogen yield of 0.23 mmol h –1 with stable long-term performance. Mechanistic studies reveal that single Ni atoms form linear coordination with oxygen atoms in CeO 2 , introducing unoccupied mid-gap states that effectively capture hot electrons and enhance the photothermal effect through local hotspot formation. In contrast, Ni clusters suffer from inefficient heat accumulation due to multistep phonon scattering. Furthermore, site isolation of Ni single atoms spatially separates the reaction intermediates and suppresses dimerization of the key intermediate COOHCH 2 CH 2 *, thereby greatly improving the selectivity for propionic acid. In contrast, closely packed Ni cluster sites promote intermediate coupling and the formation of undesirable byproducts, reducing selectivity. This work provides mechanistic insights into the advantages of atomic-scale catalyst design for selective chemical transformations.",

The Z ring is highly dynamic, and its constriction provides the essential force for chloroplast division. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing Z-ring dynamics and constriction remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the chloroplast inner envelope membrane (IEM) protein ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATION OF CHLOROPLASTS6 (ARC6) interacts with the chloroplast stromal protein ARC3, and this interaction is negatively regulated by the conserved J-like domain of ARC6. ARC3 is found both distributed throughout the stroma and localized to a ring-like structure at the chloroplast division site. We demonstrate that ARC6 recruits ARC3 to the division site to form a ring-like structure, likely through direct interaction. This ARC6–ARC3 interaction enables ARC3 to bind FtsZs. Furthermore, we show that the ARC6–ARC3 complex significantly promotes the dynamics of chloroplast Z rings reconstituted in a heterologous system. Finally, the constriction of these reconstituted Z rings is markedly enhanced by ARC6–ARC3. Our findings reveal a regulatory mechanism that governs Z-ring dynamics and constriction, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying chloroplast division.",

          "abstract": "The basal ganglia play a crucial role in action selection by facilitating desired movements and suppressing unwanted ones. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a key output nucleus, facilitates movement through disinhibition of the superior colliculus (SC). However, its role in action suppression, particularly in primates, remains less clear. We investigated whether individual SNr neurons in three male macaque monkeys bidirectionally modulate their activity to both facilitate and suppress actions and examined the role of glutamatergic inputs in suppression. Monkeys performed a sequential choice task, selecting or rejecting visually presented targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed that SNr neurons decreased firing rates during target selection and increased firing rates during rejection, demonstrating bidirectional modulation. Pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic inputs to the lateral SNr disrupted saccadic control and impaired suppression of reflexive saccades, providing causal evidence for the role of excitatory input in behavioral inhibition. These findings suggest that glutamatergic projections, potentially originating from sources including the subthalamic nucleus, contribute to the increased SNr activity during action suppression. Our results highlight conserved basal ganglia mechanisms across species and offer insights into the neural substrates of action selection and suppression in primates, with implications for understanding disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.",

          "abstract": "The NF1 tumor suppressor gene is recurrently mutated in human cancers and is associated with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) cancer predisposition syndrome. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a Ras guanosine triphosphate (GTPase) activating protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling. NF1 mutation accordingly leads to Ras misactivation and downstream activation of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, leading to the approval of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib for NF-1 associated peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors. However, how NF1 loss modifies response to selumetinib and the utility of targeting additional upstream inputs or downstream outputs of Ras these tumors remain unclear. Here, we perform RNA-sequencing, phosphoproteomic, pharmacologic, and proximal proteomic analysis across a panel of CRISPR interference immortalized peripheral nerve (iPN) cells to systematically dissect the function of neurofibromin loss. Small guide NF1 (sg NF1 ) repression is sufficient to increase Ras GTP levels and alter gene expression to promote cell proliferation and dedifferentiation, with sg NF1 iPNs showing decreased sensitivity to selumetinib due to altered feedback regulation to Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK. Upstream small guide PTPN11 (sg PTPN11 ) repression leads to the inverse gene expression signature, decreasing cell proliferation and promoting differentiation, and sg PTPN11 iPNs are more sensitive to selumetinib. However, upstream sonof sevenless 1 inhibition shows limited efficacy in iPNs due to compensation by SOS2. Finally, proximal proteomics reveals Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), but not Harvey rat sarcoma virus (HRAS) or neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), associates with neurofibromin in iPN cells, and pan-KRAS inhibition is sufficient to block ERK activation and CDK1/2 activation in NF1 mutant cells, suggesting blocking KRAS may be a therapeutic approach for NF1 mutant PNS tumors.",

          "abstract": "Anticancer chemotherapy is an essential part of cancer treatment, but the emergence of resistance remains a major hurdle. Metabolic reprogramming is a notable phenotype associated with the acquisition of drug resistance. Here, we develop a computational framework that predicts metabolic gene targets capable of reverting the metabolic state of drug-resistant cells to that of drug-sensitive parental cells, thereby sensitizing the resistant cells. The computational framework performs single-gene knockout simulation of genome-scale metabolic models that predicts genome-wide metabolic flux distribution in drug-resistant cells, and clusters the resulting knockout flux data using uniform manifold approximation and projection, followed by k -means clustering. From the clustering analysis, knockout genes that lead to the flux data near that of drug-sensitive cells are considered drug sensitization targets. This computational approach is demonstrated using doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells. Drug sensitization targets are further refined based on proteome and metabolome data, which generate GOT1 for doxorubicin-resistant MCF7, GPI for paclitaxel-resistant MCF7, and SLC1A5 as a common target. These targets are experimentally validated where treating drug-resistant cancer cells with small-molecule inhibitors results in increased sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to doxorubicin or paclitaxel. The applicability of the developed framework is further demonstrated using drug-resistant triple-negative breast cancer cells. Taken together, the computational framework predicts drug sensitization targets in an intuitive and cost-efficient manner and can be applied to overcome drug-resistant cells associated with various cancers and other metabolic diseases.",

Proteins of the Ena/VASP family and the WAVE regulatory complex orchestrate lamellar protrusions and therefore provide promising targets for pharmacological interventions. Here, we report a cross-talk between Ena/VASP proteins and WAVE2 that is important for cancer cell extravasation. Mutating the EVH1 domain recognition motif in WAVE2 abrogates chemotaxis of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and reduces their extravasation in a zebrafish model. In pilot experiments, orthotopic implantation of these cells into mice led to a reduction in macrometastasis, resulting in prolonged survival. Similarly, intervention by an Ena/VASP-EVH1 inhibitor also reduced metastasis in vivo. Our results suggest that pharmacological interference with the Ena/VASP–WAVE2 interaction may thus reduce metastasis.",

Moreover, the presence of ancient or contemporary gene flow between both species is largely untested. The Norwegian lemming displays characteristic phenotypic and behavioral adaptations (e.g., coat color, aggression) that are not present in other Lemmus species. We generated a de novo genome assembly for the Norwegian lemming and resequenced nine modern and two ancient Lemmus spp. genomes. We show that all Lemmus species form distinct monophyletic clades, with concordant topology between the mitochondrial and nuclear genome phylogenies. The Siberian lemming is divided into two distinct but paraphyletic clades, one in the east and one in the west, where the western clade represents a sister taxon to the Norwegian lemming. We estimate that the Norwegian and western Siberian lemming diverged shortly before the Last Glacial Maximum, making the Norwegian lemming one of the youngest known mammalian species. We did not find any indication of gene flow between L. lemmus and L. sibiricus , suggesting postglacial isolation of L. lemmus . Furthermore, we identify species-specific genomic differences in genes related to coat color and fat transport, which are likely associated with the distinctive coloration and overwintering behavior observed in the Norwegian lemming.",

Gain and loss of function experiments have indicated retinoic acid’s critical role in cochlear hair cell development. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we hypothesized that RA receptor alpha (RARA) has a dual role in cochlear organogenesis: First, during embryonic development, in the presence of RA, RARA functions as a transcriptional activator that induces prosensory gene expression in progenitor cells and supports differentiation of the organ of Corti; later during postnatal development, when RA is absent, the function of RARA switches, thereby repressing prosensory genes in postnatal hair cells and hindering trans-differentiation into supporting cells. This hypothesis was supported by demonstration that RARA forms a complex with either the coactivator NCOA1 or the corepressor NCOR1 depending on the developmental stage. In addition, modulation of RA levels was found to govern recruitment of the coactivator and corepressor to the RARA complex, and the expression of prosensory genes was validated to depend on RARA complex composition. Together, our results provide insights supporting the potential of harnessing RA signaling to induce prosensory progenitors in stem cell–based strategies for hearing loss.",

We developed Protein Fold Evolution Simulator (PFES), a computational approach that simulates evolution of globular folds from random amino acid sequences with atomistic details. PFES introduces random mutations in a population of protein sequences, evaluates the effect of mutations on protein structure, and selects a new set of proteins for further evolution. Iteration of this process allows tracking the evolutionary trajectory of a changing protein fold that evolves under selective pressure for protein fold stability, interaction with other proteins, or other features shaping the fitness landscape. We employed PFES to show how stable, globular protein folds could evolve from random amino acid sequences as monomers or in complexes with other proteins. The simulations reproduce the evolution of many simple folds of natural proteins as well as emergence of distinct folds not known to exist in nature. We show that evolution of small globular protein folds from random sequences, on average, takes 1.15 to 3 amino acid replacements per site, depending on the population size, with some simulations yielding stable folds after as few as 0.2 replacements per site. These values are lower than the characteristic numbers of replacements in conserved proteins during the time since the Last Universal Common Ancestor, suggesting that simple protein folds can evolve from random sequences relatively easily and quickly. PFES tracks the complete evolutionary history from simulations and can be used to test hypotheses on protein fold evolution.",

Given the requirements for Mo-catalyzed thermally driven N 2 R, this result suggested the generation of a significant driving force for proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) when irradiating HEH 2 in the presence of Col-buffer. In this study, we probe how Col-buffer enables efficient photodriven proton-coupled reductions with HEH 2 . Wavelength-dependent NH 3 yields are consistent with HEH 2 photoexcitation, and the combination of HEH 2 with Col-buffer is privileged. Data are presented, suggesting that HEH 2 is statically quenched via ET to [ColH]OTf through an H-bonded association complex to release ColH • and [HEH 2 ] •+ . Transient absorbance data and EPR studies establish that the resulting [HEH 2 ] •+ intermediate is rapidly deprotonated by Col to yield HEH • , in net furnishing HEH • and ColH • as potent H-atom donors. Broader utility of this reagent combination is demonstrated in the photoreduction of a range of C=O and N=O π-bonds by HEH 2 , with a significant boost in rates and yield, and altered reactivity, observed on addition of Col-buffer. ColH • is posited as the most potent PCET donor generated (BDFE N−H of 28 kcal mol −1 ).",

          "abstract": "The action-mode network (AMN) is a canonical functional brain network first identified using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Based on animal and human data, we have proposed that AMN supports the brain’s action mode by controlling functions required for successful goal-directed behavior. However, task fMRI averaged across groups has associated AMN regions with a variety of behaviors, contributing to uncertainty about AMN function. Here, we investigated the AMN using an inside-out approach, in which the network architecture of the AMN is first precisely mapped within individuals and then associated with behavioral functions. Individual-specific precision functional mapping with &gt;5 h of RSFC and task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed a replicable AMN subnetwork structure. AMN subnetworks were characterized and annotated by combining a meta-analytic network association method with RSFC, intrinsic timing, and task activation profiling. We demonstrate the existence of AMN-Decision, -Action, and -Feedback subnetworks that are distributed across lobes, forming a temporally sequential within-network processing stream by which the brain adjudicates between possible goals, sets action plans, and modifies those plans in response to feedback such as pain. A subnetwork in the pars marginalis of the cingulate was distinct from the Decision, Action, and Feedback subnetworks and may be important for the construction of the bodily self.",

          "abstract": "Perception is fallible. Humans know this, and so do some nonhuman animals like macaque monkeys. When monkeys report more confidence in a perceptual decision, that decision is more likely to be correct. It is not known how neural circuits in the primate brain assess the quality of perceptual decisions. Here, we test two hypotheses. First, that decision confidence is related to the structure of population activity in the sensory cortex. And second, that this relation differs from the one between sensory activity and decision content. We trained macaque monkeys to judge the orientation of ambiguous stimuli and additionally report their confidence in these judgments. We recorded population activity in the primary visual cortex and used decoders to expose the relationship between this activity and the choice-confidence reports. Our analysis validated both hypotheses and suggests that perceptual decisions arise from a neural computation downstream of visual cortex that estimates the most likely interpretation of a sensory response, while decision confidence instead reflects a computation that evaluates whether this sensory response will produce a reliable decision. Our work establishes a direct link between neural population activity in the sensory cortex and the metacognitive ability to introspect about the quality of perceptual decisions.",

          "abstract": "Chronic pain arises from maladaptive changes in both peripheral and central nervous systems, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key region implicated in descending pain modulation. Chronic pain increases the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the ACC. Although a reduction in inhibitory inputs onto pyramidal neurons has been observed in neuropathic conditions, the identity of the specific interneurons responsible remains unclear. We show that chronic pain selectively impairs parvalbumin (PV), but not somatostatin, interneurons in the rostral ACC. This is characterized by a decrease in the density of PV interneuron processes, a reduction in their surrounding perineuronal net, and a lower expression of PV. Functionally, PV interneurons display diminished inhibitory efficacy in vitro and reduced phasic activation in response to aversive stimuli in vivo. Dopamine (DA) fibers preferentially contact PV interneurons and excite them via D1 dopamine receptor activation, increasing their excitability and enhancing the frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents on pyramidal neurons in healthy, but not neuropathic, conditions. Furthermore, we show that this pathway is involved in hunger-induced analgesia: Food deprivation increases DA release in the ACC and consequently decreases pain thresholds in neuropathic mice. Conversely, when mice are not food deprived, neuropathic pain significantly reduces DA release in the ACC. We conclude that the loss of PV interneuron inhibitory efficacy, alongside convergent hypodopaminergic signaling, synergistically contributes to pathological ACC dysfunction and associated symptoms of chronic pain.",

In early Çatalhöyük, burials in the same building were frequently close genetic relatives, suggesting that houses were used by biological family members. In later periods, however, individuals buried in the same building were often genetically unrelated, despite sharing similar diets. We found no indication of sex-biased mobility into Çatalhöyük. Meanwhile, in all periods, within-building genetic connections were predominantly maternal rather than paternal. Burials of female subadults also received a higher frequency of gifts than male subadults. Our results reveal how kinship practices changed while specific practices prioritizing female lines persisted for 1000 years at Neolithic Çatalhöyük.",

We provide a comprehensive evolutionary history of squids through “digital fossil-mining” techniques, revealing a new lagerstätte. The more than 250 fossil beaks of 40 species show that squids originated and rapidly radiated by 100 million years ago. Our data suggest that the radical shift from heavily shelled, slowly moving cephalopods to soft-bodied forms did not result from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction (66 million years ago). Early squids had already formed large populations, and their biomass exceeded that of ammonites and fishes. They pioneered the modern-type marine ecosystem as intelligent, fast swimmers.",

The neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. In this work, we simultaneously recorded hundreds to thousands of neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex of freely behaving rats. Neural population activity drifted continuously along a one-dimensional manifold during all behaviors and behavioral states, including sleep, which points to an intrinsic origin of the drift. In awake animals, boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in population dynamics, which segmented the neural activity into temporal units. During tasks with recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the drift, encoding event information across multiple timescales. The results identify a hierarchical coding scheme for organizing events in time.",

          "abstract": "Many questions remain regarding Earth’s earliest crust owing to the rarity of Hadean (&gt;4.03 billion-year-old) rocks and minerals. The Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt (NGB) in Canada may be the only known remnant of Hadean crust, although its age is debated, ranging from ≥3.75 to 4.3 billion years old. Mafic intrusions within this belt were specifically sampled and analyzed to investigate the timing of their magmatic differentiation. Correlations between samarium/neodymium (Sm/Nd) and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 142 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios correspond to ages of 4157 ± 174 and 4196 − 81 + 53 million years for the long-lived 147 Sm- 143 Nd and the short-lived 146 Sm- 142 Nd systems, respectively. The age agreement between both extant and extinct radiogenic systems, in rocks related through igneous fractionation, is compelling evidence for preservation of Hadean rocks in the NGB, opening a rare window into Earth’s earliest times.",

Its formation from ammonia and carbon dioxide requires either high pressures and temperatures or, under milder conditions, catalysts or additional reagents. In this study, we observed the spontaneous formation of urea under ambient conditions from ammonia and carbon dioxide in the surface layer of aqueous droplets. Single, optically trapped droplets were probed by using Raman bands as markers. We found the surface layer to act like a microscopic flow reactor, with chemical gradients providing access to unconventional reaction pathways. This observation revealed a general mechanistic scheme for distinctive droplet chemistry. Interfacial chemistry is a possible nonenergetic route for urea formation under prebiotic conditions.",

We structurally characterized the tetragon, pentagon, hexagon, and heptagon, which comprise 16, 20, 24, and 28 BAX protomers, respectively. Missense mutations at the BAX inter-protomer interface damage pore formation and cripple its proapoptotic function.

In this work, we analyze formation pore pressure records from three offshore borehole observatories at the Nankai subduction zone, Honshu, Japan, to capture detailed slip-time histories of two slow slip events (SSEs) along the outermost reaches of the plate boundary. Slip initiates ~30 kilometers landward of the trench; migrates seaward at 1 to 2 kilometers per day to within a few kilometers of, and possibly breaching, the trench; and coincides with the onset and migration of tremor and/or very-low-frequency earthquakes. The SSE source region lies in a zone of high pore fluid pressure and low stress, which provides clear observational evidence linking these factors to shallow slow earthquakes.",

Currently, the sulfur analogs are almost exclusively prepared by de novo synthesis; the existing approach to swap carbon with sulfur is inefficient and involves stoichiometric mercury reagents. In this study, we report a two-step carbonyl-to-sulfur (CO-to-S) atom swap approach, enabled by a rationally designed N ′-alkyl-hydrazonamide (NAHA) reagent that promotes forming pre-aromatic intermediates twice sequentially by different mechanisms, thereby achieving homolytic cleavage of both α-C−C bonds of the ketone substrates. A Ts−S−Ts (Ts, p -toluenesulfonyl) reagent mediates this process through successive intermolecular and intramolecular alkyl radical trapping by the central sulfur. This method shows a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity, providing a streamlined route to sulfur-containing scaffolds from readily available ketones.",

          "abstract": "Human language is unique among communication systems since many elements are learned and transmitted across generations. Previous research suggests that this process is best predicted by infant-directed communication, i.e., a mode of communication directed by caregivers to children. Despite its importance for language, whether infant-directed communication is unique to humans or rooted more deeply in the primate lineage remains unclear. To assess this, we investigated directed and surrounding vocal communication in human infants and infants of wild nonhuman great apes. Our findings reveal that human infants receive dramatically more infant-directed communication than nonhuman great ape infants. These data suggest that the earliest hominins likely relied more on surrounding communication to become communicatively competent, while infant-directed vocal communication became considerably more prominent with human language.",

We developed an experimental and computational approach to track infants’ adaptive learning processes via pupil size, an indicator of tonic and phasic noradrenergic activity. We found that 8-month-old infants’ tonic pupil size mirrored trial-by-trial fluctuations in environmental volatility, while phasic pupil responses revealed that infants used this information to dynamically optimize their learning. This adaptive strategy resulted in successful task performance, as evidenced by anticipatory looking toward correct target locations. The ability to estimate volatility varied significantly across infants, and these individual differences were related to infant temperament, indicating early links between cognitive adaptation and emotional responsivity. These findings demonstrate that infants actively adapt to environmental change, and that early differences in this capacity may have profound implications for long-term cognitive and psychosocial development.",

Through multiple methodologies, including phytolith analysis, micro–computed tomography scanning, and thin-section petrography, this recent research confirms the presence of abundant rice husk and leaf phytoliths adhering to red-slipped pottery (“Marianas Red”) at the Ritidian Site Complex in Guam, dated by radiocarbon to 3500 to 3100 years ago. This study addresses the long-standing question of whether the first Pacific Islanders transported rice with them from the Philippines across 2300 kilometers of open sea, representing the longest known ocean voyage of the time. During this early period, rice was restricted to special ritual events in the Marianas. The early voyage apparently was planned with provisions of rice at 3500 years ago.",

          "abstract": "Conventional drug delivery methods for chronic disease often suffer from low potency and poor patient compliance, while current advanced devices face limitations because of bulkiness, frequent implantation needs, inflammation risk, and lack of precise control. To overcome these challenges, we developed the SUSTAIN—a smart, ultra-long-lasting, sequentially triggerable, and artfully implantable nozzle system. The SUSTAIN integrates an osmotic pressure–triggered module, an airflow-generated T-pipe (AGT), and a drug infusion pump (DIP) for controlled subcutaneous drug release. The AGT enables tunable dosing by varying NaHCO 3 /KH 2 PO 4 powder amounts, while shear thinning of the β-cyclodextrin/Pluronic F-127 hydrogel in the DIP ensures sustained drug infusion. In vivo studies show that the SUSTAIN delivers at least four doses of levothyroxine sodium over 10 days and three doses of semaglutide over 42 days, maintaining effective blood drug levels with minimal invasiveness. This system presents a highly promising solution for improving therapeutic outcomes and convenience in chronic disease management.",

Reducing hERG binding to obviate potential cardiac toxicity is crucial. Nanotechnology has been applied to drug delivery for reducing drug toxicity and improving efficacy, but few studies have addressed hERG-related cardiotoxicity. We report the use of self-assembling dendrimer nanosystems for drug formulation and delivery, which effectively reduced hERG binding and associated toxicity while promoting therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, these dendrimer nanosystems efficiently encapsulated the antimalarial drug chloroquine, the anticancer agent doxorubicin, and the NUPR1 inhibitor ZZW115, all three having high affinity to hERG channels. These nanoformulations showed three- to eightfold reduced hERG binding affinity, which, in animal models, translated to abolished toxicity. These nanodrugs exhibited prolonged circulation, leading to enhanced accumulation at disease sites and improved treatment outcomes. This study highlights the potential of nanotechnology to reduce hERG binding and related toxicity while improving drug efficacy, offering valuable perspectives for drug development.",

However, this long-standing view has not been rigorously evaluated as hematopoietic sites remain poorly understood in most invertebrate groups. We report, to our knowledge, the first discovery of abundant HSCs in adult mollusk shells, an invertebrate hematopoietic niche resembling vertebrate bone marrow (BM). Cell-lineage analysis and functional assays reveal the developmental origin of HSCs during larval shell formation and their participation in hemocyte-mediated shell regeneration and soft-body blood supply. Widespread skeleton-related HSC-like cells are found in diverse invertebrate groups and bony fish group, suggesting skeletons as a universal niche for animal HSCs and HSC-skeleton association preceding vertebrate water-to-land transition. Comparison of invertebrate and vertebrate skeletal HSCs enables the macroevolutionary profiling of a core-set of animal HSC regulators. Our findings would boost fundamental paradigm shifts for hematopoiesis and stem cell research in invertebrates and provide the redefined understanding of vertebrate BM evolution and water-to-land transition.",

Inspired by cryptobiosis in nature, researchers have pioneered approaches to create cell-in-shell nanobiohybrids, aiming to endow cells with enhanced protection and exogenous functions. Yet, these methods still lack the biological autonomy intrinsic to natural cellular responses. Here, we present an innovative chemo-metabolically coupled strategy for the autonomous construction of cell-in-shell structures in cell growth medium. Our system harnesses ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae , chemically coupled with an enzymatic cascade involving alcohol oxidase and horseradish peroxidase, to drive the nanoshell formation of polydopamine. The integration of autonomous shell formation with cellular proliferation produces anisotropic cell-in-shell structures, which can serve as enzyme-powered cell microrobots, upon conjugation with urease. Our autonomous system enables the creation of cell-in-shell nanobiohybrids with dynamic and adaptive environmental interactions, paving the way for transformative applications in synthetic biology, such as artificial cells, as well as advancements in cell-based therapies.",

Here, we observed that the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1 was moderately elevated in human hypertrophic myocardium and mouse models. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of YOD1 reduced Ang II– and TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Subsequently, we used multiple proteomic analyses to identify and confirm STAT3 as a substrate protein for YOD1. Mechanistically, our findings revealed that the C155 site of YOD1 removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from K97 on STAT3, stabilizing STAT3 levels and enhancing its nuclear translocation in cardiomyocytes under Ang II stimulation. Notably, inhibiting STAT3 reversed the antihypertrophic effects of YOD1 deficiency in Ang II–challenged mice. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of YOD1 mitigated Ang II–induced pathological ventricular remodeling in mice. This study clarifies the role of YOD1 and introduces a previously unidentified YOD1-STAT3 axis in regulating pathological cardiac hypertrophy, providing valuable insights for drug development targeting this condition.",

In human CD4-receptor knock-in mice, 64 Cu-CD4-Nb1 specifically accumulated in different orthotopic tumors, correlating with histological CD4 + cell densities. Based on intratumoral CD4 + cell distribution patterns within the core and periphery, we distinguished responders to combined αPD-1/4-1BB antibodies early on-treatment. CD4-PET identified resistance to αPD-1 monotherapy, which was mitigated by adding regulatory T cell–depleting α4-1BB antibodies. Patients with early-stage non–small cell lung cancer who relapsed after neoadjuvant αPD-L1 therapy revealed low CD4 + T cell densities in the tumor core. In human and mouse tumor tissues, regulatory T cells correlated with CD4 + cell densities.

Based on these findings, we further engineered a mucolipin TRP channel 1 (MTC1)–related therapeutic nanoplatform for endogenously triggering lysosomal zinc release to curb inflammation and block macrophage pyroptosis. This nanoplatform consists of mesoporous silica nanoparticles to deliver MTC1 agonists and carbon nanodots, which could synergistically exert antiatherosclerotic effect by scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species, inhibiting macrophage pyroptosis, modulating macrophage transition, and rebuilding atherosclerotic immune microenvironment.

The Divalia Fossae, surface troughs comparable in size to the Grand Canyon, encircle two-thirds of the equator. Two giant impacts reshaped the southern hemisphere, where an older basin is partially superposed by the younger Rheasilvia basin. The origin of the Divalia Fossae is widely accepted as directly linked to the Rheasilvia impact, either by tectonics caused immediately by the impact, up-spinning, or secondary cratering. We present several geologic constraints that support a tectonic origin of the troughs due to the adjustment of Vesta’s spin axis to a geoid changed by both large impacts. The best fit to Vesta’s gravitational field corresponds to a spin axis reorientation of 3° that, when coupled with despinning, induces a stress state that predicts Divalia Fossae’s established location, fracture type, and orientation. These insights underline the importance of tectonic processes in the early evolution of protoplanets.",

Some of these populations have made remarkable recoveries and are now approaching pre-exploitation levels of abundance. Contrary to expectations of baleen whales making minor oscillations around equilibrium abundances, several populations that have made the strongest recoveries have experienced major mortality events. We review examples from the literature showing increasing demographic variability in recovering populations of baleen whales and present a simulation study on the expected response of recovered versus depleted whale population to environmental variability and climate impacts. We propose that baleen whales are more sensitive to environmental variability than previously recognized; that major demographic fluctuations will become the norm as baleen whales recover; and that climate-driven disruptions to whale population dynamics will be most dramatic in populations with the lowest rates of anthropogenic mortality.",

We hypothesize that induction of PKS activity facilitates mixotrophic behavior during nutrient-depleted bloom conditions. To identify potential in situ stimuli for growth, toxigenicity, and bloom persistence, we compared environmental factors and biological processes identified by metaomics to Chrysochromulina leadbeateri HABs between two fjords in northern Norway. We identified the polyketide ichthyotoxin leadbeaterin-1 from the C. leadbeateri bloom and found potentially associated candidate PKS genes of which most were higher expressed at bloom stations. A relative depletion of inorganic nitrogen and phosphate during the bloom was correlated with higher expression of genes involved in endocytosis, autophagy, and lysosomal activity. Mixotrophy is evidently a compensatory nutritional strategy coupled to induction of toxigenesis and other metabolomic processes as biotic factors linked to Chrysochromulina bloom dynamics.",

Light field–driven currents were demonstrated in various media including dielectrics, semiconductors, and topological insulators. Now, our research question is whether we can drive and control orders of magnitude more charge carriers in metals enabling ultrafast switching with practically low-energy, picojoule-level pulses. Here, we demonstrate the interaction of light with nanometer-thick metallic layers, which leads to a generation of light field–controlled electric currents. We show that the implantation of metallic layers into a dielectric matrix leads to up to 40 times increase of the sensitivity in contrast to a bare dielectric, decreasing the intensity threshold for lightwave electronics.",

We find that the firing rates of the somatostatin (SOM) interneurons align closely with the level of network synchrony irrespective of the target of modulatory input. Further analysis reveals that inhibition from SOM to parvalbumin interneurons must be limited to allow gradual transitions from asynchrony to synchrony and that the strength of recurrent excitation onto SOM neurons determines the level of synchrony achievable in the network. Our results are consistent with recent experimental findings on cell type–specific manipulations. Overall, our results highlight common dynamic regimes achieved across modulations of different cell populations and identify SOM cells as the main driver of network synchrony.",

Here, we show that, in the absence of AOM, microbial methane produced from deep-sea sediments exhibits isotopolog compositions approaching thermodynamic equilibrium due to energy limitation. In contrast, microbial methane from salt marsh and thermokarst lakes exhibits significant hydrogen and clumped isotopic disequilibrium due to high free-energy availability. We propose that clumped isotopologs of methane provide a proxy for characterizing the bioenergetics of environments for methane production.

Depletion of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the highest expressed PM-ER tether protein, interfered with mechanotransduction from the PM to the ER, and affected the ER tension. We found that an optimized mechanical strain increased ER tension in a homeostatic manner, but excessive strain resulted in ER expansion, as well as activating ER stress.

          "abstract": "Archeological evidence indicates that full-scale expansion of Homo sapiens across the oceans began about 50,000 years ago in the Western Pacific, yet how this was achieved remains unclear. The Ryukyu Islands in southwestern Japan, where archaeological sites suddenly appeared 35,000 to 30,000 years ago, are of particular interest in this regard because of the apparent difficulty in crossing the surrounding waters. In this study, we test if a non-sailing dugout canoe can be produced with Upper Paleolithic tools, and if it can cross the 110-kilometer-wide strait at the western entrance of the Ryukyus, where one of the world’s strongest ocean currents intervenes. Our 7.5-meter-long dugout, manufactured with edge-ground stone axes, was speedy and durable enough to cross this strait. This supports the early development of functional boats, such as dugouts, while our experiment also highlighted that this type of sea travel was possible only for experienced paddlers with advanced navigational skills.",

          "abstract": "Robot collectives offer a promising solution for complex assignments that are nearly impossible for individual robots to execute. In microscopic scenarios, organizing microrobot collectives is now governed by agent-agent physical interactions. However, the existing methods are insufficient to produce robust connections and fail to tolerate harsh environments. We propose a strategy to efficiently program microrobots into reconfigurable robust collectives to operate in various dynamic environments. Magnetic collectives are produced to achieve reconfigurable pattern transformation with considerable structural enhancement via well-designed gradient magnetic fields. The strong gradient magnetic field–induced connections among individual microrobots enable a record-breaking 700-fold output force enhancement, and 0.2-gram microrobot collectives generate Newton-level output forces. The proposed reconfigurable microrobot collectives provide a stable and promising approach to executing droplet, fluid, and solid manipulations via powerful output forces. These results may have implications for further understanding of self-assembly, particle systems, microrobot collectives, smart dust, and related microscopic multiagent behaviors.",

          "abstract": "The spontaneous emergence of tissue patterns is often attributed to biochemical reaction-diffusion systems. In Hydra tissue regeneration, the formation of a Wnt signaling center exemplifies this process. However, a strictly biochemical mechanism for self-organization in Hydra remains elusive. In this study, we investigated mechanical stimuli and identified a positive feedback loop between Wnt signaling and tissue stretching. We developed a mathematical model of mechanochemical pattern formation in a closed elastic shell, representing regenerating Hydra epithelial spheroids. Our model explains how mechanical forces drive axis formation and predict the organizer’s location under various perturbations. Validation by partially confining regenerating tissues showed that the organizer forms in regions with the greatest stretching potential. This work highlights a versatile mechanochemical mechanism for luminal epithelium patterning, which is relevant across various biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Overfishing is one human-driven perturbation driving major evolutionary pressure on marine populations. Fishing is often highly selective for particular traits and elicits marked phenotypic changes, while the evolutionary basis of such trait change remains unresolved. Here, we used a unique time series of the overexploited Eastern Baltic cod ( Gadus morhua ) to investigate growth trends during 25 years of heavy fishing along with hypothesized genetic changes at the full genome level. A growth analysis demonstrated a 48% decrease in asymptotic body length from 1996 to 2019 while a genome-wide association analysis revealed outlier loci and gene candidates linked to growth performance. The contributing loci showed signals of directional selection with high autocovariance of allele frequency change and significant overlap with regions of high genetic differentiation. Our findings suggest a genomic basis of fisheries-driven growth impairment and underscore implications for conservation policy regarding the adaptive potential of marine populations.",

Here, we demonstrate the emergence of a Higgs echo in niobium superconductors. This approach disentangles unique quantum pathways involving the Higgs mode and QP excitations. Using Higgs echo spectroscopy, we also uncover unconventional echo formation caused by inhomogeneous broadening and “soft” QP bands, which dynamically evolve under terahertz (THz) driving. Specifically, THz pulse pairs modulate the superconducting gap, imprinting coherence and forming a temporal “Higgs grating.” This grating produces echoes with distinctive characteristics: (i) echo rephasing spectral peaks at superconducting gap frequencies, (ii) asymmetric echo formation delays unlike those observed in atoms or semiconductors, and (iii) negative-time echo signals stemming from Higgs-QP anharmonic interactions. Combined with advanced time-frequency analysis, these findings distinguish Higgs from QP responses and clarify their intricate interactions in THz-driven superconductivity.",

          "abstract": "Endothermy has independently evolved in several vertebrate lineages but remains rare among fishes. Using an integrated approach combining phylogenomic and ecomorphological data for 1051 ray-finned fishes, a time-dependent evolutionary model, and comparative genomic analyses of 205 marine vertebrates, we show that ecological interactions with modern cetaceans coincided with the evolution of endothermy in ray-finned fishes during the Eocene-Miocene. This result is supported by evidence of temporal and geographical overlap between cetaceans and endothermic fish lineages in the fossil record, as well as correlations between cetacean diversification and the origin of endothermy in fishes. Phylogenetic comparative analyses identified correlations between endothermy, large body sizes, and specialized swimming modes while challenging diet specialization and depth range expansion hypotheses. Comparative genomic analyses identified several genes under selection in endothermic lineages, including carnmt1 (involved in fatty acid metabolism) and dcaf6 (associated with development). Our findings advance the understanding of how ecological interactions and genomic factors shape key adaptations.",

          "abstract": "In every menstrual cycle, progesterone acting on estrogen-primed endometrium elicits an inflammatory decidual reaction, rendering it poised for embryo implantation and transformation into the decidua of pregnancy. Here, we show that the sequential functions of the decidual reaction—implantation and decidualization—pivot on the time-sensitive loss of progesterone-resistant DIO2 + stromal cells that form a specialized implantation niche and reciprocal expansion of progesterone-dependent PLA2G2A + predecidual cells. Simultaneously, uterine natural killer (uNK) cell proliferation results in the accumulation of immunotolerant subsets. Examination of endometrial biopsies from 924 women revealed that the recurrence risk of miscarriage closely aligns with the incidence of a weakened or stalled decidual reaction, more so than poor uNK cell expansion. Analysis of paired biopsies obtained in different cycles and modeling in assembloids intimated that prior miscarriages disrupt intercycle endometrial homeostasis and calibration of the decidual reaction. Our findings show that erosion of the decidual reaction following a miscarriage drives the recurrence risk irrespective of maternal age.",

          "abstract": "Sea level change is an important forcing on lowland fluvial systems. Although its impact is suggested to extend up to hundreds of kilometers inland, this impact is often considered confined to deltaic regions. We present luminescence dating of cores from the Jianghan Plain in the middle Yangtze River that demonstrates the influence of the last glacially driven sea level fall extended over 1000-kilometers inland. Luminescence ages reveal a common sedimentary hiatus from ~26 to ~17 thousand years ago (ka), reflecting fluvial incision of &gt;35 meters triggered by sea level fall. Subsequent rapid aggradation occurred within these incised valleys during deglaciation between ~17 and ~9 ka and then slowed down afterward. A further synthesis on global continental rivers shows that sea level change affects large, low-gradient lowland fluvial systems farther upstream than generally recognized, with postperturbation geomorphologic equilibrium reachable in timescales comparable to the length of Quaternary glacial cycles.",

Here, we present a combination of minimally invasive recording and disruption studies to show that DRN brings about changes in motivation states. We use recently developed methods for identifying temporal patterns in behavior to show that monkeys change their motivation depending on the availability of rewards in the environment. Distinctive patterns of DRN activity occur when monkeys transition between a high-motivation state occupied when rewards are abundant, to a low-motivation state engendered by reward scarcity. Disrupting DRN diminishes sensitivity to the reward environment and perturbs transitions in motivational states.",

However, it is unclear what dynamical regimes pedestrian crowds can exhibit at different crowd densities, how pedestrians move in these different dynamical regimes, and in which dynamical regime the movement synchronization of pedestrians is most likely to occur. Here, we conducted a unidirectional crowd movement experiment, in which we tracked the movement of pedestrian crowds through foot tracking. We find experimentally that pedestrian crowds can exhibit three distinct dynamical regimes (free regime, slow-moving regime, and jammed regime) depending on the crowd density. In the free regime, pedestrians’ movement is not constrained; in the slow-moving regime, pedestrians’ speed is constrained, but pedestrians’ movement direction in each step is not influenced; and in the jammed regime, both pedestrians’ speed and movement direction in each step are constrained. We also demonstrate that pedestrians are most likely to synchronize their movements spontaneously at the onset of jamming. Our findings provide important insights into crowd dynamics.",

While some cranial nerves allow for CSF efflux, the immune environment around CSF-interfacing cranial nerves during neuroinflammation is still poorly understood. Using a mouse model of multiple sclerosis [experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)] and CNS Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (CNS-Mtb), we examined immune responses around olfactory nerve bundles near the cribriform plate, a key CSF efflux route. During neuroinflammation, we found increased perineural immune cells that had access to intracranial injected beads, dye, and bacteria. Additionally, we identified osseous channels connecting the environment surrounding olfactory nerves to bone marrow in the cribriform plate (cpBM). Notably, the cpBM undergoes myelopoiesis during EAE, has access to components of intracranial drainage, and is vulnerable to Mtb bacteria invasion during CNS-Mtb infection. Our findings improve the understanding of how the environments of CSF-interfacing cranial nerves and bone marrow are altered within the skull during neuroinflammatory disease.",
