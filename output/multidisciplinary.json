          "abstract": "Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their ultra-high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1-3. However, the mechanical stress generated during repeated environmental stress cycles remains a critical challenge for flexible perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, leading to interfacial delamination and device degradation. In this work, we propose a dual-buffer-layer strategy with a stress-release mechanism to synergistically mitigate ion bombardment during subsequent sputtering deposition and enhance interfacial adhesion while preserving efficient charge extraction. The loose SnOx buffer layer, engineered by adjusting the purging time of atomic layer deposition, can dissipate strain energy, whereas the compact SnOx layer can ensure robust electrical contact. Based on this dual-buffer-layer, the flexible tandem solar cell, constructed on a 60-micron thick ultra-thin silicon bottom cell, achieves a certified PCE of 33.4% on 1-cm2 area, and an certified PCE of 29.8% on wafer-sized area of 260-cm2 with a power-per-weight of up to 1.77 W/g. The modified tandem solar cells demonstrate good durability, retaining over 97% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after 43000 bending cycles under a maximum curvature radius of around 40 mm in air, and around 97% after thermal cycling testing (−40 °C to 85 °C) for 250 cycles.",

          "abstract": "In human neuroimaging, brain atlases are essential for segmenting regions of interest (ROIs) and comparing subjects in a common coordinate frame. State-of-the-art atlases derived from histology1,2,3 provide exquisite three-dimensional cytoarchitectural maps but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain: that is, the likelihood of each location belonging to a given ROI. Here we present NextBrain, a probabilistic histological atlas of the whole human brain. We developed artificial intelligence-enabled methods to align roughly 10,000 histological sections from five whole brain hemispheres into three-dimensional volumes and to produce delineations for 333 ROIs on these sections. We also created a companion Bayesian tool for automatic segmentation of these ROIs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We showcase two applications of the atlas: segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of Alzheimer’s disease using in vivo MRI. We publicly release raw and aligned data, an online visualization tool, the atlas, the segmentation tool, and ground truth delineations for a high-resolution ex vivo hemisphere used in validation. By enabling researchers worldwide to automatically analyse brain MRIs at a higher level of granularity, NextBrain holds promise to increase the specificity of findings and accelerate our quest to understand the human brain in health and disease.",

          "abstract": "The nuclear export of messenger RNA (mRNA) is an important step in eukaryotic gene expression1. Despite recent molecular insights into how newly transcribed mRNAs are packaged into ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs)2,3, the subsequent events that govern mRNA export are poorly understood. Here, we uncover the molecular basis underlying key events of human mRNA export, including the remodeling of mRNP-bound transcription-export complexes (TREX), the formation of export-competent mRNPs, the docking of mRNPs at the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and the release of mRNPs at the NPC to initiate their export. Our biochemical and structural data show that the ATPase DDX39/UAP56 acts as a central molecular switch that directs nucleoplasmic mRNPs from TREX to NPC-anchored TREX-2 complexes through its ATP-gated mRNA-binding cycle. Collectively, these findings establish a mechanistic framework for a general and evolutionarily conserved mRNA export pathway.",

          "abstract": "Materials improvement is a powerful approach to reducing loss and decoherence in superconducting qubits, because such improvements can be readily translated to large-scale processors. Recent work improved transmon coherence by using tantalum as a base layer and sapphire as a substrate1. The losses in these devices are dominated by two-level systems with comparable contributions from both the surface and bulk dielectrics2, indicating that both must be tackled to achieve substantial improvements in the state of the art. Here we show that replacing the substrate with high-resistivity silicon markedly decreases the bulk substrate loss, enabling 2D transmons with time-averaged quality factors (Qavg) of 9.7 × 106 across 45 qubits. For our best qubit, we achieve a Qavg of 1.5 × 107, reaching a maximum Q of 2.5 × 107, corresponding to a lifetime (T1) up to 1.68 ms. This low loss also allows us to observe decoherence effects related to the Josephson junction, and we use an improved, low-contamination junction deposition to achieve Hahn echo coherence times (T2E) exceeding T1. We achieve these materials improvements without any modifications to the qubit architecture, allowing us to readily incorporate standard quantum control gates. We demonstrate single-qubit gates with 99.994% fidelity. The tantalum-on-silicon platform comprises a simple material stack that can potentially be fabricated at the wafer scale and therefore can be readily translated to large-scale quantum processors.",

          "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders that cause cognitive, behavioural or motor impairments affect around 15% of children and adolescents worldwide1, with diagnoses of profound autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder increasing in the USA and contributing to a major economic burden2,3. Yet the origins and mechanisms of these conditions remain poorly understood, limiting progress in therapies. Comprehensive cell atlases of the developing human brain, alongside those of model organisms such as mice and non-human primates, are now providing high-resolution measures of gene expression, cell-type abundance and spatial distribution. In this Perspective, we highlight recent studies that have identified novel developmental cell populations, revealed conserved and divergent patterns of cell genesis, migration and maturation across species, and begun testing hypotheses that link them to processes ranging from transcriptional control of cell fate specification to the emergence of complex behaviours. We present remaining conceptual and technical challenges and provide an outlook on how further studies of human and mammalian brain development can empower a deeper understanding of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Future efforts expanding to additional developmental stages, including adolescence, as well as whole-brain, multimodal and cross-species integration, will yield new insights into how development shapes the brain. These atlases promise to serve as essential references for unravelling mechanisms of brain function and disease vulnerability, and for advancing precision medicine.",

          "abstract": "Densely substituted aromatic rings are ubiquitous in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals1. For making aromatic molecules, aryne intermediates have synthetic potential that rivals most functional groups2. They readily react with nucleophiles, participate in pericyclic reactions, and activate inert σ-bonds. Despite their potential, arynes are currently used by a specialized community for mainly niche applications. The lack of widespread adoption of arynes is due to the undesirable means to generate them. Here, we report the design of an aryne precursor to overcome this prohibitive barrier. Readily available carboxylic acids are derivatized in a single step to a make a precursor which is then activated by blue light or by heat. Dozens of previously unknown aminated arynes, including pyridynes, are generated in this work, opening the door to drug discovery using aryne intermediates. We envision that future development of this precursor platform will allow even more decorated arynes to be accessed, further expanding the reach of aryne chemistry.",

          "authors": "Nicola De Maio, Nhan Ly-Trong, Samuel Martin, Bui Quang Minh, Nick Goldman",
          "abstract": "Phylogenetics has a central role in evolutionary biology and genomic epidemiology 1 . Assessing phylogenetic confidence and reliability is therefore crucial and the methods that do this, such as those derived from Felsenstein’s bootstrap 2 , are among the most widely used in modern science. However, these methods require enormous computational capacity, and are unsuitable for large datasets. Furthermore, most of these methods emerge from a focus on the membership of clades (groupings of taxa), which makes their results difficult to interpret in the context of genomic epidemiology. Here we propose subtree pruning and regrafting-based tree assessment (SPRTA), an efficient and interpretable approach to assess confidence in phylogenetic trees. SPRTA shifts the paradigm of phylogenetic support measurement from evaluating the confidence in clades to evolution histories and phylogenetic placement—for example, assessing whether a lineage evolved from another considered lineage, which is particularly valuable in genomic epidemiology. We use SPRTA to investigate a global public SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree relating more than two million genomes, highlighting plausible alternative evolutionary origins of many SARS-CoV-2 variants, assessing reliability in the Pango outbreak lineage classification system 3 , and demonstrating the effect of phylogenetic uncertainty on inferred mutation rates. Our results show that SPRTA enables pandemic-scale and detailed probabilistic assessment of transmission and mutational histories. Our method introduces a new approach to assessing phylogenetic confidence, enhancing the interpretability of pandemic-scale phylogenetic analyses and improving our ability to prepare for and respond to future pandemics.",

          "abstract": "Flexible solar cells have a transformative potential for niche applications, yet face fundamental challenges in simultaneously achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE), extreme mechanical resilience and operational stability1–4. Herein, we demonstrate a certified 33.6%-efficient flexible perovskite/crystalline silicon (c-Si) tandem solar cell with a record open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.015 V, rivaling its rigid counterpart. The flexible tandem retains 91% of its initial PCE after 5,000 cycles under a bending radius (Rb) of 17.6 mm, and demonstrates exceptional operational and damp-heat (DH) stability, featuring a T80 lifetime exceeding 2,000 hours under continuous illumination and retaining 90% of its initial PCE after 1,000 hours DH test. This advancement is enabled by implementation of the reactive-plasma-deposited (RPD) cerium and hydrogen co-doped indium oxide (ICO:H) recombination layer (RL) that promotes self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) coverage and interfacial charge transfer, and in-situ annealed zinc-doped indium oxide (IZO) front transparent electrode with significantly enhanced optoelectronic and mechanical properties.",

Here we used spatial tri-omic sequencing, including spatial ATAC–RNA–protein sequencing and spatial CUT&Tag–RNA–protein sequencing, alongside multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging (co-detection by indexinng (CODEX)) to map dynamic spatial remodelling during brain development and neuroinflammation. We generated a spatiotemporal tri-omic atlas of the mouse brain from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P21 and compared corresponding regions with the human developing brain. In the cortex, we identified temporal persistence and spatial spreading of chromatin accessibility for a subset of layer-defining transcription factors. In the corpus callosum, we observed dynamic chromatin priming of myelin genes across subregions and identified a role for layer-specific projection neurons in coordinating axonogenesis and myelination. In a lysolecithin neuroinflammation mouse model, we detected molecular programs shared with developmental processes. Microglia exhibited both conserved and distinct programs for inflammation and resolution, with transient activation observed not only at the lesion core but also at distal locations. Overall, this study reveals common and differential mechanisms underlying brain development and neuroinflammation, providing a rich resource for investigating brain development, function and disease.",

Despite the growing number of studies that have captured snapshots of gene expression of single cells along the axis of differentiation and maturation, the underlying map of lineage relationships that link individual progenitor cells to specific subtypes of neurons and glia remains unknown, especially in humans. Here we applied prospective lineage tracing to map the manifold of human neural stem and progenitor cell differentiation across the developmental window encompassing neurogenesis and gliogenesis in human primary tissue. By profiling the clonal output of 6,402 progenitor cells, we created a lineage-resolved map of human cortical development. Here we show that cortical progenitors switch from glutamatergic to GABAergic (involving γ-aminobutyric acid) neurogenesis around midgestation, which coincides with an onset of oligodendrocyte generation. Additionally, we find that truncated radial glia maintain a glutamatergic neurogenic potential for a protracted period during human cortical development. Unexpectedly, we find that late-born glutamatergic neurons derived from truncated radial glia exhibit molecular features of deep cortical layer neurons and may contribute to the expansion of the subplate region during midgestation.",

          "abstract": "Quantum error correction (QEC) [1,2] is essential for the realization of large-scale quantum computers [3,4]. However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded ‘logical’ qubits [5,6], understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement the key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors [6,7], demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding [8,9]. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery [10–12], and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes [13,14], enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with polylogarithmic overhead [5,15]. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use [16], increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations [17–20] with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic & entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates & magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality & physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and its practical implementation with neutral atom systems.",

The microglial response to amyloid plaques in AD can range from neuroprotective to neurotoxic 2 . Here we show that the protective function of microglia is governed by the transcription factor PU.1, which becomes downregulated following microglial contact with plaques. Lowering PU.1 expression in microglia reduces the severity of amyloid disease pathology in mice and is linked to the expression of immunoregulatory lymphoid receptor proteins, particularly CD28, a surface receptor that is critical for T cell activation 3,4 . Microglia-specific deficiency in CD28, which is expressed by a small subset of plaque-associated PU.1 low microglia, promotes a broad inflammatory microglial state that is associated with increased amyloid plaque load. Our findings indicate that PU.1 low CD28-expressing microglia may operate as suppressive microglia that mitigate the progression of AD by reducing the severity of neuroinflammation. This role of CD28 and potentially other lymphoid co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptor proteins in governing microglial responses in AD points to possible immunotherapy approaches for treating the disease by promoting protective microglial functions.",

We experimentally characterize VHH binders to four disease-relevant epitopes.

A high-resolution structure of the influenza-targeting VHH confirms atomic accuracy of the designed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Although initial computational designs exhibit modest affinity (tens to hundreds of nanomolar Kd), affinity maturation using OrthoRep3 enables production of single-digit nanomolar binders that maintain the intended epitope selectivity. We further demonstrate the de novo design of scFvs to TcdB and a PHOX2B peptide–MHC complex by combining designed heavy-chain and light-chain CDRs. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms the binding pose for two distinct TcdB scFvs, with high-resolution data for one design verifying the atomically accurate design of the conformations of all six CDR loops. Our approach establishes a framework for the computational design, screening and characterization of fully de novo antibodies with atomic-level precision in both structure and epitope targeting.",

          "abstract": "Computer vision is central to many artificial intelligence (AI) applications, from autonomous vehicles to consumer devices. However, the data behind such technical innovations are often collected with insufficient consideration of ethical concerns 1–3 . This has led to a reliance on datasets that lack diversity, perpetuate biases and are collected without the consent of data rights holders. These datasets compromise the fairness and accuracy of AI models and disenfranchise stakeholders 4–8 . Although awareness of the problems of bias in computer vision technologies, particularly facial recognition, has become widespread 9 , the field lacks publicly available, consensually collected datasets for evaluating bias for most tasks 3,10,11 . In response, we introduce the Fair Human-Centric Image Benchmark (FHIBE, pronounced ‘Feebee’), a publicly available human image dataset implementing best practices for consent, privacy, compensation, safety, diversity and utility. FHIBE can be used responsibly as a fairness evaluation dataset for many human-centric computer vision tasks, including pose estimation, person segmentation, face detection and verification, and visual question answering. By leveraging comprehensive annotations capturing demographic and physical attributes, environmental factors, instrument and pixel-level annotations, FHIBE can identify a wide variety of biases. The annotations also enable more nuanced and granular bias diagnoses, enabling practitioners to better understand sources of bias and mitigate potential downstream harms. FHIBE therefore represents an important step forward towards trustworthy AI, raising the bar for fairness benchmarks and providing a road map for responsible data curation in AI.",

          "abstract": "Ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) achieve rapid remission in treatment-resistant depression. However, their mechanisms of action—the understanding of which is essential for refining therapeutic precision—remain unclear1,2,3. Here, using mouse models, we identify adenosine signalling as a central pathway that underlies the antidepressant effects of these interventions. Results from genetically encoded adenosine sensor experiments and real-time optical recordings reveal that both therapies induce strong adenosine surges in key mood-regulatory regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of A1 and A2A adenosine receptors abolishes their therapeutic effects, which establishes the essential role of adenosine signalling in antidepressant efficacy. Notably, adenosine signalling specifically in the medial prefrontal cortex drives antidepressant actions. Ketamine increases adenosine by modulating cellular metabolism to increase intracellular adenosine levels without causing neuronal hyperactivity. Leveraging this mechanism, we develop ketamine derivatives that enhance adenosine signalling and exhibit improved antidepressant efficacy with reduced side effects at therapeutic doses. Furthermore, acute intermittent hypoxia, a non-pharmacological intervention involving controlled reductions in oxygen levels, increases brain adenosine levels and produces antidepressant effects, paralleling the actions of ketamine and ECT. Our findings establish adenosine as a pivotal mediator of rapid-acting antidepressants and a tractable target for scalable, noninvasive therapeutics in major depressive disorder.",

Previous studies suggest that there is a primate-specific population of striatal inhibitory interneurons—the TAC3 interneurons5. However, broader taxonomic and developmental characterization is required to address novelty in cell-type evolution. Here we examine gene expression in inhibitory neurons across 10 mammalian species, spanning 160 million years of divergence from primates. We find that the initial class of newborn TAC3 interneurons specified during development represents an ancestral, medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived striatal population that is also present in pig and ferret cortex. This discovery prompted a re-examination of Glires, including mice, which are thought to lack the TAC3 type5,6. Targeted enrichment of MGE precursors in mice revealed conservation of the TAC3 initial class, camouflaged by reduced expression of Tac2 (the mouse orthologue of TAC3) and a gain of Th expression. Extending our analysis to the adult striatum further supported the homology of primate TAC3 and mouse Th striatal interneurons, and also uncovered a rare Tac2 subpopulation in the mouse ventromedial striatum. This study suggests that initial classes of telencephalic inhibitory neurons are largely conserved, and that during evolution, neuronal types in the mammalian brain change through redistribution and fate refinement, rather than by derivation of novel precursors early in development.",

Here, using pharmacological assays, we show that agonist efficacy correlates with decreased GDP affinity, promoting GTP exchange, whereas antagonists increase GDP affinity, dampening activation. Further investigating this phenomenon, we provide 8 unique structural models and 16 cryogenic electron microscopy maps of MOR with naloxone or loperamide, capturing several intermediate conformations along the activation pathway. These include four GDP-bound states with previously undescribed receptor–G protein interfaces, AHD arrangements and transitions in the nucleotide-binding pocket required for GDP release. Naloxone stalls MOR in a ‘latent’ state, whereas loperamide promotes an ‘engaged’ state, which is structurally poised for opening of the AHD domain and subsequent GDP release. These findings, supported by molecular dynamics simulations, identify GDP-bound intermediates and AHD conformations as key determinants of nucleotide exchange rates, providing structural and mechanistic insights into G protein activation and ligand efficacy with broad implications for G protein-coupled receptor pharmacology.",

Solid waste emits methane through the decay of organic material, which amounts to about 10% of total anthropogenic methane emissions 2 . Satellite instruments 3 enable monitoring of strong methane hotspots 4 , including many strongly emitting urban areas that include solid waste disposal sites as most prominent sources 5 . Here we present a survey of methane emissions from 151 individual waste disposal sites across six continents using high-resolution satellite observations that can detect localized methane emissions above 100 kg h –1 . Within this dataset, we find that our satellite-based estimates generally show no correlation with reported or modelled emission estimates at facility scale. This reveals major uncertainties in the current understanding of methane emissions from waste disposal sites, warranting further investigations to reconcile bottom-up and top-down approaches. We also observe that managed landfills show lower emission per area than dumping sites, and that detected emission sources often align with the open non-covered parts of the facility where waste is added. Our results highlight the potential of high-resolution satellite observations to detect and monitor methane emissions from the waste sector globally, providing actionable insights to help improve emission estimates and focus mitigation efforts.",

Although these methods are conceptually similar, by analysing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank 2–4 , we show that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: (1) trait importance — how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and (2) trait specificity — the importance of a gene for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, whereas burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, whereas burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.",

Here, in the Breast Cancer-Anti-Progestin Prevention Study 1 (BC-APPS1; NCT02408770 ), we assessed whether progesterone receptor antagonism with ulipristal acetate for 12 weeks reduces surrogate markers of breast cancer risk in 24 premenopausal women. We used multilayered OMICs and live-cell approaches as readouts for molecular features alongside clinical imaging and tissue micromechanics correlates. Ulipristal acetate reduced epithelial proliferation (Ki67) and the proportion, proliferation and colony formation capacity of luminal progenitor cells, the putative cell of origin of aggressive breast cancers 2 . MRI scans showed reduction in fibroglandular volume with treatment, whereas single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, histology and atomic force microscopy identified extracellular matrix remodelling with reduced collagen organization and tissue stiffness. Collagen VI was the most significantly downregulated protein after ulipristal acetate treatment, and we uncovered an unanticipated spatial association between collagen VI and SOX9 high luminal progenitor cell localization, establishing a link between collagen organization and luminal progenitor activity. Culture of primary human breast epithelial cells in a stiff environment increased luminal progenitor activity, which was antagonized by anti-progestin therapy, strengthening this mechanistic link. This study offers a template for biologically informed early-phase therapeutic cancer prevention trials and demonstrates the potential for premenopausal breast cancer prevention with progesterone receptor antagonists through stromal remodelling and luminal progenitor suppression.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision2. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam3,4, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention module to weight video-specific embeddings that accurately map the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic clinical interpretation. In datasets from five international independent healthcare systems, EchoPrime achieves state-of-the art performance on 23 diverse benchmarks of cardiac form and function, surpassing the performance of both task-specific approaches and prior foundation models. Following rigorous clinical evaluation, EchoPrime can assist physicians in the automated preliminary assessment of comprehensive echocardiography.",

It is characterized by glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) composed of fibrillar α-synuclein (aSyn)4,5,6,7,8, the formation of which shows parallels with prion propagation9,10. While fibrils extracted from brains of individuals with MSA have been structurally characterized11, their ability to replicate in a protein-only manner has been questioned12, and their ability to induce GCIs in vivo remains unexplored. By contrast, the synthetic fibril strain 1B13,14, assembled from recombinant human aSyn, self-replicates in vitro and induces GCIs in mice15—suggesting direct relevance to MSA—but lacks scrutiny at the atomic scale. Here we report high-resolution structural analyses of 1B fibrils and of fibrils extracted from diseased mice injected with 1B that developed GCIs (1BP). We show in vivo that conformational templating enables fibril strain replication, resulting in MSA-like inclusion pathology. Notably, the structures of 1B and 1BP are highly similar and mimic the fold of aSyn observed in one protofilament of fibrils isolated from patients with MSA11. Moreover, reinjection of crude mouse brain homogenates containing 1BP into new mice reproduces the same MSA-like pathology induced by the parent synthetic seed 1B. Our findings identify 1B as a synthetic pathogen capable of self-replication in vivo and reveal structural features of 1B and 1BP that may underlie MSA pathology, offering insights for therapeutic strategies.",

          "abstract": "The amplification of extremely short laser pulses (under 100 fs) presents a fundamental challenge due to the trade-off between amplification bandwidth, efficiency and gain1. Conventional methods rely on complex optical set-ups with preprocessing and postprocessing steps2. Optical parametric amplification3 offers a high optical gain that scales with the length of the nonlinear medium at the expense of bandwidth, limiting its effectiveness for extremely short and intrinsically broadband ultrashort pulses, whose amplification requires a broad gain–bandwidth, high single-pass gain and simultaneously strong nonlinear interaction. Here we introduce a new multipass4 optical parametric amplification system that leverages dispersion-engineered dielectric mirrors to repeatedly focus the laser into a nonlinear gain crystal. The coatings simultaneously compensate for the group delay5 after each multipass step and suppress the idler wave and, therefore, backconversion. This approach achieves ×1,500 higher gain compared with single-pass amplification, a photon conversion efficiency of up to 81% (52% system conversion efficiency) and near Fourier-limited time–bandwidth products of the amplified pulses, while fully preserving the spatial beam quality. Our concept breaks the gain versus bandwidth barrier and achieves 12 THz at 41 dB gain. As our concept does not require specific gain materials, it is versatile and broadly applicable to ultrafast6 laser systems in quantum technologies7,8,9, attosecond physics10,11,12, material processing and ultrabroadband low-cost bio-imaging systems13,14.

GABAergic neurons in the telencephalon are diverse; they have many circuit functions, and dysfunction of these neurons has been implicated in various brain disorders1,2,3. Here we conducted a systematic and in-depth analysis of the transcriptomic and spatial organization of GABAergic neuronal types in all regions of the mouse telencephalon and their developmental origins. This was accomplished using 611,423 young adult single-cell transcriptomes and 614,569 single-cell transcriptomes collected from multiple prenatal and postnatal developmental timepoints. We present a hierarchically organized adult telencephalic GABAergic neuronal cell-type taxonomy of 7 classes, 52 subclasses, 284 supertypes and 1,051 clusters, as well as a corresponding developmental taxonomy of 1,688 clusters across ages from embryonic day 7 to postnatal day 14. Detailed charting efforts reveal extraordinary complexity whereby relationships among cell types reflect both spatial locations and developmental origins. Transcriptomically and developmentally related cell types are often found in distant and diverse brain regions, indicating that long-distance migration and dispersion is a common characteristic of nearly all classes of telencephalic GABAergic neurons. Moreover, we find various spatial dimensions of both discrete and continuous variation among related cell types that are correlated with gene expression gradients. Lastly, we find that cortical, striatal and some pallidal GABAergic neurons undergo extensive postnatal diversification, whereas septal, preoptic and most pallidal GABAergic neuronal types emerge in a burst during the embryonic stage with limited postnatal diversification. Overall, the telencephalic GABAergic cell-type taxonomy will serve as a foundational reference for molecular, structural and functional studies of cell types and circuits by the entire community.",

          "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly interconnected membrane network that serves as a central site for protein synthesis and maturation1. A crucial subset of ER-associated transcripts, termed secretome mRNAs, encode secretory, lumenal and integral membrane proteins, representing nearly one-third of human protein-coding genes1. Unlike cytosolic mRNAs, secretome mRNAs undergo co-translational translocation, and thus require precise coordination between translation and protein insertion2,3. Disruption of this process, such as through altered elongation rates4, activates stress response pathways that impede cellular growth, raising the question of whether secretome translation is spatially organized to ensure fidelity. Here, using live-cell single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that secretome mRNA translation is preferentially localized to ER junctions that are enriched with the structural protein lunapark and in close proximity to lysosomes. Lunapark depletion reduced ribosome density and translation efficiency of secretome mRNAs near lysosomes, an effect that was dependent on eIF2-mediated initiation and was reversed by the integrated stress response inhibitor ISRIB. Lysosome-associated translation was further modulated by nutrient status: amino acid deprivation enhanced lysosome-proximal translation, whereas lysosomal pH neutralization suppressed it. These findings identify a mechanism by which ER junctional proteins and lysosomal activity cooperatively pattern secretome mRNA translation, linking ER architecture and nutrient sensing to the production of secretory and membrane proteins.",

          "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that cancer cells are susceptible to ferroptosis, a form of cell death that is triggered by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation1,2,3. Despite broad enthusiasm about harnessing ferroptosis as a novel anti-cancer strategy, whether ferroptosis is a barrier to tumorigenesis and can be leveraged therapeutically remains unknown4,5. Here, using genetically engineered mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma, we performed tumour-specific loss-of-function studies of two key ferroptosis suppressors, GPX46,7 and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)8,9, and observed increased lipid peroxidation and robust suppression of tumorigenesis, suggesting that lung tumours are highly sensitive to ferroptosis. Furthermore, across multiple pre-clinical models, we found that FSP1 was required for ferroptosis protection in vivo, but not in vitro, underscoring a heightened need to buffer lipid peroxidation under physiological conditions. Lipidomic analyses revealed that Fsp1-knockout tumours had an accumulation of lipid peroxides, and inhibition of ferroptosis with genetic, dietary or pharmacological approaches effectively restored the growth of Fsp1-knockout tumours in vivo. Unlike GPX4, expression of FSP1 (also known as AIFM2) was prognostic for disease progression and poorer survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential as a viable therapeutic target. To this end, we demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of FSP1 had significant therapeutic benefit in pre-clinical lung cancer models. Our studies highlight the importance of ferroptosis suppression in vivo and pave the way for FSP1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for patients with lung cancer.",

Single-cell transcriptomics enables a systematic study of cell types across the entire timeline of cortical development. Here we present a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and epigenomic cell-type atlas of the developing mouse visual cortex. The atlas is built from a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of 568,654 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes and a single-nucleus Multiome dataset of 200,061 high-quality nuclei, which were densely sampled across the embryonic and postnatal developmental stages (from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56). We computationally reconstructed a transcriptomic developmental trajectory map of all excitatory, inhibitory and non-neuronal cell types in the visual cortex. Branching points that mark the emergence of new cell types at specific developmental ages and molecular signatures of cellular diversification are identified. The trajectory map shows that neurogenesis, gliogenesis and early postmitotic maturation in the embryonic stage give rise to all cell classes and nearly all subclasses in a staggered parallel manner. Increasingly refined cell types emerge throughout the postnatal differentiation process, including the late emergence of many cell types during the eye-opening stage and the onset of critical period, suggesting that there is continuous cell-type diversification at different stages of cortical development. Throughout development, there are cooperative dynamic changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in specific cell types. We identify cell-type-specific and temporally resolved gene regulatory networks that link transcription factors and downstream target genes through accessible chromatin motifs. Collectively, our study provides a detailed dynamic molecular map directly associated with individual cell types and specific temporal events that can reveal the molecular logic underlying the complex and multifaceted cortical cell type and circuit development.",

Yet, the Turkana Depression in East Africa, the site of the failed 66-million-year-old Anza Rift, did not experience the widespread flood magmatism seen on the adjacent Ethiopian Plateau, despite being a lithospheric thin spot when the region encountered hot plume material around 45 million years ago 4 . Here we jointly invert surface-wave and receiver function data to constrain crustal and upper-mantle seismic structure below the Depression to evaluate lithospheric thermo-mechanical modification. Evidence for thick lower crustal intrusions, ubiquitous below the uplifted Ethiopian Plateau 5,6 , is comparatively lacking below the Depression’s failed Anza Rift system, which ongoing East African rifting is circumnavigating, not exploiting. The mantle lithosphere below the Depression has also retained its cool, fast-wavespeed ‘lid’ character, contrasting the Ethiopian Plateau. Volatile depletion during failed Anza rifting probably rendered the thinned lithosphere refractory without later rejuvenation. Subsequent rifting and magmatism thus initiated away from the still-thin Anza Rift, in regions where fertile lithosphere enabled melting and the sufficient lowering of plate yield strength. Areas of thinned lithosphere are thus not necessarily persistent weak zones where significant extension and magmatic provinces will develop.",

          "abstract": "Tandem light-emitting diodes (LEDs), achieved by vertically stacking multiple units in series to combine the luminance of individual light-emitting elements, are effective for improving efficiency and lifespan compared to single-unit devices1–3. In particular, tandem perovskite LEDs benefit from the small Stokes shifts of perovskites4, which in principle can enable significant photon recycling between individual perovskite layers and enhance light extraction from trapped modes. However, a tandem structure that effectively merges the luminance of each perovskite units still remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient and stable tandem LEDs by combining two solution-processed perovskite light-emitting units. This tandem structure effectively combines the original luminance of each light-emitting units; we argue that the emissions are also significantly enhanced through photon recycling between the individual light-emitting units. Consequently, we achieve tandem perovskite LEDs with a low turn-on voltage of 3.2 V, a high peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5% (even 20% higher than the sum of peak EQEs of single-unit devices), an average peak EQE of 40.9%, and a half-lifetime of 64 h at an initial radiance of 70 W Sr−1 m−2.

The oldest, from the Pampas region and dating to 10,000 years before present (bp), had distinct genetic affinity to Middle Holocene Southern Cone individuals, showing that differentiation from the central Andes and central east Brazil had begun by this time. Individuals dating to 4,600–150 bp primarily descended from a previously unsampled deep lineage of which the earliest representative is an individual dating to around 8,500 bp. This central Argentina lineage co-existed with two other lineages during the Mid-Holocene and, within central Argentina, this ancestry persisted for thousands of years with little evidence of inter-regional migration. Central Argentina ancestry was involved in three distinct gene flows: it mixed into the Pampas by 3,300 bp and seemingly became the main component there after 800 bp, with central Andes ancestry in northwest Argentina, and with tropical and subtropical forest ancestry in the Gran Chaco. In northwest Argentina, there was an increased rate of close-kin unions by 1,000 bp, paralleling the pattern in the central Andes.

          "abstract": "Ferroptosis has emerged as an actionable target to eliminate therapy-resistant and metastatic cancers1. However, which ferroptosis surveillance systems may offer a therapeutic window to leverage redox maladaptation in cancer remains unclear. In melanoma, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) impedes ferroptosis during haematogenous metastasis, but is dispensable during lymphatic metastasis2. Here, using a metastatic mouse melanoma model selected for lymph node metastasis, we show that lymph-node-derived metastatic cells exhibit markedly diminished expression of glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCLC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels relative to their parental counterparts. This metabolic shift occurs within the hypoxic lymphatic niche. Under comparable low-oxygen conditions, GPX4 undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In response, lymph node metastatic cells acquire increased reliance on ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), which is localized with perinuclear lysosomes. These findings reveal that the reduced reliance on the GPX4 axis enables melanoma cells to shift toward FSP1 dependency. Notably, intratumoural monotherapy with selective FSP1 inhibitors (viFSP1 and FSEN1) effectively suppresses melanoma growth in lymph nodes, but not in subcutaneous tumours, emphasizing a microenvironment-specific dependency on FSP1. Thus, targeting FSP1 in the lymph nodes holds strong potential for blocking melanoma progression.",

Quantum mechanics dictates that the more localized a laser pulse is in time, the wider the range of frequencies of its photons — ultrashort laser pulses are said to be ‘broadband’ because of their wide frequency range. The power of ultrashort laser pulses can be increased through amplification, but efficiently amplifying these pulses is difficult. However, in a paper in Nature, Nägele et al.1 report a method that efficiently amplifies a weak, ultrashort laser pulse by overlapping it with a high-power laser pulse. The authors achieved this by bouncing the two pulses back and forth between two mirrors such that they repeatedly passed through a crystal. The mirrors were designed to reduce unwanted mismatch between the pulses, and the researchers demonstrate that this set-up transfers energy to the weaker pulse with high efficiency.",

Baskow/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service via Getty\n\nScientists feel that the pressure to publish is rising, but that the time and resources they have to do the necessary research are falling, according to a survey of 3,200 researchers.\n\nThe results come from Elsevier’s 2025 Researcher of the Future report, which between August and September surveyed people from 113 countries, to assess how they view the evolving research landscape.\n\nAbout 68% of respondents said the pressure to publish their research is greater than it was two to three years ago, and only 45% agreed that they have sufficient time for research (see ‘Researchers are feeling the pressure’). Another concern is uncertainty over funding — just 33% of respondents expect funding in their field to grow in the next 2–3 years. And that proportion fell to just 11% in North America, reflecting unprecedented cuts to US research funding this year.\n\n“As a researcher based in Brazil, I strongly relate to the survey’s findings, particularly the growing pressure to publish despite limited time and resources,” says Claudia Suemoto, a gerontologist at the University of São Paulo Medical School. “The demand for productivity has indeed increased in recent years, yet opportunities for funding and access to qualified personnel remain constrained in Brazil and other low- and middle-income countries.”\n\nSource: Elsevier\n\nSuemoto says this imbalance of high demands and restricted resources often forces researchers to do more with less, which could affect the quality and innovation of research. Comments researchers made as part of the survey indicate that the lack of time is down to factors including growing administrative and teaching demands and trying to identity and acquire funding.\n\nAs a result, some researchers are surprised that the proportion of people who have enough time to do their work is so high. “I am amazed that 45% of scientists feel they have enough time for research. I do not know anyone who feels that way,” says Anastasia Borschevsky, an engineer at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.\n\nWhich researchers want to relocate?\n\nThe survey also reveals that nearly 30% of the respondents are considering moving to a different country in the next two years for the sake of their career.\n\n“Scientists are used to moving country because of the dynamics of the job market,” says Jacco van Loon, an astronomer at Keele University in the United Kingdom, but he says politics now has a strong influence, too.\n\nSome 40% of researchers in the United States are likely to consider relocating (up 16 percentage points from a similar survey by Elsevier in 2022), but just 13% of those in China are thinking about it, down 22 percentage points from 2022.\n\n75% of US scientists who answered Nature poll consider leaving\n\n“China has made it much more attractive for Chinese scientists to stay, whilst the government in the US has been unprecedently hostile towards scientists, especially on topics where the government has a diverging opinion and with regard to diversity and inclusion,” says van Loon. “So, I am not surprised by the statistics around desire to move country.”\n\nThe relatively high proportion of respondents in the United States considering a move reflects data from a Nature poll in March, which showed that 75% of 1,600 US scientists were considering a move overseas after the election of President Donald Trump, with many saying they were looking for jobs in Europe and Canada.",

          "abstract": "The smouldering rubble after the World Trade Center collapsed on 11 September 2001. Credit: Porter Gifford/Corbis/Getty\n\nAfter interviewing health-care workers who had responded to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 in New York City, Erin Smith, a disaster-response researcher at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Australia, noticed her behaviour changing. “I started having nightmares where it was me buried in the rubble and I would wake up gasping for breath,” says Smith. She became anxious about being in crowded spaces and had intrusive thoughts about the stories she had heard during her research.\n\nIt was only when she saw a psychiatrist that she realized these changes were signs of vicarious trauma — which can be experienced by individuals who are exposed to other people’s trauma through work, including conducting research.\n\nVicarious trauma is increasingly being recognized as an occupational risk for researchers, particularly among those whose work involves distressing material. Repeated exposure to traumatic material increases the risk of vicarious trauma, as does a lack of mental-health support and having a history of trauma. Graduate students and early-career researchers are particularly vulnerable, says Smith, because they often lack the support network at work or during their studies of senior academics.\n\nThere is evidence on how to reduce its effects. For instance, a study1 published last month found that having a designated person looking after researchers’ well-being and policies mandating breaks or time off were effective strategies.\n\nIn that vein, Smith is among those calling for workplaces to introduce policies that provide more emotional support and increase resilience for researchers. “Despite its significance, vicarious trauma in academia remains under-addressed,” she says.\n\nSetting boundaries\n\nAfter receiving a graphic image of a severed foot from one of his sources in Myanmar, Ronan Lee, a genocide researcher at Loughborough University London who studies the ongoing Rohingya massacre in Rakhine State, Myanmar, started looking for literature about the best practices for managing vicarious trauma. He’s learnt that having a routine and setting boundaries between work and everyday life are crucial for managing his risk of traumatization. He says he will do work involving potentially traumatic material for a set period of time, with breaks doing activities that are calming or bring him joy. “I’m notorious for looking at pictures of alpacas on Instagram,” he adds. Lee says setting boundaries around his work is particularly important because technology has made it harder for researchers to disconnect. “I get graphic images sent to me daily,” he adds.\n\nMillan AbiNader, a gender-based violence researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia also sets physical boundaries between work and the spaces where she can disconnect. She says her team does not do trauma-related work — such as interviewing people who have experienced abuse or reading homicide case files — from their bedrooms or living spaces at home. When she was a student and did not have a separate space at home, she would work in coffee shops or libraries instead. AbiNader says she experienced vicarious trauma from her previous work as a victim-services advocate for people experiencing sexual violence, family violence or trafficking.\n\nIn a 2023 study2, AbiNader and her colleagues found that ‘compartmentalizing’ work that involved traumatic material and processing it later helped to reduce its negative effects, as did having a computer designated for trauma-related work, and restricting such work to the same time each day.\n\nAbiNader says speaking with teammates about traumatic material and other types of social support can prevent trauma and promote resilience. Formal support, such as check-ins during team meetings, and informal bonding with colleagues outside work can also be beneficial. It’s normal for exposure to traumatic material to have an emotional impact, says AbiNader. “If you’re affected, it means your brain’s working, and it doesn’t mean that something’s wrong.”\n\nThere are also ways in which universities, research institutes and other workplaces can help researchers to reduce their risk of developing vicarious trauma, says Smith. “This includes offering training on emotional safety and trauma awareness, integrating researcher well-being into ethics review processes and providing access to supervision, peer support and mental-health resources,” she adds.",

          "authors": "Carsten Lund Pedersen",
          "abstract": "How’s this for an academic dream team? Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Richard Feynman. The three physicists and I often get together over coffee to chat about career decisions, difficulties and dilemmas. Of course, not the real Einstein, Bohr and Feynman — the last of the trio to die was Feynman, in 1988 — but rather, simulations of the three that I have assembled, using artificial intelligence (AI), to serve as my personal advisory board.\n\nAI is seemingly everywhere these days. It’s in productivity apps, web browsers and technical support lines. AI users increasingly report developing friendships, and even romantic relationships, with AI companions. I used the technology to develop an advisory board that can provide customized input into my career decisions and reflections. The resulting advice has been surprisingly useful — not to mention entertaining.\n\nMy board has provided advice on how to progress to my next career stage, how to contextualize my past and future work and how I might structure my next semester for maximum impact on my career. It also provided guidance when I received a job offer at a different university, helping me to see that accepting it might not be the best decision.\n\nAlthough some people in corporate settings have proposed using AI to build a personal board of directors, I think the term ‘advisory board’ is more fitting, because the AI panellists are only advisers — they should not make decisions for you, and they cannot own the consequences of their decisions.\n\nThe make-up of my advisory board often changes, and has included an eclectic mix. Besides Bohr, Feynman and Einstein, I’ve also tapped microbiologist Alexander Fleming, poet Piet Hein and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. Sometimes I include experts from my specific disciplines of AI and marketing; other times, I ‘invite’ artist Pablo Picasso or architect Bjarke Ingels for a completely different perspective. But whatever the board’s composition, I typically retain a core group of three seminal scientists.\n\nThe make-up of the board influences not just what I might be told, but also the mood in the room. Picasso might push for an intuitive representation or metaphor, whereas Bohr tends to insist on complementarity and paradoxes. Different ‘personalities’ might dominate depending on the question — but, unlike with human discussions, you can often prompt your way out of any issues. You can, for example, prompt the AI to synthesize the board’s answers into a single coherent piece of advice, or to fuel ‘constructive conflict’ between members. As a result, I sometimes find myself acting more as a moderator than a passive recipient of information.\n\nBuild-a-board workshop\n\nSo, how do you build your own AI-generated board?\n\nFirst, choose your favourite chatbot, such as ChatGPT (provided by OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic) or LeChat (Mistral AI). Choosing one that has some memory of your previous conversations can be helpful. My profile remembers that I’m an associate professor, as well as the specific challenges I face and my interests. As a result, I don’t have to start every conversation from scratch.\n\nNext, prompt the AI to act like an academic advisory board. Here’s a prompt I might use to initiate an AI brainstorming session:\n\n“Assemble an imaginary advisory board consisting of [INSERT PEOPLE HERE]. Have them discuss my current academic situation and give me contrasting, thought-provoking advice. End with a short synthesis that integrates their perspectives into one actionable insight.”\n\nOf course, this is only a starting point. The real value lies in continuing the conversation.\n\nCarsten Lund Pedersen.Credit: Carsten Lund Pedersen\n\nYou could also try presenting the board with a dilemma you’re facing and asking for input.\n\nFinally, experiment and tinker with the make-up of your board. Try including different personalities, such as talk-show host Oprah Winfrey or author Stephen King. The sheer diversity can often reveal surprising perspectives on the challenges you face. For instance, in response to the generic prompt above, ‘Nelson Mandela’ reminded me that institutions often follow people of integrity, so I should focus on lifting other people up and ask whose lives will be improved if I succeed in my academic career.\n\nDanger on board\n\nThere are, of course, pitfalls to consider when creating your own advisory board.\n\nFirst, never outsource your decision-making. Use the technology to ‘open up the problem’ to perspectives that differ from your own, and, through this, to aid your own decision-making on a career-related matter. Because an AI can never take responsibility for its decisions (and might not have all the relevant information), you must always make the final decision yourself.",

The website will make exceptions only for papers that have been previously accepted by a peer-reviewed venue, such as a journal or conference.\n\nThese types of article were never officially on arXiv’s list of ‘accepted content types’, but they had previously been allowed at moderator discretion, said a blogpost announcing the move on 31 October. The management of arXiv says that the move was made necessary by a surge in low-quality papers, including many that seem to have been written using generative artificial intelligence tools.\n\n“I think this is a wise move by arXiv,” says Richard Sever, chief science and strategy officer of the non-profit organization openRxiv in New York City, which runs the biomedical-sciences preprint servers bioRxiv and medRxiv. He adds that both of those platforms have had a ‘no narrative reviews’ policy from the outset.\n\nRising rejection rates\n\nPreprints submitted to arXiv are checked by automated tools. Before going live on the site, around 20% of submissions are flagged to one of 240 volunteer moderators, says arXiv executive director Ramin Zabih, a computer scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.\n\nUntil a year ago, only 2–3% of submissions were ultimately rejected by moderators, says Steinn Sigurðsson, an astrophysicist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park who is arXiv’s scientific director.

          "abstract": "Roughly 1.3 million international students and recent graduates enrolled in work training are in the United States for the 2025–26 academic year.Credit: Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe/Getty\n\nInternational students in the United States have defied predictions of a huge downturn in their population. Data for the current academic year show that the number of international students — including PhD candidates and newly minted PhDs — has remained essentially flat, year-on-year.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has shaken up the landscape of higher education, revoking student visas, cutting funds to institutions and implementing travel bans for selected countries. As a result, many higher-education researchers had expected significant numbers of overseas students to turn away from US academia.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nIn July, NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a non-profit organization in Washington DC, predicted that the number of overseas students in the United States would decline by 15% between the previous academic year and this one. And in October, The New York Times reported a 20% drop in the number of students arriving in the United States in August 2025 compared with August 2024, a finding based on data from the US Department of Commerce.\n\nBut data released by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for September and October show almost no change in the population of international students and recent graduates in the United States between this year and last — and specialists say these data are more reliable than others.\n\n“It doesn’t appear to be as catastrophic as had been originally feared,” says Chris Glass, a higher-education researcher at Boston College in Massachusetts.\n\nData points\n\nThe DHS statistics, which are part of a database called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), track students enrolled in educational institutes and recent graduates gaining work experience in a programme called optional practical training (OPT). OPT is one of the largest foreign-talent pipelines to the United States, feeding thousands of people into Amazon, Google and other leading companies. It is key for people pursuing PhDs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) topics: between 2010 and 2022, 76% of recent graduates took part in it.\n\nAccording to the SEVIS data, roughly 1.3 million international students and OPT participants are in the United States for the 2025–26 academic year — about the same as the number for the 2024–25 academic year. The total number of doctoral students also remained nearly the same year-on-year (see ‘Surprising stability’).\n\nSource: SEVIS, NAFSA: Association of International Educators\n\nThe SEVIS data do not distinguish between recent graduates involved in OPT and students still enrolled in educational institutes. Glass says that, given recent trends, the number of OPT participants might have grown by about 15% between 2024 and 2025. If so, that would mean a “modest single-digit enrolment decline”, leading the total number of students and graduates to remain flat.\n\nWhat, then, might explain the 20% decline in student arrivals in August recorded by the commerce department? The August arrival data “aren’t all that great of a proxy” for the international-student population, says Violet Buxton-Walsh, an immigration researcher at the Institute for Progress, a non-profit think tank in Washington DC. Many international students could have heeded advice to stay in the United States between the end of the 2024–25 school year and the start of the 2025–26 year. If they did, they would not have been included in the August arrivals data, Buxton-Walsh says. Others might have arrived in September, rather than August, because of visa delays.\n\nThe relatively steady numbers might seem puzzling, given the headlines about the Trump administration’s anti-immigration actions. But “international students are incredibly resilient”, says Melissa Whatley, a higher-education researcher at the William & Mary School of Education in Williamsburg, Virginia. “They’re going to attend institutions and earn degrees under circumstances that we think might deter them.”\n\nDeterrence policy",

To pass the time, Jin looked out of the window.\n\nThe first thing that caught his eye was not anything outside the window, but his own reflection.

It spoke, wordlessly, of his age — and the fear of death that had brought him here.\n\nSuspended above his head, the halo-like scanning ring evoked an old memory: the first time he got a perm as a teenager. Jin remembered the feeling of the heat coils, the nervous shuffling in the salon chair, the ring-shaped machine resting awkwardly on his scalp.\n\nHis best friend had walked with him out of the salon, grinning and teasing: “Look at us!

The beloved woman had curled up beside him, kissed his tattoo softly, and smiled.\n\n“Now,” she whispered, “my name will live on your body forever.” Her eyes shimmered with joy.\n\nShe became his wife.

His mother quickly scooped him up, singing a lullaby that seemed to carry magic in its melody. The boy’s cries softened into giggles. Nearby, the father summoned a recording drone. “Capture this,” he said, freezing that tender moment in time.\n\nCameras and smartphones might have become relics, but the desire to preserve love in images had not aged a day.\n\nJin thought of an old photograph — him as a baby, resting in his mother’s arms, her face radiant with love. And then he wondered: had his father, behind the lens, looked at them with the same warmth as the man outside the window?\n\nHis mother had passed before uploading technology existed. For years after her death, his father clung to the old house, clung to the memories.

          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "A 'black box' warning has appeared on hormone replacement therapies in the United States for more than 20 years.Credit: Getty\n\nOn Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration announced its intention to eliminate safety warnings for hormone replacement therapy creams, pills and patches used to treat the symptoms of menopause. The move, which the FDA called “a historic action to restore gold-standard science to women’s health”, is drawing both praise and concern from scientists and advocates.\n\nMany argue that the warnings, which have appeared on the products for more than 20 years, have contributed to chronic underuse of menopausal hormone therapy among women who were likely to benefit. Yet some now worry that removing the labels entirely, or making overly broad claims about hormones, health and longevity, might swing the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. “I’m afraid comprehensive discussion about the risks and benefits may not occur in absence of that warning,” says Stephanie Faubion, the director of Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health in Jacksonville, Florida, and medical director of The Menopause Society a non-profit organization based in Pepper Pike, Ohio, that provides tools and resources to health-care professionals. “We need to end up somewhere in the middle.”\n\nHormone crash\n\nHormone therapy was widely prescribed for decades to ease common menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats and poor sleep. But prescriptions plunged worldwide in 2002 after an initial report from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) — a long-term US study — suggested that postmenopausal participants who were taking oestrogen and progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone) had slightly increased risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke1. The findings — widely misinterpreted and overgeneralized — sparked fear among women and clinicians.\n\nIn January 2003, the FDA announced that oestrogen-containing menopausal hormone therapy products would require a ‘black box’ safety warning, the agency’s strongest. Regulatory agencies around the world followed the FDA’s lead by changing labels and issuing advisories. Use of these products remained low even though later research hinted at reduced risks of heart disease and death among hormone-therapy users, and lower rates of breast cancer among those taking oestrogen-only therapy.\n\nHow menopause reshapes the brain\nA 2024 review reiterated that the hormone formulations, doses and delivery routes used in the WHI trials differed from those typically used today2. Transdermal patches don’t show the same links to blood clots found with oral hormones, for example. And using lower doses and hormones that are identical to those found in the body might further limit risks. Researchers have also noted that most participants included in the initial, concerning WHI analysis were a decade or more beyond menopause, a stage when the sudden return of oestrogen might pose health problems.\n\nBefore the WHI results were reported, about one-quarter of women over the age of 40 used systemic hormone therapy. Now, that figure is about 1.7%, according to The Menopause Society. “I don’t know what percentage should be getting the therapy, but I’d venture to say it is probably more than 1.7%,” says Faubion. “On the other hand, I don’t think we should go back to thinking this is the be-all-end-all longevity drug.”\n\nThe balance of risks and benefits depends on a person’s age, years elapsed since menopause, whether the individual has a uterus, existing medical conditions and the therapy’s formulation, route of delivery and dose. “Hormone therapy is not for everyone,” says JoAnn Manson, a women’s health researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston and a former president of The Menopause Society. Generally, she says, women under the age of 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause who are experiencing symptoms might be good candidates.\n\nManson says she doesn’t think that the message needs to appear in a “frightening black box”. But she says the package inserts should summarize clinical-trial data so that women, together with their clinicians, can make informed and personalized decisions.",

          "authors": "Mwila Mulubwa, Leon Mutesa, Kelly Chibale",
          "abstract": "After more than a decade of planning, the launch of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) is being celebrated in Mombasa, Kenya, this week at the Seventh Biennial Scientific Conference on Medical Products Regulation in Africa. The agency’s establishment marks a pivotal moment in Africa’s public health, at a time when the need for biomedical research conducted in Africa, focused on African health problems, has never been greater.\n\nAfrica holds higher levels of human genetic diversity than anywhere else on Earth, but this diversity has not been adequately studied. And many globally approved treatments and vaccines for diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are less effective, and can even be harmful in some people of African ancestry1,2.\n\nFailure is not an option for Africa’s newly launched medicines agency\n\nThis year, cuts of billions of US dollars in international funding for biomedical research and health services in Africa have left millions of people without access to life-saving treatments or, in the case of researchers and health-care workers, unemployed. This demonstrates the immense vulnerability that comes with relying on funding from external donors.\n\nWhat’s more, Africa’s phenomenal population growth and pace of urbanization is bringing fresh challenges — as well as opportunities — around health and disease. In Africa’s cities today, the inhabitants of increasingly affluent neighbourhoods are demanding high-quality medicines and health care. But in low-income areas, high population density, inadequate housing and poor sanitation are facilitating the spread of respiratory and diarrhoeal infections3. And everywhere, inadequate diets, air pollution, smoking and physical inactivity are driving increased rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer4. By 2100, Africa is expected to host 13 of the world’s 20 largest cities5, and such inequalities are likely to worsen.\n\nIn the context of all these challenges, the AMA is more than just another regulatory body. It represents a test of whether Africa can claim its rightful place in shaping the science that will help to determine the health of its growing population.\n\nIf the AMA ensures that preclinical models for drug testing reflect African biology, that African genomes are woven into drug discovery from the start, and that clinical trials conducted on the continent are rigorous, it will improve the health of billions of people of African ancestry. By helping to generate a more complete picture of human genetic diversity and the links between genetic variation, disease and treatments, it will also redefine standards around drug development and clinical trials globally.\n\nDrug discovery for Africa\n\nMultiple studies spanning three decades have shown that individuals from different regions and ethnic backgrounds respond to medicines differently6. But although Africa holds around 18% of the world’s population and accounts for 25% of the global disease burden7, the continent’s genetic diversity is rarely considered in preclinical or clinical research8.\n\nAfrica: tackle HIV and COVID-19 together\n\nAfrican biomedical data sets are hugely under-represented. Only 4% of the data in the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB), a public database that provides information on the links between genes, drugs and diseases, come from individuals of African ancestry, for instance.\n\nLikewise, to test drugs, researchers globally are increasingly relying on in vitro models developed from human cells or tissues. These include 3D cell cultures called organoids that mimic the structure and function of specific organs or tissues, and liver microsomes, which are collections of subcellular fragments derived from liver cells. But most of these tools have been derived from samples obtained from individuals of European ancestry9.\n\nAnd when it comes to clinical trials, under 3% of them are conducted in Africa (see ‘Poorly represented’). A study published last year found that, between 2015 and 2023, out of tens of thousands of phase I trials (which assess the safety, side effects and optimal dosing regimen of treatments) conducted around the world, only 17 were conducted in Kenya, only 12 in Nigeria and only 3 in Ethiopia10, despite these countries being among the leaders in clinical research in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSource: WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform\n\nThe result of all of this is the development of treatments that are ineffective or even detrimental for certain African populations. A compound called efavirenz, for example, was the key ingredient of first-line antiretroviral treatment in Africa and around the world until 201811. But Zimbabwean people with HIV who harbour certain genetic polymorphisms in CYP2B6, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing efavirenz, experience numbness in their feet and other symptoms of neurotoxicity when taking the drug12.\n\nWhat’s more, diseases that disproportionately affect African populations, such as sickle-cell disease — which affects roughly 1 in 100 people living in West Africa, compared with 1 in 15,000 people living in Western Europe13 — have tended to be neglected.\n\nBoth sickle-cell disease and Parkinson’s disease contribute to about the same number of deaths globally each year, but whereas nearly 50,000 studies on Parkinson’s disease have been published in the past five years (according to a PubMed search), only around 7,800 studies on sickle-cell disease were published in the same period. (Deaths from Parkinson’s disease occur mainly in Asia, Europe and North America.)\n\nCould Africa be the future for genomics research?\n\nTo ensure that African genomic diversity — and African needs — are better embedded into all stages of drug discovery and development, the AMA must ensure that African pharmacogenomic data (genetic information that signals how individuals will respond to medications) are integrated into drug discovery. It must mandate or incentivize the use of in vitro models derived from cells or tissues obtained from individuals of African ancestry9,14. And it must incentivize drug developers to focus on interventions for diseases that disproportionately affect African populations.\n\nTo do this, the AMA should require that applicants for regulatory approval demonstrate how they have considered genetic variability relevant to African populations in preclinical and clinical trials. Variants in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene family can affect the metabolism of drugs and toxins, for instance; variants in transporter proteins can influence how drugs are absorbed by, distributed in and eliminated from the body; and some variants of some genes, such as APOL1, increase people’s risk of developing a disease. (The APOL1 variants G1 and G2 are more common in individuals of African ancestry and a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease.)\n\nThe AMA should require that investigators use models derived from cells or tissues from individuals of African ancestry in all toxicity, efficacy, drug-metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies (which examine what the body does to drugs over time) submitted to it for approval. Or, to incentivize those applying for regulatory approval to take their treatment to the next phase of testing, the agency should offer expedited review pathways or reduced application fees when preclinical studies use ‘Africa-relevant’ tools.\n\nAn educator gives a talk on reproductive health in Harare, Zimbabwe.Credit: Jekesai Njikizana/AFP via Getty\n\nIn collaboration with African research institutions and global consortia, such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public–private partnership involving the European Union and European life-science industries, the AMA should promote the creation of continent-wide pharmacogenomic databases.\n\nThrough partnering with African academic institutions, such as the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development Centre at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, and global funders, such as the Gates Foundation, the agency can help to drive the development of biobanks across Africa — facilities that collect, store and manage human biological samples. This would give more researchers across the continent access to Africa-relevant preclinical tools.\n\nUltimately, pharmaceutical companies, both in Africa and worldwide, could use these data and resources, in conjunction with artificial intelligence and other computational tools, to make predictions about how certain compounds will affect a given population. In fact, to encourage multinational drug developers to use such data sets and biorepositories, the AMA could help to ensure that open-access African data sets are interoperable with other platforms used in drug development, such as PharmGKB.\n\nHarmonizing regulation\n\nAlongside these steps to make biomedical research and drug discovery more relevant to African populations, the AMA needs to make it much easier for drug developers to conduct clinical trials on the continent.\n\nCurrently, drug developers wanting to work in Africa are hampered by insufficient or inadequate laboratories and infrastructure, a shortage of trained scientists who can run clinical trials, a lack of experts in research ethics and regulation, and variability in countries’ laws and standards around the handling of biological samples.\n\nThe AMA can help to increase the number of phase I trials being conducted in Africa by fostering partnerships between Africa-based research institutions, such as the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi, and international funders. It could also work with some of Africa’s continent-wide organizations, such as the International Vaccine Institute’s Africa Regional Office, which was established last year in Kigali, Rwanda, to boost research and development (R&D) of vaccines on the continent.\n\nTo ensure that efforts in different countries are coordinated, the agency must help to develop a central database for clinical trials conducted in Africa, perhaps building on the work of the Clinical Trials Community Africa Network. This group of African research-ethics bodies, research institutions and pharmaceutical companies is coordinating a network of clinical trial sites and laboratories to harmonize clinical trials conducted in Africa.\n\nAfrica’s rapid population growth is posing fresh health challenges.Credit: Olasunkanmi Ariyo/Getty\n\nAs a central, umbrella organization, the AMA should coordinate the reviews of applications for clinical trials and thereby facilitate the design of large-scale, multicountry phase II studies, which assess the efficacy and safety of treatments. Such studies, when conducted independently in any one country, often lack the sample sizes needed to reveal clinically meaningful differences in how genetic subpopulations differ in their response to a treatment.\n\nBy harmonizing the regulatory environment across the continent, the AMA can help to facilitate phase III clinical trials (which aim to provide evidence of therapeutic efficacy and safety in thousands of patients in multiple countries), phase IV studies (evaluations of treatments in real-world settings), and the monitoring of fake medicines, too.\n\nFive traps to avoid\n\nTo promote a healthy ecosystem for biomedical research and drug and vaccine development in Africa, the AMA must beware some of the pitfalls that have hampered efforts of other continent-wide health initiatives, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in its early years.",

Credit: Itiner-e, Artas Media, MINERVA\n\nA high-resolution digital map allows people to plan their routes along the ancient roads of the Roman Empire. Combining historical records with modern mapping techniques, researchers mapped hundreds of thousands of kilometres of roads. The findings nearly double the known length of Roman roads.\n\nThe data set was published in Scientific Data on 6 November alongside an online platform called Itiner-e, which study co-author Tom Brughmans calls a “Google Maps for Roman roads”1.\n\n“It’s a growing resource for a community to keep on adding information to ensure that this remains the best representation of our knowledge of where all the roads in the Roman Empire were,” says Brughmans, an archaeologist at Aarhus University in Denmark.\n\nBrughmans hopes the data set will “revolutionize our understanding of how people, ideas and infectious diseases” spread 2,000 years ago. “Such insights can be used to better understand the challenges we face today,” he adds.\n\nSource: itiner-e.org\nRoman Google Maps\n\nPrevious attempts to map the road networks of the Roman Empire had created incomplete data sets with low spatial resolution, and estimations for road locations rather than evidence-based reconstructions.\n\n“Although the roads are one of the best-known aspects of Roman history, it’s surprising how many details about them we still don’t know,” says Catherine Fletcher, a historian at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK.\n\nThe researchers first identified Roman roads from previous studies, including atlases, surveys, historical sources, archaeological sources and existing milestones. They then compared this information to modern and historical aerial photographs, topographical maps and satellite imagery. The team digitized each road section with a high spatial resolution, then combined the sections into Itiner-e.\n\nThe map includes nearly 300,000 kilometres of roads existing in around ad 150, when the empire was at its maximum territorial extent.\n\nHigher spatial analysis allowed the researchers to map 200,000 kilometres of secondary roads. By combining different sources, the researchers could map winding roads crossing difficult terrain with more accuracy, thereby improving on previous estimates based on unrealistic direct lines over, for example, mountain passes.\n\nThe data set also reveals that the locations of only 3% of Roman roads are known with certainty. A further 7% are considered hypothetical, because they have been identified but not precisely located or verified across sources. The remaining roads are conjectured and based on fewer documented sources.\n\n“This was a huge surprise and a sobering realization,” says Brughmans. But “that 3% certainty figure isn’t a failure; it’s a ‘call to action’ that gives us a precise confidence map of what we don’t know and where to look next”.",

          "abstract": "Chinese researchers are more likely to lead projects with the United Kingdom and countries in the European Union than with the United States. Credit: Dai Bin/Xinhua/Alamy\n\nThe number of Chinese scientists taking on leadership roles in international science projects is growing rapidly. They now lead more than half of all research projects with the United Kingdom, and are expected to lead an equal number of projects with countries in the European Union and with the United States in the next couple of years, according to a study1 published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last week.\n\nHongjun Xiang, a physicist at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, says the projections are consistent with what he has observed in the country, particularly in fields such as physics and engineering. But China needs to strengthen its leadership capabilities in disruptive basic research, “as Nobel-level original breakthroughs remain rare”, he adds.\n\nTo understand how scientific leadership is changing, researchers analysed authorship data from nearly six million scientific publications. The team analysed ‘author contribution’ statements on journal manuscripts, in which each author’s role is described. When such statements weren’t available, the team developed a model that could predict leadership roles on the basis of author experience, citation histories and the ideas researchers brought from their previous work, says James Evans, a co-author and computational sociologist at the University of Chicago in Illinois.\n\nResearchers who conceived, designed and guided the project or offered mentorship were classified as leaders; first-year students, people providing tech support and those performing experiments under direction were considered followers.\n\nFrom there, Evans and his colleagues devised two parameters to assess the changes in scientific leadership in bilateral partnerships. Lead share describes the number of people in leadership roles from a given country. Lead premium is the ratio of leaders to followers on the paper.\n\nRising leaders\n\nThe team found that China’s lead share in US–China collaborations rose from 30% in 2010 to 45% in 2023. China’s lead premium, however, is progressing more slowly. Chinese scientists still have supporting roles in many of these projects, says Evans. They are more likely to lead projects when they work with groups in the United Kingdom and EU, he adds.\n\nAccording to the research, in 2019, China’s lead share reached parity with the United Kingdom’s; it is likely to be on a par with the EU lead share by 2025–27 and the US lead share by 2027–28. In some crucial technology areas, such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors and energy, Chinese leadership is further behind and is expected to catch up to the United States by 2030.\n\nXiang says that, in the development of core technologies, such as semiconductors, the country faces significant ‘chokehold’ challenges, including the US government’s ban on selling NVIDIA AI chips to China since 2022. China’s dependency on US tech cannot be easily overcome, because it is rooted in decades of deep scientific research, says Xiang. “Addressing these structural imbalances is the key to our journey from being a big science country to a truly strong one, and continued international collaboration remains vital for this endeavour,” Xiang adds.\n\nBut Evans says the findings upend the assumption that the United States can shut China out of global scientific opportunities by not collaborating with its researchers. Some US lawmakers want restrictions on research collaborations with Chinese institutions that work with the country’s military. Simulations show that “if the US were to stop collaborating with China on projects related to critical technologies — such as space, artificial intelligence or quantum computing — it would prove to be very costly for the US”, he says.\n\nEvans says that US–China collaborations, particularly in fields such as artificial intelligence, are more likely to be successful than work done separately.\n\nCultural differences",

          "abstract": "Credit: Keystone Press/Alamy\n\nHamilton (Ham) Smith co-discovered type II restriction enzymes, molecular scissors that cut DNA at precise sequence sites, which proved to be an essential tool for the emerging field of molecular biology. For this work he shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Werner Arber and Daniel Nathans. Smith began a second career in 1993, when he agreed to collaborate with me on sequencing the genome of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. On its publication in 1995, it was the first complete genome of any organism.\n\nThat fortunate collaboration led to the first draft human genome sequence in 2001, and then to the first cell made from a synthetic genome in 2010. Smith was a scientist’s scientist, working in the laboratory almost every day and quietly being an inspiration, friend and a collaborator to all his colleagues.\n\nA wealth of discovery built on the Human Genome Project — by the numbers\n\nBorn in New York City, Smith grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, where his father was a college professor. Smith discovered biology while studying mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and went on to receive his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1956. Following his military service in the US Navy, and a medical residency at Henry Ford hospital in Detroit, Michigan, in 1962, Smith received a fellowship from the US National Institutes of Health to work with Myron Levine — a pioneer in infectious-disease research — at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Studying the bacteriophage P22, a virus that infects the bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium, he mastered DNA isolation techniques that became an essential component of all his main contributions to science.\n\nIn 1967, Smith joined the microbiology department at Johns Hopkins. Beginning work on H. influenzae, he discovered a restriction enzyme by studying changes in DNA viscosity. He used several clever techniques to prove that the enzyme recognized a unique DNA sequence, long before the advent of DNA sequencing, and published two key papers in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 1970 (H. O. Smith and K. W. Wilcox J. Mol. Biol. 51, 379–391 (1970); T. J. Kelly Jr and H. O. Smith J. Mol. Biol. 51, 393–409; 1970). His parents were driving to the grocery shop on 12 October 1978 when the news came over their car radio that Hamilton Smith at Johns Hopkins had won the Nobel prize. His mother told him that she looked at his father and said, “Do you suppose there is another Hamilton Smith at Hopkins?”\n\nIn 1993, Smith and I met at a conference in Bilbao, Spain. I had founded the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) in Rockville, Maryland, the year before and Smith agreed to join the science advisory board. At his suggestion, we decided to collaborate on sequencing the genome of H. influenzae using my idea of whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The method is dependent on achieving a perfect statistical Poisson distribution of the DNA fragments that cover the genome in a genomic sequencing library, and Smith developed techniques to achieve this. We sequenced 25,000 fragments and mathematically assembled them into the complete circular genome. After this, Smith joined TIGR and its successor firm, the J. Craig Venter Institute, where he stayed for the remaining 25 years of his career. We went on to collaborate on dozens of other genomes, including the Neisseria meningitidis genome that led to the development of the first meningococcal B vaccine that has saved thousands of lives.",

          "title": "How genetically encoded sensors have lit up neuroscience",
          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "In the nervous system, synapses are where the action is. There, across a narrow gap between adjacent cells, neurons talk to one another through the dynamic exchange of chemical and electrical signals. Molecules known as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators induce or inhibit action potentials — spikes in voltage across neuronal cell membranes that trigger the release of other molecules. This cross-talk ultimately enables the production of emotions, thoughts, behaviours — everything that makes the brain what it is.\n\nA new way to capture the brain’s electrical symphony\n\nTo decode these conversations, researchers have relied on various tools. These include electrophysiology, in which electrodes are inserted into the brain or individual cells (in the case of patch-clamp recording) to measure the voltage changes linked to action potentials; microdialysis, in which some of the fluid surrounding neurons is extracted and analysed; and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, which uses implanted electrodes to detect certain signalling molecules.\n\nBut these methods have limitations. For instance, electrophysiology can precisely measure action potentials, but scientists can’t pinpoint the exact neurotransmitters or neuromodulators (collectively called neurochemicals) that drive them. Microdialysis can identify specific molecules, but it lacks the spatial and temporal resolution to pinpoint exactly when and where these neurochemicals are released, and voltammetry often struggles to distinguish molecules that are similar to each other.\n\nThe development of genetically encoded sensors over the past two decades has offered a way for neuroscientists to circumvent these issues. Such sensors were initially developed to identify action potentials in cells by tracking changes in calcium ions, but in recent years, researchers have expanded the toolbox to detect key neurochemicals.\n\nThe next generation of these sensors now enables scientists to ask questions such as: how much of a specific neurochemical is released in response to the firing of an action potential? How many action potentials are required to release a given neurochemical? And how long does that molecule stick around? “All these kinds of questions, for the vast majority of molecules — we’re talking about dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and many others — we know virtually nothing about,” says Nicolas Tritsch, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. “This new class of genetically encoded sensors has really opened up this world.”\n\nLighting up cells\n\nThe revolution in genetically encoded neurochemical sensing began with calcium. Action potentials activate specialized channel proteins on the neuron’s cell membrane and allow calcium to enter, changing the calcium concentration. By fusing the calcium-binding protein calmodulin with a fluorescent protein and genetically targeting the hybrid molecule to specific populations of cells, researchers have developed sensors that light up in response to calcium fluctuations — a proxy for neuronal activity.\n\nOne popular variety of genetically encoded calcium indicators, known as GCaMPs, has been around since 2001. Researchers have since optimized the sensors’ speed and sensitivity — and they are now mainstays of neuroscience research. “They’re so ubiquitous that most papers that use GCaMPs stopped citing the relevant papers,” says Loren Looger, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), whose team has been developing these sensors.\n\nGenetically encoded sensors offer several advantages (see ‘Tracking neurochemicals’). Researchers can express them at specific times in particular cells, then pair them with techniques such as optogenetics to cause them to fire in response to light. But they also require genetic manipulation and might change the biology of cells in unexpected ways.\n\nSources: GCaMP: Y. Yang et al. Ann. Rev. Anal. Chem. 17, 367–392 (2024); PBP & GPCR: Z. Wu et al. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 23, 257–274 (2022)\n\nStill, the success of these sensors motivated many tool developers, including Looger, to dream up similar strategies for detecting other neurochemicals. Among them are neurotransmitters such as glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine — which activate or inhibit nerve cells — and neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin and endocannabinoids, which trigger molecular pathways in the brain1.\n\nIn 2018, two papers2,3 published just weeks apart by teams in the United States and China independently described GCaMP-like sensors for dopamine, a neuromodulator involved in reward-based decision-making, learning and many other processes.\n\nDubbed dLight1 and GRAB-DA, respectively, both teams’ sensors were built on the dopamine receptor, one of a family of proteins known as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The teams, led by neuroscientist Lin Tian, then at the University of California, Davis, and by Yulong Li, a neuroscientist at Peking University in Beijing, modified the receptor to fluoresce in the presence of dopamine and inserted that gene into a virus. Researchers could then inject the sensors into a living animal and observe the activity of specific molecules in infected cells in the brain using fibre photometry, a technique that measures changes in fluorescence using an optical fibre implanted in the brain.\n\nHow to keep the lights on: the mission to make more photostable fluorophores\n\nThese sensors quickly became popular additions to the neuroscience toolkit, and the papers have been cited more than 800 times apiece. In part, says Mark Walton, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, their popularity is due to their ease of use. Conventional methods can be difficult to master — voltammetry, in particular, “is a bit of a black art”, he says. But with genetically encoded sensors, “we’ve never looked back”. Among other things, Walton and his team have used them to investigate dopamine fluctuations in almost 200,000 tests in mice, revealing that, contrary to previous results from conventional approaches, reward-based decision-making can happen independently of dopamine4.\n\nAnother benefit of GPCR-based sensors is their generalizability, with a design that has now been extended to receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin and endocannabinoids. “Those initial dopamine sensors and their subsequently optimized variants have been transformative,” says Matthew Banghart, a neuroscientist at UCSD. “It’s so easy to implement, and the sky’s the limit in terms of being able to apply this approach to any GPCR of interest.”\n\nEnabling discoveries\n\nThese sensors have begun to fundamentally shift our understanding of how neurotransmitters and neuromodulators work. Take dopamine, for instance. Although scientists have long known what it does, how exactly it transmits information in the brain has remained a mystery.\n\nAs a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in the late 2010s, Arif Hamid wanted to understand how dopamine fluctuates in the brain. One leading hypothesis at the time was that, when dopamine neurons were activated, the neuromodulator would be released across the brain uniformly. But when Hamid and his colleagues used the dLight sensor to track the molecule’s movements in the striatum of mouse brains — a region that contains many dopamine-responsive neurons — they discovered instead that the neuromodulator was released in waves5. “We were completely floored,” says Hamid, who is now a neuroscientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “It really defied our expectations.”\n\nGenetic light bulbs illuminate the brain\n\nTritsch and his team have found that acetylcholine, too, propagates in waves across the striatum. Using two-colour imaging in live mice with GRAB-DA-based sensors for both acetylcholine and dopamine, the researchers reported in 2023 that, rather than there being a stable, baseline concentration of the two molecules, their levels fluctuate with sub-second kinetics6. “We found signatures of dopamine and acetylcholine on timescales that are much, much faster than we thought was possible,” Tritsch says. “Our next step is to see how that’s influencing the brain on these timescales.”\n\nThe sensors are also revealing the secrets of other important neurochemicals. In 2021, a team led by researchers in California and Canada used a GRAB-based sensor to study endocannabinoid signalling in the mouse brain7. And earlier this year, another team used a GPCR sensor, called ntsLight1.1, that responds to the neuropeptide neurotensin, which is involved in feeding behaviour. The aim was to study what drives mice that are fed purely a high-fat diet to start avoiding calorie-rich foods8. Among other things, that analysis implicated a decline in neurotensin levels in a brain region linked with dopamine signalling as a possible cause.\n\nAnd it’s not only in basic neurobiology that these sensors show promise. For instance, Tian, who is now at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience in Jupiter, Florida, and her team have found a use that could help to develop treatments for anxiety. They showed that a sensor targeting neurons affected by the psychedelic drug 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine can be used to identify other cells that contribute to the drug’s anxiety-reducing effects in mice without producing hallucinogenic effects9. That’s a finding that could support the development of future psychedelics that could have therapeutic benefits without the mind-bending side-effects, the study authors write.\n\nMixed signals\n\nGenetically encoded sensors do have some important caveats, however.\n\nOne key consideration is how these proteins affect the biology of the cells in which they are expressed. Like most proteins, excessive expression can be toxic to neurons, so identifying the best concentration at which to use a sensor is paramount, says Tritsch. “With every batch, we need to know how much to dilute so we can see it, but so it’s not too much that it kills the neurons.”\n\nWhy this happens is an open question, but Tritsch and others suggest two possibilities: The GPCRs could be siphoning off molecules that are required for healthy neuronal functioning, or their overexpression could be overextending the cellular machinery required to build these molecules and deliver them to the membrane.",

Foreign researchers who have graduated from ‘famous’ universities or institutes in China or abroad with a bachelor-or-higher degree in STEM will be eligible to apply. That also includes people who teach or research STEM topics in such organizations.\n\nA ‘big step forward’\n\nThe visa is designed to help the country boost its competitiveness in areas that it deems important for its future, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and new materials, says Yuen Yuen Ang, a political economist at Johns Hopkins University in in Baltimore, Maryland. As the US government cuts back on its support for science, Chinese leaders see an opportunity to attract the best foreign scientists, particularly those working in fundamental research, Ang says.\n\nLu Fengming, a political economist at the Australian National University in Canberra, says it is a big step for the Chinese government to allow scientists to move to the country without a job offer. Sponsorship is needed for most other Chinese visa types, Lu says. The visa is a smart move given China’s desire to attract global talent, he adds.\n\nThe country’s immigration figures are relatively low compared with those of other leading science nations. In 2023, only 0.05% of China’s overall population were foreigners, compared with 4.9% in South Korea and 14.3% in the United States, according to an analysis by Direct HR, a recruitment firm based in Shanghai. It is unclear how many of them work in STEM, but some estimates show that China has 5,000–10,000 foreign researchers with a PhD, compared with at least 100,000 foreign scholars at this level in the United States.\n\nHowever, the United States is now restricting some immigration. In late September, the administration of President Donald Trump imposed a US$100,000 fee on applications for an H-1B visa, which many foreign STEM researchers rely on to live in the country.\n\n“While the US seemed to be raising barriers, China sent a strong counter-signal that it was opening its doors,” says Changhee Kim, a human-resource researcher at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China.\n\nBut Wang Zichen, a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank based in Beijing, says China did not launch the K visa on a whim. He notes that the government called for “more proactive, open and effective talent policies” as early as 2022.\n\nChallenges ahead",

          "title": "The computers that run on human brain cells",
          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "In a town on the shores of Lake Geneva sit clumps of living human brain cells for hire. These blobs, about the size of a grain of sand, can receive electrical signals and respond to them — much as computers do. Research teams from around the world can send the blobs tasks, in the hope that they will process the information and send a signal back.\n\nWelcome to the world of wetware, or biocomputers. In a handful of academic laboratories and companies, researchers are growing human neurons and trying to turn them into functional systems equivalent to biological transistors. These networks of neurons, they argue, could one day offer the power of a supercomputer without the outsized power consumption.\n\nCan lab-grown brains become conscious?\n\nThe results so far are limited. But keen scientists are already buying or borrowing online access to these brain-cell processors — or even investing tens of thousands of dollars to secure their own models.\n\nSome want to use these biocomputers as straightforward replacements for ordinary computers, whereas others want to use them to study how brains work. “Trying to understand biological intelligence is a very interesting scientific problem,” says Benjamin Ward-Cherrier, a robotics researcher at the University of Bristol, UK, who rents time on the Swiss brain blobs. “And looking at it from the bottom up — with simple small versions of our brain and building those up — I think is a better way of doing it than top down.”\n\nBiocomputing advocates claim that these systems could one day rival the capability of artificial intelligence and the potential of quantum computers.\n\nOther researchers who work with human neurons are more sceptical of what’s possible. And they warn that hype — and the science-fictional allure of what are sometimes labelled brain-in-a-jar systems — could even be counterproductive. If the idea that these systems possess sentience and consciousness takes hold, there could be repercussions for the research community.\n\n“I’m nervous that, if this kind of work gets a lot of attention and is overstated, that the reaction won’t just be, ‘We need to think about this work a little more carefully’. It will be, ‘We need to stop this work entirely,’” says Madeline Lancaster, a developmental biologist who uses neural tissue to study development and disease at the University of Cambridge, UK, but is not involved in biocomputing projects. “That could bring in regulations that prevent all work, including on the side of the field that’s really doing research to try to help people.”\n\nPower down\n\nComputer scientists have long coveted the astonishing power efficiency of the human brain. Running on less than 20 watts — about enough to work a small desktop fan — its billions of neurons can spin through the equivalent of one billion billion mathematical operations each second. The best supercomputers can match that speed, but consume a million times more power in doing so.\n\nSome researchers are trying to replicate the super-efficient structure of the brain using silicon chips. This approach, broadly called neuromorphic computing, takes inspiration from how neurons connect and fire to communicate. Specifically, some systems seek to mimic how neurons must charge to a threshold before firing an electrical impulse.\n\nBiocomputing, on the other hand, goes back to the biological source material. Starting with induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which can be reprogrammed to become almost any type of cell, researchers culture communities of brain cells and nurture them with nutrients and growth factors. To communicate with them, researchers sit the cells on electrode arrays, then pass signals and commands to them as sequences of electrical pulses. These signals change the way that ions flow into and out of neurons, and might prompt some cells to fire an electrical impulse known as an action potential. The biocomputer electrodes can detect these signals and employ algorithms to convert them to usable information.\n\nNeurons in a dish learn to play Pong — what’s next?\n\nThe most common biocomputing approach cultures the neurons as 3D clusters called organoids. The composition of these brain-cell communities varies, depending on how the iPS cells differentiate, but typically includes neurons and cells that support them, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.\n\nIn August, Ward-Cherrier and his colleagues reported1 using human brain organoids of around 10,000 neurons to ‘recognize’ Braille letters. They first used a robot fitted with a tactile sensor to read the letters, and then converted the data collected for each letter into a distinct pattern of electrical pulses — varying the timing and intensity, for example — which they passed through a series of eight electrodes placed next to the surface of the organoid. These electrodes record the collective activity of many nearby neurons.\n\nThe researchers wanted to learn whether the patterns of firing in the organoid were different depending on the stimulation pattern it received, and whether those responses were consistent.\n\nFor each letter, they collected the response from each electrode, averaged them to yield an overall organoid output, and used machine learning to identify any patterns.\n\nThe results showed that, when fed electrical pulses corresponding to specific letters, a single organoid would produce the same characteristic response 61% of the time, on average. When responses from three organoids were combined, that went up to 83%. In other words, the organoids could perform a simple processing task: to distinguish between and identify inputs.\n\nFor Ward-Cherrier, it’s a solid proof of principle. “It is an initial kind of stab at showing that we can do these types of tasks. The next step is doing something a little bit more complex.” That could include interpreting messages from the cultured cells as instructions for the robot — to read the letter again, for example. Such abilities define what researchers call closed-loop-systems, which have not yet been demonstrated with human brain organoids — although a 2024 study2 reported that such a system, made of mouse neuronal organoids, could play Cartpole, a computer game in which the aim is to keep a wobbly pole upright on a moving cart.\n\nBecause the inputs and outputs in cultured systems are simple electrical signals, it’s easy to offer remote access to organoids through the web. So, even though the Braille-reading robot is based in Ward-Cherrier’s lab in Bristol, the organoids are grown and housed at the company FinalSpark, in Vevey, Switzerland.\n\nDevices containing tiny clumps of human brain cells sit inside a fridge at FinalSpark in Vevey, Switzerland.Credit: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty\n\nA self-confessed fan of science fiction, FinalSpark co-founder Fred Jordan says he wants to develop systems of biological neurons that can “perform some similar things as are done with AI today”.\n\nThere is a long way to go. As computers, the organoid systems are currently “totally useless from a practical perspective”, he admits. “There is a very big difference between dreaming or thinking about something and doing it for real. And I would love to be one of those people who make this step.”\n\nSelected academic groups, such as Ward Cherrier’s, get free access to FinalSpark organoids, and many teams have signed up for this. A team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, for example, is testing different types of stimulation to see how the organoids behave, and researchers at the Free University of Berlin are focusing on how machine-learning tools can best extract information from neural firing patterns.\n\nFor clients with deeper pockets, including private companies, monthly fees of US$5,000 can secure exclusive online access to an organoid system. And plenty do. “We have very, very big companies active in individual fields that you would think are disconnected to this,” Jordan says. Unlike with the free work done by academic groups, FinalSpark does not know what paying customers use the organoids for.\n\nOther independent groups with organoid expertise are jumping into biocomputing. The neural organoids in Alysson Muotri’s lab at the University of California, San Diego, each contain about 2.5 million neurons of various types. Muotri aims to apply organoids to a real-world problem: predicting the path of possible oil spills in the Amazon jungle. The project, financed by an oil company, is due to conclude by 2028. “We’re taking the challenge,” he says. “We’ll see where we are in three years.”\n\nTraining ground\n\nFor many organoid users trying to run more-complex tasks, one immediate aim is to find ways to train the neurons and thereby encourage goal-directed behaviour. At present, the responses from FinalSpark’s lab-grown organoids have more in common with the reflex actions of the peripheral nervous system — when someone’s leg kicks in response to a tap below the knee, for example — than with the malleable processes that guide decision-making in the brain.\n\nTo handle more complexity, these neural systems must be able to learn. One way to encourage that, Jordan says, is to deliver neurotransmitters such as dopamine to try to tune the organoids’ responses to particular stimuli. Dopamine makes neurons more likely to fire and strengthens the synapses that connect them — two changes that make the same neural response to a stimulus more likely to be repeated in future.\n\nAnother is a technique called pattern training stimulation, which was used in 2022 by researchers at Cortical Labs, a company based in Melbourne, Australia, to encourage lab-grown brain cells to play the 1970s computer game Pong3.\n\nRather than working with organoids, they chose to create networks of cells in dishes (see ‘Computing with cells’). Then the researchers wired them up to a computer, which was programmed so that the response of the neurons to stimulation moved a virtual paddle while a virtual ball bounced around. To direct the paddle towards the ball, the researchers fed the neurons with an organized burst of electrical activity if the cells (at first, randomly) got it right. If the neurons moved the paddle in the wrong direction, they were blasted with chaotic white noise. Over time, the neurons learnt to hit the ball to receive the patterned response rather than the random one.\n\nThe strategy is drawn from the observation that brain cells tend to repeat activity that yields a predictable outcome, so will learn the kinds of behaviour that trigger familiar stimulation.\n\nCortical Labs has now developed a modular system that can link increasing numbers of individual wells, each containing at most 1,000 neurons, to form what the company calls a bioengineered intelligence. Each cell culture has a useful life of about six months before it must be replaced.",

Previous research in this area has suggested that speaking multiple languages can improve cognitive functions such memory and attention2, which boosts brain health as we get older. But many of these studies rely on small sample sizes and use unreliable methods of measuring ageing, which leads to results that are inconsistent and not generalizable.\n\n“The effects of multilingualism on ageing have always been controversial, but I don’t think there has been a study of this scale before, which seems to demonstrate them quite decisively,” says Christos Pliatsikas, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Reading, UK.

Therapies are being designed to reduce the severity of infections such as bird flu, and cure HIV and other chronic conditions. Synthetic antibodies could also make vaccines for diseases such as COVID-19 more effective.\n\nAntibodies are part of the immune system’s defence against infection. Scientists produce synthetic versions by combining B cells from mice and human cell lines. Most approved antibody drugs are for cancers and autoimmune diseases.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are also widely used in antiviral therapies to treat severe infections caused by Ebola, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2, says Runhong Zhou, who studies immune responses at Hong Kong University. But past efforts to develop antivirals for avian influenza have not been as successful because the virus undergoes mutations that make treatment less effective, he adds. Antibody drugs for COVID-19 have also become less effective over time for the same reason.\n\nBird flu treatment\n\nFor H5N1 avian influenza, Zhou and his colleagues have developed an antibody that has two targets: the stem region of proteins on the surface of the virus and receptors on a person’s cells. In cell-based experiments, they found that the antibody neutralized multiple live strains of the bird flu virus and was superior to a model monoclonal antibody — which targets only one specific antigen — at stopping viral particles from attaching to or entering cells. Their results suggest that targeting the virus stem and host receptors at the same time “is a good strategy to enhance antibody efficacy”, Zhou says, who was among the teams presenting their findings in this field at the Pandemic Research Alliance International Symposium in Melbourne last week. But it is still unclear how long the protection will last, or whether antibody treatment can induce mutations in the virus that allow it to evade the immune system.\n\nHsiang Hong, a medical student at Columbia University in New York City, is also part of a team using antibodies for H5N1. He says that he and his colleagues are developing a panel of monoclonal antibodies that target multiple parts of the H5N1 virus to track how it evolves over time and identify potential treatments that can target several variants of the virus.\n\nA helping hand\n\nAntibodies could also boost the efficacy of other treatments, such as vaccines, which need to be updated because most viruses mutate frequently as they evolve.\n\nZhiwei Chen, an immunology researcher at the University of Hong Kong, says antibodies that can bind to highly conserved parts of SARS-CoV-2 could help vaccines to stay effective even as the virus mutates. Chen and his team have identified several areas of the SARS-CoV-2 particle surface that do not change when the virus undergoes mutation. They have also found that several antibodies that target these highly conserved areas were effective at neutralizing different coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, variants of SARS-CoV-2 and some coronaviruses found in pangolins and bats.",

          "authors": "Anna McKie",
          "abstract": "In her work for the documentary Shadow Scholars, Patricia Kingori visited Kenya to meet academic ghostwriters.Credit: Anna Patarakina\n\nFour years ago, Patricia Kingori became one of the youngest women, and the youngest Black person, to be awarded a full professorship at the University of Oxford, UK. Her research as a sociologist focuses on understanding, exploring and documenting different forms of ethics and power in health, medicine and science.\n\nHer latest project, The Shadow Scholars, is a 138-minute documentary directed by Eloise King and executive-produced by 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen. It investigates a hidden multibillion-dollar industry: contract cheating. Kingori traces how students in the wealthy, industrialized countries of the global north outsource coursework to “shadow scholars” in Nairobi. An estimated 40,000 highly educated but underemployed young people ghostwrite everything from undergraduate essays to master’s dissertations and PhD theses, often producing several essays every day, with tight turnarounds. Kenya, where Kingori undertook doctoral research until political unrest forced her and her family to leave in 2007, is a hub for this global market. Surveys suggest that more than 70% of its online freelance workforce is engaged in ‘writing and translation’, which Kingori discovered is an oblique way of referring to fake-essay writing.\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon: a 2018 paper estimated that at least one in seven graduates worldwide have used such services1. The UK, Irish and Australian governments, plus some US and Indian states, have taken steps to outlaw advertising by commercial ‘essay mills’. But despite such moves, demand continues to grow. Kingori’s film explores the issue by going to the writers themselves.\n\nIn the documentary, Kingori also discusses her personal experience of having someone else take credit for her work. By sharing her story, she acknowledges that Kenya’s ghostwriters are just one small part of a “much bigger, systemic issue around the value of ideas, value of people, where knowledge comes from, who gets invited into spaces, who is removed”.\n\nWhat was your journey into academia?\n\nI grew up as a teen in a single-parent household in west London, after moving around a lot when I was younger, and was always really interested in how the world works. I stumbled across sociology and loved it, because it takes the ordinary and shows how extraordinary it really is, holding a mirror up to us as a society.\n\nI did my bachelor’s degree and my master’s at Royal Holloway, University of London. The latter was in medical sociology, exploring how social factors shape health and illness. I then worked for a few years as a research assistant before starting my PhD.\n\nTowards the end of my doctorate, I met Michael Parker, director of the bioethics Ethox Centre at the University of Oxford, at a conference. He was extremely supportive and encouraged me to stay in academia, at a time when I was ready to leave.\n\nHow did you become interested in the work of shadow scholars in Kenya?\n\nIn 2019, I went to an open meeting at the Oxford Internet Institute, a multidisciplinary department that researches digital technologies. The topic was the iLabour project, which looks at how people use the Internet for work. Kenya was listed as a hotspot for ‘writing and translation’, which turned out to be a euphemism for the fake-essay industry. I have a Kenyan background and, at the time, I was working on fakes and fabrications — my research into data fabrication in clinical trials had sparked an interest in fakes more generally — so I was intrigued. The Online Labour Index, an economic indicator produced by the Oxford Internet Institute, had lots of figures but little information on the people behind them.\n\nWas it difficult to get the shadow scholars to speak to you?\n\nNot at all. They were champing at the bit. They wanted the world to know they exist, because they are proud of their work, even if it is uncredited. Many said they liked seeing their writing used in real dissertations and articles (often for lofty institutions), even under someone else’s name. The challenge wasn’t persuading them to talk, but deciding whose stories to include.\n\nWhat was your biggest surprise from this work?\n\nThe way in which power makes certain people invisible, and how long that’s been going on for. During our research, we were put in touch with Anne Manuel, the now-retired librarian at Somerville College at the University of Oxford. She recalled an oral history about Patricia Owtram, a Somerville student in the 1950s who is now 102. Owtram’s BLitt thesis had been taken in 1959 and published under the name of her supervisor in a scholarly publication, but in 2023 Somerville College was able to give it back to her with her own name on it. Shadow scholars have always existed: women, migrants, others excluded from mainstream academia.\n\nWhat also surprised me was how prejudice shapes assumptions. Tell people that one-quarter of a class had used a shadow scholar, and almost everyone will make an incorrect assumption about who has cheated.\n\nWhat can we learn from the shadow scholars?\n\nThey can teach us a lot about dealing with pressure, deadlines and writer’s block — in the same way that we look to sports psychology for lessons in performance.\n\nWe can learn a lot about how misconceptions and bias shape our understanding of expertise. When people actually accept that contract cheating exists, they imagine it’s out-of-work academics in the United Kingdom or the United States who are writing the articles. They can’t picture that it’s actually young, bright Africans in Kenya who might never have left the country, and yet have the skills to write PhD-level work. Their contribution is real, but long-standing assumptions about where knowledge is produced make it almost invisible.\n\nWhat do you think it says about higher education in the global north and global south?\n\nOne of the things that really surprised me was the empathy that the Kenyan writers had for students in the global north. I thought they might say, “Oh, those lazy so-and-sos,” but actually they felt we’ve all been sold the same broken social contract: work hard, study hard and everything will be yours. But that dream hasn’t materialized.\n\nIn the United States, especially — which accounts for a majority of the essay writers’ business — students are managing huge debts, working alongside their studies and scrambling for internships just to stay afloat. In Kenya, restrictions on visas for travel to places such as the United Kingdom and Australia, together with low wages, make it hard to leave the country, so education is no longer seen as a passport to a prosperous future.\n\nWhat are the biggest hurdles to tackling contract cheating?",

          "abstract": "Nataliya Shakhovska hopes to develop strong connections with European institutions.Credit: Nataliya Shakhovska\n\nOne of Ukraine’s largest universities inaugurated its first female rector in May. Now, Nataliya Shakhovska is steering Lviv Polytechnic National University’s 35,000 students and 2,500 academic staff members through the fourth year of the Russian invasion, on top of her research on artificial intelligence.\n\nGlobal geopolitics should not stall science — 5 ways to push back\n\nShakhovska told Nature how she keeps going and how she’s trying to build up her university to be ‘the best in Europe’.\n\nHow do you feel about being the university’s first female rector?\n\nThis is incredible. It signals that leadership can and should reflect academic diversity and that the most important criterion is qualification, not gender. And it is a trend across Ukraine. In the past year, women have also won leadership elections at the Kyiv Aviation Institute and the Vasyl Stefanyk Carpathian National University in Ivano-Frankivsk.\n\nIn our society, mothers and women have strong roles. The war is a crisis and maybe there is a feeling that a woman can protect us.\n\nYou want your university to lead in Europe. How will you achieve that?\n\nYes, I believe in the transformative power of ambition. Moreover, Ukrainian universities have long been underestimated. Our intellectual resilience, especially in times of crisis, is extraordinary. In my mind, the best university is the one that is the best place for people. We’re not just talking about rankings but about the feeling that ‘I like to spend my time here, not only for work or education, but also because this is a good place for me’.\n\n‘Education is possible in any situation’ — what I’ve learnt from teaching in Kyiv amid a war\n\nBrain drain is a problem in Ukraine. That’s why it is important to show our young people that they can and must stay in the country, not only for education but also for their future careers and to rebuild it.\n\nWe need sustained investment in research infrastructure. We need new laboratories and — importantly — deeper international partnerships. We need a culture that rewards innovation and inter-disciplinary thinking. But above all, we need to trust it’s possible, and act accordingly.\n\nYour university was bombed in July. What were the consequences?\n\nThe event was not just about the damaging of labs and classrooms: those can be rebuilt. It was about the emotional trauma to students and staff members. And it was about the mobilization of students and staff. Our community understands that we must rebuild, we must continue our work, we must continue our studying. Universities are not only the buildings: they are first of all the people.\n\nHow have you kept the community together and motivated?\n\nWe are replacing all of the damaged windows. We have raised funds from our partner companies to repair our labs. And for our community, we organized a psychological-support group for students and academics.\n\nWe have had to think about a trauma- informed educational model. We are a huge university and it is difficult to know whether any particular student is affected by trauma. We have a psychological-support centre for our students. It is busy all the time.\n\nResearchers at Lviv Polytechnic National University in Ukraine are developing hydrogel bandages for treating people with burns and other wounds.Credit: Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nWe are also holding a lot of motivational lectures — about new possibilities and time management — and meetings with successful people, not only Ukrainian professors, but also international ones. We organize workshops and courses on non-academic topics for students.\n\nI think these measures are working. Our academic staff members are highly motivated: they want to create something new.\n\nThe war has forced your university to innovate — how so?\n\nConventional education is about lectures, about labs, about practical issues. But having to deal with trauma as well as problems such as access to electricity and materials, it is important that we have a flexible model for our students and staff members.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nThat’s why we first reviewed our educational facilities. We are currently focusing on opening co-working zones where students and staff members can spend their free time and do their work, and on 24-hour lab access for everyone. In the AI department, students can now access the lab at any time.\n\nAnd we try to organize ways for our staff members to connect with our international partners. This is one of the most important parts of our strategy. And it is not about emergency support. It is about long-term integration into European research frameworks. This is, I think, the most important innovation.\n\nTo what extent has your university’s research pivoted during the war?\n\nBecause our economy is working on post-war recovery scenarios, we are having a radical reorganization of research agendas to support this. It is not about publishing papers: we are helping to rebuild the country. We have a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nThe most important thing for Ukraine now is the development of technologies, for example, drone systems and energy resilience. For instance, one project is upcycling bomb-damaged concrete into high-quality concrete for reconstruction. It’s funded by the UK government’s InnovateUkraine programme; our engineers have trained using equipment from the University of Leeds, and a mobile rubble-processing line has begun trials near Kyiv. The benefits include carbon dioxide savings, lower construction costs and simpler logistics for reconstruction.\n\nYour output of scientific papers is prolific. How do you manage this?",

          "abstract": "People protested staff cuts at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March.Credit: Elijah Nouvelage/Getty\n\nIn the nine months since anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr stepped in as US health secretary, all eyes have been on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency tasked with protecting the health of Americans and which Kennedy had referred to before his appointment as a “cesspool of corruption”. In June, members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an expert panel that makes recommendations on what vaccines should be considered safe and effective for Americans were dismissed and replaced with new advisers, most of whom have expressed anti-vaccine views. As a result, access to vaccines against COVID-19, seasonal influenza and measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, among others, has begun to erode.\n\nMichael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, understood the threat these changes posed to public health and thought that he might be in a position to try and limit the damage. Osterholm directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), a group focused on providing scientific evidence to inform public-health policy. In April, the centre launched the Vaccine Integrity Project (VIP), an initiative aimed at presenting science-based evidence on vaccine safety and efficacy.\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?\n\nIts first move was to convene specialists from across the US vaccine ecosystem to explore how a non-governmental group could help. The most pressing issue, they concluded, was to take up part of the work once done by the ACIP. In July, with respiratory-virus season looming, the VIP jumped into a rapid review of the data on seasonal vaccines for influenza, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to inform recommendations. And it is now analysing data on the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose, which has been recommended to nearly all infants born in the US since the early 1990s. Even though the strategy has helped to keep hepatitis B under control, the current ACIP has decided to re-examine it.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC says that “ACIP remains the nation‘s scientific compass for immunization policy”. They add that CDC is not limiting access to vaccines, but “returning decision-making power to the American people.”\n\nCIDRAP has also announced plans to publish health alerts modelled on the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), a long-running public health-bulletin. The centre’s efforts have attracted former CDC officials, including former director Rochelle Walensky. The moves have led to some speculation that CIDRAP is evolving into a sort of shadow CDC that provides public-health guidance in the vacuum created by the overhaul of ACIP and massive layoffs at the agency. Osterholm dismisses this: “No one could replace the CDC,” he says.\n\nWhat has the VIP accomplished so far?\n\nWe were particularly concerned about the seasonal viral pathogen vaccines — influenza, coronavirus and RSV. So, we launched in early July what some said was an impossible task. We took a protocol-based approach to reviewing those vaccines, similar to what the ACIP would do. And from early July until late October, when the final product was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)1, we have been continuing to provide information to medical societies of what would be the scientific basis for them to make vaccine recommendations.\n\nOur next stop right now is a review of hepatitis B vaccine, and we’re really focusing on the importance of the infant first dose.",

          "abstract": "This week, as world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), once again it seems that there will be more rhetoric than real solutions for the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate.\n\nMy native Belize — with its tropical rainforests, coastal wetlands and coral reefs — is one such country. Warming seas are killing our reefs. Hurricanes and wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity.\n\n‘Almost utopian’: how protecting the environment is boosting the economy in Brazil\n\nAs a biologist with two decades of experience in academia and conservation, I have learnt that, to protect natural resources, local communities must bey empowered to steward these efforts — and that women are often best placed to drive them, at least in Latin America and the Caribbean, but probably everywhere.\n\nIn many cultures, women are the de facto main carers and custodians of community knowledge. They are often in positions, paid or otherwise, to make their communities healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful — making them well-suited to lead climate action and conservation work.\n\nI am the managing director of the Belize Maya Forest Trust, a non-profit organization dedicated to conserving nearly 1,000 square kilometres of the country’s tropical forest. I also chair the board of directors of the Belize Network of NGOs, an umbrella organization for many of the more than 100 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the country. In Belize, many prominent conservation organizations are led by women. Take the Community Baboon Sanctuary, a globally recognized conservation effort that protects the habitat of the Yucatán black-howler monkey (Alouatta pigra). Today, the sanctuary is managed by the Community Baboon Sanctuary Women’s Conservation Group, which is directed by women from seven Belizean villages.\n\nAnd over the past five years, working with the government of Belize and The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, women in Belize have had key roles in the execution of game-changing sustainable-financing initiatives. One is Belize’s first large-scale project to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation, which is helping to protect the Belize Maya Forest, an area that includes some of the world’s most biodiversity-rich lands. Another is Belize Blue Bonds — which, when the deal closed in November 2021, was the world’s largest debt-refinancing scheme for ocean conservation.\n\nThe more I participate in advocacy and interact with civil-society organizations — both in Belize and internationally — the more I find myself in rooms full of women striving to protect the environment and defend human rights.\n\nBut I have also noticed that women are not usually negotiating for funds, deciding whether to launch large initiatives or setting national priorities.\n\nIs it time to give up trying to save coral reefs? My research says no\n\nBelize is again a case in point. In any of the ten elections since Belize gained independence in 1981, at most four women have been elected to the 28–31-member House of Representatives, the most powerful arm of the country’s legislature. Other female parliamentarians have been appointed by the prime minister, but these positions tend to have much less authority than do those elected through popular vote. Also, female ministers are usually put in charge of human or rural-development issues, rather than the country’s economy, land, infrastructure or defence.\n\nFor countries to build resilience and protect their biodiversity in the time needed, more women must be made equal partners in decision making.",

          "abstract": "Reading a person’s mind using a recording of their brain activity sounds futuristic, but it’s now one step closer to reality. A technique called ‘mind captioning’ generates descriptive sentences of what a person is seeing or picturing in their mind using a read-out of their brain activity, with impressive accuracy.\n\nThe technique, described in a paper published today in Science Advances1, also offers clues for how the brain represents the world before thoughts are put into words. And it might be able to help people with language difficulties, such as those caused by strokes, to better communicate.\n\nThe model predicts what a person is looking at “with a lot of detail”, says Alex Huth, a computational neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley. “This is hard to do. It’s surprising you can get that much detail.”\n\nScan and predict\n\nResearchers have been able to accurately predict what a person is seeing or hearing using their brain activity for more than a decade. But decoding the brain’s interpretation of complex content, such as short videos or abstract shapes, has proved more difficult.\n\nPrevious attempts have identified only key words that describe what a person saw rather than the complete context, which might include the subject of a video and actions that occur in it, says Tomoyasu Horikawa, a computational neuroscientist at NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Kanagawa, Japan. Other attempts have used artificial intelligence (AI) models that can create sentence structure themselves, making it difficult to know whether the description was actually represented in the brain, he adds.\n\nHorikawa’s method first used a deep-language AI model to analyse the text captions of more than 2,000 videos, turning each one into a unique numerical ‘meaning signature’. A separate AI tool was then trained on six participants’ brain scans and learnt to find the brain-activity patterns that matched each meaning signature while the participants watched the videos.\n\nThe rise of brain-reading technology: what you need to know\n\nOnce trained, this brain decoder could read a new brain scan from a person watching a video and predict the meaning signature. Then, a different AI text generator would search for a sentence that comes closest to the meaning signature decoded from the individual’s brain.",

Chamois were rare then; the desire to learn about and protect them inspired me to become a biologist. Over the past 25 years, their population in my study area — the Northern Pindos National Park — has grown drastically, mainly thanks to a ‘human shield’ effect created by hikers visiting the upper parts of the Northern Pindos mountain range: their presence has made poaching more difficult.\n\nNow, I can easily see dozens of Balkan chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica) just a few hours from my village. In this picture, I’m counting them on the ledges of a cliff, one of their favourite habitats. We think that there are now around 1,000 individuals in the national park and nearby mountain ranges.\n\nStudying chamois requires the skills of a mountaineer and a scientist’s precision. My colleagues and I have built a habitat suitability model, based on elevation, vegetation, slope and human activity, and are testing it by checking for chamois presence in areas across northern and central Greece.

          "abstract": "Positive Tipping Points: How to Fix the Climate Crisis Tim Lenton Oxford Univ. Press (2025)\n\nEarth-systems scientist Tim Lenton has long been emphasizing the importance of ‘tipping points’ for climate change. In a seminal paper published in 2008, he and his co-authors identified several elements of Earth’s climate system that might shift to a different state irreversibly once physical thresholds are crossed (T. M. Lenton et al. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 105, 1786–1793; 2008). For example, the Greenland ice sheet, the Amazon rainforest and circulation patterns in the Atlantic Ocean could change suddenly as the world warms.\n\nThe race to uncover snow’s many mysteries before it disappears forever\n\nBreaches of climate tipping points are a reason for great concern and warrant rapid reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. Yet some types of tipping point could instead help to slow down climate change. Social ones, for example, could accelerate the transition to climate neutrality. Policies that have helped to reduce the cost of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, for example, have encouraged consumers and companies to use electric and renewable-energy sources. These trends are unlikely to be reversed even if such policies are revoked.\n\nIn Positive Tipping Points, Lenton takes a closer look at these social forces and discusses how they can be harnessed to avoid further drastic climate change. His engaging and thought-provoking discussion of how individuals can bring about positive tipping points and contribute to climate action is based on state-of-the-art research and packed with useful facts and figures. It is a breath of fresh air at a time when people are increasingly prone to feelings of ‘climate doom’, the idea that a climate catastrophe is unavoidable.\n\nBig changes\n\nThe first part of the book highlights that changes in the climate system and society are often non-linear and can occur rapidly. For systems with self-reinforcing feedback loops, a small perturbation might be enough to tip the climate system from one equilibrium state to another. For example, higher temperatures accelerate the melting of sea ice, reducing the amount of solar radiation that is reflected back into space, thus triggering further warming.\n\nPast tipping events include the transition, roughly 12,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the current Holocene interglacial period. Such drastic changes in environmental conditions had implications for human societies, too. The end of that big freeze enabled people to switch from foraging to farming as their main means of food production.\n\nOther wholesale cultural shifts might be expected in a warmer world. If humans are forced to live outside the climatic niche in which our societies evolved, social stability might be threatened. But other positive tipping points could emerge that work in favour of climate-change mitigation.\n\nPeople in Venice, Italy, plant trees to protect crucial salt-marsh ecosystems.Credit: Simone Padovani/Getty\n\nThe second part of Lenton’s book discusses how positive tipping points can help to avert a climate catastrophe. He includes numerous examples of how actions taken by small groups of people have resulted in large-scale social change. For example, Lenton describes how his aunt Lilian’s fight for women’s suffrage helped to change social norms, and how a small number of climate activists, such as Greta Thunberg, have sparked a global movement.\n\nThe author argues that the key to pushing social change towards a climate-friendly economy lies in feedback loops — progress in one area increases the probability of improvements in others. Social activism, alternative forms of democracy, technological progress and government policies could reinforce each other, allowing societies to overcome the current state of ‘carbon lock-in’ by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nSmall steps",

          "abstract": "As Brazil hosts the United Nations climate summit COP30 in Belém, its government is taking steps to boost the economy without damaging the environment. The goal sounds almost utopian: by 2050, Brazil aims to double income per capita, slash emissions of every greenhouse gas to attain ‘net zero’, and distribute wealth more fairly to achieve a 20% reduction in the Gini index — a metric that reflects income inequality.\n\nThere has already been substantial progress. For example, deforestation has substantially decreased since the start of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s latest term in 2023, and is now at its lowest rate for 11 years (see go.nature.com/442bqtp). As a member of the team in charge of the Ecological Transformation Plan at Brazil’s Ministry of Finance, I hope that our early successes will encourage other nations to proceed in a similar direction.\n\nFor real climate action, empower women\n\nTwo initiatives, in particular, could fundamentally reshape global climate finance — the funding systems that support climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. The first is the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), a fund ran by participating nations, with support from the World Bank, to help low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to preserve their tropical forests. The fund aims to reach US$125 billion in the coming years. An initial investment of $25 billion should come from nations and philanthropic organizations. Brazil has pledged to invest the first $1 billion, and other countries, including Norway, Indonesia, France and Germany, have announced substantial contributions. Another $100 billion is expected to come from capital markets, through the issuing of bonds that pay interest at the market rate.\n\nThe fund is made up of investments rather than donations — the distinction matters. Experience shows that aid flows are volatile and are subject to political winds and fiscal constraints in donor countries. The TFFF breaks this cycle. Here’s how it works: sponsors invest in the fund and receive annual returns that are comparable with those from low-risk sovereign bonds, at, say, 4%. The fund deploys this capital in a diversified portfolio of fixed-income assets, mainly bonds from emerging markets, with an expected yield of 7–8% (historically, a representative portfolio of diversified emerging-market bonds has paid out at around that rate). This portfolio excludes investments that finance fossil fuels or activities linked to deforestation.\n\nWhen mature, this mechanism could generate nearly $4 billion annually for forest conservation — rewarding ecosystem services and paying for anti-deforestation enforcement and capacity-building to foster the bioeconomy, such as biotechnology for pharmaceutical production.\n\nThe ‘implementation COP’: why the Belém summit must ratchet up climate action",

My feed is a relentless highlight of everyone else’s successes: papers, major grants, coveted fellowships. And then there’s me, in a five-year-long, committed relationship with a massive project, in the field of neuroscience.\n\nIt’s not that I haven’t published anything. My name appears on co-authored papers that I’m proud of, collaborations in which I contributed data, analyses and expertise. But my own project was structured as a comprehensive story that kept expanding in scope, rather than as a series of publishable segments. This choice meant a longer road to first authorship compared with some of my peers, who were finishing projects and seeing their work published sooner. However, graduate students know that there’s a different gravity to first authorship. Co-authorship says ‘You were part of the story’, but first authorship says ‘This was your story to tell’.\n\nIt’s treated like the holy grail of the PhD journey, the golden ticket to a good postdoc, the milestone of independence and, in many programmes, the key to graduating. In a mid-sized laboratory such as mine, at Texas A&M University in College Station, landing a high-impact first-author paper isn’t just a personal win — it can be career-defining for the student and is a huge event for the lab. But it can also be a long, long wait.\n\n27 things we wish we’d known when we started our PhDs\n\nMy project began with a simple, elegant question: how does a little-known protein — a receptor that helps neurons to communicate — regulate flexibility in the brain’s learning circuits? The work quickly expanded, demanding new techniques and complex analyses. The results weren’t what we expected — and instead of answers, they led to more questions that had to be tested and untangled. Every new result came with the same question: do we publish a paper now, or do we hold off and build a single, ambitious story? The academic in me understood the power of the big narrative. The graduate student in me desperately wanted something to show for the years of work.\n\nThe tension between the desire to make the project as meaningful as possible and my own professional clock has been one of the hardest lessons of my PhD. Along the way, I’ve discovered three truths that reshaped how I think about progress.\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nThe hardest part of chasing a big paper isn’t the failed experiments or broken equipment. It’s the waiting. Without having something accepted or published, it often felt like my progress didn’t count.\n\nEventually, I realized that if I measured success only by a first-author paper, I’d buckle under the weight of waiting. I had to find other ways to recognize progress.\n\nI started noticing the number of skills I was building up. So, to keep myself honest, I made a simple spreadsheet. Each entry was proof of growth, and within months, I had dozens of examples. Mastering patch-clamp electrophysiology. Learning to run proteomics. Doing analyses that once made my head spin. These weren’t just chores on the road to publication, they were permanent upgrades to how I do science.\n\nWhat makes PhD students happy? Good supervision",

Credit: AP Photo/AlamyAP Photo/Alamy\nJames Dewey Watson —who won the Nobel Prize for his role in divining the structure of DNA;was instrumental in initiating and propelling theHuman Genome Project; and who became notorious for his history ofracist and sexist comments— has died at 97.\n\nThe discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA paved the way for scientists to unravel the mechanisms behind genetic inheritance and how cells synthesize proteins. Gene therapies, the sequencing of the human genome and the development of monoclonal antibodies as treatments for cancer are just a few of the developments that would not have been possible without an understanding of DNA’s structure.\n\n“The elucidation of the structure of the double helix goes down, along with Mendel and Darwin, as the three greatest discoveries in biology,” says Bruce Stillman, president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, where Watson had various positions.\n\nLandmark paper\n\nWatson and Francis Crick, who worked together at the University of Cambridge, UK, solved the structure of DNA within a few years of their first meeting. In 1953, they published a seminal paper1 in Nature titled A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. Watson had just turned 25.\n\n“For him, nothing was impossible,” says Robert Martienssen, a geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor. “Nothing was out of reach.”\n\nBut the discovery of the DNA helix also became enmeshed in controversy. Watson and Crick elucidated the complex structure with the help of data and ideas from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, who were working at King’s College London at the time. Some of these data were shared without Franklin’s permission. Wilkins was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 with Watson and Crick. Franklin had died of ovarian cancer 4 years earlier at the age of 37, and so was ineligible for the award.\n\nWhat Rosalind Franklin truly contributed to the discovery of DNA’s structure\n\nWatson and Crick, “could have — and should have — requested permission to use the data and made clear exactly what they had done, first to Franklin and Wilkins, and then to the rest of the world”, wrote Matthew Cobb, and Nathaniel Comfort, historians of science at the University of Manchester, UK, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, respectively, in a 2023 essay2 on Franklin.\n\nIn the aftermath of the discovery, Watson was particularly unkind about Franklin and dismissive of the role of women in science generally. In a best-selling book about the discovery of the double helix, he criticized Franklin’s appearance and wrote, “The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person's lab.”\n\nNo answers\n\nColleagues who were close to Watson have long had to wrestle with his mixed legacy. Nancy Hopkins, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that Watson convinced her to pursue her PhD, at a time when few women pursued careers in science. When she launched her own lab and feared she might not get tenure, Watson convinced her to push on. “Just keep working and when you come up for tenure, if the letters are good enough, you’ll get tenure. Or I’ll sue them,” Hopkins says Watson told her.\n\nHopkins later became a vocal advocate for women in science and says that she is just one of many women Watson trained and supported. She also says she is bewildered by Watson’s rhetoric on race.\n\nEnd racism in science\n\nA 2001 lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, left many in the audience stunned when Watson made remarks linking skin colour to sexual libido, and thinness to ambition.\n\n“That was the beginning of the end,” Hopkins says of the lecture. “What happened later on, I just don’t know the answer.”\n\nIn 2007, Watson abandoned a book tour after asserting that he thought Black people are less intelligent than white people. At the time, he was still active at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he had once been the director and had helped to make the lab a pre-eminent scientific institution. But he was removed from his leadership roles at the lab for his statements about race and intelligence. The institution severed ties with him completely after he made similar remarks in 2020. He also had a history of anti-Semitic comments, such as a 2007 remark that “Some anti-Semitism is justified.”\n\nInfluential textbook",

Researchers can now “mine the data, find genes that may be critical for a particular event in a particular cell type and at a particular time point”, says Zeng. “We have a very exciting time coming,” adds Zoltán Molnár, a developmental neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, who was not involved with any of the studies.\n\nThe work is part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) — a project launched in 2022 by the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative at the US National Institutes of Health with US$500 million in funding to build reference maps of mammalian brains.\n\nPatterns of development\n\nTwo of the papers map parts of the mouse cerebral cortex — the area of the brain involved in cognitive functions and perception.\n\nZeng and her colleagues focused on how the visual cortex develops from 11.5-day-old embryos to 56-day-old mice. They created an atlas of 568,654 individual cells and identified 148 cell clusters and 714 subtypes1. “It’s the first complete high-resolution atlas of the cortical development, including both prenatal and postnatal” phases, says Zeng.\n\nOne surprise, she says, was how many neurons continued to take up specialized identities after birth, particularly between day 11, when newborn mice open their eyes for the first time, to day 21.\n\nAnother study focused on brain development in human fetuses. How different types of brain cell emerge “is a long-standing question in developmental neurobiology”, says Tomasz Nowakowski, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. He and his colleagues created a family tree map of human cortical cells2 using brain tissue collected from eight human fetuses at various stages of development.\n\nBrain tissues, assemble! Inside the push to build better brain models\n\nThey identified 6,402 progenitor cells in these tissues and inserted a unique DNA ‘barcode’ into each one. When the cells divide, the barcodes are copied and passed on to their daughter cells — allowing researchers to track which stem cells generated which types of brain cell.\n\nNowakowski and his team found that, in fetuses that are less than 20 weeks old, progenitor cells were mostly developing into excitatory neurons, which relay electrical signals to activate other neurons. But after 20 weeks, the cells shifted to generating inhibitory neurons, which halt neuronal communication. “This shows how these progenitors transition from one type into the other,” says Molnár.\n\nThe team also observed that the generation of other types of brain cell — called astrocytes and oligodendrocytes — in humans “seems to be much more continuous and protracted” than in mice, Nowakowski adds.\n\n“We actually don’t know what controls all these developmental programmes and switches, or why they occur in development and especially at such precise moments,” says Nowakowski. Addressing these questions will be a key goal for future studies, he adds.",

          "title": "Can AI be truly creative?",
          "authors": "Jo Marchant",
          "abstract": "Pianita number 17 is a short, haunting piece for the piano. Set in the D minor key, its poignant chords and softly ascending arpeggios convey a sense of lost love, yet with enough novelty — dissonant notes and an eerie timing shift — to lift the piece out of cliché. What searing life experiences, then, did the composer pour into this work?\n\nNone, as it turns out. Because this music was produced by an artificial-intelligence model, trained on thousands of hours of YouTube videos.\n\nFor decades, psychologists have thought of creativity as a key trait that would set us apart from machines, even as they surpassed us in intelligence and skill. But now, a wave of generative AI models, which create new content based on learning from huge data sets, is throwing shade on this idea.\n\nAI ‘scientists’ joined these research teams: here’s what happened\n\nThese models exploded onto the scene in November 2022 when the California AI firm OpenAI released ChatGPT, a hugely popular AI chatbot. Powered by the large language model (LLM) GPT-3.5, ChatGPT was able to produce convincing text and images in response to simple prompts. Models that were even more impressive quickly followed.\n\nFrom poetry and video to ideas and music, AI-generated content now rivals many human-made works, meaning that the standard scientific definitions of creativity struggle to distinguish between people and computers. The progress since 2022 has been “absolutely mind-blowing”, says Simon Colton, who studies computational creativity at Queen Mary, University of London. “All of my colleagues are scrambling to catch up, like ‘What? What just happened?’”\n\nSo should we accept that AI is now creative? Or change the definition to safeguard human creativity? Researchers on both sides argue that the stakes are high — not just for AI’s creative potential, but for our own.\n\nMachine ingenuity\n\nThe debate over whether machines can be creative isn’t new. In the 1840s, Ada Lovelace, who collaborated on a prototype of the first digital computer, the Analytical Engine, insisted that despite the model’s impressive abilities, “it has no pretensions whatever to originate anything” and is limited to “whatever we know how to order it to perform”. More than a century later, many scientists still held the same opinion, but in 1950, mathematician Alan Turing provocatively argued the reverse: that there was no human faculty that couldn’t one day be replicated by computers.\n\nSome 50 years later, machines began to rival even the most talented humans at specific tasks. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue computer beat the reigning chess world champion. Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo program achieved a similar feat for the game of Go in 2015. In 2019, Google unveiled the Bach Doodle, which could harmonize short melodies in the style of the German composer Johann Sebastian Bach. But researchers agree that what’s happening now with generative AI is different from anything seen or heard before.\n\nCreativity is difficult to characterize and measure, but researchers have coalesced on a standard definition: the ability to produce things that are both original and effective. They also have a range of tests for it, from interpreting abstract figures to suggesting alternative uses for a brick.\n\nFrom 2023 onwards, researchers in fields from business to neuroscience started reporting that AI systems can rival humans in such tests, and people often struggled to distinguish AI-generated and human-produced content, whether it was a poem, a scientific hypothesis or a smartphone app1. “People started saying, ‘Hey, generative AI does well on creativity tests, therefore it’s creative,’” says Mark Runco, a cognitive psychologist at Southern Oregon University in Ashland, and a founding editor of the Creativity Research Journal.\n\nThe best-performing humans still have the edge over machines, however. One study2 compared short stories written by humans with pieces generated by popular chatbots. Although some of the AI-generated stories were judged to be as good as attempts by amateur human writers, experts rated the AI stories as much poorer in quality than professional stories published in The New Yorker, complaining that they lacked narrative endings, rhetorical complexity and character development. A separate experiment concluded that when it came to dreaming up new functions for everyday objects, LLMs couldn’t match the innovative capacity of a group of five-year-old children3.\n\nScientific spark\n\nIn science, generative AI tools have achieved impressive results for tightly defined problems, such as predicting the 3D structures of proteins. But they can struggle with broader challenges. First, they lack the experience and context to come up with fruitful suggestions in a real-world research environment. When a team at Stanford University in California asked both LLMs and humans to generate research proposals in computer science, the AI suggestions were initially rated by reviewers as more novel and effective. But after testing the proposals, reviewers noticed design flaws: for instance, some AI-generated ideas were computationally too expensive to execute easily, and others failed to refer to previous research, whereas the human ideas were more feasible1.\n\nSome AI models might also struggle with the imaginative leaps required to generate truly new insights in science. In a March study4, AI researchers Amy Ding at Emylon Business School in Lyons, France, and Shibo Li at Indiana University in Bloomington asked a recent version of ChatGPT (ChatGPT-4) to uncover the roles of three genes in a hypothetical regulatory system. The researchers asked the chatbot to come up with hypotheses and to design experiments; these were then performed using a computer-simulated laboratory and the results were fed back to the AI.\n\nAI tools such as the Nobel-prizewinning AlphaFold, which predicts protein structures from amino-acid sequences, have revolutionized some areas of science.Credit: Alecsandra Dragoi for Nature\n\nCompared with human scientists who were given the same task, the chatbot proposed fewer hypotheses and conducted fewer experiments. Unlike the humans, it didn’t revise its hypotheses or conduct any new experiments after receiving the results, and it failed to reveal the correct regulatory mechanism. After just one round of research, it confidently concluded that its original ideas were correct, even though they were not supported by the data.\n\nDing and Li conclude that ChatGPT-4, at least, doesn’t have the necessary creative spark to notice and interpret anomalous results, or to ask surprising and important questions. Humans often conduct experiments out of curiosity, the researchers point out, then try new ideas to explain their results. But ChatGPT-4 was “stubborn” — unable to adjust its thinking in the face of fresh evidence.\n\nWill AI ever win its own Nobel? Some predict a prize-worthy science discovery soon\n\nThe researchers suggest that achieving the curiosity and imagination needed for truly groundbreaking discoveries might require going beyond the deep neural networks — hierarchical layers of inter-connected nodes — that underlie generative AI. Although these excel at recognizing statistical patterns, they can struggle with flexible, outside-the-box thinking. That is “very difficult to do when you’re training on huge amounts of data,” agrees Colton, “which is, by definition, inside the box.”\n\nAlternative AI architectures could increase the potential for creativity, although research is at an early stage. Ding and Li highlight “neuromorphic” AI, which is modelled on the dynamic, self-organizing processes of the brain. Meanwhile, Colton is excited about neurosymbolic AI. In this approach, deep neural networks that glean patterns from data are combined with symbolic rules and reasoning, with the symbolic part being closer to explicit, abstract thought. The addition could equip AI systems with more flexibility to break out beyond their training, he says. “You can say, ‘You’ve seen this rule in the data, but what if that wasn’t true?’”\n\nTrust the process\n\nNo matter how impressive the models become, however, should they ever be described as creative? Some researchers argue that, before attributing creativity to AI, society must think more carefully about what this quality really is. James Kaufman, an educational psychologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs and the author of several books on creativity, argues that we need to understand the process of creating rather than just looking at the end result. “AI can produce a creative product, sure,” he says. “But it doesn’t go through a creative process. I don’t think it’s a creative entity.”\n\nFor Runco, too, the idea of creative AI ignores important qualities that humans use in their creative output. He argues that, whereas neural networks follow algorithms, people use subjective emotions, aesthetics, personal values and lived experience to make creative decisions and imaginative leaps that might not seem logical or rational, but which express a person’s unique perspective, or self.\n\nTo capture these human aspects, Runco suggests amending the standard definition of creativity to include ‘authenticity’, or being true to oneself, as well as ‘intentionality’ — an intrinsic motivation or drive that includes both the curiosity to begin a creative process and the judgement to know when to stop.\n\nSome types of AI model can assess their output and improve by themselves, says Caterina Moruzzi, a philosopher studying creativity and AI at the Edinburgh College of Art, UK, but they can still only move towards a goal provided by a human user. “What they still cannot do, and the question is whether they will ever be able to, is to give themselves their own goals.”\n\nThis AI-generated work, exhibited by Refik Anadol at the Serpentine North Gallery in London, was made from images of coral reefs and rainforests.Credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty\n\nFor Jon McCormack, who studies computational creativity at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, even high-quality AI creations are “parasitic” on the human creativity that went into their training material. “They’re not able to come up with art movements or independently want to be an artist.”",

          "abstract": "People tend to form impressions of others’ trustworthiness based on their facial appearance and make trust-related decisions accordingly. In such face-based trustworthiness judgments (FBTJs), older adults are generally more likely than younger adults to attribute higher trustworthiness. This pattern is sometimes referred to as positivity bias and has been proposed as a potential risk factor for fraud victimization in later life. However, previous studies lack objective ground-truth measures of the actual trustworthiness of FBTJ targets, thus limiting their ability to assess the accuracy and bias of such judgments. To address this gap, we conducted three studies to examine age-related differences in FBTJ accuracy and bias using behavior in a trust game (Studies 1 and 2, Japanese participants) and records of political corruption convictions (Study 3, British participants) as ground-truth indicators of trustworthiness. In participant-level analyses, older adults demonstrated either higher accuracy (Studies 1 and 3) or comparable accuracy (Study 2) relative to younger adults. Furthermore, younger adults consistently tended to judge others as untrustworthy; however, older adults did not exhibit this negativity bias (Studies 1 and 2), and only a milder positivity bias emerged in Study 3. Although these age-related differences, particularly in accuracy, became less evident when face-level variability was considered, the overall results suggest that older adults perform as well as, or even better than, younger adults in terms of FBTJ accuracy and bias. This finding challenges the conventional view that older adults’ FBTJs are positively distorted and increase their vulnerability to deception.",

          "abstract": "Expressions of dissent against authority are an important feature of most societies, and efforts to suppress such expressions are common. Modern digital communications, social media, and Internet surveillance and censorship technologies are changing the landscape of public speech and dissent. Especially in authoritarian settings, individuals must assess the risk of voicing their true opinions or choose self-censorship, voluntarily moderating their behavior to comply with authority. We present a model in which individuals strategically manage the tradeoff between expressing dissent and avoiding punishment through self-censorship while an authority adapts its policies to minimize both total expressed dissent and punishment costs. We study the model analytically and in simulation to derive conditions separating defiant individuals who express their desired dissent in spite of punishment from self-censoring individuals who fully or partially limit their expression. We find that for any population, there exists an authority policy that leads to total self-censorship. However, the probability and time for an initially moderate, locally adaptive authority to suppress dissent depend critically on the population’s willingness to withstand punishment early on, which can deter the authority from adopting more extreme policies.",

          "abstract": "The US Decennial Census serves as the foundation for many high-profile policy decision-making processes, including federal funding allocation and redistricting. In 2020, the Census Bureau adopted differential privacy to protect the confidentiality of individual responses through a disclosure avoidance system that injects noise into census data tabulations. The Bureau subsequently posed an open question: Could stronger privacy guarantees be obtained for the 2020 US Census compared to their published guarantees, or equivalently, had the privacy budgets been fully utilized? In this paper, we address this question affirmatively by demonstrating that the 2020 US Census provides significantly stronger privacy protections than the officially published guarantees suggest at each of the eight geographical levels, from the national level down to the block level. This finding is enabled by our precise tracking of privacy losses using f -differential privacy, applied to the composition of private queries across these geographical levels. Our analysis reveals that the Census Bureau introduced unnecessarily high levels of noise to meet the specified privacy guarantees for the 2020 Census. Consequently, we show that noise variances could be reduced by 15.08% to 24.82% while maintaining nearly the same level of privacy protection for each geographical level, thereby improving the accuracy of privatized census statistics. We empirically demonstrate that reducing noise injection into census statistics mitigates distortion caused by privacy constraints in downstream applications of private census data, illustrated through a study examining the relationship between earnings and education.",

Using a 25-y dataset from 80 grassland sites embedded in a 2,800-ha landscape, we tested for stabilizing effects of connectivity, defined here as the amount of source grassland habitat within dispersal-relevant radii of each site. We found no relationship of connectivity to the temporal variability of total cover or estimated biomass, or to the retention of species diversity over time, and no predicted unimodal relationship of connectivity to species richness. Connectivity did show a predicted positive relationship to temporal species turnover, but this effect disappeared after accounting for livestock grazing history. These grasslands changed toward taller exotic annual grass species and lower species richness over the study period, regardless of connectivity or grazing history, and the richness-reducing shift to taller grasses was consistent with previously documented thermophilization, i.e., shift to warmer and drier species composition. Connectivity in this system appears not to stabilize local communities undergoing directional change.",

          "abstract": "Each year, hundreds of millions of people are sickened by diseases that are transmitted through mosquito bites, including dengue, Zika, and malaria. Mosquito biting does not occur uniformly throughout the day and peak biting times follow species-specific patterns. While host-associated cues, like carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), behaviorally activate human-biting mosquitoes to search for a host, the mechanisms that regulate these responses throughout the day remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce an automated behavioral tracking system to investigate time-of-day variation of CO 2 responsiveness in Aedes aegypti . We find that while acute responses to CO 2 remain consistently high throughout the light phase, response persistence peaks only at dawn and dusk, in alignment with field-observed biting rhythms. We identify the circadian neuropeptide Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF) as a key regulator in the daily timing of spontaneous locomotor activity and CO 2 response persistence. Mosquitoes lacking PDF show reduced activity and CO 2 persistence in the morning. In response to a blood meal baited with heat and human odorants, pdf mutants also show reduced feeding in the morning and midday. Additionally, loss of pdf impacts the spatial pattern of PDF immunostaining and cell-autonomous clock gene oscillation in the central circadian system. Notably, acute CO 2 responsiveness remains rhythmic without external zeitgeber cues and is unaffected in pdf mutants, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms for acute CO 2 activation versus response persistence. These findings reveal a circadian layer of control of mosquito activity pattern that temporally modulate host-seeking drive.",

          "abstract": "Cellulosic biomass represents a promising feedstock for biofuel and biochemical production. However, its recalcitrant structure strongly hinders enzymatic degradation. Cellulosomes are large multienzyme complexes, highly efficient at degrading cellulose. A cellulase in a cellulosome has a dockerin domain that binds to a cohesin module on the CipA (cellulosome integrating protein A). In a native cellulosome all cohesins are identical, so that the cellulase types and their positions in a CipA cannot be controlled. Here, we constructed the largest designer CipA known to date. Using innovative techniques, we synthesized a designer CipA gene that encodes nine distinct cohesins and two cellulose-binding modules, which we named DCipA2B9C . Then, we fused nine distinct fungal cellulases separately with nine distinct dockerins for their precise positioning on DCipA2B9C to achieve enzyme proximity-effect. We constructed three yeast hosts to compare their performances. First, an enzyme host (EH) secretes nine dockerin-fused cellulases, including endoglucanases (EgIII-a, EgIII-m, and EgIII-c), exoglucanases (CBHII-j and EXG2-r), β-glucosidases (BGS-f and BGS-l), and cellulase boosters, including a LPMO-t and CDH-b. Second, the scaffoldin host (SH) expresses DCipA2B9C. Third, the cellulosome-9 host expresses DCipA2B9C and nine dockerin-fused cellulases. Native-PAGE and ELISA confirmed specific interactions between dockerins and cohesins. Additionally, native-PAGE, SDS-PAGE, and LC-MS verified the successful assembly of the multienzyme complex. Our performance evaluation showed that coculturing of EH and SH outperformed the cellulosome-9 host. It degraded microcrystalline cellulose efficiently to produce 14.29 g/L bioethanol, which surpassed all previously constructed yeast cellulosomes by fourfold or more. In summary, our study provides an effective approach to biomass degradation.",

          "abstract": "The angrite parent body (APB) is the most volatile-depleted among known differentiated bodies in the Solar System, yet the mechanisms responsible remain poorly constrained. Here, we present high-precision nickel (Ni) isotope data from a suite of angrite samples to reconstruct the APB’s volatile depletion history. Plutonic angrites contain unusually high proportions of metallic iron and exhibit chondritic δ 60/58 Ni values (0.202 ± 0.028‰; per mille mass-dependent 60 Ni/ 58 Ni deviation relative to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM) 986). These observations are consistent with a homogeneous Ni isotope composition of the APB after core formation and the subsequent incorporation of endogenous core material in plutonic angrites. In contrast, a dunite and megacrystic olivines from volcanic angrites, derived from the mantle, display suprachondritic δ 60/58 Ni values (0.4 to 0.7‰). We argue that these values are consistent with Ni loss via evaporation during a high-energy impact that follows an initial stage of volatile loss from a magma ocean generated by 26 Al heating. Thermodynamic modeling confirms Ni to be more volatile than Mn, Fe, Si, and Mg during evaporation from silicate liquids, in agreement with the observed relative magnitude of isotopic fractionation. Volcanic angrite matrices show variable and often subchondritic δ 60/58 Ni values (down to −0.5‰), reflecting mixing with isotopically heavy megacrystic olivines and recondensation of light Ni vapor onto the crust. These findings imply that volatile elements are stratified (core–mantle–crust) in the APB and provide direct isotopic evidence for impact-driven vapor loss and recondensation on a differentiated planetary body.",

          "abstract": "China faces the challenge of simultaneously improving fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and ozone (O 3 ) air quality while tackling climate change. However, most studies have focused on either the cocontrol of PM 2.5 and O 3 or the synergy between CO 2 reduction and PM 2.5 improvement, leaving comprehensive strategies for tackling all three underexplored. Here, we evaluate various combinations of clean-air and climate policies in China using an integrated framework that consists of a technology-based emission projection model, a goal-oriented measure selection and optimization method, a chemical transport model, and a detailed cost–benefit assessment approach. Our results show that while maintaining current clean-air policies is effective in controlling PM 2.5 , their impact on O 3 remains limited. Maximizing cost-effective end-of-pipe measures targeting NO x and volatile organic compounds can achieve cocontrol of PM 2.5 and O 3 , but remain vulnerable to unfavorable meteorological conditions. Near-term climate policies alone contribute limited improvements in air quality, particularly for O 3 , due to the lower synergy between CO 2 and O 3 precursor emission sources. Only a combined strategy, integrating stringent clean-air actions and ambitious climate mitigation, can achieve the “triple control” of PM 2.5 , O 3 , and CO 2 . Under this strategy, national annual mean PM 2.5 and national O 3 -8 h 90th percentile concentrations are reduced to 19.1 μg m −3 and 126.9 μg m −3 by 2030, respectively, yielding net benefits of over 3,000 billion RMB.

However, studies on dopamine’s role in negative reinforcement learning (NRL) are scarce. Learning to escape aversive stimuli is vital for survival and may differ significantly from positive reinforcement in behavior and neural mechanisms. This study employs footshocks as aversive stimuli to investigate neural activity, synaptic transmission, and intrinsic excitability in a NRL paradigm using fiber photometry and ex vivo electrophysiology. Results show that inescapable footshocks initially increase activity in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons, which later shifts to reflect shock termination as exposure increases. Electrophysiological observations reveal increased intrinsic excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission in SNc neurons, with decreased inhibitory transmission. After mice learn to escape the shock by nose-poking, dopaminergic activity shifts from shock termination to shock onset. Furthermore, inhibitory input increases, while excitatory input decreases after learning, with intrinsic excitability returning to baseline levels. This indicates that SNc dopaminergic neurons exhibit RPE-like signals in response to aversive stimuli, with their intrinsic excitability adjusting according to expectations of shock termination. These findings enhance our understanding of RPE encoding in negative reinforcement learning and may inform therapeutic strategies for disorders caused by environmental factors such as aversive stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale recording technology have spurred inquiries into the high-dimensional geometry of the neural code. However, characterizing this geometry from noisy neural responses, particularly in datasets with more neurons than trials, poses major statistical challenges. We address this problem by developing tools for the accurate estimation of high-dimensional signal geometry. We apply these tools to investigate the geometry of representations in the mouse primary visual cortex. Previous work has argued that these representations exhibit a power law, in which the i th principal component falls off as 1 / i . Here, we show that response geometry in V1 is better described by a broken power law, in which two different exponents govern the falloff of early and late eigenmodes of population activity. Our analysis reveals that later modes decay more rapidly than previously suggested, resulting in a substantially lower-dimensional representation that is concentrated in early modes. We thus characterize the stimulus encoding of these dominant population modes. We find properties of population coding in the mouse primary visual cortex that underscore its greater tractability relative to single-neuron characterization. Specifically, we find these modes encode visual features with far higher fidelity than single neurons, and these features are easier to characterize than the tuning of single neurons: both classical and deep network models of V1 achieve more than 25 % better predictive performance for eigenmodes than single neurons. Overall, our approach overturns prior results and reveals emergent structure in a population sensory representation.",

MDFIC2 modulates both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 gating properties by slowing their kinetics and shifting mechanical sensitivity to higher forces. Interestingly, Mdfic2 is downregulated in mouse neuropathic pain models in which mechanical allodynia is a hallmark symptom.

          "abstract": "Silica is the paradigmatic network glass-former and understanding its response to pressure is essential for comprehending the mechanical properties of silica-based materials and the behavior of silicate melts in the Earth’s interior. While pressure ( P )-induced changes in the short-range structure—particularly the breakdown of tetrahedral symmetry—have been well documented, structural transformations on larger length scales, important for many material properties, remain poorly understood. Here, we numerically investigate the three-dimensional structure of silica glass as a function of compression up to P ≈ 100 GPa. Using a many-body correlation function, we reveal a complex medium-range order: While for P ≲ 10 GPa, one finds tetrahedral, octahedral, and cubic symmetries, the structure at higher P s exhibits alternating cubic and octahedral particle arrangements. The P -dependence of the corresponding structural correlation length displays two distinct maxima, which permits to rationalize the anomalous compressibility of silica. The identified complex structural organization on intermediate range scales is the result of a pressure-and scale-dependent interplay between directional bonding, packing efficiency, and network stiffness. Since these competing effects are common in network glass-formers, the identified three-dimensional medium-range order, and hence the physical properties of the glass, are expected to be universal features of such materials under extreme conditions.",

Using MC1Re/e mice lacking functional MC1R, we demonstrate impaired wound healing marked by delayed reepithelialization and increased neutrophil extracellular traps—pathological features observed in human CWs. To investigate MC1R’s therapeutic potential, we developed a new murine CW model that replicates human pathology, presenting as nonhealing, exudate-rich ulcers. Topical application of the MC1R-selective agonist BMS-470539 restored healing by reducing exudate production, stimulating vascularization, and enabling reepithelialization. The critical role of MC1R was further evidenced by MC1Re/e mice, which developed more severe ulcers with excessive exudate and NETosis. In acute wound studies, we found that topical MC1R agonist enhanced wound bed perfusion and lymphatic drainage through increased angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and reduced scarring by modulating fibroblast phenotype. Together, these findings establish the MC1R/POMC axis as a fundamental regulator of skin repair and identify promising therapeutic strategies to drive healing.",

In this work, we sought to reevaluate all the main components of the root graviresponse through the lens of angle dependence. We show angle dependence in Cholodny–Went-based auxin asymmetry and growth response, which we tracked back to angle-dependent variation in PIN asymmetry and statolith sedimentation in the columella. Thanks to this approach, we were able to suggest distinct roles for PINs and columella cell tiers, and a potential function for auxin vertical flux through the columella.

We found that loss of METTL3 stimulates mammary epithelial proliferation and reprograms gene expression in an m6A methyltransferase-dependent manner. Single-cell analysis in normal breast organoids revealed that METTL3 ablation causes disruption of the mammary cellular hierarchy through increased aberrant luminal differentiation. Mechanistically, METTL3 loss reduces RNA m6A modification of transcribed transposable elements leading to their increased expression and upregulation of interferon-STAT signaling. This inflammatory response leads to cross talk between STAT and GATA3 transcription factors, resulting in transcriptional activation of luminal genes in the mammary epithelium.

While it is observed throughout the visual system, normalization may be particularly important in higher visual areas, where neurons have large receptive fields (RFs) that are frequently presented with multiple stimuli under natural viewing conditions. Yet it remains unclear how a population of neurons, with diverse selectivities and offset RFs, responds to complex scenes in which given stimuli engage different RFs more effectively than others. Here, we investigated how normalization varies with the spatial offset of stimuli from the centers of neurons’ RFs in the macaque monkey middle temporal area. We found that existing models of normalization perform poorly when stimuli appear in arbitrary RF locations. Instead, an intensity-weighted normalization model, in which intensity is defined as the product of stimulus contrast and a location-specific RF weight, is required to closely account for normalization. Intensity-weighted normalization furthermore explains a systematic increase in contrast sensitivity at sites closer to the field center. Finally, intensity-weighted normalization reveals that spontaneous activity contributes to normalization in a manner indistinguishable from experimental stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Memories are believed to be stored in synapses and retrieved by reactivating neural ensembles. Learning alters synaptic weights, which can interfere with previously stored memories that share the same synapses, creating a trade-off between plasticity and stability. Interestingly, neural representations change even in stable environments, without apparent learning or forgetting—a phenomenon known as representational drift. Theoretical studies have suggested that multiple neural representations can correspond to a memory, with postlearning exploration of these representation solutions driving drift. However, it remains unclear whether representations explored through drift differ from those learned or offer unique advantages. Here, we show that representational drift uncovers noise-robust representations that are otherwise difficult to learn. We first define the nonlinear solution space manifold of synaptic weights for fixed input–output mappings, which allows us to disentangle drift from learning and forgetting and simulate drift as diffusion within this manifold. Solutions explored by drift have many inactive and saturated neurons, making them robust to weight perturbations due to noise or continual learning. Such solutions are prevalent and entropically favored by drift, but their lack of gradients makes them difficult to learn and nonconducive to future learning. To overcome this, we introduce an allocation procedure that selectively shifts representations for new stimuli into a learning-conducive regime. By combining allocation with drift, we resolve the trade-off between learnability and robustness.",

Similar cyst structures exist in nonmammalian vertebrate ovaries, but their polarity and function have remained uncertain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution imaging, we reconstructed the germ cell differentiation trajectory in Xenopus laevis and uncovered striking parallels with invertebrate and mouse cyst development. We identified a distinct germline stem cell (GSC) population marked by piwil4 , low translational activity, and expression of neuronal-specific and transposon-silencing genes. Downstream from GSCs, during cyst development, an asymmetric fusome-like structure composed of stable microtubules forms a rosette-like connection between cystocytes and contains Golgi vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting polarized trafficking. In contrast to previous claims, ~80% of cyst cells turned over rather than forming oocytes, consistent with a nurse cell fate. The striking parallels described here between cyst and fusome formation, polarization, cyst breakdown, and nurse-like cell turnover to produce relatively few oocytes argue that amphibian cysts have important functions in female gametogenesis.",

Here, we show that auxin transport-guided auxin accumulation in the cells with primary xylem identity (PXI cells) within the root apical meristem defines the vascular cambial stem-cell organizer already during the primary development. Ablation of PXI cells or transient interference of auxin transport resulted in respecification of stem cells within the vascular bundle in a scattered manner. Similarly, ablation of cells with secondary xylem identity (SXI cells) in the mature vascular cambium resulted in the regeneration of SXI cells from stem cells within the same radial cell files. Reciprocally, ablation of stem cells in mature vascular cambium led to respecification of new stem cells from adjacent SXI cells. Thus, in response to injury, xylem identity cells and stem cells form an interchangeable unit, which we propose to define as a stem cell niche. Successful respecification of stem cells required functional auxin transport and presence of undifferentiated xylem cells.

Vif mediates degradation of host restriction factor APOBEC3G, while Vpr modulates the host cell proteome in ways that promote virion infectivity and viral gene expression. In cycling cells including CD4+ T cells, Vif and Vpr also severely impact cell cycle progression for reasons that remain unknown. Here, we combined live-cell imaging with virological assays to define the relative impacts of Vif and Vpr on the cell cycle and single-cell virion production. We demonstrate that Vif and Vpr’s effects on the cell cycle are markedly distinct, with Vif arresting cells in mitosis, while Vpr causes a G2 phase delay followed by endoreplication and reversion of cells into a “pseudo-G1” cell state lacking G2 markers. When coexpressed, Vpr’s capacity to bypass mitosis acts to suppress cytotoxicity associated with Vif-mediated cell cycle arrest, with the two proteins cooperating to extend the infected cell’s time in interphase as much as fivefold. Vpr-driven endoreplication also caused duplication of transcriptionally active proviral genomes, yielding a correlative ~twofold increase in per-cell viral gene expression. Based on these findings, we propose that Vif and Vpr coordinately regulate the cell cycle to prolong the infected cell’s lifespan and maximize single-cell virion output.",

The early onset and moderate severity of the US 2022–2023 influenza season may have resulted from reduced use of nonpharmaceutical interventions or lower population immunity after 2 y of limited influenza virus circulation. We used a mathematical model of influenza virus transmission that incorporates vaccine-derived protection against both infection and severe disease to estimate the impact of influenza vaccines on healthcare burden. Assuming reported levels of past vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and hospitalization, we estimate that influenza vaccines prevented 69,886 (95% CI: 51,860 to 84,575) influenza-related hospitalizations nationwide during the 2022–2023 season, with 57% attributable to reduced susceptibility and onward transmission. Despite limited data on VE against infection, our analyses suggest substantial indirect protection, particularly from young adults to other age groups. This is supported by a significant negative correlation between young adult (aged 18 to 49 y) vaccination rates and observed hospital burden across US states. Among those aged ≧65 y, nearly half of averted hospitalizations resulted from vaccinating younger age groups. These findings highlight the need for better estimates of influenza VE against infection and the potential benefits of increasing young adult influenza vaccination rates to reduce both direct and indirect disease burden.",

CR increases Sirt6 levels, and its beneficial effects are mediated by the gasotransmitter H 2 S, a one-carbon pathway product. Yet, the role of this pathway in Sirt6-regulated longevity remains elusive. Here, we show that Sirt6 controls hepatic one-carbon metabolism, preventing the aging-dependent H 2 S reduction, and the elevation of the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Sirt6 downregulates Slc7a11 expression in an Sp1-dependent manner, decreasing cystine uptake and increasing Cgl H 2 S production activity. Additionally, comparative acetylome in old livers revealed Sirt6-related differential acetylation of most of the one-carbon enzymes. Specifically, Sirt6-dependent Matα1 K235 deacetylation reduces its SAM production activity and Cbs binding, thereby reducing its activation of Cbs-dependent H 2 S production. The net outcome is H 2 S and SAM levels as observed in young animals. Thus, we unveil a fundamental mechanism for the promotion of healthy longevity by Sirt6.",

          "abstract": "RNA base editing has the capability to rewrite genetic codes while offering improved safety due to its reversibility and temporal-spatial tunability. The development of cytosine-to-uridine editors faces issues of DNA mutagenic activity of APOBECs and the large-size anchoring domains associated with immunogenicity due to their microbial origin. To address these issues, we took an approach by returning to the original formula of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), i.e., to convert ADAR2 to a cytosine deaminase acting on RNA by introducing 17 mutant substitutions derived from RESCUE-S—it is named ADAR2-mimic base editor for C-to-U RNA editing (AMBER). AMBER displays similar sequence contexts preference to that of RESCUE, and exhibits robust performance across various tested cell lines. By applying AMBER to correct several pathogenic transcript mutations, we achieved substantial editing with efficiency ranging from 8 to 38%. For example, for the Pah mutant (c.788T&gt;C) that caused phenylketonuria in mice, AMBER had an editing efficiency of 19.7% in HEK293T cells. Additionally, concurrent bystander editing of target transcripts was mitigated by two alternate strategies. To demonstrate its effectiveness in vivo, we applied AMBER in C57BL/6 mice, and observed gRNA-dependent editing with ~21% on-target efficiencies at 72 h post injection, which remained detectable up to 1 wk. RNA-sequencing analysis of the mouse liver transcriptome revealed minimal off-target effects and no significant changes to endogenous RNA editing events. These results highlight AMBER as a promising therapeutic tool for repairing T-to-C mutations, offering great potential for the treatment of genetic diseases.",

Nevertheless, fundamental questions persist regarding the precise mechanisms of FER-mediated signal transduction and its context-dependent functional specialization in multicellular processes. Here, we develop Ferovicin (FRV), a small-molecule inhibitor that specifically disrupts FER kinase activity, thereby enabling mechanistic dissection of FER. Cocrystallization and mutational analysis show that FRV selectively binds to the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain of FER and inhibits its kinase activity. Assisted by the FRV tool and quantitative phosphoproteomics, we characterized a series of signaling pathways and networks regulated by RALF1 and FER. Notably, our analysis reveals that RALF1 activates FER through phosphorylation at Ser695, which subsequently inhibits H + -ATPase1/2 via phosphorylation at Ser899. This mechanism leads to apoplastic alkalinization and regulates cell expansion in the root meristem. Given the conservation of FRV binding sites in FER proteins across land plant species, FRV will serve as a valuable tool for dissecting FER signaling mechanisms as well as facilitating agricultural applications.",

          "abstract": "The potential impact of new mutations on organismal function and evolution depends on the developmental fate of the affected cells. Stem cells in the shoot apical meristem form much of the plant body, but only those in the L2 can form gametes. This raises the question of whether the mutation rate is optimized for this developmental plan. To test this, we compare stem cell mutations accumulated over decades of clonal propagation in two potato varieties with those arising during leaf-cell regeneration. By sequencing DNA from layer-enriched cell fractions, we found that variant allele frequencies in whole-leaf DNA can predict a mutation’s layer of origin. We further observed that mutations accumulate independently in L1 but jointly in L2 and L3. In cultivar Desiree, L1 mutation rates were fourfold higher than in deeper layers, suggesting germline-progenitor protection. In Red Polenta, layer-specific DNA from regenerants marked by a periclinal chromosomal translocation revealed a similar, though subtler, bias, with L1 exhibiting a 1.6-fold higher rate. In stark contrast, mutations during regeneration of differentiated cells were fiftyfold more frequent and bore a pronounced 8-oxoguanine signature confined to intergenic regions. Across all samples—and consistent with enhanced repair or purifying selection—the genic mutation rate was less than half that of intergenic regions. These findings indicate that plants employ mechanisms to restrict mutations according to cellular context and genomic region and suggest that the layered organization of angiosperm meristems evolved to balance genetic fidelity with adaptability",

We develop a framework for identifying metastasis regulators using CRISPR/Cas9-based screening in a genetically defined organoid model of colorectal adenocarcinoma. We conduct in vitro screens for invasion and migration alongside orthotopic, in vivo screens for gain of metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model. We identify CTNNA1 and BCL2L13 as bona fide metastasis-specific suppressors which do not confer any selective advantage in primary tumors. CTNNA1 loss promotes cell invasion and migration, and BCL2L13 loss promotes anchorage-independent survival and non-cell-autonomous changes to macrophage polarization. This study demonstrates proof of principle that large-scale genetic screening can be performed in tumor-organoid models in vivo and identifies novel regulators of metastasis.",

We here address the issue by proposing a geometric class of gradient descent–like algorithms, which we use to study a system in the hard-sphere universality class, the random Lorentz gas. The statistics of the resulting ISs is found to be strictly inherited from those of Poisson–Voronoi tessellations. The landscape roughness is further found to give rise to a hierarchical organization of ISs, which various algorithms explore differently. In particular, greedy and reluctant schemes tend to favor ISs of markedly different densities. The resulting ISs nevertheless robustly exhibit a universal force distribution, thus confirming the geometric nature of the jamming universality class.

A major impediment is the paucity of therapeutically useful phages and the great variation in the phage infection profiles, especially among Mycobacterium abscessus clinical isolates. These limitations—together with the abundance of mycobacteriophage genes of unknown function—could be addressed by synthetic genetic construction of viruses in which undesirable genes can be eliminated and genetic payloads can be readily added. However, the relatively high G+C% content of mycobacteriophage genomes (64.1%) can be challenging for DNA synthesis using phosphoramidite chemistry, and the genomes are relatively large (40 to 150 kbp) for assembly and rebooting in a bacterial host. Here, we demonstrate efficient de novo synthesis of high G+C% DNA fragments using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase chemistry, the reconstruction of complete mycobacteriophage genomes using High-Complexity Golden Gate Assembly, and efficient rebooting via electroporation into Mycobacterium smegmatis . Using this approach, we synthesized the genomes of phages BPs (41.9 kbp, 66.6% G+C%) and Bxb1 (50.5 kbp, 63.6% G+C%), and constructed variants carrying targeted mutations or added payloads. Synthetic construction of mycobacteriophages and their derivatives expands the phage repertoire for therapeutic development and provides versatile tools for advancing mycobacterial genetics and phage-based clinical applications.",

Pyrrolysine (Pyl) is encoded by the amber codon (TAG/UAG) and is widespread in archaea, where it is required for methylamine-mediated methanogenesis, an environmentally important metabolism. Mechanisms to conditionally suppress the amber stop codon for Pyl installation during protein synthesis have not been identified. In the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans, we demonstrate that the UAG codon encodes dual meaning as stop and Pyl. Our data suggest that expression of Pyl biosynthesis and incorporation genes is tuned to the cellular demand for Pyl, which might allow these archaea to navigate ambiguous stop decoding in response to environmental cues.",

This land management practice offers numerous economic and ecological advantages over conventional tillage as evidenced by its rapid expansion since the 1960s, now practiced on 15% of the global arable land. Nevertheless, various crops exhibit persistent yield losses even decades after transition to NT. Here, we demonstrate that the promise of beneficial and sustainable soil management may be undermined by a gradual and invisible threat of subsoil compaction. We report on a risk of subsoil compaction stemming from the episodic passage of heavy machinery (e.g., harvesters). The threat is of dynamic and asymmetric nature whenever compaction events occur more frequently than the natural rates of soil structure recovery, resulting in a gradual increase in soil degradation. Our analyses show that nearly 40% of global NT lands (0.8 million km 2 ) are under high subsoil compaction risk (primarily in heavily mechanized Canada, United States of America, and Brazil). Awareness and mitigation of subsoil compaction by scaling field operations to soil mechanical limits and adoption of smaller robotic vehicles will contribute to a sustainable and holistic conservation agriculture.",

          "abstract": "Dihydrodichlorofluorescein derivatives have been employed as reporters of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in innumerable studies. Their use in bacteria has led investigators to conclude that a wide array of cellular stresses owe their toxicity to the formation of ROS. However, in the present study we find that this dye reacts too poorly with physiological concentrations of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide to signal their presence, and that lethal doses of hydroxyl radicals are dispersed among too many intracellular targets for the dye to be detectably oxidized. Instead, common redox moieties inside the cell—including flavins, quinones, and metal centers—capably oxidize the dye. Indeed, the dye is oxidized as rapidly inside anaerobic cells as inside aerobic ones, refuting any involvement of ROS. The ability of diverse stresses to increase the dye signal derives from the fact that both the reduced and oxidized forms of the dye are continuously exported by protonmotive force-driven pumps. Any stress or growth condition that diminishes the cellular energy charge has the effect of slowing these pumps and thereby causing an increase in the intracellular dye signal. Therefore, the unfortunate combination of ROS-independent dye oxidation plus stress-driven metabolic slowdowns have led investigators to conclude incorrectly that diverse stressors generate ROS. Those conclusions, including ones involving clinical antibiotics, must be reconsidered.",

          "abstract": "Abnormal blood vessels limit the delivery and function of endogenous T cells as well as adoptively transferred Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells in tumor microenvironment (TME). We recently showed that vascular normalization using anti-VEGF therapy can overcome these challenges and improve the outcome of CAR-T therapy in glioblastoma models in mice. Here, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to simulate the dynamics of both adoptively transferred CAR-T cells and endogenous immune cells in solid tumors following vascular normalization. Similar to our data, our model simulations show that vascular normalization reprograms the TME from immunosuppressive to immunosupportive by enhancing infiltration of endogenous CD8 + T cells and CAR-T cells, increasing M1 macrophages, and reducing M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells, thereby improving efficacy. Strikingly, vascular normalization reduces the number of infused CAR-T cells needed for tumor control by approximately fivefold. Moreover, synchronizing a second CAR-T infusion at their peak proliferative phase maximizes antitumor function. Furthermore, the efficacy of CAR-T cells engineered to secrete anti-VEGF antibody depends on the ability of CAR-T cells to induce vascular normalization. Additionally, combining vascular and stromal normalization can improve the efficacy of anti-VEGF antibody-producing Fibroblast Activated Protein-CAR-T cells for the treatment of desmoplastic tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Finally, the model predicts that local CAR-T delivery can sustain high concentrations within the TME and induce recruitment of other antitumor immune cells, improving outcomes. Our model provides a versatile framework to optimize dosing strategies, treatment sequencing, and delivery routes for improving CAR-T therapies for solid tumors.",

During seed maturation, ABA receptors PYLs directly interact with bHLH34/104/115 transcription factors, blocking their binding to YSL1/3 promoters to inhibit Fe transport. Conversely, Fe deficiency triggers bHLH104/115 to repress ABA2 , reducing ABA biosynthesis and PYL expression to derepress YSL1/3 expression—a feedback loop balancing Fe and ABA levels. Genetic analyses confirm that this module governs Fe loading, as ABA-deficient mutants ( aba2-1 , nced6-1 ) and pyr1 pyl124 quadruple mutants accumulate higher Fe, while bhlh34 104 115 phenocopies ysl1 ysl3 Fe deficiency.

It has been argued that pair beam instabilities disrupt the cascade, thus accounting for the observed lack of reprocessed GeV emission from TeV blazars.

          "abstract": "The unique, hypnotic pulsation behavior of certain soft corals of the Xeniidae family, the result of rhythmic opening and closing of their tentacles, has fascinated scientists since the 18th century. Repetitive motion is regulated by autonomous neural circuits known as pacemakers or central pattern generators. However, little is known about such circuits in nonbilaterian organisms like corals. In this report, Xenia umbellata , a fast-growing octocoral, served as a model organism to study the muscular and neural mechanisms of pulsation. Leveraging this coral’s rapid regeneration ability, we tested somatic regrowth and pulsation recovery following oral disc amputation. Transcriptomic analysis upon transitioning from nonpulsation to intermediate and synchronized pulsation during regeneration demonstrated shared pulsation-related genes in X. umbellata and bilaterians, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved rhythmic machinery. Pharmacological interference experiments supported transcriptomic findings, showing that acetylcholine regulates pulsation and anoctamin channels affect pacemaker rhythm. Interestingly, in the intermediate pulsation phase tentacles could pulsate individually without synchronization, suggesting the development of separate pacemakers. At the synchronized pulsation phase a dense nerve net developed around the mouth opening and overlapping muscle fibers between tentacles, providing the mechanisms for tentacle synchronization. However, when polyp tentacles were cut into small pieces, the fragments remained alive and each retained independent pulsation, revealing a unique pacemaker system driven by a diffuse nerve network lacking any centralized control. This finding uncovers a mechanism of rhythmic behavior generation in nonbilaterian animals, which could represent either a lineage-specific innovation or an ancient origin for more centralized control.",

          "abstract": "Conjugation accelerates bacterial evolution by enabling bacteria to acquire genes horizontally from their neighbors. Plasmid donors must physically encounter and connect with recipients to allow plasmid transfer, and different environments are characterized by vastly different encounter rates between cells, based on mechanisms ranging from simple diffusion to fluid flow. However, how the environment affects the conjugation rate by setting the encounter rate has been largely neglected, mostly because existing experimental setups do not allow for direct control over cell encounters. Here, we describe the results of conjugation experiments in Escherichia coli in which we systematically varied the magnitude of shear flow using a cone-and-plate rheometer to control the encounter rate. We found that the conjugation rate increases with shear until it peaks at an optimal shear rate ( γ ˙ = 1 × 10 2 s − 1 ), reaching a conjugation rate fivefold higher than the baseline set by diffusion-driven encounters. This optimum marks the transition from a regime in which shear promotes conjugation by increasing the rate of cell–cell encounters to a regime in which shear disrupts conjugation. Regions of high fluid shear are widespread in aquatic systems, in the gut of host organisms, and in soil, and our results indicate that these regions could be hot spots of bacterial conjugation in the environment.",

While mechanobiology has primarily focused on factors such as cell-generated contractility and mechanical properties of extracellular matrix, a interesting mechanobiological paradigm highlights the role of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping epithelial tissues. In our study, we developed an in vitro model of cell-coated microsized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) which allows to decipher the interplay between cellular activities and tissue mechanics. Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of fluid transport in generating mechanical forces within epithelial tissues. Supported by a theoretical mechanohydraulic model, a mechanistic framework for understanding the intricate interplay between cellular processes and tissue mechanics was established. These results challenge traditional views of epithelial tissue mechanics, emphasizing the pivotal influence of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping tissues. We anticipate that this study will advance the understanding of epithelial tissue development, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying pathological conditions.",

Using a massive-scale, first-principles study, we show that while reacting with p -block elements under increasing pressure from ambient to Earth core conditions, iron tends to reverse its redox nature, changing from an electron donor (reductant) to an electron acceptor (oxidant), and oxidizes many p -block elements. Such reverse redox propensity significantly impacts the stoichiometries, bond types and strengths, structures, and properties of iron compounds under deep planetary conditions. This change transforms many p- block elements (conventionally labeled lithophile or chalcophile) into highly siderophile species. The chemical binding strengths with iron show an inverse correlation with the depletion of p -block elements in the silicate Earth. Furthermore, silicon shows a distinct anomaly in its bonding to iron, which suggests silicon may readily be incorporated into Earth’s core.",

This relationship holds across major phylogenetic groups, suggesting a general biogeographical rule for range size variation. Our findings indicate that latitudinal and elevational gradients in range size arise from selective pressures and species sorting based on climatic tolerance. Additionally, we show that species with larger range sizes tend to be ecologically dominant, supporting a long-suspected connection between range size, niche breadth, and local and regional abundance. Our results suggest a spectrum of dominance, where species with extensive geographic ranges and broader climatic tolerances tend to be more abundant. We posit that the relationship between range size, niche breadth, and ecological dominance is an emergent macroecological pattern that can be used for understanding and predicting the impacts of climate change on species distributions.",

Composed of alternating regions of Li-selective ceramic and anion-selective polymeric materials, CMMs offered the unique advantage of promoting the transport of both Li + and anions while blocking other cations. As a result, the membrane achieved a high Li/Mg selectivity of 62 and a high permeation rate of 59 mmol·m −2 ·h −1 at a low feeding concentration of 30 mM, without any external driving force. Systematical experiments revealed the influence of brine Mg/Li ratio and membrane ceramic/polymer ratio on the overall extraction rate, which was consistent with the prediction of our transport model.

We compare our experimental observations with predictions from a reaction–diffusion model that includes central dogma-related reactions and excluded volume interactions between ribosomal subunits, polysomes, and chromosomal DNA. Our results show that the nonequilibrium reactions of ribosomes cause them to aggregate at the midcell, and this process facilitates the separation of the two daughter chromosomes. However, the observed effects are weaker in live cells than our one-dimensional reaction–diffusion model predicts. Rather than relying solely on active mRNA–ribosome dynamics, our data suggest that the closing division septum via steric interactions and potentially entropic forces between two DNA strands coupled to cell elongation act as additional mechanisms to ensure faithful partitioning of the nucleoids to two daughter cells.",

Through a dry process, pollen grains are transformed into continuous, homogeneous patterns over wafer-scale areas, which can be reconfigured via thermally induced capillary action. These geometrically controlled pollen textures are precisely transferred onto one or both sides of the silk films, producing biotextured biopolymer platforms. The hierarchical pollen architecture imparts exceptional surface properties that surpass those of existing natural or synthetic analogs, while preserving the intrinsic advantages of silk fibroin, including recyclability and biodegradability. This approach, decoupling and reintegrating fundamental natural elements at both compositional and structural levels, opens pathways for combining diverse bioresources to realize sustainable materials with enhanced versatility.",

          "abstract": "The MEK–ERK pathway is a key driver of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis, and BRAF mutations, particularly BRAF V600E , can contribute to its activation. Although BRAF V600E mutations are rare in human HCC, they do occur, yet their physiologic impact in liver cells, especially when combined with frequent comutations in tumor suppressor genes, remains poorly understood. Moreover, the effect of BRAF inhibitors on HCC progression and metastasis is not well-defined. Therefore, we developed mouse models with hepatocyte-specific BRAF V600E expression and Trp53 or Cdkn2a deletion to assess tumor development, subtypes, and metastatic patterns. We found that BRAF V600E expression caused hepatomegaly, vascular congestion, and ductal reactions, and led to reduced liver function and early mortality. Codeletion of Trp53 or Cdkn2a markedly increased primary liver tumor incidence and enabled sarcomatoid metastasis. While the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 effectively reduced primary tumors and extended survival, it paradoxically increased sarcomatoid metastases. Mechanistically, PLX4720 and other RAF inhibitors induced TGFβ2 expression which promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced tumorigenicity. The effects of RAF inhibitors on TGFβ2 expression were validated in BRAF V600E -mutant human melanoma cells. We conclude that BRAF V600E drives diverse primary tumors but only one type of metastasis and that RAF inhibition, while effective against primary tumors, may promote metastasis through TGFβ2-mediated EMT. Although RAF inhibitors remain promising therapies, their unintended role in enhancing metastasis raises concerns that may extend beyond liver cancer to other BRAF V600E -driven malignancies.",

We unequivocally unveil that Li + transport in SEI mainly follows a mechanism of successive displacement. We further reveal that in accordance with the spatial dependence of SEI structure across the thickness, the apparent Li + self-diffusivity continuously drops from the SEI–electrolyte side to the SEI–electrode side (6.7 × 10 −19 m 2 /s to 1.0 × 10 −20 m 2 /s), setting a quantitative gauging of both ionic transport behavior of the SEI layer against the underlying electrode and the rate-limiting step of battery operation.

Regulators of hepatic mobilization aside from vitamin A status itself are ill-defined. Here, we show that amino acid (AA) insufficiency by diet (low-protein, leucine-devoid diet) or drug (asparaginase, ASNase) elevated liver RBP4 without depleting hepatic retinoid stores. In addition, ASNase reduced liver TTR protein. Furthermore, circulating ROH–RBP4–TTR levels were attenuated, and retinoid levels in peripheral organs were perturbed. To understand the basis for elevated RBP4 in the liver, we isolated total and polysomal mRNA to assess gene-specific translation. ASNase significantly reduced Rbp4 mRNA translation, indicating that elevated hepatic RBP4 protein was not due to increased protein synthesis. In contrast, ASNase reduced Ttr mRNA abundance but not its translation. Global deletion of the AA insufficiency sensor, general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), lessened ASNase-induced RBP4 protein accumulation in the liver but did not rescue circulating ROH–RBP4 levels. These effects were replicated by chemical inhibition of GCN2 in ASNase-exposed primary hepatocytes. Finally, hepatocyte-specific knockout of autophagy-related 7, an enzyme involved in autophagy and protein secretion, fully rescued circulating ROH–RBP4–TTR and normalized liver RBP4 and TTR during ASNase.

The transduction of mechanical cues into chemical changes modulates cell physiology, allowing a cell to adapt to its microenvironment. Understanding how the chemical and mechanical regulatory modules interact is crucial for elucidating mechanisms of mechanosensation and cellular homeostasis. In this study, we find that cells exhibit nonmonotonic changes in cell volume and intracellular pH when subjected to physical stimuli and varying degrees of actomyosin cytoskeleton disruption. We find that these nonmonotonic responses are mediated by a chemical compensation mechanism, where the attenuation of actomyosin activity stimulates the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway. This, in turn, activates sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), resulting in elevated intracellular pH and increased cell volume. Furthermore, we identify a competitive interaction between the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways—two major regulators of cell proliferation and motility. This competition modulates the chemical compensation based on the relative activities of these pathways. Our mathematical modeling reveals the network structure that is essential for establishing the nonmonotonic response. Interestingly, this regulatory system is altered in HT1080 fibrosarcoma, highlighting a potential mechanistic divergence in cancer cells in contrast to their normal-like counterpart, such as NIH 3T3 and HFF-1 fibroblasts.

The cavity escape times of individual nanoparticles decreased dramatically even with weak fields (2 V/cm), enhancing effective diffusion. However, directional bias was negligible at low field strengths, and became significant only for stronger fields (~7 V/cm). Simulations revealed that at low field strengths, when Brownian motion dominated the nanoparticle dynamics [Péclet number (Pe) &lt; 0.005], the transport was stochastic with accelerated random exploration and cavity escape without directional preference, facilitated by the coordination of weak electrophoresis and electroosmotic (EO) recirculating flow. The combined effect creates localized vortices that position particles closer to internal boundaries, increasing exit encounter probability. At larger Pe values, electrophoretic forces start to overcome the apparently random motion, and establish a preferred migration direction through the porous network. These findings demonstrate the delicate balance between Brownian fluctuations, electrophoretic force, and EO flow in interface-confined and interconnected environments, providing mechanistic insights for optimizing electrokinetic separation in chromatographic columns, separation membranes, and nanocargo delivery systems.",

Mining these data holds significant potential for enhancing disease diagnosis and prognosis, though challenges remain, especially in noncancer contexts. In this study, we developed a statistical framework that links raw histological images and their derived features to the genotype, transcriptome, and chronological age of the samples. We first demonstrated an association between image features and genotypes, identifying 906 image quantitative trait loci (imageQTLs) significantly associated with image features. Next, we identified differentially expressed (DE) genes by stratifying samples into image-similar groups based on image features and performing DE comparisons between groups. Additionally, we developed a deep-learning model that accurately predicts gene expression in specific tissues from raw images and their features, highlighting gene sets associated with observed morphological changes. Finally, we constructed another deep-learning model to predict chronological age directly from raw images and their features, revealing relationships between age and tissue morphology, especially aspects derived from nucleus features. Both models are supported by a computational approach that greatly compresses gigapixel whole-slide images and extracts interpretable nucleus features, integrating both large-scale tissue morphology and smaller local structures. We have made all interpretable nucleus features, imageQTLs, DE genes, and deep-learning models available as online resources for further research.",

He established that the specialized cells called heterocysts that are differentiated by multicellular Anabaena ( Nostoc ) are the sites of biological nitrogen fixation, and went on to reveal mechanisms of prokaryotic development. The Haselkorn lab became a leader more broadly in prokaryotic gene, and later genome, sequencing and annotation.

          "abstract": "Metabolic pathways are typically dysregulated in cancer to support critical cellular processes. In response to metabolic disturbances, cancer cells preferentially manipulate stress sensors to enhance their adaptability. Sestrin 2 (SESN2), a highly conserved protein induced by various stressors, is implicated in this adaptation. Mutations and alterations of SESN2 are prevalent among cancer patients, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression. However, the functions and regulation of SESN2 in cancer, particularly in virus-induced cancer, remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that latent infection with Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) stabilizes and upregulates SESN2 by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation across multiple cell lines. Notably, KSHV-encoded vCyclin, a homolog of cellular Cyclin D, directly interacts with SESN2 and promotes its stabilization by recruiting the deubiquitinase OTUB1, thereby blocking SESN2 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Moreover, vCyclin- and OTUB1-mediated stabilization of SESN2 activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which supports the survival and growth of KSHV-driven primary effusion lymphoma cells. Importantly, the lysine at residue 74 of vCyclin is crucial for its cytosolic localization, OTUB1 recruitment, and subsequent SESN2 upregulation and AMPK activation. These findings unveil a regulatory mechanism for SESN2 involving vCyclin and OTUB1, positioning them as potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with AMPK dysregulation.",

          "abstract": "Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is essential for cells to respond to nutrient deficiency by delivering cytosolic contents to vacuoles for degradation via the formation of a multilayer organelle named an autophagosome. A set of autophagy-related (ATG) regulators are recruited to the phagophore assembly site for phagophore initiation, including its expansion and closure, and subsequent delivery into the vacuole. However, it remains elusive how the phagophore assembly is regulated under different stress conditions. Here, we described an uncharacterized Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) ERC (ELKS/Rab6-interacting/CAST) protein family as an interacting partner of ATG8. ERC1 proteins translocate to the phagophore membrane and develop into ring-like autophagosomes upon autophagic induction. Notably, we found that ERC1 proteins possess the ability to assemble into substantial droplets together with ATG8e proteins prior to ATG8 conjugation to the membrane. Through multiscale characterization, we demonstrated that the ERC1 membraneless droplet represents a distinct type of plant condensate. Additionally, ERC1 directly binds to NBR1 to promote NBR1 degradation. ERC1 dysfunction suppresses the turnover of ubiquitinated substrates and compromises plant tolerance to heat stress. Our study suggests a model for autophagic degradation in response to heat stress by the action of ERC1-mediated biomolecular condensation in Arabidopsis .",

Therefore, developing effective antibodies and vaccines against H7N9 is vital for preventing and controlling major outbreaks.

This antibody recognized the hemagglutinins (HAs) of the representative H7 subtype zoonotic viruses spanning two decades of antigenic evolution and potently neutralized epidemic H7N9 viruses in vitro. Moreover, 6Y13 conferred complete protection in mice against lethal H7N9 challenge in both prophylactic and therapeutic experiments. Structural analysis by cryoelectron microscopy indicated that 6Y13 binds to a unique conserved site on the HA head, distinct from the receptor-binding site and lateral patch. Nevertheless, 6Y13 efficiently blocked viral receptor binding without interfering with HA receptor binding, independent of Fc-mediated steric hindrance.

While bone marrow injury, such as by bone fracture, disrupts marrow vasculature, the consequences for local oxygen tension remain unclear. Here, we show in mice that while the tissue oxygen tension in bone marrow is low (25 mmHg, ~4% O 2 ), intracellular oxygenation is heterogeneous, and erythroid cells are high in oxygen. Bone fracture elevates oxygen tension in the injured bone marrow (&gt;55 mmHg, ~8%), which persists for over a week postinjury. This oxygen elevation results not from angiogenesis, but rather from localized expansion of erythroid precursor cells in the injured bone marrow. Injury-activated erythroid precursors synthesize hemoglobin and concentrate oxygen at the injury site; however, blocking transferrin receptor 1 (CD71)-mediated iron uptake impairs hemoglobin synthesis, reduces local oxygen levels, and enhances bone regeneration through increased angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Together, these findings identify erythroid precursors as active regulators of local oxygen availability in the bone marrow niche, which may be targetable to enhance tissue regeneration.",

Intense experimental and theoretical research has been devoted to establishing the rich nontrivial metallic and heavy fermion phases intertwined with such localized electronic states. Here, we investigate the transition metal oxide spinel LiV 2 O 4 , an enigmatic heavy fermion compound lacking localized f orbital states. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical mean-field theory to reveal a kind of correlation-induced flat band with suppressed interatomic electron hopping arising from intra-atomic Hund’s coupling. The appearance of heavy quasiparticles is ascribed to a proximate orbital-selective Mott state characterized by fluctuating local moments as evidenced by complementary magnetotransport measurements. The spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived quasiparticles and their disappearance with increasing temperature further support the emergence of a high-temperature “bad” metal state observed in transport data. This work resolves a long-standing puzzle on the origin of heavy fermion behavior and unconventional transport in LiV 2 O 4 . Simultaneously, it opens a path to achieving flat bands through electronic interactions in d -orbital systems with geometrical frustration, potentially enabling the realization of exotic phases of matter such as the fractionalized Fermi liquids.",

Cuticle cracks have long been identified as essential for salt to reach the leaf surface but enable a potentially desiccating continuity between the brine and the gland interior. Using the secreting salt gland of Nolana mollis as a model system, we integrate mathematical modeling, imaging, and physiological measurements to examine the mechanical and biochemical processes required for efficient salt removal. We find that the subcuticular space between the concentrated surface brine and the more dilute secreting cell eases the energetic limits of active salt secretion by reducing the concentration gradient of salt across the cell membrane.

The unifying characteristic linking these diverse kinases is that they selectively regulate Pol II at signal-responsive genes. An example of such “direct-at-gene” Pol II regulation is displayed by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase.

Forecasting these impacts requires mechanistic understanding of how Arctic sea ice responds to climate change, but this is limited by scarce long-term records. We present continuous 30,000-year reconstructions of sea-ice coverage from the Arctic Ocean based on measurements of two isotopes, thorium-230 and extraterrestrial helium-3, whose burial ratio changes with sea-ice coverage. We found that the central Arctic was perennially covered by sea ice during the last glaciation. Sea-ice cover retreated during the deglaciation approximately 15,000 years ago, culminating in seasonal sea-ice coverage in the warm early Holocene, before ice coverage increased into the late Holocene. Sea-ice changes closely correlate with biological nutrient consumption, supporting projections of a nutrient-starved central Arctic Ocean with continued sea-ice loss.",

Studies in murine models have identified that the anti-inflammatory activity of IVIG is dependent on sialylation of the N-linked glycan on the CH2 domain of immunoglobulin G (IgG), the type I IgG inhibitory Fc receptor FcγRIIB, and the type II Fc receptor dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN). We hypothesized that DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin, may directly interact with glycans on FcγRIIB, augmenting its ability to bind sialylated IgG. We found that Fc-engineering sialylated IgG1 to enhance its affinity for FcγRIIB resulted in a molecule that was more potent than IVIG in reducing the inflammatory sequelae of antibody or T cell–mediated autoimmune diseases, providing the basis for a class of potent anti-inflammatory therapeutics.",

Purine salvage represses DNPB to prevent excessive purine nucleotide synthesis through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. We identified Nudix hydrolase 5 (NUDT5) as a DNPB regulator. During purine salvage, NUDT5 suppresses DNPB independently of its catalytic function but through interaction with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the DNPB pathway. The NUDT5-PPAT interaction promoted PPAT oligomerization, suppressed PPAT’s enzymatic activity, and facilitated disassembly of the purinosome, a metabolon that functions in DNPB. Disrupting the NUDT5-PPAT interaction overcame DNPB suppression during purine salvage, permitting excessive DNPB and inducing thiopurine resistance. Therefore, NUDT5 governs the balance between DNPB and salvage to maintain appropriate cellular purine nucleotide concentrations.",

By investigating chemical and genetic dependencies caused by mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, cyclohydrolase and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase 1 (MTHFD1), we discovered a key role for Nudix hydrolase 5 (NUDT5) in regulating purine de novo synthesis. Genetic depletion and selective chemical degradation showed that a scaffolding role, rather than NUDT5 enzymatic activity, was causing this phenotype. NUDT5 interacted with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme of purine de novo synthesis, to repress the pathway in response to increased purine abundance. Through this mechanism, loss of NUDT5 mediates resistance to purine analogs in cancer treatment and prevents adenosine toxicity in MTHFD1 deficiency.",

A key difficulty lies in discerning the different energy scales in this strongly interacting system, particularly the superconducting gap. Here, we report simultaneous tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements of magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. This approach allows us to identify two coexisting V-shaped tunneling gaps with different energy scales: a distinct low-energy superconducting gap that vanishes at the superconducting critical temperature and magnetic field, and a higher-energy pseudogap. The superconducting tunneling spectra display a linear gap-filling behavior with temperature and magnetic field and exhibit the Volovik effect, consistent with a nodal order parameter. Our work suggests an unconventional nature of the superconducting gap and establishes an experimental framework for multidimensional investigation of tunable quantum materials.",

Here, we show in the founder crop barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) that dormancy is primarily regulated through a mosaic of locus haplotypes comprising copy-number variation and inherent kinase activity of Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 ( MKK3 ).

The structure revealed that mammalian seipin assembles into two distinct oligomeric forms: undecamers and dodecamers. Adig selectively bound to the dodecameric form and enhanced seipin assembly by bridging and stabilizing adjacent subunits. Functionally, this complex promoted lipid droplet development at both early and late stages.

The negative excess-energy interface can be produced at extremely high density in Ni(Mo) solution with average spacing as small as about 1 nanometer, which inhibits plastic deformation and elevates the strength close to the theoretical value of the alloys. The measured Young’s modulus of the Ni(Mo) alloys increases obviously with the interface density, reaching 254.5 gigapascals, well above that of the same compositional metallic glass and intermetallic compound (Ni 3 Mo).",

By contrast, inverse CISS involves the conversion of spin to a charge current. Using terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, we directly measured an ultrafast charge current due to inverse CISS with picosecond time resolution. Polarity and polarization analysis of the THz emission map the induced charge current direction upon spin injection. We found that a charge current is generated along the spin orientation that changes direction with stereochemical configuration. These observations directly demonstrate the inherent coupling between spin and charge currents in chiral systems, offering key insights into their fundamental dynamics.",

Ctnnb1/Arid2 -driven cancers were much more likely to arise in zone 3. The zone 3 genes Gstm2 and Gstm3 were required for efficient HCC initiation, in part through inhibition of ferroptosis.

Expression of a hypocontractility-linked sarcomeric variant in mice triggered cardiac fibroblast expansion from the de novo formation of hyperproliferative mechanosensitized fibroblast states, which occurred prior to eccentric myocyte remodeling. Initially, this fibroblast response reorganized fibrillar collagen and stiffened the myocardium, albeit without depositing fibrotic tissue. These adaptations coincided with heightened matrix–integrin receptor interactions and diastolic tension sensation at focal adhesions within fibroblasts. Targeted p38 deletion arrested these cardiac fibroblast responses in DCM mice, which prevented cardiomyocyte remodeling and improved contractility. p38-mediated fibroblast responses were essential regulators of DCM severity, marking a potential cellular target for therapeutic intervention.",

A representative sample of 2089 U.S. citizens evaluates whether universities should engage in initiatives such as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), free speech, and environmental sustainability, benchmarking views against corporations. We include an incentivized experiment asking respondents to allocate money between universities based on performance on various dimensions. Results show broad support for engagement in initiatives related to environmental sustainability, well-being, and free speech but opposition to political engagement. Views on DEI are polarized: Women and liberals reward universities excelling in DEI but conservatives and men penalize them, even when academic performance is equal. These findings highlight the polarization surrounding universities’ societal roles.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate text, raising urgent questions about whether their judgments are consistent, unbiased, and robust to framing effects. Here, we examine inter- and intramodel agreement across four state-of-the-art LLMs tasked with evaluating 4800 narrative statements on 24 different topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of 192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified nationality affects evaluation outcomes. Different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intramodel agreement across topics, but this alignment breaks down when source framing is introduced. Attributing statements to Chinese individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models and, in particular, for DeepSeek Reasoner. Our findings show that LLMs’ own judgment of agreement with narrative statements exhibit systematic bias from framing effects, with substantial implications for the neutrality and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems.",

          "abstract": "Social networks are shaped by complex, intersecting identities that drive our connection preferences. These preferences create tie inequalities: Systematic differences in the number of links members of different groups accumulate. Understanding tie inequalities is critical because they contribute to disparities in social capital, with downstream consequences for access to opportunities and resources. Previous research has examined the impact of single-dimensional identities on tie disparities, but when multiple identities intersect, network disadvantages accumulate nonlinearly, disproportionately harming individuals belonging to several disadvantaged groups. However, how multidimensional connection preferences affect network dynamics and amplify or mitigate differences in ties remains unknown. Using a network model, we characterize the effects of multidimensional preferences and attribute correlation. We find that correlation creates counterintuitive tie inequalities unobservable in one-dimensional systems. We calibrate the model with high school friendship data and derive closed-form expressions for tie inequalities, which reproduce the empirical patterns with remarkable accuracy. Our findings have substantial implications for addressing intersectional inequalities in social networks.",

In 2013, five threatened shark species were listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species to regulate global trade and promote recovery. Once listed, any uncertified, unreported export of these species became illegal. Minimal trade was reported from 2015 to 2021, yet fins from four of these species were common in the world’s largest shark fin hub (Hong Kong) throughout this period, indicating substantial and sustained illegal trade. Seventy three of 90 shark fin–exporting nations (81%) have never reported any trade of these species. Mixed stock analysis of a market sample of fins from one listed species revealed six populations of origin but only three were from regions where trade was reported. Broader application of CITES compliance mechanisms is necessary to combat widespread illegal trade of shark fins and realize the conservation potential of these trade regulations.",

          "abstract": "Using original data from the Family Incarceration Costs Survey, we present national estimates of the direct financial costs of family member incarceration. We find that most Americans with an incarcerated family member provide them direct financial support. The median monthly direct expense among those who contribute is $172, which represents 6% of their household income. On average, Blacks and Hispanics incur higher direct expenses than whites despite their lower household incomes. Men and women contribute similar amounts, but these direct expenses reflect a larger share of women’s household income. Poor families’ direct expenses are comparable to those of affluent families and are similar to their spending on health care, utilities, and car-related costs. Together, these results suggest that familial incarceration is a prominent line item that strains marginalized families’ already-tight household budgets and is a substantial yet underappreciated mechanism through which mass incarceration has reshaped the texture of American poverty in recent decades.",

This study examines how nationalistic messages and sentiments propagate on Chinese social media, focusing on interactions between celebrities and fans. We analyzed more than 8 million Weibo microblogs and comments, classified their content using machine-learning techniques, and examined the dynamics between celebrities and fans. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings reveal that fans exert a stronger influence on celebrities than vice versa in spreading nationalism. Fans often shape the nationalist narratives that celebrities amplify, with those aligned with specific political leanings (e.g., within the state-conformist camp) having a greater influence. These results highlight the critical role of grassroots online communities in shaping nationalism in nondemocratic contexts, offering insights into the dynamic interactions between the masses and influential figures in reinforcing nationalist ideologies and sentiments.",

Lead-free double-perovskite semiconductors, such as Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , attract particular interest in this respect due to their structural phase transition and strong carrier-lattice coupling. Here, we reveal that the giant anisotropic photostriction in halide perovskites with tetragonal crystal structure provides an efficient nonthermal tool for generating coherent transverse phonons. Using time-domain Brillouin spectroscopy, we observe transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons with comparable amplitudes in the tetragonal phase of Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 below the temperature of 122 kelvins, while, in the cubic phase, only longitudinal phonons are generated. The polarization of the transverse phonons is dictated by the projection of the crystal c axis on the surface plane, which leads to a prominent anisotropic polarization response in the detection. The generated strain pulses correspond to soft transverse acoustic eigenmodes with a strong temperature dependence of dispersion, providing an additional degree of freedom for hypersonic manipulation.",

Subunit vaccines that contain other domains of Pfs230 have so far failed to induce functional antibodies. Here, we produced eight single-domain fragments of Pfs230 in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells and assessed their immunogenicity in mouse immunizations. In addition to D1-specific antibodies, antibodies raised against D12 showed strong functional transmission-reducing activity in membrane feeding assays with cultured parasites, an activity that was complement dependent. Murine D12-specific antibodies further reduced mosquito transmission of parasites acquired from naturally infected parasite carriers. The D12 antigen was recognized by sera from an all-age cohort of individuals who had been naturally exposed to P. falciparum with antibody levels increasing with age. In conclusion, we identified Pfs230D12 as a promising TBV candidate.",

However, their development is very nascent, largely owing to the imbalance of p- and n-type elastic transistors. Here, we report fully stretchable complementary integrated electronics combining elastic n-type transistors based on metallic carbon nanotube (CNT)–oped poly{[ N , N ′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} with p-type transistors using semiconducting CNT networks. The layered elastomer-semiconductor-elastomer architecture provides both type transistors with stable, well-matched electrical characteristics up to 50% strain. Using these components, we demonstrate stretchable digital logic gates—including inverters, NAND, and NOR—which retain function under large strain. As a system-level demonstration, a complementary inverter active matrix integrated with a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator array realizes a stretchable tactile sensing skin. The stretchable complementary integrated electronics demonstrated here hold promise in many fields, particularly these require seamless integration with dynamic living systems.",

Here, we integrate satellite light detection and ranging (LIDAR) measurements with machine learning to assess the Southern Ocean air-sea CO 2 fluxes between 2007 and 2020. We reveal that CO 2 outgassing south of 50°S was underestimated by up to 40% in previous studies. While the midlatitude Southern Ocean (30° to 50°S) strengthens as a carbon sink, the high-latitude region (50° to 90°S) shows Southern Annular Mode (SAM)–modulated alternation between uptake and outgassing. The air-sea CO 2 partial pressure difference (Δ p CO 2 ) increasingly dominates flux variability over wind-driven transfer velocity. We propose a framework involving three latitudinal loops with differing p CO 2 controls: (i) Antarctic (salinity/sea ice), (ii) polar front (atmospheric CO 2 /chlorophyll), and (iii) subpolar (sea surface temperature/CO 2 ). The findings underscore the winter processes’ critical role and necessitate year-round observations to understand Southern Ocean’s global carbon cycle impact.",

          "abstract": "Chicoric acid, a caffeic acid derivative exhibiting diverse bioactivities, has been identified in more than 60 plant species. Here we report an alternative biosynthetic pathway in lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ). BAHD acyltransferases catalyze the synthesis of chlorogenic acid, which serves as the acyl donor for four serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) acyltransferases (LsSCPL1-4) encoded by tandemly duplicated genes. LsSCPL2 and LsSCPL4 catalyze the synthesis of chicoric acid using caftaric acid as the acyl acceptor. In contrast to the BAHD acyltransferases found in Echinacea species, LsSCPL1 and LsSCPL3 alter their substrate preferences through key amino acid substitutions and use tartaric acid as the acyl acceptor to synthesize caftaric acid. These tandemly duplicated SCPL genes are observed across several evolutionarily related species within the tribe Cichorieae. These findings illustrate the convergent evolution of chicoric acid biosynthesis in Asteraceae and highlight the complexity of acyltransferase activity in specialized metabolism in plants.",

We establish four major findings in adult male rats: (i) BLA projection neurons are necessary and sufficient for stress-induced neuroendocrine activation; (ii) projection populations have a heterogeneous spatial distribution across the BLA; (iii) diverse BLA populations targeting the prelimbic cortex, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, central amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and ventral hippocampus are activated by acute stress, with the location of activated populations biased toward the medial basal amygdala; and (iv) inhibition of singular projections does not recapitulate global inhibition of BLA projection neurons. Together, this suggests that a network of BLA projection populations is broadly activated by acute stress and collectively contribute to neuroendocrine regulation.",

This study demonstrates a real-time Mandarin speech BCI that decodes monosyllabic units directly from neural signals. Using the 256-channel microelectrocorticographic BCI, we achieved robust decoding of a comprehensive set of 394 distinct syllables based purely on neural signals, yielding median syllable identification accuracy of 71.2% in a single-character reading task. Leveraging this high-performing syllable decoder, we further demonstrated real-time sentence decoding. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of a tonally integrated, direct syllable neural decoding approach for Mandarin Chinese, paving the way for full-coverage systems in tonal monosyllabic languages.",

Here, we identify L-type calcium channel (LTCC)–expressing thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) as a critical component regulating both behaviors. ELT-induced excessive LTCC activity in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) RE neurons and its corresponding effects on persistent neuronal activation contribute to increasing susceptibility to aggression and self-harm. Activation of vGlut2 RE neurons projecting to ventral hippocampus (vCA1), but not medial prefrontal cortex, promotes these behaviors in control mice. Furthermore, we found that RE neurons modulate two distinct subsets of vCA1 neurons, with one projecting to the hypothalamus to drive aggression and another to the basal amygdala to mediate self-harm. Our findings uncover how LTCC functions in the RE-to-vCA1 neural pathway increase the risk of aggression and self-harm, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for mitigating destructive behaviors following early adversity.",

Here, we show that dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)–induced colitis severity correlates with compensatory GLP-1 increases, while receptor blockade worsens damage, confirming GLP-1’s protective role during colitis. Fiber deficiency impaired L cell function and GLP-1 release, increasing colitis susceptibility. GLP-1 receptor agonist reversed these effects, restoring barrier integrity and accelerating recovery. We engineered a probiotic, releasing a microbial peptide, that locally elevates GLP-1, which normalized gut parameters in fiber-deprived mice and alleviated colitis via GLP-1–dependent mechanisms, including improved metabolism, antimicrobial defenses , and barrier restoration.

Using mouse hippocampal slices, we showed that l -fucose enhanced excitatory neurotransmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) through regulation of presynaptic release. Such effects required l -fucose be metabolized through the FCSK-driven salvage pathway, suggesting a metabolic-signaling mechanism.

Such abnormalities were corrected by exogenous l -fucose, exemplified by rectification of LTP deficits in 5xFAD hippocampus. A dietary l -fucose supplement, which increased cerebral free l -fucose levels and up-regulated FCSK to drive the salvage pathway, mitigated synaptic and behavioral deficits of 5xFAD mice.

Herein, we implanted an intracortical microelectrode array of 100 electrodes in the visual cortex of two blind volunteers. We recorded the neural activity around the electrodes while performing electrical stimulation to induce visual perceptions. Besides showing how stimulation parameters influence perceptual thresholds, perceived brightness, and the minimum interval required to distinguish separate stimuli, our results indicate that subjective visual experience can be accurately predicted from the recorded neural activity.

We present a method that generates descriptive text mirroring brain representations via semantic features computed by a deep language model. Constructing linear decoding models to translate brain activity induced by videos into semantic features of corresponding captions, we optimized candidate descriptions by aligning their features with brain-decoded features through word replacement and interpolation. This process yielded well-structured descriptions that accurately capture viewed content, even without relying on the canonical language network. The method also generalized to verbalize recalled content, functioning as an interpretive interface between mental representations and text and simultaneously demonstrating the potential for nonverbal thought–based brain-to-text communication, which could provide an alternative communication pathway for individuals with language expression difficulties, such as aphasia.",

Here, we applied three-dimensional minimal flux optical nanoscopy to mouse IHC-SGN synapses to chart the positions of key pre- and postsynaptic proteins with single-digit nanometer resolution. We demonstrate that nanoclusters of ion channels and their interacting proteins govern the topography of AZs and postsynaptic densities (PSDs).

The structures reveal a bilobed architecture highlighting HP coordinated action at the replication fork and providing a structural basis for HP inhibition by illustrating precisely how pritelivir and amenamevir block helicase activity. Data lay a solid foundation for the development of improved antiviral therapies.",

          "abstract": "Flexible goal-directed behavior relies on selecting relevant internal goal representations and external sensations. Yet, these selection processes have classically been studied in isolation, leaving unclear how they are coordinated in time to support behavior. To address this, we developed a visual search task to simultaneously track selection among internal search goals held in working memory and external search targets in the environment. Capitalizing on sensitive gaze and neural markers, we provide proof-of-principle evidence in humans that internal and external selection processes do not necessarily take turns in a strictly serial manner but can develop concurrently. These concurrent processes are supported by largely nonoverlapping neural activity patterns in the human brain and can be performed effectively even when engaging opposite spatial locations in working memory and perception. Our findings challenge views portraying brain states as being either internally or externally focused and bring insight into how internal and external selection processes work together to yield efficient search behavior.",

In materials with exceptionally strong light-matter interaction, excitons can hybridize with photons without the need of an external cavity. Here, we report the electrical excitation of such self-hybridized polaritons in the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. We exploit an unconventional excitation via energy transfer from tunneling electrons in graphene tunnel junctions to strongly bound excitons in proximate CrSBr layers. This enables us to excite CrSBr crystals ranging in thickness from a bilayer up to 250 nanometers, with the strong linear polarization of the electroluminescence confirming the excitonic origin. We assign the electrically excited emission to self-hybridized exciton polaritons, highlighting the strong coupling between optical excitations and confined photon modes in CrSBr. Our findings not only offer an efficient method to generate polaritons electrically but also create opportunities for future spintronic devices.",

Although advances such as acoustic analogs of the Zel’dovich effect and the observation of negative resistance in low-frequency electromagnetic models have been reported, genuine positive signal gain, spontaneous emission of electromagnetic waves, and runaway amplification have not previously been verified. Here, we provide the first experimental demonstration that a mechanically rotating metallic cylinder acts as an amplifier of a rotating electromagnetic field mode. Moreover, when combined with a low-loss resonator, the system becomes unstable and operates as a generator seeded only by noise. The exponential runaway amplification of spontaneously generated electromagnetic modes is observed, establishing the electromagnetic analog of the Press-Teukolsky black hole bomb and paving the way to experimental tests of quantum friction from vacuum fluctuations.",

To date, the only place where a direct measurement of Enceladus’s heat loss has been made is at the south pole. Here, we show that the north pole also emits heat at a greater rate than can be explained by purely passive models. By comparing winter and summer observations taken with the Cassini Composite InfraRed Spectrometer, we find a winter temperature ~7 kelvin warmer than passive modeling predicts, accounting for uncertainties in emissivity and thermal inertia. An additional endogenic heat flux of 46 ± 4 milliwatts per square meter is required to match the observed radiance. The implied local shell thickness is 20 to 23 kilometers—consistent with the higher end of thickness models based on gravity, topography, and libration measurements. This work provides a previously unidentified constraint for models of tidal heat production, shell thickness, and the long-term evolution of Enceladus’ ocean.",

While CRISPR-based cellular barcoding is powerful for lineage tracing, many platforms suffer from low efficiency and limited compatibility with single-cell transcriptomics. We developed Oligo-CALL (Oligonucleotide-inducible CRISPR transcriptional activator–Assisted Lineage Labeling), an advanced barcoding system enabling precise lineage tracing, live clone isolation, and seamless integration with single-cell RNA sequencing. Applied to lung cancer cells treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor, Oligo-CALL identified clones consistently enriched posttreatment, supporting a model of predestined resistance. Oligo-CALL achieved &gt;95% efficiency in linking lineage identity to transcriptomes, uncovering diverse clone-specific pathways with underlying resistance. Paired analysis of barcode-matched clones from naïve and resistant populations revealed transient and fixed resistance phenotypes. Notably, DNA repair pathways are recurrently altered in resistant clones, and inhibition of poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate–ribose) polymerase synergizes with KRAS G12C inhibition to overcome resistance. Together, Oligo-CALL provides a versatile platform for dissecting lineage evolution and molecular dynamics of targeted therapy resistance.",

We found that inhaled NPs triggered rapid, neutrophil recruitment, localized to alveolar NP deposition hotspots, orchestrated by alveolar macrophages (AMs) through both their motility and phagocytic activity. AM motility inhibition in the alveoli via intercellular adhesion molecule–1/LFA-1 blockade reduced neutrophil recruitment, as did impaired AM phagocytosis through C5a receptor 1/Fc-γ receptor I inhibition or by stealth NP surfaces. In addition, cellular degranulation inhibition indicated the importance of spatially focused cytokine release in neutrophil recruitment.

In this study, we analyzed noble gases in Archean hydrothermal quartz fluid inclusions and show that a modern atmospheric 20 Ne/ 22 Ne ratio was almost reached 2.7 Ga ago, implying intense mantle degassing during the first 1.7 billion years of Earth’s history, three orders of magnitude higher than today.

Its center was marked by a large cruciform cache containing the earliest known directional color symbols in Mesoamerica. The overall pattern consisted of 9- and 7.5-kilometer-long axes delineated by canals and corridors. The builders constructed canals, measuring up to 35 meters wide and 5 meters deep, and a dam to supply them with lake water.

A notable example is the energy spectrum of a widely studied rotating flow—the turbulent Taylor-Couette (TC) flow. Previous studies have shown that, unlike other canonical turbulent flows, it does not obey Kolmogorov’s universal power law or any other power law. Here, we report measurements of the energy spectra in turbulent TC flow from unique “flying-wire” experiments where a rotating probe sweeps through the flow. In contrast with previous studies, which focused primarily on spectral power laws, we analyze spectral data collapse. Through this broader approach, we show that, contrary to the prevailing understanding, the spectral structure of small scales in turbulent TC flow is in excellent accord with the potent paradigm of Kolmogorov’s small-scale universality.",

We report secreted Dickkopf (DKK) proteins—DKK1 through DKK4—as previously unrecognized ligands of low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 1 (LRP1), a principal Aβ clearance receptor. Analyses of cells derived from a patient with AD, postmortem tissue, and 5×FAD mice reveal that DKK1 and DKK3 are elevated in AD and reduce Aβ uptake and degradation in neurons and astrocytes. Mechanistically, DKKs inhibit Aβ clearance by competitively binding LRP1 and promoting its internalization. In 5×FAD mice, DKK3 overexpression worsens, while knockout improves, Aβ pathology and cognitive outcomes. A targeted high-throughput screen of ~3000 compounds identified SJ-300 as a potent and selective inhibitor of the DKK3-LRP1 interaction. SJ-300 restores Aβ clearance and rescues cognitive function and neuropathology in 5×FAD mice. These findings uncover DKK3-LRP1 axis as a contributor for Aβ metabolism and nominate SJ-300 as a promising therapeutic candidate for AD intervention.",

Using a structural equation measurement model, we compare how reproductive effort affects the life span of 4684 women exposed across different life stages, or not at all, to the Great Finnish Famine. We find that life-span costs of reproduction became higher in mothers exposed to the famine during reproduction and, for these mothers, amounted to lower life expectancies of ~0.5 years per child. Conversely, reproduction did not shape the life spans of mothers not exposed to the famine or exposed postreproduction or during development. This natural experiment reveals how environmental adversity can influence reproductive costs, providing a biological explanation for previous inconsistent findings while showing how reproductive behavior has shaped the evolution of aging in humans.",

Diversity in reef-supporting regions is on average two- to threefold higher than in non–reef-supporting regions and has been remarkably stable over timescales of tens to hundreds of millions of years. This signal is present in both reefal and non-reefal facies within reef-supporting regions, suggesting that reefs enriched diversity in surrounding environments. Sepkoski’s “Modern Fauna,” an assemblage of higher taxa that includes gastropods, bivalves, and echinoids, has been a key component of reef-supporting regions since the Paleozoic, contrasting with its later rise to dominance in non–reef-supporting regions during the later Mesozoic-Cenozoic.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms around how NAD + enhances neuronal resilience, especially whether it has any effect on ASEs, have remained elusive. This study shows that NAD + augmentation corrects the ASEs of many genes via a key protein, EVA1C (epithelial V-like antigen 1 homolog C), which is involved in neuronal development and activities. EVA1C is reduced in the hippocampus in patients with AD compared to cognitively normal ones. NAD + -induced memory retention is partially dependent on EVA1C, as adeno-associated virus–based Eva1c knockdown in the hippocampal CA1 region annuls NAD + -induced memory improvement in pathological Tau–bearing mice. We propose that NAD + reduces AD pathologies, at least partially, via amplification of the NAD + - EVA1C splicing axis, pointing to a potential splice-switching therapy for AD.",

Our computational model examines DD-induced neural activity changes and synaptic reorganization in the BG subcircuit comprising the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus externus. Calcium-dependent synaptic and structural plasticity mechanisms were incorporated, allowing neural activity to alter network topology. We show how hyperactivity of indirect pathway striatal projection neurons (iMSN) can induce synaptic connectivity changes consistent with PD animal models. Our results suggest that synaptic reorganization following DD results from a series of homeostatic calcium–based synaptic changes triggered by iMSN hyperactivity. While this structural plasticity functions as a compensatory mechanism in the cascade of changes following elevated iMSN input from striatal DD, it may become compromised if iMSN and cortical inputs show substantial bursting activity.",

Endorheic basins form where uplift on faults exceeds incision. A decrease in shortening after ~10 Ma allows rivers to compete with uplift and incise into endorheic basins at the plateau edge. Two modeled basin capture events at ~7 to 5 Ma and ~3.5 to 0.5 Ma, coupled with climate-driven discharge fluctuations, markedly increase rivers’ discharge, erosion, and sediment transport, facilitating canyon incision and highlighting the importance of basin captures in canyon formation along the northeastern edge of the Andean Plateau.",

Using presynaptic optical recordings of synaptic vesicle fusion, calcium influx in D1-MSN synapses together with postsynaptic patch-clamp recordings from SNr neurons, we found that DA inhibits D1-MSN GABA release in a frequency-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, this effect was independent of DA receptors and instead required 5-HT1B receptor activation. Using two-photon serotonin biosensor imaging in slices and fiber photometry in vivo, we demonstrate that DA enhances extracellular serotonin in the SNr via inhibition of serotonin reuptake.

          "abstract": "Insulin-producing β cell replacement therapies show promise for treating type 1 diabetes (T1D), but challenges such as donor shortages and immune rejection persist. Stem cell–derived β cells (sBC) provide a renewable source but remain susceptible to immune attack. We engineered human pluripotent stem cells to express either the wild type (WT) or a high-affinity mutant (Mut) variant (rs1058402, G&gt;A; Ala 67 Thr) of the natural killer (NK) and T cell checkpoint inhibitor CD155 before differentiation into sBC. Modified sBC maintained up-regulated CD155 expression and showed enhanced binding to co-receptor ligands. Co-culture studies revealed CD155-expressing sBC suppressed autoreactive CD8 + T cell and NK cell activation, reducing immune cell–mediated sBC destruction and cytotoxic molecule secretion by preferentially engaging the coinhibitory receptor TIGIT. This protection was lost with TIGIT blockade, affirming the role of CD155-TIGIT signaling in antagonizing immune cell cytotoxicity. Our findings suggest that high-affinity CD155 expression enhances immune evasion of sBC, improving their potential as a therapy for T1D.",

          "abstract": "Metazoans comprise diverse tissues and cell types, each essential for the organismal survival. Most of these types are established early in embryogenesis and persist into adulthood. In indirectly developing sea urchins, however, the continuity between embryonic and adult stages is interrupted by a planktonic larval stage that undergoes complete metamorphosis. While gene regulatory networks controlling embryonic and larval lineages are well studied, the molecular and morphological identities of postmetamorphic cell types remain poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed the cell atlas of postmetamorphic Paracentrotus lividus juveniles using single-nucleus transcriptomics, revealing conservation of regulatory mechanisms. We identified signatures of eight distinct cell type groups and analyzed 29 neuronal families, including 15 unique photoreceptor types. By combining transcriptomics, spatial analysis, and ultrastructure, we identified vertebrate neuronal and opsin homologs expressed across the juvenile. These findings show that the echinoderm body plan is predominantly head-like and exhibits an “all-brain” organization.",

          "abstract": "Polymeric immunoglobulins are essential components of the immune system in jawed vertebrates. While mammalian immunoglobulin M (IgM) typically forms a pentamer linked by the joining chain (J-chain), Xenopus laevis IgX can assemble into a J-chain–independent polymer. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of IgX, revealing its hexameric configuration. By incorporating the IgX tailpiece into human IgM, we achieved efficient IgM hexamer formation. Truncating IgM’s natural tailpiece to a range of 11 to 16 residues also substantially enhanced hexamerization efficiency. Furthermore, introducing a shortened IgM tailpiece to IgG resulted in effective IgG hexamer formation. We further show that the engineered IgM and IgG hexamers targeting CD20 demonstrated robust complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against several B lymphoma cells. In addition, the IgG-Fc hexamer functioned as a decoy, attenuating CDC in cell cultures. These findings deepen our understanding of polymeric immunoglobulin evolution and introduce innovative strategies for the development of IgM- and IgG-based biologics.",

          "abstract": "Advancing next-generation bioelectronic interfaces requires devices that are soft, miniaturized, and seamlessly integrated with biological tissues. However, conventional fabrication methods, primarily based on UV photolithography, struggle to meet these needs, relying on hazardous chemicals, labor-intensive processes, and planar, layer-by-layer construction. To overcome these limits, we introduce dynamically autofocused 3D pulsed laser micromachining (d-3DPLM) using a nanosecond pulsed near-infrared laser. This approach enables rapid, cost-effective structuring of diverse materials, including thin films, metal foils, and bulk metal blocks, supporting monolithic, multilayer bioelectronics with complex 3D architectures such as microneedles and deployable elements. d-3DPLM achieves high-resolution ablation and patterning for conformable and functional device geometries. Demonstrated applications include electro-haptic patches, in vitro multielectrode diagnostic arrays, and wireless contact lenses for red light therapy. By broadening the design and manufacturing landscape for bioelectronic systems, this versatile method paves the way for improved performance, unique functionality, and enhanced integration with living tissue.",

          "abstract": "Offshore wind farms may induce changes in the upper ocean and near-surface atmosphere through coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. Yet, the role of air-sea interactions mediated by offshore wind farms remains poorly understood. Using fully coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave model simulations for seasonally stratified conditions along the US East Coast, we show that simulated cumulative reductions in wind stress due to large-scale wind farm clusters lead to sea surface warming of 0.3° to 0.4°C and a shallower mixed layer. This warming drives upward heat fluxes, destabilizing the atmospheric boundary layer and enhancing wind stress, which partially offsets wake-induced wind deficits. These wake-ocean interactions influence near-surface meteorology and air-sea fluxes, suggesting that a coupled modeling approach may be necessary for assessing potential oceanographic impacts of offshore wind developments. However, ocean coupling exerts limited influence on winds at turbine-relevant heights or within downstream wakes, resulting in minimal impact on long-term energy. These findings suggest that models without ocean coupling may be adequate for wind energy applications.",

          "abstract": "The development of regioselective methods for C(sp 3 )─Br bond formation in unactivated alkenes remains a fundamental challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a nickel hydride–catalyzed method that enables regiocontrolled hydrobromination of both terminal and internal alkenes through strategic deployment of an N -fluoropyridinium oxidant. The method features two complementary approaches: direct hydrobromination of alkenes with high proximal selectivity and a chain-walking strategy that enables switchable site-selective functionalization in extended alkyl chains. Notably, temperature-controlled reaction parameters enable regiodivergent access to β- or γ-brominated products from identical alkenes with excellent selectivity. The protocol demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and enables late-stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium labeling, radical clock experiments, and density functional theory calculations, revealed a radical-mediated pathway featuring temperature-dependent regioselectivity in the chain-walking process. This unified method provides a versatile platform to access diverse alkyl bromides and offers fundamental insights into selective C─Br bond construction through direct and chain-walking pathways.",
