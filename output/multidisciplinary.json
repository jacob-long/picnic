Challenges include sufficient cardiomyocyte retention for a sustainable therapeutic impact without intolerable side effects, such as arrhythmia and tumour growth. We investigated the hypothesis that epicardial engineered heart muscle (EHM) allografts from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells structurally and functionally remuscularize the chronically failing heart without limiting side effects in rhesus macaques. After confirmation of in vitro and in vivo (nude rat model) equivalence of the newly developed rhesus macaque EHM model with a previously established Good Manufacturing Practice-compatible human EHM formulation 8 , long-term retention (up to 6 months) and dose-dependent enhancement of the target heart wall by EHM grafts constructed from 40 to 200 million cardiomyocytes/stromal cells were demonstrated in macaques with and without myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. In the heart failure model, evidence for EHM allograft-enhanced target heart wall contractility and ejection fraction, which are measures for local and global heart support, was obtained. Histopathological and gadolinium-based perfusion magnetic resonance imaging analyses confirmed cell retention and functional vascularization. Arrhythmia and tumour growth were not observed. The obtained feasibility, safety and efficacy data provided the pivotal underpinnings for the approval of a first-in-human clinical trial on tissue-engineered heart repair. Our clinical data confirmed remuscularization by EHM implantation in a patient with advanced heart failure.",

          "abstract": "The fate of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) 1 is the largest cause of uncertainty in long-term sea-level projections. In the last interglacial (LIG) around 125,000 years ago, data suggest that sea level was several metres higher than today 2–4 , and required a significant contribution from Antarctic ice loss, with WAIS usually implicated. Antarctica and the Southern Ocean were warmer than today 5–8 , by amounts comparable to those expected by 2100 under moderate to high future warming scenarios. However, direct evidence about the size of WAIS in the LIG is sparse. Here we use sea salt data from an ice core from Skytrain Ice Rise, adjacent to WAIS, to show that, during most of the LIG, the Ronne Ice Shelf was still in place, and close to its current extent. Water isotope data are consistent with a retreat of WAIS 9 , but seem inconsistent with more dramatic model realizations 10 in which both WAIS and the large Antarctic ice shelves were lost. This new constraint calls for a reappraisal of other elements of the LIG sea-level budget. It also weakens the observational basis that motivated model simulations projecting the highest end of projections for future rates of sea-level rise to 2300 and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Crosslinked thermosets are highly durable materials, but overcoming their petrochemical origins and inability to be recycled poses a grand challenge1,2,3. Many strategies to access crosslinked polymers that are bioderived or degradable-by-design have been proposed, but they require several resource-intensive synthesis and purification steps and are not yet feasible alternatives to conventional consumer materials4,5,6,7,8. Here we present a modular, one-pot synthesis of degradable thermosets from the commercially available, biosourced monomer 2,3-dihydrofuran (DHF)9. In the presence of a ruthenium catalyst and photoacid generator, DHF undergoes slow ring-opening metathesis polymerization to give a soft polymer; then, exposure to light triggers strong acid generation and promotes the cationic polymerization of the same DHF monomer to spatially crosslink and strengthen the material10,11,12. By manipulating catalyst loading and light exposure, we can access materials with physical properties spanning orders of magnitude and achieve spatially resolved material domains. Importantly, the DHF-based thermosets undergo stimuli-selective degradation and can be recycled to the monomer under mild heating. The use of two distinct polymerization mechanisms on a single functional group allows the synthesis of degradable and recyclable thermoset materials with precisely controlled properties.",

Turnover rates differ markedly among communities4, but the drivers of this variation across taxa and realms remain unknown. Here we analyse 42,225 time series of species composition from marine, terrestrial and freshwater assemblages, and show that temporal rates of turnover were consistently faster in locations that experienced faster temperature change, including both warming and cooling. In addition, assemblages with limited access to microclimate refugia or that faced stronger human impacts on land were especially responsive to temperature change, with up to 48% of species replaced per decade. These results reveal a widespread signal of vulnerability to continuing climate change and highlight which ecological communities are most sensitive, raising concerns about ecosystem integrity as climate change and other human impacts accelerate.",

However, low- and middle-income countries, in which approximately 84% of the world’s population lives1, are not equitably represented in large-scale gut microbiome research2,3,4. Here we present the AWI-Gen 2 Microbiome Project, a cross-sectional gut microbiome study sampling 1,801 women from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. By engaging with communities that range from rural and horticultural to post-industrial and urban informal settlements, we capture a far greater breadth of the world’s population diversity. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we identify taxa with geographic and lifestyle associations, including Treponema and Cryptobacteroides species loss and Bifidobacterium species gain in urban populations. We uncover 1,005 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes, and we identify antibiotic susceptibility as a factor that might drive Treponema succinifaciens absence in urban populations. Finally, we find an HIV infection signature defined by several taxa not previously associated with HIV, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Enterocloster sp. This study represents the largest population-representative survey of gut metagenomes of African individuals so far, and paired with extensive clinical biomarkers and demographic data, provides extensive opportunity for microbiome-related discovery.",

          "abstract": "The Casarabe culture (500–1400 ce ), spreading over roughly 4,500 km 2 of the monumental mounds region of the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia, is one of the clearest examples of urbanism in pre-Columbian (pre-1492 ce ) Amazonia. It exhibits a four-tier hierarchical settlement pattern, with hundreds of monumental mounds interconnected by canals and causeways 1,2 . Despite archaeological evidence indicating that maize was cultivated by this society 3 , it is unknown whether it was the staple crop and which type of agricultural farming system was used to support this urban-scale society. Here, we address this issue by integration of remote sensing, field survey and microbotanical analyses, which shows that the Casarabe culture invested heavily in landscape engineering, constructing a complex system of drainage canals (to drain excess water during the rainy season) and newly documented savannah farm ponds (to retain water in the dry season). Phytolith analyses of 178 samples from 18 soil profiles in drained fields, farm ponds and forested settings record the singular and ubiquitous presence of maize ( Zea mays ) in pre-Columbian fields and farm ponds, and an absence of evidence for agricultural practices in the forest. Collectively, our findings show how the Casarabe culture managed the savannah landscape for intensive year-round maize monoculture that probably sustained its relatively large population. Our results have implications for how we conceive agricultural systems in Amazonia, and show an example of a Neolithic-like, grain-based agrarian economy in the Amazon.",

          "abstract": "Soil alkalinization and global warming are predicted to pose major challenges to agriculture in the future, as they continue to accelerate, markedly reducing global arable land and crop yields1,2. Therefore, strategies for future agriculture are needed to further improve globally cultivated, relatively high-yielding Green Revolution varieties (GRVs) derived from the SEMIDWARF 1 (SD1) gene3,4. Here we propose that precise regulation of the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) to optimal levels is the key to not only confer alkali–thermal tolerance to GRVs, but also to further enhance their yield. Endogenous modulation of ALKALI-THERMAL TOLERANCE 1/2 (ATT1/2), quantitative trait loci encoding GA20-oxidases or exogenous application of GA minimized rice yield loss affected by sodic soils. Mechanistically, high GA concentrations induce reactive oxygen species over-accumulation, whereas low GA concentrations repress the expression of stress-tolerance genes by means of DELLA–NGR5-mediated H3K27me3 methylation. We further showed that ATT1 induces large fluctuations in GA levels, whereas ATT2 is the ideal candidate for fine-tuning GA concentrations to appropriate levels to balance reactive oxygen species and H3K27me3 methylation to improve alkali–thermal tolerance and yield. Thus, ATT2 is expected to be a potential new post-Green Revolution gene that could be harnessed to develop and use marginal lands for sustainable agriculture in the future.",

          "abstract": "Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a genetically engineered therapy that is highly effective against B cell malignancies and multiple myeloma1. However, the length and cost of personalized manufacturing limits access and leaves patients vulnerable to disease progression. Allogeneic cell therapies have the potential to increase patient access and improve treatment outcomes but are limited by immune rejection2,3. To devise a strategy to protect allogeneic CAR T cells from host immune cells, we turned to lymphotropic viruses that have evolved integrated mechanisms for immune escape of virus-infected lymphocytes4. We find that viral evasins that partially reduce HLA class I expression can shelter CAR T cells from mismatched CD8+ T cells without triggering ‘missing-self’ rejection by NK cells. However, this protection alone is insufficient to sustain effective allogeneic CAR T cell therapy. HIV-1 Nef uniquely also acts through the serine-threonine kinase Pak2 to abate activation-induced cell death and promote survival of CAR T cells in vivo. Thus, virus-like immune escape can harness multiple mechanisms that act in concert to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic CAR T cells.",

          "abstract": "Dielectric-based energy storage capacitors characterized with fast charging and discharging speed and reliability1,2,3,4 play a vital role in cutting-edge electrical and electronic equipment. In pursuit of capacitor miniaturization and integration, dielectrics must offer high energy density and efficiency5. Antiferroelectrics with antiparallel dipole configurations have been of significant interest for high-performance energy storage due to their negligible remanent polarization and high maximum polarization in the field-induced ferroelectric state6,7,8. However, the low antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase-transition field and accompanying large hysteresis loss deteriorate energy density and reliability. Here, guided by phase-field simulations, we propose a new strategy to frustrate antipolar ordering in antiferroelectrics by incorporating non-polar or polar components. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively tunes the antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase-transition fields and simultaneously reduces hysteresis loss. In PbZrO3-based films, we hence realized a record high energy density among all antiferroelectrics of 189 J cm−3 along with a high efficiency of 81% at an electric field of 5.51 MV cm−1, which rivals the most state-of-the-art energy storage dielectrics9,10,11,12. Atomic-scale characterization by scanning transmission electron microscopy directly revealed that the dispersed non-polar regions frustrate the long-range antipolar ordering, which contributes to the improved performance. This strategy presents new opportunities to manipulate polarization profiles and enhance energy storage performances in antiferroelectrics.",

          "abstract": "Since the onset of the pandemic, many SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, exhibiting substantial evolution in the virus’ spike protein 1 , the main target of neutralizing antibodies 2 . A plausible hypothesis proposes that the virus evolves to evade antibody-mediated neutralization (vaccine- or infection-induced) to maximize its ability to infect an immunologically experienced population 1,3 . Because viral infection induces neutralizing antibodies, viral evolution may thus navigate on a dynamic immune landscape that is shaped by local infection history. Here we developed a comprehensive mechanistic model, incorporating deep mutational scanning data 4,5 , antibody pharmacokinetics and regional genomic surveillance data, to predict the variant-specific relative number of susceptible individuals over time. We show that this quantity precisely matched historical variant dynamics, predicted future variant dynamics and explained global differences in variant dynamics. Our work strongly suggests that the ongoing pandemic continues to shape variant-specific population immunity, which determines a variant’s ability to transmit, thus defining variant fitness. The model can be applied to any region by utilizing local genomic surveillance data, allows contextualizing risk assessment of variants and provides information for vaccine design.",

Infections in bats are largely asymptomatic2,3, indicating limited tissue-damaging inflammation and immunopathology. To investigate the genomic basis of disease resistance, the Bat1K project generated reference-quality genomes of ten bat species, including potential viral reservoirs. Here we describe a systematic analysis covering 115 mammalian genomes that revealed that signatures of selection in immune genes are more prevalent in bats than in other mammalian orders. We found an excess of immune gene adaptations in the ancestral chiropteran branch and in many descending bat lineages, highlighting viral entry and detection factors, and regulators of antiviral and inflammatory responses. ISG15, which is an antiviral gene contributing to hyperinflammation during COVID-19 (refs. 4,5), exhibits key residue changes in rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats. Cellular infection experiments show species-specific antiviral differences and an essential role of protein conjugation in antiviral function of bat ISG15, separate from its role in secretion and inflammation in humans. Furthermore, in contrast to humans, ISG15 in most rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats has strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our work reveals molecular mechanisms that contribute to viral tolerance and disease resistance in bats.",

The extent to which this negative effect varies among grassland types and over time in response to multi-year extreme drought remains unclear. Here, using a coordinated distributed experiment that simulated four years of growing-season drought (around 66% rainfall reduction), we compared drought sensitivity within and among six representative grasslands spanning broad precipitation gradients in each of Eurasia and North America—two of the Northern Hemisphere’s largest grass-dominated regions. Aboveground plant production declined substantially with drought in the Eurasian grasslands and the effects accumulated over time, while the declines were less severe and more muted over time in the North American grasslands. Drought effects on species richness shifted from positive to negative in Eurasia, but from negative to positive in North America over time. The differing responses of plant production in these grasslands were accompanied by less common (subordinate) plant species declining in Eurasian grasslands but increasing in North American grasslands. Our findings demonstrate the high production sensitivity of Eurasian compared with North American grasslands to extreme drought (43.6% versus 25.2% reduction), and the key role of subordinate species in determining impacts of extreme drought on grassland productivity.",

This protein catalyses the oxidation of VK hydroquinone to convert specific glutamate residues to γ-carboxyglutamate residues in VK-dependent proteins (VDPs), which are involved in various essential biological processes and diseases1,2,3. However, the working mechanism of GGCX remains unclear. Here we report three cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human GGCX: in the apo state, bound to osteocalcin (a VDP) and bound to VK. The propeptide of the VDP binds to the lumenal domain of GGCX, which stabilizes transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of GGCX to create the VK-binding pocket. After binding of VK, residue Lys218 in GGCX mediates the oxidation of VK hydroxyquinone, which leads to the deprotonation of glutamate residues and the construction of γ-carboxyglutamate residues. Our structural observations and results from binding and cell biological assays and molecular dynamics simulations show that a cholesterol molecule interacts with the transmembrane helices of GGCX to regulate its protein levels in cells. Together, these results establish a link between cholesterol metabolism and VK-dependent pathways.",

Following pathogen recognition by nucleotide binding-domain, leucine-rich, repeat-containing (NLR) proteins, CARDs recruit and activate caspases, which, in turn, activate gasdermin pore-forming proteins to induce pyroptotic cell death2. Here we show that CARD domains are present in defence systems that protect bacteria against phage. The bacterial CARD domain is essential for protease-mediated activation of certain bacterial gasdermins, which promote cell death once phage infection is recognized. We further show that multiple anti-phage defence systems use CARD domains to activate a variety of cell death effectors, and that CARD domains mediate protein–protein interactions in these systems. We find that these systems are triggered by a conserved immune-evasion protein used by phages to overcome the bacterial defence system RexAB3, demonstrating that phage proteins inhibiting one defence system can activate another. Our results suggest that CARD domains represent an ancient component of innate immune systems conserved from bacteria to humans, and that CARD-dependent activation of gasdermins is shared in organisms across the tree of life.",

Modulating γ-carboxylation level provides prevalent treatments for hemorrhagic and thromboembolic diseases5. This unique posttranslational modification requires vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) to drive highly demanding reactions6 catalyzed by the membrane-integrated γ-carboxylase (VKGC). To decipher underlying mechanisms, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VKGC in unbound form, with KH2 and four hemostatic and non-hemostatic proteins possessing propeptides and glutamate-rich domains in different carboxylation states. VKGC recognizes substrate proteins via knob-and-hole interactions with propeptides, thereby bringing tethered glutamate-containing segments for processive carboxylation within a large chamber that provides steric control. Propeptide binding also triggers a global conformational change to signal VKGC activation. Through sequential deprotonation and KH2 epoxidation, VKGC generates free hydroxide ion as an exceptionally strong base required to deprotonate the γ-carbon of glutamate for CO2 addition. The diffusion of this superbase, protected and guided by a sealed hydrophobic tunnel, elegantly resolves the challenge of coupling KH2 epoxidation to γ-carboxylation across the membrane interface. These structural insights and extensive functional experiments advance membrane enzymology and propel the development of novel treatments for γ-carboxylation disorders.",

          "abstract": "During normal cellular homeostasis, unfolded and mislocalized proteins are recognized and removed, preventing the build-up of toxic byproducts 1 . When protein homeostasis is perturbed during ageing, neurodegeneration or cellular stress, proteins can accumulate several forms of chemical damage through reactive metabolites 2,3 . Such modifications have been proposed to trigger the selective removal of chemically marked proteins 3–6 ; however, identifying modifications that are sufficient to induce protein degradation has remained challenging. Here, using a semi-synthetic chemical biology approach coupled to cellular assays, we found that C-terminal amide-bearing proteins (CTAPs) are rapidly cleared from human cells. A CRISPR screen identified FBXO31 as a reader of C-terminal amides. FBXO31 is a substrate receptor for the SKP1–CUL1–F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF–FBXO31, which ubiquitylates CTAPs for subsequent proteasomal degradation. A conserved binding pocket enables FBXO31 to bind to almost any C-terminal peptide bearing an amide while retaining exquisite selectivity over non-modified clients. This mechanism facilitates binding and turnover of endogenous CTAPs that are formed after oxidative stress. A dominant human mutation found in neurodevelopmental disorders reverses CTAP recognition, such that non-amidated neosubstrates are now degraded and FBXO31 becomes markedly toxic. We propose that CTAPs may represent the vanguard of a largely unexplored class of modified amino acid degrons that could provide a general strategy for selective yet broad surveillance of chemically damaged proteins.",

However, the origin of these chemicals remains unclear5,6 as there are no known energy metabolisms that generate methylated compounds de novo as a major product. Here we identified an energy metabolism in the subsurface-derived thermophilic anaerobe Zhaonella formicivorans7 that catalyses the conversion of formate to methanol, thereby producing methanol without requiring methylated compounds as an input. Cultivation experiments showed that formate-driven methanologenesis is inhibited by the accumulation of methanol. However, this limitation can be overcome through methanol consumption by a methylotrophic partner methanogen, Methermicoccus shengliensis. This symbiosis represents a fourth mode of mutualistic cross-feeding driven by thermodynamic necessity (syntrophy), previously thought to rely on transfer of hydrogen, formate or electrons8,9,10. The unusual metabolism and syntrophy provide insights into the enigmatic presence of methylated compounds in subsurface methanogenic ecosystems and demonstrate how organisms survive at the thermodynamic limit through metabolic symbiosis.",

The key challenge is achieving selectivity for one particular C(sp3)−H bond1,2,3. In recent years, metalloenzymes have been found to perform C(sp3)−H bond functionalization4,5. Despite substantial progresses in the past two decades6,7, enzymatic halogenation and pseudohalogenation of unactivated C(sp3)−H—providing a functional handle for further modification—have been achieved with only non-haem iron/α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases, and are therefore limited by the chemistry possible with these enzymes8. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a previously unknown halogenase ApnU, part of a protein family containing domain of unknown function 3328 (DUF3328). ApnU uses copper in its active site to catalyse iterative chlorinations on multiple unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds. By taking advantage of the softer copper centre, we demonstrate that ApnU can catalyse unprecedented enzymatic C(sp3)−H bond functionalization such as iodination and thiocyanation. Using biochemical characterization and proteomics analysis, we identified the functional oligomeric state of ApnU as a covalently linked homodimer, which contains three essential pairs—one interchain and two intrachain—of disulfide bonds. The metal-coordination active site in ApnU consists of binuclear type II copper centres, as revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This discovery expands the enzymatic capability of C(sp3)−H halogenases and provides a foundational understanding of this family of binuclear copper-dependent oxidative enzymes.",

To meet recent international commitments to maintain genetic diversity within species 5,6 , we need to understand relationships between threats, conservation management and genetic diversity change. Here we conduct a global analysis of genetic diversity change via meta-analysis of all available temporal measures of genetic diversity from more than three decades of research. We show that within-population genetic diversity is being lost over timescales likely to have been impacted by human activities, and that some conservation actions may mitigate this loss. Our dataset includes 628 species (animals, plants, fungi and chromists) across all terrestrial and most marine realms on Earth. Threats impacted two-thirds of the populations that we analysed, and less than half of the populations analysed received conservation management. Genetic diversity loss occurs globally and is a realistic prediction for many species, especially birds and mammals, in the face of threats such as land use change, disease, abiotic natural phenomena and harvesting or harassment. Conservation strategies designed to improve environmental conditions, increase population growth rates and introduce new individuals (for example, restoring connectivity or performing translocations) may maintain or even increase genetic diversity. Our findings underscore the urgent need for active, genetically informed conservation interventions to halt genetic diversity loss.",

          "abstract": "A particle current generated by pumping in the absence of gradients in potential energy, density or temperature1 is associated with non-trivial dynamics. A representative example is charge pumping that is associated with the quantum Hall effect2 and the quantum anomalous Hall effect3. Spin pumping, the spin equivalent of charge pumping, refers to the emission of a spin current by magnetization dynamics4,5,6,7. Previous studies have focused solely on transversal spin pumping arising from classical dynamics, which corresponds to precessing atomic moments with constant magnitude. However, longitudinal spin pumping arising from quantum fluctuations, which correspond to a temporal change in the atomic moment’s magnitude, remains unexplored. Here we experimentally investigate longitudinal spin pumping using iron–rhodium (FeRh), which undergoes a first-order antiferromagnet-to-ferromagnet phase transition during which the atomic moment’s magnitude varies over time. By injecting a charge current into a FeRh/platinum bilayer, we induce a rapid phase transition of FeRh in nanoseconds, leading to the emission of a spin current to the platinum layer. The observed inverse spin Hall signal is about one order of magnitude larger than expected for transversal spin pumping, suggesting the presence of longitudinal spin pumping driven by quantum fluctuations and indicating its superiority over classical transversal spin pumping. Our result highlights the significance of quantum fluctuations in spin pumping and holds broad applicability in diverse angular momentum dynamics, such as laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization8, orbital pumping9,10 and quantum spin transfer11,12,13.",

          "abstract": "Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are elements of a neural map of self position 1–5 . For these cells to benefit navigation, their representation must be dynamically related to the surrounding locations 2 . A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal’s path has been described for place cells, in which the sequence of spikes in each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal’s current location towards upcoming locations 6–8 . In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms when the animal approaches the choice point 9,10 , raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials 10 . However, to bridge the animal’s path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats that in individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal’s location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps are accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells that have putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive grid × direction cells. Sweeps extend into never-visited locations that are inaccessible to the animal. Sweeps persist during REM sleep. The sweep directions can be explained by an algorithm that maximizes the cumulative coverage of the surrounding manifold space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left–right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal–hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient ‘look around’ mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path.",

          "abstract": "“Drill, baby, drill!” This campaign slogan came up minutes into Donald Trump’s inauguration address, as the new US President announced his plans to boost domestic fossil-fuel production and exports and curb climate action. This push for US oil and gas production will probably be endorsed by the Department of Energy, the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency — now led by vocal supporters of fossil-fuel development.\n\nSome level of oil and gas extraction was always going to continue in the coming years. Some cleaner fuels, such as hydrogen, are derived mostly from natural gas — boosting hydrogen was a hallmark policy of the Biden administration, which saw record levels of US fossil-fuel extraction. Now, Trump has made clear that he aims to expand drilling, declaring an ‘energy emergency’ on day one of his presidency. But this needn’t mean the end of US decarbonization efforts, nor further environmental degradation. What’s important is that it is done right.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nThe US government has direct control over oil and gas development only on federal lands and waters, which host just 11% of US oil production and 9% of its gas. And opening up more federal lands, such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to oil and gas drilling, as Trump has threatened to do, will be neither quick nor easy. Several laws protect these lands, including the Clean Air (1963), Safe Drinking Water (1974) and Endangered Species (1973) acts. It would take acts of Congress to overturn them — and major rollbacks are unlikely to be widely supported by the mostly moderate legislators across the US House of Representatives and Senate, in line with their constituents’ preferences.\n\nTrump has issued an executive order to encourage energy exploration on federal areas. But any drilling initiative can, and probably will, be immediately challenged by environmental groups. The initiatives would then have to wind their way through the court system to get approved. Drilling on federal territories might not even be economically competitive, because these regions are often more remote and harder to access than other resource deposits.\n\nAs an energy geographer, I study state energy policies and their impacts on communities and ecosystems. The public often worries that energy policy is dictated by the oil and gas industry through ‘model bills’ written by pro-business lobbying groups. But my colleagues and I have found that, in fracking regulation for example, states often relied more on each other’s regulations to strike the right balance between permitting fracking to boost employment and lower energy prices and safeguarding the environment (J. Baka et al. Energy Res. Soc. Sci. 70, 101734; 2020).\n\nTrump will weaken climate action — the rest of the US must not follow suit\n\nStates should retain their own regulatory frameworks to ensure environmental protection. Independent groups such as the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission can help with these efforts. The organization was founded in 1935 to facilitate communication on fossil fuels between oil and gas regulators, providing a space for state officials to promote balanced regulatory approaches.",

A failing heart can be stabilized with patches of muscle grown from stem cells.Credit: Thomas Deerinck, NCMIR/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers have shown that patches of muscle grown from stem cells can help to repair a failing heart, in a clinical trial that tested the procedure on a 46-year-old woman.\n\nThe woman, who had a heart attack in 2016 and later developed heart failure, had an operation to implant 10 patches of 400 million cells on the surface of her heart. Her condition then remained stable for three months, long enough for her to receive a heart transplant. Scientists who examined her old heart found that the implanted muscle patches had remained in place and formed blood vessels.\n\nThe results of the trial, which took place in 2021, were published in Nature on 29 January1, alongside findings from earlier studies that tested muscle patches containing either 40 million or 200 million cells in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta).\n\nFirst pig-to-human heart transplant: what can scientists learn?\n\n“We now have, for the first time, a laboratory-grown biological transplant available which has the potential to stabilize and strengthen the heart muscle,” said study co-author Ingo Kutschka, a heart surgeon at University Medical Center Göttingen in Germany, during a press briefing.\n\n“It’s quite a breakthrough,” says Jianyi Zhang, who specializes in bioengineering and using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) — cells reprogrammed from an adult state to allow them to differentiate into any cell type in the body — for cardiac repair at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe treatment is not intended to replace the need for a full transplant, but it can help people with advanced heart failure who are waiting for a heart to become available.\n\n“Less than 1% of the patients in need are heart transplanted,” said study co-author Wolfram-Hubertus Zimmermann, a pharmacologist at University Medical Center Göttingen, during the press briefing. This approach “is offering another treatment to patients that are presently under palliative care”.\n\nThe researchers have implanted similar muscle patches into 15 people so far, and hope to recruit more participants.\n\nPatched-up hearts\n\nAn estimated 60 million people worldwide are living with heart failure, and more than half of people who are diagnosed with severe heart failure die within a year. A lack of donors means that there are not enough hearts available for most people who need them, and artificial pumping devices are expensive and require invasive surgery.\n\nFor many years, scientists have experimented with implanting or directly injecting stem cells or muscles grown from them into the heart. But these procedures often result in irregular heartbeat, growth of tumours or rejection by the body’s immune system.\n\nZimmermann and his team engineered iPSCs to grow into heart muscle and connective tissue. They mixed these cells with collagen gel to create patches, and developed a minimally invasive procedure to place them on the surface of the heart. “The graft is basically outside of the heart,” says Zhang.\n\nCRISPR ‘cousin’ put to the test in landmark heart-disease trial",

Field and laboratory studies suggest that bats rarely become ill from these viruses and don’t mount the harmful immune overreactions seen, for instance, in people with severe COVID-19.\n\n“There’s something unique about bats,” says Aaron Irving, a comparative immunologist at the Zhejiang University–University of Edinburgh Institute in Haining, China, who co-led the study, published1 on 29 January in Nature. “When they are infected, generally, they’re quite healthy. They somehow evolved the right way to control their immune responses without going overboard.”\n\nImmunity secrets\n\nTo uncover secrets to bat immunity, a team led by Irving and Michael Hiller, an evolutionary genomicist at the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, Germany, sequenced the genomes of ten bats, including four horseshoe bat and three species part of a family called Hipposideridae, all of which are coronavirus reservoirs. The researchers then analysed these along with ten previously sequenced bat species from other parts of the family tree.\n\nCompared with 95 other mammal species, bats had especially high numbers of immune genes, with changes indicative of natural selection. Some of these alterations were limited to individual branches of the bat family tree, hinting that they evolved after the group began diversifying. But many immune adaptations were shared by all bats, suggesting that they emerged in a common ancestor of all bats — and at around the same point that fossil evidence has suggested that powered flight evolved in the animals.",

These dense, dead stars, which host powerful magnetic fields, typically form in young galaxies, when a massive star collapses during a supernova.\n\nAstrophysicists turn fast radio bursts into cosmic probes\n\nNow, an FRB has been found at the edge of a galaxy in which stellar activity has slowed, strengthening evidence that at least some FRBs must have another provenance. “The FRB origin story is far from boring, and certainly far from solved,” says Wen-fai Fong, an astronomer at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nFong and her colleagues spotted the signal using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), a radio telescope in southern British Columbia. CHIME has already spotted more than 1,000 FRBs. But this is the first repeating FRB to be pinpointed using the telescope’s Outriggers, a trio of observatories that help CHIME to detect not just an FRB but also its source. Once CHIME can routinely locate FRBs, “it will be the next big game changer in the field”, says Laura Spitler, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany.\n\nGlobular clusters",

          "authors": "Linda Nordling",
          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nI joined my current laboratory at a large Western institution as a PhD student seven years ago. I’m now two years into a postdoc there, taking on more responsibilities in the growing lab. However, my former PhD supervisor has accused me of bullying one of her new students.\n\nShe was never much of a mentor for me. Early on in my PhD, we realized that my project wasn’t going as planned. Instead of discussing a new direction, she asked me to lie and fake data for internal reports to save her reputation with our boss and clinic head. She blamed the failed project on me. After that, our relationship deteriorated as I lost trust in her.\n\nThree years ago, she hired a new PhD student who has caused a lot of problems. He’s lazy, lies, is not willing to memorize anything and is highly insubordinate. I’ve tried to help by answering his constant questions and by providing standard protocols, but my tone has occasionally been harsher when he’s been about to mess things up.\n\nRecently, my former supervisor accused me of not behaving appropriately. She went directly to our boss instead of discussing it with me or my current group leader. I feel frustrated by the lack of open communication and have a sense of betrayal. My colleagues tell me they don’t see an issue with my behaviour. Now I fear this accusation could jeopardize the job I love, and there seems to be nothing I can do about it. I would greatly appreciate any advice that the community can give me. — A frustrated neuroscientist\n\nThe advice\n\nNature’s careers team spoke about your situation to a professional mediator, a researcher who studies bullying in academic settings and an academic coach. They agreed that you describe a complex situation that has evolved from early career difficulties into current workplace tensions.\n\nThe three proposed different routes out of your impasse. However, they also suggested that you reflect on how your past experiences influence how you act and react in the present.\n\nFanny Zabloz, a mediator based in Valais, Switzerland, suggests asking your institution’s human-resources team for mediation, if you and your former supervisor are willing to take part. “Mediation could be particularly helpful here, as it provides a structured, neutral space to rebuild a more constructive working relationship, which is often essential, especially when both parties need to continue working together,” she says.\n\nHow to thank your lab mates: eight ways to show gratitude at the end of year\n\nThe mediation process can be either direct, with both parties in the same room, or ‘shuttle’, in which the parties remain separate, she says. In both cases, the mediator will probably meet each party individually first, to clarify the process, define confidentiality terms and allow the two sides to express their perspectives.\n\nZabloz emphasizes that mediation is future-focused rather than fault-finding. If a formal complaint of bullying has been made to your human-resources representative, you will probably instead enter a more investigative process, through which you can present your side. Zabloz notes that any disciplinary action typically requires substantial proof of misconduct, with multiple corroborating witnesses.\n\nAnother approach, which can be complementary to mediation, is to reflect more broadly about how you navigate relationships at work. The aim here is to develop new strategies for managing frustrations and conflicts. This could be done by reaching out to a trusted mentor, a counsellor or a coach.\n\nSimon Kay is an immunologist who worked in international development and for the biomedical funding charity Wellcome before becoming a full-time coach in Haywards Heath, UK, specializing in helping early-career academics.\n\nKay says he detects “a lot of anger and frustration” in your letter — and that such feelings, however understandable, can get in the way of a solution.\n\nShould I climb the career ladder as a manager, or will I regret leaving the lab bench behind?\n\nIf he were your coach, he says, although you would need to offload your frustration with the environment and people around you, he would want to work on your behaviours and how you can positively influence your situation, your relationships and your career direction. “Assuming [the correspondent] is open to coaching, our starting point would be to explore how they handle relationships, to explore patterns of behaviour and try to bring them to a level of awareness about their impact on and relationships with others,” he says.",

Credit: Martin Dohrn/Science Photo Library\n\nA variety of mosquito once thought to have evolved in the tunnels of the London Underground seems to have originated alongside humans thousands of years ago in the Middle East, a genetic analysis reveals1.\n\nCulex pipiens molestus were notorious during the Second World War for biting Londoners sheltering from German air raids in the Underground’s tunnels and stations. The mosquito looks like the common house mosquito, Culex pipiens, but behaves very differently. For example, C. pipiens lives and breeds above ground, mates in swarms, bites birds and requires a blood meal before laying eggs. The molestus form breeds underground, can mate in confined spaces, bites mammals and can lay eggs without having dined on blood.\n\nMosquito blood meals reveal history of human infections\n\nIn the 1990s, scientists suggested that C. pipiens molestus could have evolved in the London Underground tunnels themselves2, but populations of the same form have since been found underground in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia, making this hypothesis unlikely.\n\nTo trace where the insects might have originated, evolutionary biologist Yuki Haba, now at Columbia University in New York City, evolutionary genomicist Lindy McBride at Princeton University, New Jersey, and their colleagues extracted DNA from 357 C. pipiens molestus mosquitoes collected from across Europe, North Africa and western Asia, including 22 historical specimens from the National History Museum in London. They then analysed variations between the mosquitoes’ genomes to identify the evolutionary relationships between populations.\n\nGradual evolution\n\nThe team’s results, posted on the bioRxiv preprint server, suggest that molestus mosquitoes first adapted to human environments above ground in what is now Egypt, over the course of more than 1,000 years, potentially in conjunction with the rise of agricultural civilizations. The fastest rate of genetic divergence between pipiens and molestus seems to have been about 2,000 years ago, says McBride.",

          "abstract": "Hidden in the Heavens: How the Kepler Mission’s Quest for New Planets Changed How We View Our Own Jason Steffen Princeton Univ. Press (2024)\n\nIn the mid-1980s, NASA engineer William Borucki faced a panel of in-house specialists. They told him to either justify an idea that many were calling crazy, or quit. His concept was for a space telescope dedicated to detecting extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, which orbit stars other than the Sun. It was an audacious idea, a decade before any such planets had been found.\n\nBorucki had been developing the concept since the 1970s and was under pressure to stop wasting NASA resources. Yet he managed to convince the panel to let him carry on, and even persuaded several members to join him. Still, it would take until 2001 for the mission to be signed off, and another eight years before Borucki’s crazy idea sat on the launchpad.\n\nWhy did Earth’s first radio message to alien civilizations leave out half of humanity?\n\nThat spacecraft, the Kepler Space Telescope, remains humanity’s most prolific planet hunter so far, having spied thousands of distant planets and many more candidate ones. In Hidden in the Heavens, astrophysicist Jason Steffen — who joined the mission a year before it launched in 2009 — relates the story of Kepler and its surprising discoveries.\n\nKepler detected planets by identifying the dimming of light from a star as a planet moved across its face. Doing this is extremely hard — Steffen compares the process to looking down at Las Vegas from space and searching for a fly buzzing around a street light. The Kepler team had to prove that the telescope’s instruments were up to the task this before the project was given the green light. So deputy principal investigator David Koch designed a simple but clever experiment to do so.\n\nKoch punched holes in a sheet of metal and illuminated it from behind to make an artificial field of stars. Wire was stretched across the holes, and an electric current was passed through it. The current warmed the wire, causing it to expand a little — just enough to simulate an Earth-sized planet crossing a distant star similar to the Sun. This test proved that, technically at least, the concept could work.\n\nOn the hunt\n\nNext, real target stars had to be selected. In practice, more than one light dip would need to be detected to prove that a planet was orbiting the star and to measure the period. To find a planet on an orbit similar to our own, Kepler would have to monitor the star for several years to confirm that the dips repeated.\n\nScaled up, that meant that Kepler needed to watch one patch of sky, which ideally contained as many stars as possible. That raised engineering problems — it needed to distinguish light from individual stars in a dense crowd, avoid bright stars that would saturate the detectors and handle limitations to the bandwidth needed to send the data back to Earth. The final choice was a region with plenty of stars for Kepler to explore, but not so many that the telescope would be overwhelmed.\n\nNASA engineer William Borucki drove development of the Kepler Space Telescope.Credit: Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via AP/Alamy\n\nOnce Kepler’s hunt began, decisions also needed to be made around how the science team worked together. And Steffen describes how practices held over from the lengthy developmental phases — such as being overly protective about who had access to data — led to uneven workloads. Some members “were swamped and just trying to keep their heads above water“; others “felt stuck twiddling [their] thumbs with nothing to do”. Steffen sought a solution, which in the end was simply ensuring that the whole scientific team could access the regular teleconferences. “‘The participating scientists went rogue’ and changed everything,” Steffen recalls a colleague joking.\n\nDespite stringent planning, however, nothing involving space ever goes smoothly. And the team faced yet more decisions. One question was whether to sharpen the telescope’s focus after the first images seemed slightly blurry. It was designed to be adjusted, but moving any of the parts came with a risk. If the team did nothing, Kepler would still detect relatively large planets but would miss the smallest ones. If the scientists went ahead with adjusting it, results might improve — or there could be irreparable damage, and the entire mission could be jeopardized.\n\nWhether to intervene with a spacecraft far from Earth is a dilemma faced by most mission leaders. For example, in April 2023 the radar antenna on board the Juice mission, led by the European Space Agency, failed to fully deploy after a pin jammed. Mission control delivered a mechanical shock that helped the antenna to unfold. In January 2024, researchers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and NASA made a different decision for the XRISM X-ray telescope, when a protective aperture door failed to open. The telescope is otherwise performing well, so the team has decided not to attempt to free the door for the moment.\n\nIt all came down to a simple question, Steffen recalls: “Do we risk it all for that twenty percent?” In the case of Kepler, the team did. The mirror was moved by a mere 40 micrometres and the images sharpened.",

          "abstract": "Victoria, Olivia and Justine (left to right) during one of their field sessions on Sable Island.Credit: Justine Ammendolia\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, the three of us spent two five-week field seasons on Sable Island, a tree-less environment in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. It was originally settled in 1801, when a life-saving station was built to aid sailors whose ships had been wrecked. The island consists of grasses and shrubs that sustain a population of around 450 feral horses, descended from an unknown population introduced in the mid-1700s. A meteorological station was established in the 1890s, and biological research began in the 1970s.\n\nTwo of us (V.C. and J.A.) were there to collect data for our PhD projects. O.A. was a summer undergraduate researcher; V.C. and O.A. research the feral horses and work 16-hour days to conduct field surveys and laboratory work. J.A. collects and processes atmospheric microplastic samples in the mornings and then monitors her equipment throughout the rest of the day.\n\nThe island is almost 25 times longer than it is wide. Its expansive coastline hosts the largest breeding population of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the world and has a rich biodiversity of seabirds. The weather often changes without warning, from blaring heat to dense fog. There is an average summer population of 15 people, including federal employees, researchers and visiting academics.\n\nOur island ‘town’ is Parks Canada’s main station. This cluster of buildings, mostly from the 1940s, includes our shared accommodations. The Visitors’ Quarters building has all the comforts of home. Electricity, running water, Wi-Fi and laundry facilities all make the isolation and long working days easier.\n\nWe’ve reflected on our shared experiences to compile advice for early-career researchers (ECRs) journeying into the pressure-cooker environment of remote fieldwork, which poses many challenges. These include managing logistics for the first time, fixing damaged field gear and navigating group dynamics at close quarters. We encourage all ECRs going into the field to take initiative. Given that the barrier between work and life tends to dissolve in the field, initiative can take different forms from those that you might be used to. For example, you might offer to cook, or to verify weather conditions for the next working day or even just to sweep up if you notice that it needs to be done.\n\nDon’t overcomplicate things\n\nGetting to your remote field site is hard, typically involving making relevant partnerships, applying for permits and funding, and ensuring that you are prepared to conduct your science in the field. Don’t be hard on yourself. Fieldwork is unpredictable; for reasons from illness to adverse weather conditions, it isn’t always possible to do everything you initially planned. Put your health and safety first, to prevent burnout.\n\nWe were lucky to spend two periods at our field site, enabling us to better understand sampling protocols and the environment. This helped to reduce the risk of our project not meeting our expectations. For example, V.C.’s work is part of a long-term monitoring project on the feral horses, collecting data through photography and non-invasive faecal sampling without disturbing or handling the animals. Her first field season was spent gaining experience with her study system, which inspired the direction of her PhD project, by asking new questions that use data collected over the past 17 years.\n\nJustine Ammendolia processes atmospheric microplastic samples on Sable Island, as part of her PhD project.Credit: Victoria Crozier\n\nWith any field project, we suggest working with what’s available. In designing her field programme, J.A. could have collected data anywhere on the island, but instead chose to use existing infrastructure, because it didn’t require any extra construction. J.A. has adapted a localized sampling approach that minimizes island travel and uses the Air Chemistry building in the island’s main town to take samples. And although choosing not to sample at multiple points on the island has reduced the number of variables to measure, by keeping things simple, J.A. has framed her project to have reliable data while minimizing its impact on the environment. Our two projects have taken approaches that support the philosophy of ‘leave no trace’, which should inform our work as field scientists.\n\nCapture science in action\n\nWe have supported each other in documenting our fieldwork experiences. This has involved waking up at the crack of dawn to photograph microplastic collections or hiking across the island to document data being collected on feral-horse biology.\n\nWe’ve invested time in developing stories about our research and filming each other in the field, with the intention of sharing the results with audiences back home through seminars, articles and educational-outreach initiatives. J.A. photographed O.A. and V.C. during their fieldwork; the photos were used in an article celebrating O.A.’s experience as an Indigenous scholar. V.C. and O.A. helped J.A. to document her science for her virtual tour, part of her National Geographic Society grant.\n\nVictoria Crozier on Sable Island, collecting data for her PhD project.Credit: Justine Ammendolia\n\nJ.A. shared her knowledge about science communication and photography, and as a group we gained a better understanding of how to develop an impactful story arc and capture complementary footage. As a group, we’ve become better science communicators, working together to capture research in action, so that we can share our science beyond our time in the field. Sharing your research can not only inspire others, but also help to elevate your professional profile and reputation in your field.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Michael Boyd\n\nColin Renfrew played a key part in transforming archaeology into a problem-oriented, theoretically explicit and scientifically informed field during the last third of the twentieth century. Although his fieldwork concentrated mainly on the prehistory of two island groups close to his heart — the Cyclades in Greece and Orkney in Scotland — his interpretive reach and influence were global, making him archaeology’s closest approximation to a household name. He has died aged 87.\n\nRenfrew was born in the English town of Stockton-on-Tees. He added an informed engagement with science (his father worked as a chemist) to his youthful passion for antiquity. He initially chose to study natural sciences at the University of Cambridge, UK, but soon switched to archaeology and anthropology. In 1965, he completed his PhD, which shed new light on the early Cyclades, and then began a lectureship at the University of Sheffield, UK.\n\nThere, Renfrew found himself well placed to exploit the archaeological opportunities of scientific advances. For example, that year, he collaborated with geologists, using trace elemental analysis to discriminate between Aegean sources of the volcanic glass obsidian, used to make cutting tools. Eventually this investigation would confirm that 12,000-year-old finds of obsidian from Franchthi Cave in southern Greece were derived from the Cycladic island that is now called Milos — at the time, marking the earliest proven sea-crossing in the world.\n\nEstella Bergere Leopold (1927–2024), passionate environmentalist who traced changing ecosystems\n\nRenfrew’s thinking was further inspired by a stay in California during 1967. It was a time of exciting developments in ‘new archaeological’ theory in the United States, which emphasized rigorous scientific, quantitative and anthropological approaches to understand the dynamics of past societies. And it had just been discovered that tree-ring sequences from the long-lived bristlecone pines (Pinus longaeva), found in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains, offered the means to calibrate radiocarbon dates, making it possible to push chronologies back centuries earlier than previously expected.\n\nPrompted by these developments, Renfrew re-examined the accepted inter-relations between prehistoric developments in Europe and Near Eastern civilizations, offering new models for how societies change. Until the 1960s, most archaeologists had explained large-scale cultural change through ‘diffusion’ of people and ideas over time from core areas — in particular Egypt and Mesopotamia. But Renfrew quickly realized that calibrated radiocarbon dating challenged this perspective.\n\nAs he pointed out, building of the megalithic temples of Malta began before the pyramids of Egypt, and the rich Bronze Age burials in southern Britain were as ancient as those of ‘golden’ Mycenae in Greece. His early masterpiece, a book called The Emergence of Civilisation (1972), advocated a radically new way of viewing change and growth, not as a consequence of external stimuli but rather as a result of interactive, mutually reinforcing internal processes such as agricultural intensification, technological change, increased trade and ideational shifts in a society.\n\nWere Neanderthals soulful inventors or strange cannibals?",

          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "Researchers have long sought potent, but non-addictive, painkillers as alternatives to opioids.Credit: Getty\n\nWhen Terp Vairin awoke from a 2023 surgery that straightened a bend in her nasal passage, she felt like she’d taken a hard punch to the nose. As the anaesthesia wore off, she called out for something to ease the pain, and was pleasantly surprised. The drug she received — a new kind of analgesic being tested in a clinical trial — eased her discomfort, without the grogginess or nausea of opioids.\n\n“I felt very lucid,” says Vairin, an artist from Decatur, Georgia.\n\nChronic pain can be treated — so why are millions still suffering?\n\nNow, millions more people will soon have access to this painkiller — suzetrigine. It works by selectively blocking sodium channels on pain-sensing nerve cells, providing opioid-level pain suppression without the risks of addiction, sedation or overdose. On Thursday, the US Food and Drug Administration approved suzetrigine for short-term pain management, making it the first pain drug given a regulatory nod in more than 20 years that works through a brand-new mechanism.\n\nPain-medicine specialists hailed the arrival of a potent but safer alternative to opioids, which have fuelled a wave of overdoses and deaths in the United States and beyond. For drug developers, meanwhile, suzetrigine proves that targeting sodium channels — a strategy that has long stymied the pharmaceutical industry — can succeed.\n\n“This is a big step forward,” says Stephen Waxman, a neuroscientist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n“Anything we can add to the toolbox that will allow us to reduce opioid dependency is a significant positive,” says Paul White, an anaesthesiologist at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, who was involved in suzetrigine’s development.\n\nThe hunt for selectivity\n\nSuzetrigine, now marketed as Journavx, is not the first sodium-channel-targeting drug for pain management. Compounds such as procaine (Novocain) have provided reliable anaesthesia for more than a century. However, sodium channels come in nine flavours, or subtypes, and older drugs block all of them indiscriminately, so they must be administered locally — through injections or skin creams and gels — to avoid widespread side effects.\n\nHow do placebos ease pain? Mouse brain study offers clues\n\nThe hunt for more selective drugs began in the 1990s, following the discovery that three of the channel subtypes are found mainly on pain-sensing neurons — meaning that they have little activity in the heart and brain, minimizing the risk of toxicity or addiction.\n\nSodium channels operate like gates, opening and closing in response to electrical signals flowing through nerve cells to let sodium ions pass through. This initiates a cascade of nerve impulses that transmit pain signals to the brain.\n\nEarly efforts to design drugs targeting these channels focused mainly on one subtype, called NaV1.7. Waxman likens it to the fuse in a firecracker, which amplifies the initial spark of a pain signal. This in turn ignites NaV1.8, another channel subtype that acts like a propellant, intensifying the signal further and relaying it, in the form of repetitive impulses, down nerves to the spinal cord and ultimately to the brain. A third subtype, NaV1.9, further modulates the signal’s intensity and duration.\n\nGenetics studies in the mid-2000s, first in people with a chronic-pain condition called ‘man on fire’ syndrome1 and later in those with complete insensitivity to pain2, had implicated NaV1.7 as a master regulator of pain perception. These “knock your socks off” findings led “the majority of the money and attention” to pour into targeting this channel subtype, says Waxman. Yet, the drug industry’s initial efforts to inhibit NaV1.7 yielded disappointing clinical results.\n\nNaV1.9 proved challenging to study and target in the laboratory, so attention shifted to NaV1.8, with Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston, Massachusetts, leading the way. After first trialling two other selective NaV1.8 inhibitors, the company leaned into suzetrigine (previously known as VX-548) — finding that it blocks its target more than 30,000 times more potently than other sodium channels3.\n\n“VX-548 didn’t come out of nowhere,” says Marc Rogers, a drug-discovery consultant in Cambridge, UK. “It’s a story of long, hard work. ”\n\nA smoother way to soothe",

          "abstract": "The DeepSeek model is accessible through a chatbot app.Credit: Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty\n\nScientists are flocking to DeepSeek-R1, a cheap and powerful artificial intelligence (AI) ‘reasoning’ model that sent the US stock market spiralling after it was released by a Chinese firm last week.\n\nRepeated tests suggest that DeepSeek-R1’s ability to solve mathematics and science problems matches that of the o1 model, released in September by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, whose reasoning models are considered industry leaders.\n\nHow China created AI model DeepSeek and shocked the world\n\nAlthough R1 still fails on many tasks that researchers might want it to perform, it is giving scientists worldwide the opportunity to train custom reasoning models designed to solve problems in their disciplines.\n\n“Based on its great performance and low cost, we believe Deepseek-R1 will encourage more scientists to try LLMs in their daily research, without worrying about the cost,” says Huan Sun, an AI researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus. “Almost every colleague and collaborator working in AI is talking about it.”\n\nOpen season\n\nFor researchers, R1’s cheapness and openness could be game-changers: using its application programming interface (API), they can query the model at a fraction of the cost of proprietary rivals, or for free by using its online chatbot, DeepThink. They can also download the model to their own servers and run and build on it for free — which isn’t possible with competing closed models such as o1.\n\nSince R1’s launch on 20 January, “tons of researchers” have been investigating training their own reasoning models, based on and inspired by R1, says Cong Lu, an AI researcher at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. That’s backed up by data from Hugging Face, an open-science repository for AI that hosts the DeepSeek-R1 code. In the week since its launch, the site had logged more than three million downloads of different versions of R1, including those already built on by independent users.\n\nHow does ChatGPT ‘think’? Psychology and neuroscience crack open AI large language models\n\nScientific tasks\n\nIn preliminary tests of R1’s abilities on data-driven scientific tasks — taken from real papers in topics including bioinformatics, computational chemistry and cognitive neuroscience — the model matched o1’s performance, says Sun. Her team challenged both AI models to complete 20 tasks from a suite of problems they have created, called the ScienceAgentBench. These include tasks such as analysing and visualizing data. Both models solved only around one-third of the challenges correctly. Running R1 using the API cost 13 times less than did o1, but it had a slower “thinking” time than o1, notes Sun.\n\nR1 is also showing promise in mathematics. Frieder Simon, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Oxford, UK, challenged both models to create a proof in the abstract field of functional analysis and found R1’s argument more promising than o1’s. But given that such models make mistakes, to benefit from them researchers need to be already armed with skills such as telling a good and bad proof apart, he says.\n\nMuch of the excitement over R1 is because it has been released as ‘open-weight’, meaning that the learnt connections between different parts of its algorithm are available to build on. Scientists who download R1, or one of the much smaller ‘distilled’ versions also released by DeepSeek, can improve its performance in their field through extra training, known as fine tuning. Given a suitable data set, researchers could train the model to improve at coding tasks specific to the scientific process, says Sun.\n\nChina’s cheap, open AI model DeepSeek thrills scientists",

And earlier this week, DeepSeek launched another model, called Janus-Pro-7B, which can generate images from text prompts much like OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, made by Stability AI in London.\n\nIf DeepSeek-R1’s performance surprised many people outside of China, researchers inside the country say the start-up’s success is to be expected and fits with the government’s ambition to be a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIt was inevitable that a company such as DeepSeek would emerge in China, given the huge venture-capital investment in firms developing LLMs and the many people who hold doctorates in science, technology, engineering or mathematics fields, including AI, says Yunji Chen, a computer scientist working on AI chips at the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. “If there was no DeepSeek, there would be some other Chinese LLM that could do great things.”\n\nIn fact, there are. On 29 January, tech behemoth Alibaba released its most advanced LLM so far, Qwen2.5-Max, which the company says outperforms DeepSeek's V3, another LLM that the firm released in December. And last week, Moonshot AI and ByteDance released new reasoning models, Kimi 1.5 and 1.5-pro, which the companies claim can outperform o1 on some benchmark tests.\n\nGovernment priority\n\nIn 2017, the Chinese government announced its intention for the country to become the world leader in AI by 2030. It tasked the industry with completing major AI breakthroughs “such that technologies and applications achieve a world-leading level” by 2025.\n\nDeveloping a pipeline of ‘AI talent’ became a priority. By 2022, the Chinese ministry of education had approved 440 universities to offer undergraduate degrees specializing in AI, according to a report from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) at Georgetown University in Washington DC. In that year, China supplied almost half of the world’s leading AI researchers, while the United States accounted for just 18%, according to the think tank MacroPolo in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nDeepSeek probably benefited from the government’s investment in AI education and talent development, which includes numerous scholarships, research grants and partnerships between academia and industry, says Marina Zhang, a science-policy researcher at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia who focuses on innovation in China. For instance, she adds, state-backed initiatives such as the National Engineering Laboratory for Deep Learning Technology and Application, which is led by tech company Baidu in Beijing, have trained thousands of AI specialists.\n\nExact figures on DeepSeek’s workforce are hard to find, but company founder Liang Wenfeng told Chinese media that the company has recruited graduates and doctoral students from top-ranking Chinese universities. Some members of the company’s leadership team are younger than 35 years old and have grown up witnessing China’s rise as a tech superpower, says Zhang. “They are deeply motivated by a drive for self-reliance in innovation.”\n\nWenfeng, at 39, is himself a young entrepreneur and graduated in computer science from Zhejiang University, a leading institution in Hangzhou. He co-founded the hedge fund High-Flyer almost a decade ago and established DeepSeek in 2023.\n\nJacob Feldgoise, who studies AI talent in China at the CSET, says national policies that promote a model development ecosystem for AI will have helped companies such as DeepSeek, in terms of attracting both funding and talent.\n\nBut despite the rise in AI courses at universities, Feldgoise says it is not clear how many students are graduating with dedicated AI degrees and whether they are being taught the skills that companies need. Chinese AI companies have complained in recent years that “graduates from these programmes were not up to the quality they were hoping for”, he says, leading some firms to partner with universities.\n\n‘Efficiency under constraints’",

          "abstract": "Cows graze in a drought-afflicted field near Les Brenets, Switzerland, during a 2022 heatwave.Credit: Fabrice Coffeini/AFP via Getty\n\nFarmers suing their government for failing to act on climate change might sound surprising — we’re more used to seeing convoys of tractors in the streets with farmers protesting the imposition of climate and sustainability policies. But that’s just what’s happening in Switzerland — a country where average temperature increases have already hit 2.8 °C compared with preindustrial times.\n\nIn March last year, a group of farmers turned to the Swiss courts to force the government to do more to act on climate change before their farms become unviable.\n\nEarth breaches 1.5 °C climate limit for the first time: what does it mean?\n\nNine farmers and five farmers’ associations, involved in producing crops, fruits and vegetables, viticulture, forestry and animal husbandry, submitted evidence that anthropogenic, climate-related drought and heat, increasing storms, hail and changes in the seasons have led to losses of 10–40% in annual turnover over the past three years (see go.nature.com/4h4bzk6). Adapting to climate change is adding to those losses.\n\nThis case is yet to be settled — having been initially rejected, the farmers are still awaiting the outcome of an appeal. But it marks a big shift in the position of farmers on environmental issues. In the past few years, many lawsuits have been filed — and won — in the United States and beyond to hold ‘methane majors’, which include dairy farms, pork producers and other agricultural corporations, responsible for their contribution to global warming1.\n\nBy contrast, the Swiss case positions farmers as crucial advocates for protecting the climate. It also contributes to a wider trend in which individuals are increasingly taking governments to court for negligence over climate change.\n\nWill lawsuits from farmers make a difference? They might. Here, we explain how.\n\nClimate drivers\n\nFarming is at the heart of climate change. The agri-food sector accounts for about one-third of global greenhouse-gas emissions2,3. And limiting global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, as set out by the 2015 Paris climate agreement, will be impossible without addressing this sector4,5.\n\nAt the same time, agriculture is greatly affected by rising temperatures and extreme weather, including droughts, heatwaves, frosts and heavy rainfall, as well as changes in pests6. These effects differ widely from region to region, from crop to crop and from farm to farm, depending on local climate, terrain and soil types, access to water and the type of farming7.\n\nA water bladder helps farmers to cope with more frequent droughts in Alpine areas.Credit: George Steinmetz/New York Times/Redux/eyevine\n\nCosts arise from lost yields, increased risks and the need to implement adaptation measures and climate-resilient farm practices, such as switching crops, improving soils and using more irrigation. In the long run, farmers worry that climate change could threaten the viability of some farms8.\n\nAlthough Swiss farmers are drawing attention these issues, they are not alone — agriculturalists all over the world are being severely affected by rapidly changing climates.\n\nPrivileged position\n\nSo far, agriculture has also been exempted from the strictest regulations on climate and environmental protection, owing to its economic and cultural importance9,10. For example, the Global Methane Pledge, launched in 2021 at the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference, focuses mainly on cutting emissions of this potent greenhouse gas from the oil, gas and waste sectors rather than from food systems. In 2023 at COP28, parties to the Paris climate agreement signed a non-binding pledge on sustainable agriculture, but only in relation to adapting current practices, not mitigating climate change.\n\nScience could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it?\n\nIn the past few years, some nations have begun to take a closer look at agriculture’s role in climate policy. The European Green Deal and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are pushing towards sustainable food production and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions while strengthening the resilience of food systems11. Similarly, Switzerland’s Climate Strategy for Agriculture and Food emphasizes self-sufficiency while cutting the nation’s food-related ecological footprint, through recommendations, food labels, dietary advice and research.\n\nStill, farmers remain sceptical. Putting farmers in the spotlight of climate policy has reinforced the message that they are ‘polluters who have to pay’. And across Europe in 2024, many farmers engaged in organized protests in response12. As well as dealing with rising production costs, competitive pressure from free trade agreements, high margins paid to retailers and poor working conditions, they are now shouldering the costs and regulatory burdens of climate policy, they say.\n\nYet, as farmers face increasing climate impacts themselves, some are beginning to question this ‘farmer versus environment’ narrative and are calling for more action to protect their livelihoods — while securing food production.\n\nGrowing pressure\n\nThe Swiss farmers who brought the lawsuit accuse their national government of failing to take effective measures to protect them from the most sweeping effects of climate change. Farmers argue that, because the government has disregarded its own climate-change laws for more than 20 years and is acting contrary to its own long-term climate strategy, it is unlikely that Switzerland will meet its future commitments. Many farms will be less profitable and face higher risks owing to climate change, threatening the continuation of business.\n\nSwiss farmers use their tractors to form an SOS signal near Goumoens-la-Ville, Switzerland.Credit: Valentin Flauraud/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nIn legal terms, the farmers claim that, as well as violating their rights to life, private and family life and personal liberty, government inaction is threatening their economic freedom and property rights. After the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications disagreed initially, the farmers lodged an appeal with the Swiss Federal Administrative Court; if that fails, too, the judgment will probably be appealed to the Federal Supreme Court.",

          "authors": "Meghie Rodrigues",
          "abstract": "At age 75, Vadevino Alano keeps up a brisk pace as he strides through the forest on the way to the Armadillo’s Den — a spectacular cave in southern Brazil. When he reaches the cave’s opening, Alano is dwarfed by the size of the hole, which is big enough to accommodate a van.\n\nAlano steps into the cave and enters a different world. The air is noticeably warmer and the cavern echoes loudly as Alano, who is a local guide, discusses the cave’s history with Juliano Campos, an archaeologist at the University of the Extreme South of Santa Catarina (UNESC) in Criciúma, Brazil. According to local legend, the Armadillo’s Den — known as Toca do Tatu in Portuguese — was a hiding place where Jesuit missionaries stored gold centuries ago. But the real treasure is more ancient and strange.\n\nCampos points to the ceiling of the cave, which is covered with deep grooves. He and other researchers suspect that the scars were carved by giant ground sloths that roamed the region until they went extinct more than 10,000 years ago. “This is an archaeological and palaeontological marvel,” says Campos.\n\nLocal guide Vadevino Alano (left) and archaeologist Juliano Campos examine gouges that researchers have identified as being scratch marks left by ice age ground sloths.Credit: Rafael Lange for Nature\n\nFor generations, these structures have puzzled travellers and scientists, who have debated how they formed. Explorers in the early twentieth century attributed the spaces to ancient Indigenous groups. But research in the past decade has coalesced around the theory that the caves were carved by extinct megafauna.\n\nPalaeontologists have been amassing evidence to tease out which creatures were responsible and how they carved such huge burrows — the biggest known caves of their type in the world — from solid rock. But many questions remain about these enigmatic formations, says Campos.\n\nThe vast desert\n\nResearchers call these caves giant palaeoburrows and most are concentrated in Brazil, with a few in Argentina, says Heinrich Frank, a retired geologist formerly at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil. He founded the Palaeoburrows Project research group in the early 2000s to study these structures.\n\nAccording to Francisco Buchmann, a palaeo-oceanographer at São Paulo State University in São Vicente, Brazil, the majority of the caves are found in a particular layer of sandstone called the Botucatu Formation. It dates to more than 100 million years ago, a time when the region was a large desert. “The Sahara is small compared to this one,” says Buchmann, who leads the Palaeoburrows Project with Frank.\n\nBecause of how those desert sands solidified, the Botucatu sandstone is soft enough to carve but not so soft that it falls apart too easily, says Maria Carolina Villaça Gomes, a physical geographer at the State University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.\n\nThe rounded edges of the scratches indicate they are much older than modern graffiti.Credit: Rafael Lange for Nature\n\nInside the Armadillo’s Den, the rock is covered with modern graffiti, which researchers can spot because its edges are much crisper than those of the inscriptions made by ancient human residents. Alano points to a zig-zag carving on the wall. “This line puzzled many explorers who came here in the past,” he says. “But what it most certainly shows is an ancient map of the Rocinha River that flows nearby,” because it depicts specific bends seen in the nearby canyons. “Past Indigenous groups could have used it to orient themselves in the region,” says Alano, a descendant of one of the Indigenous groups that could have left the inscription.\n\nJust a few metres beyond the zig-zag line, the cave presents evidence of even older residents. The large scratches on the walls and ceiling have stunned palaeontologists and other scientists from across South America.\n\nFrank and Buchmann were part of the first group to describe the Armadillo’s Den, and suggested in 2012 that it was carved by ancient megafauna1. It is an example of what palaeontologists refer to as an ichnofossil: tracks, tunnels and other marks left by ancient organisms.\n\nGone with a trace\n\nThe South American palaeoburrows might be the largest ichnofossils known so far, says Luis Buatois, an ichnologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada.\n\nIn the field of ichnology, researchers assign genus and species names to specific ichnofossils. In a study of these caves, Buchmann, Frank and their colleagues divided the South American palaeoburrows into two types: Megaichnus minor and Megaichnus major2. The M. minor type includes tunnels with openings measuring 0.6–1.5 metres wide by 0.5–0.9 metres high, and a maximum length of 30 metres. The M. major type is massive: more than 2 m high by 4 m wide, with a length that can exceed 50 m.\n\nThe battle to rebuild centuries of science after an epic inferno\n\nThe longest described so far is in Pará state in the Amazon region, with combined internal galleries some 1,500 metres long, says Buchmann.\n\nAccording to Frank, there are between 1,500 and 2,000 of these structures in South America, but none on other continents, which baffles scientists. Caves of the M. major type have so far been found only in Brazil. Just a few of each type of cave have been described in detail, and they are hard to find because most — about 70% of the M. major ones — are filled with rubble. “We often find them when a company is doing some earth-moving work for construction,” Frank says.\n\nKnowledge of these caves goes back more than a century, and researchers have long thought the giant palaeoburrows were archaeological structures left by people. But in 2001, Sergio Vizcaíno, head of the vertebrate palaeontology department at the La Plata Museum in Argentina and his colleagues proposed that the large palaeoburrows that have claw-like markings on the walls and roof could have been excavated by ground sloths belonging to the extinct genera Scelidotherium and Glossotherium3. The scratches are a match for these animals’ claws, he and his colleagues argued.\n\nOne species, Glossotherium robustum, a South American sloth that lived between 4 million and 12,500 years ago, reached more than 3 metres in length and weighed up to 1,500 kilograms. A smaller species of sloth, Scelidotherium leptocephalum, inhabited South America between about 800,000 and 11,000 years ago. It is thought to have been about one metre long, weighing up to one tonne.\n\nA reconstruction of several extinct ground sloths and armadillos compares them with the dimensions of some caves found in South America.Credit: Renato Pereira Lopes\n\nAccording to Richard Fariña, a palaeontologist at the University of the Republic Uruguay in Montevideo, the anatomy of these large ancient sloths suggests that they were efficient diggers.\n\nDespite their size and strength, individual animals might not have carved each burrow, says Vizcaíno. He suggests that the caves might instead have been the work of several animals over time. “Palaeoburrows must be transgenerational, as the energy cost decreases when the work is done by many individuals,” he says.\n\nHumanity’s oldest art is flaking away. Can scientists save it?\n\nWhy these animals would dig such large, long burrows is not clear, however. Néstor Toledo, a comparative anatomist at the La Plata Museum argues that giant prehistoric armadillos might have carved the smaller burrows to hide from predators, and giant sloths “could have started digging to protect themselves from a colder and drier climate” during ice ages. Ground sloths might also have used the caves to hide offspring from predators.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Fragments of the asteroid Bennu, carefully collected and ferried to Earth by a robotic spacecraft, contain the building blocks for life, NASA announced today.\n\nNASA ‘fist bumps’ an asteroid to reveal Solar System’s secrets\n\nNot only does Bennu contain all 5 of the nucleobases that form DNA and RNA on Earth and 14 of the 20 amino acids found in known proteins, the asteroid’s amino acids hold a surprise. On Earth, amino acids in living organisms predominantly have a ‘left-handed’ chemical structure. Bennu, however, contains nearly equal amounts of these structures and their ‘right-handed’, mirror-image forms, calling into question scientists’ hypothesis that asteroids similar to this one might have seeded life on Earth.\n\nThe work appears in Nature Astronomy1.\n\n“What makes these results so significant is that we’re finding them in a pristine sample,” says co-author Daniel Glavin, an astrobiologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. When meteorites fall to Earth, they are heated in the atmosphere and contaminated by the planet’s molecules. The Bennu samples were ferried to Earth in a sealed canister, protected from the heat and analysed in a super-clean laboratory space under inert gas.\n\nThe specimens contain the richest bounty of life-friendly extraterrestrial compounds ever brought to Earth.\n\nA salty finding\n\nBut that’s not all they contain. In an accompanying paper published in Nature today2, other researchers report that the material from Bennu is also rich in salts created billions of years ago, probably when watery ponds on Bennu’s parent asteroid evaporated and left behind a crust of minerals. Although no signs of life were spotted on Bennu, those salty ponds would have been a good environment for fostering the chemistry that could lead to it. This might involve small, carbon-rich molecules such as methanal (formaldehyde) — a simple compound that was found in the Bennu samples.\n\n“Having these brines there, along with simple organic stuff, may have kick-started [the process of] making much more complicated and interesting organics like the nucleobases,” says Sara Russell, a mineralogist at the Natural History Museum in London and an author of the Nature paper.\n\nA scanning electron microscope image of the sodium carbonate crystalline needles found in samples of the asteroid Bennu.Credit: Rob Wardell, Tim Gooding and Tim McCoy/Smithsonian\n\nThe Bennu discovery helps to illuminate how, early in the Solar System’s history, asteroids and other planetary building blocks were not just “lumps of stone and ice, but active ‘living’ objects”, says Yasuhito Sekine, a planetary scientist at the Earth-Life Science Institute in Tokyo who wrote a News & Views article accompanying the Nature paper.\n\nBoth sets of results come from NASA’s US$1.2-billion mission OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security — Regolith Explorer. The spacecraft launched from Florida in 2016, flew to Bennu, collected rocks and dust from the asteroid’s surface in 2020 and landed back on Earth in Utah in 2023.\n\nBefore the mission visited Bennu, scientists knew that the asteroid was probably carbonaceous — rich in carbon, and containing water molecules locked up in clay minerals. But until the samples came back to Earth and went into NASA’s curation facility in Houston, Texas, researchers didn’t know how much of a bounty they had.\n\nLargest-ever sample",

          "abstract": "Many universities once admitted only male students — and traditions and values from that era still prevail, says Nicole Bedera.Credit: Bettmann/Getty\n\nNicole Bedera spent the 2018–19 academic year investigating how a US university handled allegations of sexual harassment and violence. Her resulting book, On the Wrong Side: How Universities Protect Perpetrators and Betray Survivors of Sexual Violence, was published last year.\n\nBedera’s investigation was based on interviews with 24 administrators and 45 perpetrators and survivors at the university, which she does not name. She also reviewed more than 700 documents, including media reports and Instagram posts.\n\nFreedom and safety in science\n\nHer research painted a picture of an institution that felt threatened by complaints about gender-based violence, says Bedera. Male perpetrators’ education was routinely prioritized over that of female victims, leaving the impression that sexual-violence complaints were not taken seriously, she adds.\n\nMany higher-education institutions in the United States continue to rely on traditions and values that pre-date the admission of female students. Women continue to feel excluded.\n\nA sociologist and sexual-violence researcher based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bedera co-founded Beyond Compliance Consulting in 2023. The company’s work includes helping organizations to develop anti-violence strategic plans.\n\nNicole Bedera is a sociologist who studies sexual violence and responses to it.\nHow did you become interested in researching sexual violence on campus?\n\nIt dates back to 2010, when I started my bachelor’s degree in sociology at a US liberal-arts college. I thought feminism had been won. That was what I’d been taught growing up in Nevada at the height of the 1990s ‘girl power’ era.\n\nOn our very first day, we were told that there had not been a rape on my campus in ten years.\n\nBut some of my friends were later sexually assaulted, and were left with the impression that their continued presence in campus accommodation would somehow disturb their roommates. I felt that was a horrible message.\n\nI began volunteering for a rape crisis centre, and this led to me working as a victim advocate in hospitals. In that role, I got a lot of questions from survivors that there just weren’t really very clear answers to. One of these was why everything got worse, instead of better, after they reported their assault.\n\nFor example, in the United States, if you’re sexually assaulted, the place where you start the criminal-justice process is a hospital, for an examination. That is the exact opposite of what a sexual-assault survivor would want — being stripped naked and examined from head to toe.\n\nWe had things that we said as advocates, but I wanted to give a scientific answer to their questions.\n\nThe conventional approach and that of a lot of the academic literature at the time was to say that they’d done something risky, that they’d done something wrong, that they’d put themselves in that situation. But that was hard for me to believe, and it wasn’t something I wanted to repeat.\n\nAnd so that’s how I came into my research interest and my PhD at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, which focused on how organizations shape the experience of college sexual assault.\n\nHow did your advocacy experience inform your work as a social scientist?\n\nWhat I learnt as an advocate that was most useful as a scientist was to make space for the full expression of emotion. A lot of the time, whether it’s in the hospitals or in a research interview, victims will act differently than you’ve been taught to expect.\n\nIn the cultural stereotypes, people think interviews will be very sad, and people will cry through all of them. That’s not true. A lot of them are very funny — some people cope through humour. People also cope through anger, as well as sadness.\n\nWhen you make room for that full expression in each interview, you often see all those emotions, and you get a much more nuanced account of what the person has experienced and a more honest story. It means people don’t feel like they have to be ‘the perfect victim’.\n\nHow did you maintain scientific rigour when you were interviewing survivors?\n\nYour role as an advocate is to be there, be compassionate, be empathetic, hear what they’re saying, really listen, but also keep some distance because they might handle things differently than you.\n\nThose skills are really useful when working as a scientist, too. When you are interviewing people, you don’t want to have a big emotional reaction. You don’t want them to know your opinion about what they’ve experienced, or how they decided to handle it. Those things are really not relevant to the research.\n\nWhat struck you most during the research for your book?\n\nVictims of sexual assault shouldn’t be made to feel it’s their fault, and that’s motivated my work.\n\nOne of the most upsetting parts of my research was the way administrators talked about handling sexual-violence complaints. There were a lot of cases of sexual harassment, for instance, where the perpetrator would confess to what they had done. And even in those cases, administrators would say, “We don’t want to have to deal with this, we don’t think it’s that big a deal.”\n\nBedera’s book On the Wrong Side explores responses to complaints of sexual violence at a US university.\n\nOne of them said something that immediately stuck in my head: “I just feel like we are regulating student dating, and we’re not interested in doing that.”\n\nThey were saying they didn’t enjoy making people accountable for violating the university’s own code of conduct, and that as much as they could, they tried to look for loopholes and ways to avoid investigating or making a meaningful sanction.\n\nOne of the consistent themes was that schools prioritized “neutrality”, which meant treating victims and perpetrators exactly the same. For example, the university was sending no-contact directives to perpetrators, but also to the victims, treating them equally, literally as Party 1 and Party 2. Neither were allowed to contact each other or ask others to contact the other person on their behalf. They weren’t permitted to talk about each other to anyone else or share space with each other. But enforcement was fuzzy — for example, they were allowed to take classes together or be in the library at the same time.",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov, Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "The administration of President Trump set off an uproar 27 January by suspending federal spending on grants and loans.Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty\n\nUpdate: In a memo sent to federal agencies on 29 January, the administration of US President Donald Trump rescinded its 27 January order that would have frozen federal loans and grants from 28 January. But Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on the social-media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the latest move is not a cancellation of the funding freeze but a withdrawal of the 27 January order. It remains unclear which federal grants and loans are frozen.\n\nResearchers in the United States are reeling after the administration of new President Donald Trump issued an order on 27 January that froze all federal grants and loans. A federal judge in Washington DC temporarily blocked the order late today, but it had already spurred many US universities to advise faculty members against spending federal grant dollars on travel, new research projects, equipment and more.\n\nThe Republican-led administration issued a memo today attempting to clarify what is and is not covered by the freeze, but it included no information specific to scientific funding, leaving many scientists just as confused as when the order was issued.\n\n“If somehow they are allowed to get away with this, the disruption is almost incalculable,” says John Holdren, who was the US science adviser to former Democratic president Barack Obama.\n\nThe order is only the latest in a stream of White House directives on federal spending, diversity and other programmes that have sown chaos and confusion in the US scientific community. In the past week, the Trump administration has also ordered staff members at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is charged with protecting US health, to cease communication with the World Health Organization, and scrubbed most federal websites of any material relating to diversity. In addition, agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), major funders of basic US science, have suspended research-grant review meetings.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nResearchers aren’t sitting still: hundreds of scientists sprang into action on the social-media platform Bluesky to organize a rally at the White House in Washington DC today and to set up sessions for people to call on their elected officials to stop the freeze.\n\nScientists are worried about the long-term effects of the administration’s actions. “It will be much easier to destroy the world’s greatest scientific ecosystem than it will be to try to rebuild it,” says Carole LaBonne, a developmental biologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nThe White House, the NIH and the NSF did not respond to queries about the breadth of the order, when it might be lifted or scientists’ concerns.\n\nFrozen in place\n\nThe spending freeze was outlined in a 27 January memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which ordered federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance”. It singled out spending on “foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion], woke gender ideology, and the green new deal”, the name that Trump has given to climate legislation passed during the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nThe memo, which was first reported by the journalist Marisa Kabas, was challenged in court by a coalition of states and legal experts who argued that it illegally suspends funds appropriated by the US Congress. Matthew Lawrence, an expert in administrative law at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, says that the US Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to appropriate funds. An order that imposes “a halt across the board, and without a special message, would violate the Impoundment Control Act”, he says, referring to a 1974 law that limits a president’s power to impound, or withhold, funding.\n\nWhat Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers\n\nThe memo’s broad language left researchers confused about which portion of the country’s roughly US$200-billion in annual public spending on research and development is affected. Worried about the risk of non-compliance and in the absence of more clarity, many university officials have already begun to freeze funding at their institutions. For example, the University of Chicago in Illinois informed its faculty members on Tuesday that they should suspend certain types of spending on federally issued grants.\n\n“We must for now proceed under the assumption that grant expenditures incurred after today while this memorandum is in effect may not be covered by federal funding,” university provost Katherine Baicker wrote in an e-mail to faculty members. “This is not a request that I make lightly.”\n\nElusive clarity\n\nThe OMB issued a memo today clarifying that the funding pause does not apply to benefits programmes such as Medicare, which provides health care to older people in the United States, and it emphasized that the 27 January order sets up a process for agencies to determine which types of spending are affected. After review, the spending pause could be “as short as [a] day”, the clarification said, without offering a specific example of a programme whose funding had been restored.",

The researchers hoped this tool, called ribosome profiling, would provide an accurate tally of all the proteins a cell makes and their relative quantities.\n\nBut, when Weissman and others began trying the method out, they turned up a giant surprise. Not only were ribosomes busily churning out proteins encoded by known genes in a cell’s genome, but they also seemed to be making thousands upon thousands of ‘dark proteins’ that map to portions of the genome that weren’t thought to produce proteins1. “That was the ‘Aha!’ moment for us,” says Weissman, who is based at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Soon, his lab and others were uncovering unexpected translation events in nearly every organism they examined.\n\nAI scans RNA ‘dark matter’ and uncovers 70,000 new viruses\n\nFifteen years later, scientists are still scratching their heads over what to make of these proteins.\n\nDark proteins tend to be short — often just a few dozen amino acids or fewer. And many are unfamiliar — they don’t have close relatives in the genomes of other organisms. Studies suggest that some could have essential roles in the cell and might influence human health. They seem to be abundant in some cancers, and several companies hope to develop treatments that target dark proteins. But for many of these mysterious entities, the evidence that they’re doing anything important — or even whether they survive for very long in the cell — is equivocal.\n\nThe problem, says Marie Brunet, who studies proteomics at University of Sherbrooke in Canada, is that scientists don’t really know what they might be missing. “If you have a protein lacking from the repository, you’re not even looking for it,” she says.\n\nGene-counting conundrum\n\nBrunet is part of a global effort to document all of the dark proteins encoded by the human genome (see ‘Exploring the dark proteome’). The goal is to draw researchers’ attention to this dark matter, so they can begin working out what the proteins are doing, molecule by molecule.\n\nSource: J. R. Prensner et al. Mol. Cell Prot. 22, 100631 (2023).\n\nThe prospects are exciting, says Sebastiaan van Heesch, a systems biologist at the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology in Utrecht, the Netherlands, who is also part of the effort: “There’s definitely new biology there.”\n\nLeading up to the first publications of the human genome in the early 2000s, researchers were furiously examining the emerging sequence data trying to estimate the number of protein-coding genes. Typically, they looked for what are known as open reading frames (ORFs), stretches of code with specific three-letter sequences, or codons, that can contain instructions for making a protein. Genomicists looked for further clues, such as evidence that a sequence is conserved among other organisms and of reasonable length, all of which are indications that the resulting protein might have a function in cells.\n\nMany ORFs that didn’t meet these criteria were ignored or simply missed as biologists refined their estimates. Consortia that maintain lists of predicted genes, such as the GENCODE project, currently list just shy of 20,000 protein-coding genes. About 90% of these have been confirmed through other efforts, to produce corresponding proteins (individual genes can encode multiple different proteins, by including or omitting stretches of code called exons). GENCODE and other projects make periodic adjustments to their lists as data emerge.\n\nAI has dreamt up a blizzard of new proteins. Do any of them actually work?\n\nBut, according to John Prensner, a cancer biologist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, the accounting is incomplete. The idea that researchers could draw up a complete list of protein-coding genes as early as 2001 was a popular misconception. “The leaders of the Human Genome Project always knew they were just starting a conversation,” Prensner says.\n\nThe ability to directly measure ribosomes’ output led to an explosion of interest in overlooked ORFs and their potential to encode working proteins. In a 2022 correspondence to Nature Biotechnology, a team co-led by Prensner, van Heesch and others assembled a list of more than 7,000 of these ‘non-canonical’ ORFs, which generally don’t meet the requirements to be considered protein-coding genes and have therefore been omitted from databases2. (That is a lower bound, says van Heesch; other studies have identified tens of thousands of potential dark proteins encoded by the human genome.)\n\nMost of the unconventional ORFs that the scientists listed are found either near to or overlapping with canonical, protein-coding genes (see ‘Where are all the dark proteins?’). About one-third of them were in sequences called long non-coding RNAs, which — as the name suggests — weren’t expected to encode proteins but were thought to have regulatory roles.\n\nSource: J. R. Prensner et al. Mol. Cell Prot. 22, 100631 (2023)\n\nBut just because an ORF is translated into a protein doesn’t mean that the proteins are stable or have important jobs in a cell. The translation of some non-canonical ORFs, which is carried out by ribosomes, could be a way for cells to control the activity of a nearby gene, for instance, by gumming up the ribosomal machinery with products that will be quickly degraded, say Prensner and others. This sort of control occurs in certain upstream ORFs that appear ahead of a protein-coding sequence.\n\nIn a preprint study that follows up on their 2022 publication, Prensner, van Heesch and an expanded consortium of genomics and proteomics specialists trawled through hundreds of proteomics data sets — comprising billions of data points — and findings from studies that used mass spectrometry and other approaches to identify the protein content of cells3. The researchers found protein fragments corresponding to more than 1,700 of the non-canonical ORFs they had identified in 2022. For 15 of them, the researchers argued, the evidence was strong enough to make a case for adding the proteins and their corresponding genes to official tallies of protein-coding genes.\n\nBut, for most non-canonical ORFs, clear-cut evidence that they can produce a protein is lacking. Part of the challenge is the small size of the potential proteins — researchers call them microproteins because they tend to be much shorter than 100 amino acids (on average human proteins contain several hundred amino acids, and many are much longer). Their short length makes it hard to find matching fragments — which are created in experiments that break proteins apart and identify the resulting shards by their mass. Cell samples will over-represent the fragments of longer proteins, says van Heesch, particularly if the microproteins are less abundant.\n\nWhen scientists have used the artificial-intelligence tool called AlphaFold to predict the structure of dark proteins, the molecules often bear little resemble to well-folded, bona fide proteins. But, Presner says, “there are clear examples that very much look like canonical proteins and were just missed”. GENCODE and other organizations that manage repositories have begun to add these overlooked proteins to their lists.\n\nJonathan Mudge, who works on the GENCODE project at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, and is a co-author of the preprint, says that around 50 sequences identified through ribosome profiling have been included in its list of human protein-coding genes.\n\nBut they are moving carefully, he adds. It isn’t just lab biologists who rely on efforts such as GENCODE to make sense of experiments. Clinicians, too, rely on such databases, and adding a slew of suspect protein-coding genes could complicate efforts to identify harmful variants found in patient genomes, says Mudge. “We’re not sceptical. We’re just cautious,” he says.\n\nEdits for clarity\n\nAround the time that researchers started shining a spotlight on the genomes’ potential to encode dark proteins, another breakthrough made it possible to systematically study their effects in cells: CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing. “Suddenly we could surgically take out the coding sequence of these non-canonical proteins and ask, are they important for the function of the cell?” Weissman says.\n\nIn a 2020 Science paper, Weissman’s team showed just that. The researchers used CRISPR gene editing to interrupt thousands of non-canonical ORFs, preventing them from being translated into proteins in human induced pluripotent cells, as well as by a cancer cell line4. In hundreds of instances, the CRISPR editing caused a growth defect in the cells. “Many microproteins were really important for cells,” says Weissman.\n\nWith further experiments, they were able to ascertain why. In some instances, the proteins encoded by a non-canonical ORF interacted with a protein encoded on the same mRNA strand. This is reminiscent of the way that co-regulated bacterial genes tend to reside next to one another in units called operons, Weissman says. The functional dark proteins his team identified took on diverse roles in cells: one seemed to be involved in the cell cycle, another in mitochondrial physiology.\n\n‘Dark matter’ DNA influences brain development\n\nCancer cells might be especially rich in dark proteins. Prensner, who is also a paediatric neuro-oncologist, is studying the possibility that non-canonical ORFs present in all human genomes can become misregulated in some cancers, potentially contributing to different treatment outcomes that he and other cancer physicians see in their patients. “We’re asking the central question of why cancers are making these things,” he says.\n\nIn similar experiments to Weissman’s, a team led by Prensner found that about 10% of more than 500 non-canonical ORFs they inactivated with CRISPR caused growth defects in various kinds of human cancer cell5. Prensner and his colleagues identified a dark protein that was expressed at elevated levels in breast-cancer cell lines and also seemed to be driving their growth.\n\nIn a study published last year, Prensner, van Heesch and their colleagues identified several dark proteins that contribute to medulloblastomas, sometimes fatal paediatric brain cancers6. In one example, the researchers showed that a dark protein — independent of a canonical protein encoded by an adjacent ORF — was driving the growth of especially aggressive forms of medulloblastoma that carry an overactive version of a cancer gene called MYC.",

That’s the finding of a study1 that tracked citations linked to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), a US law designed to protect and support the recovery of species at risk of extinction.\n\nGiven that the ESA has the power to halt logging, construction, problematic fishing practices and other human activities that threaten vulnerable wildlife, getting a species added to it can be an important way for a conservation biologist to help protect populations.\n\nBut publishing in the kinds of journal that are more likely to influence the ESA could set conservation researchers back in their careers, says study co-author Brian Silliman, a marine conservation biologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. For decisions about who gets hired, promoted or funded, he says, a researcher’s impact is too often equated with the number of citations they receive and the impact factor of the journals they’ve published in (the standard way of calculating a journal’s impact factor is by dividing the number of times all the papers it has published in the past two years were cited in the last year by the total number of papers published in those two years.)\n\n“When you have graduate students who are trying to get jobs, you generally advise them not to publish in taxon-specific journals, because they’re going to be low impact factor,” says Silliman. “Even if it’s great science and it has applications to other systems, it’s a very limited audience and it’s going to be harder for them to get a job.”\n\nThis disconnect between what’s valued in academia and what has real-life impact prompted Silliman to ask a graduate class to think of alternative ways to evaluate research. PhD student and co-author Jonathan Choi suggested that they investigate which journals are publishing the studies that are cited in the ESA when new species are added to it.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nChoi and his colleagues examined documentation for the 260 species that were added to the ESA by the administration of Barack Obama between 2012 and 2016. They counted 4,836 citations for academic papers published in 785 journals. Categorizing the journals according to their impact factor, they showed that only 7% of ESA citations came from journals with an impact factor of more than 9, whereas 87% came from journals with an impact factor of less than 4 or no impact factor at all. Mid-ranking journals accounted for 6%. Journals that have not been given an impact factor by Clarivate — often because they are not considered influential enough — represented 13% of ESA citations.\n\nThe team also created an “ESA listing impact factor”, which was based on the fraction of papers that a journal publishes that go on to be cited by the ESA. The highest ranked journal was Pacific Science, a regional journal with a conventional impact factor of just 0.74.\n\nCollectively, regional journals, such as The Southwestern Naturalist and The American Midland Naturalist, and taxa-specific journals, such as the Journal of the Lepidopterists Society, American Fern Journal and American Malacological Bulletin, were the most important sources of ESA citations, says Choi. Habitat-specific journals such as Coral Reefs and Rangeland Ecology & Management were also important, he adds.\n\nThe study, published in Conservation Biology, highlights how conservation law relies on the type of rigorous practical work that is typically published in niche journals but is not rewarded by academic promotion and funding systems.\n\nGreater support needed for fieldwork\n\nChoi is careful to point out that the study’s findings do not devalue the kind of theory-driven science that appeals to high-impact-factor journals. Rather, they emphasize the need to support researchers who want to do other kinds of work, such as long-term population-monitoring studies, without sacrificing their career prospects. “That is really important science when it comes to conservation that we stand to lose if we don’t incentivize this kind of very baseline data collection,” says Choi.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Jim Young/Reuters\n\nJames Fraser Stoddart created a field of chemistry based on threaded and mechanically connected molecules, held together like links of a chain rather than through conventional chemical bonds. He recognized that the motions of the linked components could be exploited to make artificial molecular machinery, a breakthrough for which he shared the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Jean-Pierre Sauvage and Bernard L. Feringa. He has died aged 82.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, UK, Stoddart was brought up on a remote farm that lacked electricity. He said that farm living instilled in him “the work ethic of a honeybee”. The young Stoddart played with construction toys such as Meccano, which he later suggested was an inspiration for his building of machines from molecules. After completing a PhD in chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, he took a postdoctoral position at Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. The parting advice of the University of Edinburgh’s chair of organic chemistry, Edmund Hirst, rang in his ears: “Whatever you do in research, Stoddart, make sure you work on a big problem!”\n\nNanoscale scythe cuts molecular tethers using mechanical forces\n\nIn 1970, Stoddart returned to the United Kingdom to do a lectureship at the University of Sheffield, and began to search for a problem. The emerging field of supramolecular chemistry — chemistry beyond the molecule — caught his attention. He became intrigued by cyclic molecules called crown ethers, which could bind metal ions and charged organic molecules within their rings.\n\nFrom 1978, Stoddart spent three years on secondment to the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Corporate Laboratories in Runcorn, UK, while — back in Sheffield — his students prepared a series of transition-metal complexes with crown ethers. Structural similarities between those complexes and the herbicides he had seen at ICI led Stoddart to explore crown ethers that could bind to the weedkiller Paraquat. A visiting Spanish PhD student threaded a paraquat derivative through a crown ether ring, then connected the derivative’s two ends. The result: two cyclic molecules mechanically linked together, called a [2]catenane.\n\nStoddart’s team then created a [2]rotaxane — a ring-shaped molecule threaded onto a dumbbell-shaped molecule, with the ring darting back and forth between two ‘stations’ on the dumbbell’s shaft. In a 1991 paper, Stoddart termed it a ‘molecular shuttle’, noting: “Insofar as it becomes possible to control the movement of one molecular component with respect to the other in a [2]rotaxane, the technology for building ‘molecular machines’ will emerge.” (P. L. Anelli et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 5131–5133; 1991).\n\nAn artificial molecular motor powered by electricity\n\nHe had found his problem. Over the next two decades, the Stoddart group pioneered the field of artificial molecular machinery, producing eye-catching molecular objects that resembled in some aspects their counterparts from the macroscopic world, including a ‘molecular elevator’ and ‘Olympiadane’, a molecular version of the Olympic rings.",

And papers with higher co-authorship numbers were more likely to be retracted than were those with fewer co-authors.\n\nIoannidis and his colleagues used the world’s most comprehensive database on retractions, compiled by media organization Retraction Watch, which contains more than 55,000 retractions. They linked these records to citation data from Scopus, a literature and citation database maintained by publisher Elsevier. They filtered out retractions not attributed to author error, those that couldn’t be linked on Scopus and cases in which retractions led to republication. This left them with almost 39,500 retractions, which they compared with a list of highly cited authors. (Ioannidis has been compiling a list of highly cited researchers, known as the Stanford list, since 2016.)\n\nRetraction breakdown\n\nIn the study, the authors split the most-cited scientists into two groups. The first featured the 217,097 authors who were among the top 2% most-cited in their fields over their careers. The second group comprised the 223,152 scientists who made up the top 2% for citation impact in 2023, the most recent year for which there were data. The authors found that 8,747 (4%) of the most highly cited researchers in 2023 had at least one retraction during their career, as did 7,083 (3.3%) of the researchers who were most-cited over their careers.\n\nRetraction rates among top-cited researchers varied by country. In the 20 countries or regions where most top-cited authors are working, the database shows retractions are highest among top-cited scientists in India and on the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, whereas the lowest rates appear in Finland, Belgium and Israel.\n\nOverall, a high absolute number of papers published was associated with more retractions.

          "abstract": "The National Science Foundation, headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, funds about 25% of basic US academic research.Credit: JHVEPhoto/Alamy\n\nThe US National Science Foundation (NSF), a major funder of basic academic research, announced yesterday that it has reopened a website that distributes money from research grants to scientists. The move comes after a week of confusion and frustration for NSF-funded researchers in which the agency froze their funding — including for postdoctoral fellowships — and said it was reviewing grants worth billions of dollars to comply with President Donald Trump’s directives to terminate funding for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and to scrub all federal resources of these terms.\n\nAlthough the funds are unfrozen after a federal judge issued an order blocking the US government from freezing grant money, the NSF has said it will continue its review.\n\nThis whiplash shows that the “United States is not a stable place to be a scientist”, says Julia Barnes, an NSF-funded cultural anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. “Scientists funded by the NSF aren’t paid a lot, but we care a lot about the research we do.”\n\nTo better understand what is happening inside the NSF and what the future might hold, Nature spoke to six NSF staff members, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the press. All expressed strong concerns about recent agency decisions, especially to freeze funds.\n\n“People are trying to understand what’s going on,” says one NSF employee. “The freeze in funding was, and continues to be, completely confusing to everyone.”\n\nAn NSF spokesperson declined to comment about the agency’s actions and instead pointed Nature to information on the NSF website about its implementation of Trump’s executive orders.\n\nA week of whiplash\n\nIn the first hours of his presidency, Trump signed a barrage of executive orders, which are decrees that direct the US government’s actions but that cannot change existing laws. The orders aimed to reshape US policy on climate science, public health, the federal workforce and more. A week later, the Trump administration issued a memo freezing all federal grants. That 28 January memo was temporarily blocked by a federal judge minutes before it would have taken effect, and the White House then rescinded it. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on the social-media platform X that Trump’s executive orders on federal funding would “remain in full force”. In response, the NSF froze its funds and cancelled a week's worth of grant reviews, which are used to determine which projects are funded.\n\nTo more permanently halt the funding freeze, 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government and its agencies. Two federal judges have since temporarily blocked the funding freeze, hinting that it might be an overreach that lacks proper authority.\n\nThere is no clear timeline for how long the judges’ temporary holds will last, but even if they are lifted in an appeal, the NSF could have a hard time legally terminating grants, because their funds are appropriated by the US Congress, meaning they are protected by law, says Deborah Pearlstein, a specialist in law and public policy at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nThere is another area where the NSF’s actions might butt up against the law. Since 1980, Congress has mandated that the agency seek to broaden participation of underrepresented groups, including women and other minorities, within science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). “The orders are illegal,” says an NSF employee. “The statutory framework of NSF is being violated.”\n\nThe NSF spokesperson did not respond to a query about concerns that Trump’s executive orders are at odds with the agency’s responsibilities, as codified in law.\n\nInside grant review\n\nThe NSF has not publicly shared details of how it is continuing to examine research grants and flag those in violation of Trump’s orders, but NSF employees shared documents with Nature clarifying the process.\n\nAround 10,000 research grants have been flagged for review and distributed to various programme directors. Grants in one area of science are being distributed to directors in a separate area of science. For instance, the geosciences division is examining grants from the division of social, behavioural and economic sciences. The grants are being reviewed independently by two staff members instructed to indicate any potential violations of Trump’s orders. They will submit their reviews in a spreadsheet by 5 p.m. today.\n\nNature has seen the criteria for flagging grants, which call for programme officers to look for “broadening participation” language, foreign assistance, climate science, domestic energy, and “discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI”.\n\n“To see ‘women’ and ‘woman’ and ‘people of colour’ showing up on a spreadsheet over and over and over and over — that was a gut punch,” says one NSF employee.\n\nAction for grants can include cancelling, archiving or modifying them, with a deadline of 7 February. A team of five to eight NSF staff members will then review any revised grants, which will go to the Office of the Director for approval.\n\n“We already reviewed all of these,” says one NSF employee, referring to the fact that grant proposals go through extensive vetting before being funded.“It's really frightening and ridiculous.” Another shares those concerns but says that faced with Trump’s orders, “NSF is doing an honest job, as painful as it can be.”\n\nScience interrupted",

          "abstract": "Monica Bertagnolli, who was appointed head of the National Institutes of Health by President Joe Biden, stepped down shortly before the start of Donald Trump’s second presidential term. Credit: Stephen Voss for Nature\n\n“This is clearly a high-anxiety moment,” says former US National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Monica Bertagnolli, who finished her term on 17 January. Since her departure, an onslaught of directives from the administration of US President Donald Trump, a Republican, have sown bewilderment and anxiety throughout the US scientific community, including at the NIH, where research-grant reviews and all external communications have been halted.\n\nMany researchers fear that this tumult will continue if the US Senate confirms Robert F. Kennedy Jr as head of the NIH’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has a long history of opposing vaccination and making false claims about the cause of AIDS. He has vowed to “make America healthy again”, in part by overhauling US health agencies to focus on chronic diseases and environmental toxins.\n\nAs Kennedy sits for his confirmation hearings this week, Bertagnolli, who was appointed by former Democratic president Joe Biden, spoke to Nature about Kennedy’s norm-shattering ideas, the upheaval at the NIH ― the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research ― and her biggest fears for the future.\n\nWhat do you make of the Trump administration’s pause on grant-review meetings and external communications at health agencies, including the NIH?\n\nIt’s not unusual for an incoming administration to take a pause until they get their new people in place. But what has heightened anxiety is the expressed mandate of this administration to completely overhaul health. There are so many people that depend on the efficient and responsible functioning of NIH.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges for the agency moving forwards?\n\nEverybody recognizes that when science is under attack, that’s really a big detriment to the agency and to people. It’s great to have discussions about the uses or priorities of science, but anti-science is harmful to us all. To think we would eliminate vaccination is frankly frightening. There’s no question that diseases that existed in my lifetime are gone because of vaccinations, and we don’t want them back.\n\nThere’s growing appetite from Congress to reform the NIH, which has 27 institutes and centres. Some proposals call for nearly halving that number. Where do you hope these reforms land?\n\nIt’s never a bad idea to take a look at any large, complicated organization and ask if we’re performing optimally and if there are changes that are needed.\n\nThere are two components of the NIH structure to remember: it has to serve science really well, and it has to serve those who participate in the research, people who benefit from the research and advocates who care about a particular disease. One of the reasons I would be reluctant to completely collapse all these institutes and centres is that those advocates have, over time, developed these visible institutes as a focal point ― as an open door for them.\n\nKennedy has floated the idea of replacing 600 employees at the NIH. What do you make of that proposal?\n\nIt certainly wouldn’t be what I would do, because I will say that the work that I was able to achieve as director argues very strongly against that. I could have all the great ideas in the world, but without the team to accomplish them, they don’t go anywhere.\n\nWhat Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers\n\nKennedy has campaigned on a platform to ‘Make America Healthy Again’ (MAHA) by tackling the root causes of chronic diseases, removing toxic substances from the environment and combatting corporate corruption. Do you see opportunity in this campaign?\n\nThose ideas that you just articulated are absolutely critical. I take issue with saying that they’ve been ignored by the [previous] team. One of the ways that we had been thinking about that is looking at cross-cutting biological programmes [that] underlie many diseases — the link between obesity and inflammation, for example. We’ve been focusing on these common fundamental pathways and uncovering them to identify someone at risk for developing chronic disease early, and combatting it before it happens.",

Researchers used genetic tools to reveal that certain neurons in the brain control food choice and can sense both taste and texture1 .\n\nThe conventional view of taste sensing holds that specific neurons carry single signals to the brain, says study co-author Simon Sprecher, a neurobiologist at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. For instance, sweet taste neurons carry sweet signals and bitter taste neurons carry bitter signals.\n\nBut those assumptions have been challenged over the past two decades by studies in fruit flies and mice that suggest neurons might have the capacity to respond to both chemical signals, such as bitter or sweet, as well as mechanical signals, such as texture.\n\nJust right\n\nIn the current study, published in PLoS Biology on 30 January, Sprecher and his colleagues set out to see whether individual neurons in taste organs have this ‘multimodal’ capacity. They fed fruit-fly larvae — maggots — different preparations of agarose, a sugary gel. The maggots showed a propensity for a ‘Goldilocks’ preparation, one that was neither too hard nor too soft. The preferred hardness for larvae is “similar to [that] of decaying fruit”, says Sprecher.",

          "abstract": "Itchy-scratchy: experiments show that there are benefits to scratching ― although it can also aggravate skin disease. Credit: Getty\n\nScratching a mosquito bite can offer a moment of bliss, and now scientists know why: scratching activates an immune response that helps to protect the skin against harmful infections, at least in mice.\n\nThe findings could also explain why people find a good scratch satisfying. The study1 was published today in Science.\n\n“The exciting thing about this study is that there’s now a molecular basis” for how scratching causes inflammation, says Aaron Ver Heul, an immunologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, who was not involved in the study. The work, he adds, is “rigorous” and “really well done”.\n\nWhy we scratch\n\nAlmost all animals scratch, even though scratching too much can damage the skin. The classic explanation for scratching is that it removes parasites and irritants. “But we’ve always thought there might be other reasons,” says Ver Heul. After all, some parasites, such as mosquitoes, are long gone by the time itching starts.\n\nTo get to the root of the matter, skin immunologist Dan Kaplan at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and his colleagues painted a synthetic allergen onto the ears of mice. This induced a form of skin inflammation called allergic contact dermatitis, which is caused by contact with an allergen such as the oil in poison ivy. When control mice scratched, their ears swelled up and became full of neutrophils, a type of immune cell.\n\nBut mice that wore tiny Elizabethan collars — the rodent version of the ‘cone of shame’ that dogs sometimes need to wear after surgery — couldn’t scratch their irritated ears. These animals’ ears showed less swelling and contained fewer neutrophils than the ears of control mice did. Bioengineered mice that were lacking an itch-sensing neuron exhibited a similarly muted reaction. The experiment showed that the act of scratching itself worsens inflammation.\n\nFrom itch to scratch\n\nTo learn more about what happens after scratching, the scientists studied ordinary mice that were allowed to scratch their itchy ears. They noticed that at scratched sites, pain-sensing neurons released a potent nervous-system messenger called substance P.\n\nSubstance P activated key white blood cells called mast cells, which are central to triggering allergy symptoms. The mast cells recruited neutrophils to the scratched site, driving inflammation.\n\nResearchers already knew that mast cells can be turned on directly by allergens. The authors’ work revealed that mast cells can also be turned on indirectly, by scratching and the sequence of steps it initiates.\n\nResearch round-up: Allergies",

          "abstract": "The H5N1 avian influenza virus (blue) revealed in a coloured image from a transmission electron microscope.Credit: CDC/Science Photo Library\n\nTen months on from the shocking discovery that a virus usually carried by wild birds can readily infect cows, at least 68 people in North America have become ill from the pathogen and one person has died.\n\nWhy a teenager’s bird-flu infection is ringing alarm bells for scientists\n\nAlthough many of the infections have been mild, emerging data indicate that variants of the avian influenza virus H5N1 that are spreading in North America can cause severe disease and death, especially when passed directly to humans from birds. The virus is also adapting to new hosts — cows and other mammals — raising the risk that it could spark a human pandemic.\n\n“The risk has increased as we’ve gone on — especially in the last couple of months, with the report of [some] severe infections,” says Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nLast week, US President Donald Trump took office and announced that he will pull the United States — where H5N1 is circulating in dairy cows — out of the World Health Organization, the agency that coordinates the global response to health emergencies. This has sounded alarm bells among researchers worried about bird flu.\n\nHere, Nature talks to infectious-disease specialists about what they’re learning about how humans get sick from the virus, and the chances of a bird-flu pandemic.\n\nDoes how ill a person gets depend on whether they are infected by a cow or a bird?\n\nThere are two main variants of H5N1 that researchers are monitoring: one, called B3.13, is spreading mainly in cows; the other, called D1.1, is found mostly in wild and domesticated birds, including chickens raised for poultry.\n\nHuge amounts of bird-flu virus found in raw milk of infected cows\n\nB3.13 has spread rapidly in cattle across the United States, infecting more than 900 herds across 16 states, and has also infected other animals, such as cats, skunks and poultry. Infected cows and their milk contain high levels of the virus, making it easy for the pathogen to be transmitted between animals and workers on dairy farms, where milking equipment can spray liquid into the air and milk can coat surfaces.\n\nAt least 40 people have been infected by sick cows in North America, but in these cases, the virus has caused only mild respiratory illness and an inflammatory eye condition known as conjunctivitis. At least 24 people have become ill after exposure to sick birds, and 2 of these infections, caused by D1.1, were severe — one person was in hospital for months and the other died.\n\nThese numbers are too small to enable researchers to determine whether one variant of the virus is more dangerous than the other, Lakdawala says. Factors such as underlying health conditions in the people infected and the route of exposure to the virus can affect outcomes, she says.\n\nSo can an infection’s severity depend on whether a person ingests or breathes in the virus?\n\nDairy workers are vulnerable to infection because, during the milking process, they can inhale airborne milk particles and milk droplets can splash into their eyes. Some data suggest that if the virus enters the lungs directly, it could cause a severe infection. In a study published in Nature on 15 January1, a research group including Heinz Feldmann, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ virology laboratory in Hamilton, Montana, infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with B3.13 virus.\n\nIs bird flu spreading among people?

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Chinese firm DeepSeek debuted a version of its large language model last year.Credit: Koshiro K/Alamy\n\nA Chinese-built large language model called DeepSeek-R1 is thrilling scientists as an affordable and open rival to ‘reasoning’ models such as OpenAI’s o1.\n\nThese models generate responses step-by-step, in a process analogous to human reasoning. This makes them more adept than earlier language models at solving scientific problems, and means they could be useful in research. Initial tests of R1, released on 20 January, show that its performance on certain tasks in chemistry, mathematics and coding is on a par with that of o1 — which wowed researchers when it was released by OpenAI in September.\n\n“This is wild and totally unexpected,” Elvis Saravia, an artificial intelligence (AI) researcher and co-founder of the UK-based AI consulting firm DAIR.AI, wrote on X.\n\nR1 stands out for another reason. DeepSeek, the start-up in Hangzhou that built the model, has released it as ‘open-weight’, meaning that researchers can study and build on the algorithm. Published under an MIT licence, the model can be freely reused but is not considered fully open source, because its training data have not been made available.\n\n“The openness of DeepSeek is quite remarkable,” says Mario Krenn, leader of the Artificial Scientist Lab at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen, Germany. By comparison, o1 and other models built by OpenAI in San Francisco, California,including its latest effort, o3, are “essentially black boxes”, he says.\nAI hallucinations can’t be stopped — but these techniques can limit their damage\n\nDeepSeek hasn’t released the full cost of training R1, but it is charging people using its interface around one-thirtieth of what o1 costs to run. The firm has also created mini ‘distilled’ versions of R1 to allow researchers with limited computing power to play with the model. An “experiment that cost more than £300 [US$370] with o1, cost less than $10 with R1,” says Krenn. “This is a dramatic difference which will certainly play a role in its future adoption.”\n\nChallenge models\n\nR1 is part of a boom in Chinese large language models (LLMs). Spun off a hedge fund, DeepSeek emerged from relative obscurity last month when it released a chatbot called V3, which outperformed major rivals, despite being built on a shoestring budget. Experts estimate that it cost around $6 million to rent the hardware needed to train the model, compared with upwards of $60 million for Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B, which used 11 times the computing resources.\n\nPart of the buzz around DeepSeek is that it has succeeded in making R1 despite US export controls that limit Chinese firms’ access to the best computer chips designed for AI processing. “The fact that it comes out of China shows that being efficient with your resources matters more than compute scale alone,” says François Chollet, an AI researcher in Seattle, Washington.\n\nDeepSeek’s progress suggests that “the perceived lead [that the] US once had has narrowed significantly”, Alvin Wang Graylin, a technology specialist in Bellevue, Washington, who works at the Taiwan-based immersive technology firm HTC, wrote on X. “The two countries need to pursue a collaborative approach to building advanced AI vs continuing on the current no-win arms-race approach.”\n\nChain of thought\n\nLLMs train on billions of samples of text, snipping them into word-parts, called tokens, and learning patterns in the data. These associations allow the model to predict subsequent tokens in a sentence. But LLMs are prone to inventing facts, a phenomenon called hallucination, and often struggle to reason through problems.",

          "authors": "Yagmur Ozbay, Eftychia Stamkou, Suzanne Oosterwijk",
          "abstract": "Experiencing negative content through art has a unique power to transform our perceptions and foster engagement. While this idea has been widely discussed, empirical evidence is scarce, since experimental testing of art experiences poses significant challenges. Here, we aimed to fill this gap by quantifying and comparing individuals’ preference for engaging with art and nonart depicting matched negative content via two behavioral measures: the choice to engage vs. avoid and the duration of engagement. Across five studies (total N = 1,063), results revealed a preference for engaging with negative content through art as compared to nonart. Specifically, people more frequently chose to view negative art images, and looked at them for longer, as compared to photographs of similar content. To understand what underlies this preference for art, we examined the psychological impact of engaging with negative content through art and nonart depictions. Results showed that art experiences evoked higher aesthetic appreciation, while nonart gave the viewer a more realistic perspective and was emotionally more costly to engage with. Further, our analysis of engagement motives revealed that individuals were driven by expectations of aesthetic appreciation, thought-provocativeness, and an original perspective, both in art and nonart, while they were discouraged by emotional costs, even more strongly when engaging with nonart. These findings align with the idea of aesthetic distance, where art, as an abstraction of reality, facilitates exploration of negative content with less emotional costs and the prospect of aesthetic rewards.",

          "abstract": "The ε4 variant of human apolipoprotein E ( APOE4 ) is a key genetic risk factor for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and elevated all-cause mortality in humans. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that can mitigate the harmful effects of APOE4 has significant implications. In this study, we find that inactivating the VHL-1 (Von Hippel–Lindau) protein can suppress mortality, neural and behavioral pathologies caused by transgenic human APOE4 in Caenorhabditis elegans . The protective effects of VHL-1 deletion are recapitulated by stabilized HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor), a transcription factor degraded by VHL-1. HIF-1 activates a genetic program that safeguards against mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, proteostasis imbalance, and endolysosomal rupture—critical cellular events linked to neural pathologies and mortality. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Vhl reduces cerebral vascular injury and synaptic lesions in APOE4 mice, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Thus, we identify the VHL–HIF axis as a potent modulator of APOE4 -induced neural pathologies and propose that targeting this pathway in nonproliferative tissues may curb cellular damage, protect against neurodegeneration, and reduce tissue injuries and mortality.",

          "abstract": "Preemptive identification of potential failure under loading of engineering structures is a critical challenge. Our study presents an innovative approach to design built-in prefailure indicators within multiscale structural designs with optimized load carrying capabilities utilizing the design freedom of topology optimization. The indicators are engineered to visibly signal load conditions approaching the global critical buckling load at predefined locations. By showing noncritical local buckling when activated, the indicators provide early warning without compromising the overall structural integrity of the design. This proactive safety feature enhances structural reliability. The method is particularly beneficial for offshore wind turbines, where many sensors are located below sea level and are inaccessible for maintenance. By allowing the placement of indicators in accessible predetermined locations, our method can reduce the number of required sensors and improve structural health monitoring. Additionally, the potential use of memory overload indicators exploiting plasticity offers a reliable means of detecting overloads during offline periods. Experimental testing of 3D-printed designs confirms a strong correlation between measurements and numerical simulations, demonstrating the feasibility of creating structures that can signal the need for load reduction or maintenance at predetermined locations. This research contributes to the design of safer structures by introducing built-in early-warning failure systems.",

          "abstract": "As knowledge accumulates in science and society in a distributed fashion, erroneous derivations can be introduced into the corpus of knowledge. Such derivations can compromise the validity of any units of knowledge that rely on them in the future. Can societal knowledge maintain some level of integrity given simple distributed error-checking mechanisms? In this paper, we investigate the following formulation of the question: assuming that a constant fraction of the new derivations is wrong, is it possible for simple error-checking mechanisms that apply when a new unit of knowledge is derived to maintain the integrity of the corpus of knowledge? This question was introduced by Ben-Eliezer et al. [“Is this correct? Let’s check!” in 14th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference (ITCS, 2023)], who gave a robust affirmative answer in a specific probabilistic model for knowledge accumulation. Namely, this model required that new units depend on just one existing unit and join the process according to a preferential attachment rule. In this work, we consider much more general families of processes of knowledge accumulation, where new units may depend on multiple existing units and join according to varied attachment mechanisms. We also consider models with a (random) fraction of insertions of adversarial nodes. We give a robust affirmative answer to the above question by showing that for all of these models, as long as many of the units follow simple local heuristics for checking a bounded number of units they depend on, all errors will be eventually eliminated.",

          "abstract": "The design of organic–peptide hybrids has the potential to combine our vast knowledge of protein design with small molecule engineering to create hybrid structures with complex functions. Here, we describe the computational design of a photoswitchable Ca 2+ -binding organic–peptide hybrid. The designed molecule, designated Ca 2+ -binding switch (CaBS), combines an EF-hand motif from classical Ca 2+ -binding proteins such as calmodulin with a photoswitchable group that can be reversibly isomerized between a spiropyran (SP) and merocyanine (MC) state in response to different wavelengths of light. The MC/SP group acts both as a photoswitch as well as an optical sensor of Ca 2+ binding. Photoconversion of the SP to the corresponding MC unmasks an acidic phenol, which CaBS uses as an integral part of both its Ca 2+ -binding site as well as its tertiary and quaternary structure. By design, the SP state of CaBS is monomeric, while the Ca 2+ -bound form of the MC state is an obligate dimer, with two Ca 2+ -binding sites formed at the interface of a domain-swapped dimer. Thus, light and Ca 2+ were expected to serve as an “AND gate” that powers a change in backbone structure/dynamics, oligomerization state, and fluorescence properties of the designed molecule. CaBS was designed using Rosetta and molecular dynamics simulations, and experimentally characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, isothermal titration calorimetry, and optical titrations. These data illustrate the potential of combining small molecule engineering with de novo protein design to develop sensors whose conformation, association state, and optical properties respond to multiple environmental cues.",

          "abstract": "Chromobox 2 (CBX2), a crucial component of the polycomb repressive complex (PRC), has been implicated in the development of various human cancers. However, its role in the regulation of tumor immunogenicity and immune evasion remains inadequately understood. In this study, we found that ablation of CBX2 led to tumor growth inhibition, activation of the tumor immune microenvironment, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1 or adoptive T cell therapies by using murine syngeneic tumor models. By analysis of the CBX2-regulated transcriptional program coupled with mass spectrometry screening of CBX2-interacting proteins, we found that CBX2 suppresses interferon signaling independent of its function in the canonical PRC. Mechanistically, CBX2 directly interacts with RACK1 and facilitates the recruitment of HDAC1, which attenuates the H3K27ac modification on the promoter regions of interferon-stimulated genes, thereby suppressing interferon signaling. Consequently, CBX2 reduces tumor immunogenicity and enables immune evasion. Moreover, a high expression level of CBX2 is associated with immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and reduced efficacy of immunotherapy across various human cancer types. Our study identifies a noncanonical CBX2–RACK1–HDAC1 corepressor complex in suppression of tumor immunogenicity, thereby presenting a potential target and biomarker for tumor immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Enzyme–enzyme interactions are fundamental to the function of cells. Their atomistic mechanisms remain elusive mainly due to limitations of in-cell measurements. We address this challenge by atomistically modeling, for a total of ≈80 μs, a slice of the human cell cytoplasm that includes three successive enzymes along the glycolytic pathway: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). We tested the model for nonspecific protein stickiness, an artifact of current atomistic force fields in crowded environments. The simulations reveal that the human enzymes co-organize in-cell into transient submetabolon complexes, consistent with previous experimental results. Our data both reiterate known specificity between GAPDH and PGK and reveal extensive direct interactions between GAPDH and PGM. Our simulations further reveal, through force field benchmarking, the critical role of protein solvation in facilitating these enzyme–enzyme interactions. Transient interenzyme interactions with μs lifetime occur repeatedly in our simulations via specific sticky protein surface patches, with interactions often mediated by charged patch residues. Some of the residues that interact frequently with one another lie in or near the active site of the enzymes. We show that some of these patches correspond to a general mode to interact with several partners for promiscuous enzymes like GAPDH. We further show that the non-native yeast PGK is stickier than human PGK in our human cytoplasm model, supporting the idea of evolutionary pressure to reduce sticking. Our cytoplasm modeling paves the way toward capturing the atomistic dynamics of an entire enzymatic pathway in-cell.",

The caseinolytic mitochondrial matrix peptidase chaperone subunit X (ClpX) recognizes and translocates protein substrates into the degradation chamber of the caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) for proteolysis. ClpXP degrades damaged respiratory chain proteins and is necessary for cancer cell survival. Despite the critical role of ClpXP in mitochondrial protein quality control, the specific degrons, or modifications that tag substrate proteins for degradation by human ClpXP, are still unknown. We demonstrated that phosphorylated serine (pSer) targets substrates to ClpX and facilitates their degradation by ClpXP in biochemical assays. In contrast, ClpP hyperactivated by the small-molecule drug ONC201 lost the preference for phosphorylated substrates. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry combined with biochemical assays showed that pSer binds the RKL loop of ClpX. ClpX variants with substitutions in the RKL loop failed to recognize phosphorylated substrates. In intact cells, ClpXP also preferentially degraded substrates with pSer. Moreover, ClpX substrates with the pSer were selectively found in aggregated mitochondrial proteins. Our work uncovers a mechanism for substrate recognition by ClpXP, with implications for targeting acute myeloid leukemia and other disorders involving ClpXP dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Microbial mats are stratified communities often dominated by unicellular and filamentous phototrophs within an exopolymer matrix. It is challenging to quantify the dynamic responses of community members in situ as they experience steep gradients and rapid fluctuations of light. To address this, we developed a binary consortium using two representative isolates from hot spring mats: the unicellular oxygenic phototrophic cyanobacterium Synechococcus OS-B′ (Syn OS-B′) and the filamentous anoxygenic phototroph Chloroflexus MS-CIW-1 (Chfl MS-1). We quantified the motility of individual cells and entire colonies and demonstrated that Chfl MS-1 formed bundles of filaments that moved in all directions with no directional bias to light. Syn OS-B′ was slightly less motile but exhibited positive phototaxis. This binary consortium displayed cooperative behavior by moving further than either species alone and formed ordered arrays where both species aligned with the light source. No cooperative motility was observed when a nonmotile pilB mutant of Syn OS-B′ was used instead of Syn OS-B′. The binary consortium also produced more adherent biofilm than individual species, consistent with the close interspecies association revealed by electron microscopy. We propose that cyanobacteria and Chloroflexota cooperate in forming natural microbial mats by colonizing new niches and building robust biofilms.",

          "abstract": "Tumor cells reshape iron and lipid metabolism for their rapid proliferation. However, how tumor cells coordinate the interplay between tumor cell–specific iron homeostasis and lipid metabolism reprogramming to counteract energy shortages remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that glucose deprivation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells induced AMPK-dependent Transferrin S685 phosphorylation, which exposed Transferrin nuclear localization signal (NLS) for binding to importin α7 and subsequent nuclear translocation. Nucleus-translocated Transferrin interacts with PPARα and enhance its protein stability to increase fatty acid oxidation (FAO) upon glucose deprivation. Mechanistically, PPARα-associated Transferrin upregulates iron-dependent PHD2-mediated PPARα P87 hydroxylation and subsequently disrupts the binding of MDM2 to PPARα, therefore inhibiting MDM2-mediated PPARα ubiquitination and degradation. Reconstitution of Transferrin S685A and NLS mutation or knock-in expression of PPARα P87A inhibited PPARα-mediated FAO upon energy stress, enhanced HCC cell apoptosis, and impeded liver tumor growth in mice. Importantly, combined treatment with Transferrin pS685 blocking peptide suppressing AMPK-Transferrin-PPARα axis could synergize with a well-established AMPK activator Metformin to inhibit tumor growth. Additionally, Transferrin pS685-mediated PPARα P87 hydroxylation is positively correlated with PPARα expression levels in human HCC specimens and poor patient prognosis. These findings revealed a mechanism by which Transferrin can sense energy stress to promote the hydroxylation and protein stability of PPARα through iron-dependent activation of PHD2 and underscore the moonlighting function of Transferrin in lipid catabolism and liver tumor development.",

Here, we performed an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea forward genetic screening in zebrafish and identified an accelerated aging mutant named meteor ( met ), harboring a mutation in the Werner syndrome RecQ - like helicase ( wrn ) gene. Loss of wrn leads to a short lifespan and age-related characteristics in the intestine of zebrafish embryos, such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, and epigenetic alteration. Therefore, we conducted a screening of antiaging drugs using the met mutant and revealed that sapanisertib effectively ameliorated most of the aging phenotypes of the mutant. Mechanistically, the geroprotective effects of sapanisertib may be attributed to inhibition of mTORC1/2. Furthermore, sapanisertib also attenuated chronological aging in wild-type aged zebrafish and replicative-senescence in human foreskin fibroblasts. Taken together, our study introduces a unique and efficient model for large-scale antiaging drug screening in vertebrates and suggests sapanisertib as a potential therapeutic option for treating premature aging and promoting healthy aging.",

          "abstract": "The mammalian Hippo kinases, MST1 and MST2, regulate organ development and suppress tumor formation by balancing cell proliferation and death. In macrophages, inflammasomes detect molecular patterns from invading pathogens or damaged host cells and trigger programmed cell death. In addition to lytic pyroptosis, the signatures associated with apoptosis are induced by inflammasome activation, but how the inflammasomes coordinate different cell death processes remains unclear. Here, we identify the crucial role of MST1/2 in inflammasome-triggered cell death. Macrophages proteolytically convert full-length MST1/2 into the MST1/2 N-terminal fragments (MST1/2-NT) when the NLRC4 inflammasome detects flagellin from the pathogenic bacterium, Legionella pneumophila . Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by the damage-associated molecular pattern, extracellular ATP, also produces MST1/2-NT. Caspase-1, the protease activated by these inflammasomes, directly cleaves MST1/2, and blockage of caspase-1 inhibits MST1/2-NT production in macrophages challenged with L. pneumophila . Importantly, MST1/2-NT production is critical for macrophages to trigger a set of death processes associated with apoptosis upon inflammasome activation and knocking out Mst1/2 causes dysregulated gasdermin protein cleavage for pyroptotic death. Furthermore, macrophages lacking MST1/2 have increased susceptibility to virulent L. pneumophila, revealing that the Hippo kinases are important restriction factors against the pathogen. These findings demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage of MST1/2 induced by inflammatory stimuli is an immune pathway to regulate programmed cell death in macrophages and uncover a unique link between the tumor-suppressive Hippo kinases and the inflammasomes in innate immunity.",

LRRK2 phosphorylates Rab guanosine triphosphatase (GTPases) within the Switch II domain while PINK1 directly phosphorylates Parkin and ubiquitin (Ub) and indirectly induces phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPases. Herein we have crossed LRRK2 [R1441C] mutant knock-in mice with PINK1 knock-out (KO) mice and report that loss of PINK1 does not impact endogenous LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation nor do we see significant effect of mutant LRRK2 on PINK1-mediated Rab and Ub phosphorylation. In addition, we observe that a pool of the Rab-specific, protein phosphatase family member 1H phosphatase, is transcriptionally up-regulated and recruited to damaged mitochondria, independent of PINK1 or LRRK2 activity. Parallel signaling of LRRK2 and PINK1 pathways is supported by assessment of motor behavioral studies that show no evidence of genetic interaction in crossed mouse lines. Previously we showed loss of cilia in LRRK2 R1441C mice and herein we show that PINK1 KO mice exhibit a ciliogenesis defect in striatal cholinergic interneurons and astrocytes that interferes with Hedgehog induction of glial derived-neurotrophic factor transcription. This is not exacerbated in double-mutant LRRK2 and PINK1 mice. Overall, our analysis indicates that LRRK2 activation and/or loss of PINK1 function along parallel pathways to impair ciliogenesis, suggesting a convergent mechanism toward PD. Our data suggest that reversal of defects downstream of ciliogenesis offers a common therapeutic strategy for LRRK2 or PINK1 PD patients, whereas LRRK2 inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials are unlikely to benefit PINK1 PD patients.",

Diverse mutations of TET2 are frequently found in various blood cancers, yet the full scope of their functional consequences has been unexplored. Here, we report that a subset of TET2 mutations identified in leukemia patients alter the substrate specificity of TET2 from acting on mC to thymine. This neomorphic activity results from substitutions at key residues involved in the interactions with the mC base, including Asn1387 and His1904. Recombinant human TET2 proteins harboring the mutation of these residues can catalyze the oxidation of thymine to 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) and 5-formyluracil (fU). Exogenous expression of the mutant TET2 Asn1387Thr (N1387T) in HEK293T cells leads to hmU accumulation, with levels further increased in cells lacking the glycosylase SMUG1. Endogenous knock-in of N1300T, the murine equivalent of N1387T, in mouse embryonic stem cells induces hmU production, causing DNA lesions and transcriptional activation of DNA damage response genes. N1300T cells accumulate more additional mutations with extended culture and exhibit heightened sensitivity to ATR inhibition compared to Tet2 knockout cells. Our study reveals that certain patient-derived TET2 mutations can acquire unexpected gain-of-function activities beyond impairing mC oxidation, offering a fresh perspective on the diverse molecular etiology of mutant TET2-related leukemogenesis.",

While measurements and theory indicate that the reacting graphyne becomes nonplanar because of sheet wrinkling produced by dimensional mismatch between reacted and nonreacted sheet regions, sheet planarity is regained when the reaction is complete. Although the observed elimination of triple bonds to make parallel planar sp 2 carbon sheets likely requires ordered transformation within each sheet, diffraction data for reacted multisheet stacks indicate that the relative lateral positions of neighboring sheets are disordered, as predicted, since no crystalline diffraction peak (other than for the intersheet spacing) is observed.",

Natural history collections, from modern biological specimens to the archaeological and fossil records, are crucial tools for understanding cultural and biological processes that shape our modern world. At the same time, natural history collections in low and middle-income countries are at-risk and underresourced, imperiling efforts to build the infrastructure and scientific capacity necessary to tackle critical challenges. The case of Mongolia exemplifies the unique challenges of preserving natural history collections in a country with limited financial resources under the thumb of scientific colonialism. Specifically, the lack of biorepository infrastructure throughout Mongolia stymies efforts to study or respond to large-scale environmental changes of the modern era. Investment in museum capacity and training to develop locally-accessible collections that characterize natural communities over time and space must be a key priority for a future where understanding climate scenarios, predicting, and responding to zoonotic disease, making informed conservation choices, or adapting to agricultural challenges, will be all but impossible without relevant and accessible collections.",

          "abstract": "The ionizable lipid component of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations is essential for mRNA delivery by facilitating endosomal escape. Conventionally, these lipids are synthesized through complex, multistep chemical processes that are both time-consuming and require significant engineering. Furthermore, the development of new ionizable lipids is hindered by a limited understanding of the structure-activity relationships essential for effective mRNA delivery. In this work, we have developed a modular platform utilizing the Passerini reaction to rapidly generate large, chemically diverse libraries of biodegradable ionizable lipids. This high-throughput approach enables the systematic exploration of various lipid components–head groups, tails, and spacers–and their impacts on mRNA delivery efficiency. By investigating the hydrogen bonding potential between the lipid’s head groups and the mRNA’s ribose phosphate complex, we found that optimizing the methylene units between the lipid’s head groups and linkages could enhance endosomal escape and, consequently, mRNA delivery efficiencies. Leveraging this insight, our platform has led to the identification of the biodegradable ionizable lipid A4B4-S3, which outperforms the current clinical benchmark, SM-102, in gene editing efficacy in mouse liver following systemic administration and demonstrates the promise for repeat-dose protein replacement treatments. This work not only offers a rapid, scalable method for ionizable lipid synthesis but also deepens our understanding of their structure-activity relationships, paving the way for more effective mRNA therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity may pave the way for rapid adaptation to newly encountered environments. Although it is often contested, there is growing evidence that initial plastic responses of ancestral populations to new environmental cues may promote subsequent adaptation. However, we do not know whether plasticity to cues present in the ancestral habitat (past-cue plasticity) can facilitate adaptation to novel cues. Conceivably, this could occur if plastic responses are coincidentally optimal to both past and novel cues (i.e., are preadaptive) or if they are transferred to novel cues during adaptation. Past plastic phenotype values could also become fixed during adaptation to the new environment. To uncover the role of past-cue plasticity in adaptation, we tested gene expression plasticity responses of two parallel mine-waste-adapted Silene uniflora populations and their closest coastal relatives. Plants were exposed to the past and novel cues of salt and zinc, which revealed that during adaptation to mine waste, plasticity to salt diminishes. Despite this, our results show that ancestral plasticity to salt has a substantial impact on subsequent adaptation to zinc. For a third of genes that have evolved zinc plasticity in mine populations, salt plasticity has been transferred to the zinc response. Furthermore, a quarter of fixed expression differences between mine and coastal populations were similar to ancestral salt responses. Alongside evidence that ancestral plasticity to novel cues can facilitate adaptation, our results provide a clear indication that ancestral past-cue plasticity can also play a key role in rapid, parallel adaptation to novel habitats.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial receptors feed into multiple signal transduction pathways that regulate a variety of cellular processes including gene expression, second messenger levels, and motility. Receptors are typically activated by signal binding to ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Cache domains are omnipresent LBDs found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, including humans. They form the predominant family of extracytosolic bacterial LBDs and were identified in all major receptor types. Cache domains are composed of either a single (sCache) or a double (dCache) structural module. The functional relevance of bimodular LBDs remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the PacF chemoreceptor in the phytopathogen Pectobacterium atrosepticum that recognizes formate at the membrane-distal module of its dCache domain, triggering chemoattraction. We further demonstrate that a family of formate-specific sCache domains has evolved from a dCache domain, exemplified by PacF, by losing the membrane-proximal module. By solving high-resolution structures of two family members in complex with formate, we show that the molecular basis for formate binding at sCache and dCache domains is highly similar, despite their low sequence identity. The apparent loss of the membrane-proximal module may be related to the observation that dCache domains bind ligands typically at the membrane-distal module, whereas studies have failed to find ligands bound in the membrane-proximal module. This work advances our understanding of signal sensing in bacterial receptors and suggests that evolution by reducing complexity may be a route for shaping diversity.",

          "abstract": "CaSiO 3 perovskite (CaPv) is the last major mineral in the Earth’s lower mantle whose elasticity remains largely unresolved. Here, we investigate the elasticity of CaPv using ab initio machine-learning force fields (MLFF). At room temperature, the elasticity of tetragonal CaPv determined by MLFF molecular dynamics (MD) agrees well with experimental measurements after considering temperature induced variations in the hydrostatic structure, proving the effectiveness of the method. We use the MLFF MD in the NPT ensemble to establish the tetragonal–cubic phase boundary and confirm that in the lower mantle CaPv is in the cubic phase. The elasticity of cubic CaPv shows distinct temperature dependence at different ranges: it is linear at high temperatures, whereas it exhibits anomalous precursor softening near the tetragonal–cubic phase boundary. The temperature interval of precursor softening widens as the pressure increases and overlaps with the temperature profile of subducted cold slabs near the core–mantle boundary. While cubic CaPv is seismically invisible along the average mantle geotherm, it may induce low-velocity zones with negative temperature anomaly, leading to the view that the large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) may be caused by subducted oceanic crust rich in CaPv with temperature lower than ambient mantle. A cool, rigid LLSVP may help explain the preferential formation of mantle plumes at its margins, as well as its weaker seismic anisotropy.",

We observe a plateau at magnetization equal to 1 9 Bohr magneton per magnetic ion, accompanied by oscillations in the magnetic torque, reminiscent of quantum oscillations in metals.

          "abstract": "The chloroplast genome encodes key components of the photosynthetic light reaction machinery as well as the large subunit of the enzyme central for carbon fixation, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphat-carboxylase/-oxygenase (RuBisCo). Its expression is predominantly regulated posttranscriptionally, with nuclear-encoded RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) playing a key role. Mutants of chloroplast gene expression factors often exhibit impaired chloroplast biogenesis, especially in cold conditions. Low temperatures pose a challenge for plants as this leads to electron imbalances and oxidative damage. A well-known response of plants to this problem is to increase the production of RuBisCo and other Calvin Cycle enzymes in the cold, but how this is achieved is unclear. The chloroplast RBP CP29A has been shown to be essential for cold resistance in growing leaf tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana . Here, we examined CP29A–RNA interaction sites at nucleotide resolution. We found that CP29A preferentially binds to the 5′-untranslated region of rbcL , downstream of the binding site of the pentatricopeptide repeat protein MATURATION OF RBCL 1 (MRL1). MRL1 is an RBP known to be necessary for the accumulation of rbcL . In Arabidopsis mutants lacking CP29A, we were unable to observe significant effects on rbcL , possibly due to CP29A’s restricted role in a limited number of cells at the base of leaves. In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants of tobacco NtCP29A exhibit cold-dependent photosynthetic deficiencies throughout the entire leaf blade. This is associated with a parallel reduction in rbcL mRNA and RbcL protein accumulation. Our work indicates that a chloroplast RNA–binding protein contributes to cold acclimation of RbcL production.",

          "abstract": "Cellular actin networks exhibit distinct assembly and disassembly dynamics, primarily driven by multicomponent reactions occurring at the two ends of actin filaments. While barbed ends are recognized as the hotspot for polymerization, depolymerization is predominantly associated with pointed ends. Consequently, mechanisms promoting barbed-end depolymerization have received relatively little attention. Here, using microfluidics-assisted three-color single-molecule imaging, we reveal that cyclase-associated protein (CAP), long known for its roles in nucleotide exchange and pointed-end depolymerization, also acts as a processive depolymerase at filament barbed ends. CAP molecules track barbed ends for several minutes, inducing depolymerization rates of up to 60 subunits per second. Importantly, CAP modulates barbed-end dynamics even under cytosol-mimicking assembly promoting conditions. We further show that CAP can colocalize with both formin and capping protein (CP) at barbed ends. CAP enhances formin processivity by 10-fold, allowing CAP–formin complexes to track fast-elongating barbed ends. In contrast, CAP destabilizes CP-bound barbed ends and accelerates dissociation of CP by fourfold. Our findings, combined with CAP’s previously reported activities, firmly establish CAP as a key regulator of cellular actin dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Airborne insects generate a leading edge vortex when they flap their wings. This coherent vortex is a low-pressure region that enhances the lift of flapping wings compared to fixed wings. Insect wings are thin membranes strengthened by a system of veins that does not allow large wing deformations. Bat wings are thin compliant skin membranes stretched between their limbs, hand, and body that show larger deformations during flapping wing flight. This study examines the role of the leading edge vortex on highly deformable membrane wings that passively change shape under fluid dynamic loading maintaining a positive camber throughout the hover cycle. Our experiments reveal that unsteady wing deformations suppress the formation of a coherent leading edge vortex as flexibility increases. At lift and energy optimal aeroelastic conditions, there is no more leading edge vortex. Instead, vorticity accumulates in a bound shear layer covering the wing’s upper surface from the leading to the trailing edge. Despite the absence of a leading edge vortex, the optimal deformable membrane wings demonstrate enhanced lift and energy efficiency compared to their rigid counterparts. It is possible that small bats rely on this mechanism for efficient hovering. We relate the force production on the wings with their deformation through scaling analyses. Additionally, we identify the geometric angles at the leading and trailing edges as observable indicators of the flow state and use them to map out the transitions of the flow topology and their aerodynamic performance for a wide range of aeroelastic conditions.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is impacting forests in complex ways, with indirect effects arising from interactions between tree growth and reproduction often overlooked. Our 43-y study of European beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) showed that rising summer temperatures since 2005 have led to more frequent seed production events. This shift increases reproductive effort but depletes the trees’ stored resources due to insufficient recovery periods between seed crops. Consequently, annual tree ring increments have declined by 28%, dropping from a stable average of 1.60 mm y −1 between 1980 and 2005 to 1.16 mm y −1 thereafter. Importantly, this growth decline occurred without an accompanying trend in summer drought, indicating that altered reproductive patterns—not moisture stress—are driving the reduction. This creates a “perfect storm”: Increased reproductive effort drains resources, viable seed output falls due to the loss of mast-seeding benefits via pollination and lower seed predation, and the ongoing growth decline reduces current carbon uptake and future reproductive potential. These compounding factors threaten the sustainability of Europe’s most widespread forest tree. Our findings unveil a critical yet underrecognized indirect mechanism by which climate change endangers forest ecosystems, emphasizing the need to consider interactions between demographic processes when assessing species vulnerability to climate change.",

Bacterial and yeast Hsp70s and their cochaperones function synergistically with Hsp90s to reactivate inactive and aggregated proteins by a mechanism that requires a direct interaction between Hsp90 and Hsp70 both in vitro and in vivo. Escherichia coli and yeast Hsp70s also collaborate in bichaperone systems with ClpB and Hsp104, respectively, to disaggregate and reactivate aggregated proteins and amyloids such as prions. These collaborations are dependent on direct interactions between ClpB/Hsp104 and Hsp70. We explored the possibility that E. coli homologs of Hsp70, Hsp90, and ClpB, referred to as DnaK, Hsp90 Ec , and ClpB, respectively, in combination with two DnaK cochaperones, DnaJ and GrpE, could promote protein disaggregation and reactivation under conditions where bichaperone systems are ineffective. Our results show that Hsp90 Ec is able to overcome the inhibition of protein disaggregation and reactivation observed when the concentration of DnaK is approaching physiological concentrations. We found that ATP hydrolysis and substrate binding by all three chaperones are essential for the collaborative function. The work further shows that ClpB acts early in protein reactivation with DnaK and its cochaperones; E. coli Hsp90 acts at a later stage after ClpB.

Despite the outstanding relevance of HCN channels for organisms, including generating electrical rhythmicity in cardiac pacemaker cells and diverse types of brain neurons, key channel properties are still elusive. In particular, the unitary conductance, γ, of HCN channels is highly controversial. We analyzed the unitary conductance at femtosiemens resolution of all four homotetrameric channels of the mouse, mHCN1–4. All conductance values are in the range of 1 pS which is exceptionally small compared to most other ion channels. Surprisingly, the conductance among the isoforms differs up to threefold (γ mHCN2 = 1.54 pS &gt; γ mHCN1 = 0.84 pS &gt; γ mHCN3 = 0.54 pS ≈ γ mHCN4 = 0.51 pS) though the residues in the two narrow parts of the pore, the selectivity filter and the inner gate, are conserved. Mutagenesis and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the differences in the conductance are generated by different amounts of negative charges in the outer channel vestibule, which control ion accumulation. In line with these results, heterotetrameric channels exhibit intermediate unitary conductance values with respect to the homotetrameric channels. Our approach demonstrates how HCN channels can be functionally differentiated at the single-channel level, paving the way to target specific channels with selective drugs.",

Genetic deletion of TgCLP1 resulted in a thickened cyst wall that decreased cyst turnover, blocked the export of virulence effectors into host cells, and resulted in failure to persist during chronic infection. Genetic complementation with a series of mutants revealed that the GH19 glycosidase domain was crucial for regulating glycosylation of several glycoproteins in the cyst wall.

          "authors": "Evgenii Kliuchnikov, Kenneth A. Marx, Valeri Barsegov, Alex Mogilner",
          "abstract": "Accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis depends on proper connections of sister chromatids, through microtubules, to the opposite poles of the early mitotic spindle. Transiently, many inaccurate connections are formed and rapidly corrected throughout the mitotic stages, but a small number of merotelic connections, in which a chromatid is connected to both spindle poles, remain lagging at the spindle’s equator in anaphase. Most of the lagging chromatids are eventually moved to one or the other pole, likely by a combination of microtubules’ turnover and the brute force of pulling by the microtubules’ majority from the one pole against the microtubules’ minority from the other pole. We use computer simulations from two stochastic models (1D and full 3D CellDynaMo model) combining force balances and microtubules’ dynamics for the lagging chromatids to investigate what maximizes the percentage of segregated laggards. We find that a) brute force tug-of-war with slow (&lt; 0.0001 s −1 ) microtubules’ detachment rate can move asymmetric laggards to the poles in limited time, b) rapid (&gt; 0.01 s −1 ) microtubules’ detachment rate leads to a significant loss of the laggards, and c) intermediate (~ 0.001 s −1 ) microtubules’ detachment rate ensures higher than 90% accuracy of segregation. The simulations also shed light on the waiting time required to correct the merotelic errors in anaphase and on the roles of chromatid-attached microtubule number and Aurora B–mediated, spatially graded regulation of microtubule kinetics in anaphase.",

          "abstract": "The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to orthogonalize inputs from the entorhinal cortex (pattern separation) and relay this information to the CA3 region. In turn, attractor dynamics in CA3 perform a pattern completion or error correction operation before sending its output to CA1. In a mouse model of congenital hypoplasia of the DG, a deficiency in the Wntless (Wls) gene, specifically in cells expressing Gfap-Cre , which targets neuronal progenitors, led to an almost total absence of dentate granule cells and modestly impaired performance in spatial tasks. Here, we investigated the physiological consequences of granule cell loss in these mice by conducting in vivo calcium imaging from CA1 principal cells during behavior. The spatial selectivity of these cells was preserved without the DG. On a linear track, place fields in mutant mice were more likely to be near track terminals and to encode the distance from the start point in each running direction. In an open box, CA1 cells in mutant mice exhibited reductions in the percentage of place cells, in spatial information, and in place field stability. The reduction in place field stability across repeated exposures to the same environment resulted in a reduction in the differential representations of two different contexts in mutant mice compared to wild-type mice. These results suggest that DG helps to stabilize CA1 spatial representations, especially in 2-D environments, and that the lack of stability across similar environments may play a key role in the deficits of animals with DG dysfunction in discriminating different environments.",

At birth, FRT epithelium is highly malleable, allowing differentiation into various epithelial types, but the regulatory pathways guiding these early cell fate decisions are unclear. Here, we use neonatal mouse endometrial organoids and assembloid coculture models to investigate how innate cellular plasticity and external mesenchymal signals influence epithelial differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that uterine epithelium undergoes marked age-dependent changes, transitioning from a highly plastic state capable of forming both monolayered and multilayered structures to a more restricted fate as development progresses. Interestingly, parallels emerge between the developmental plasticity of neonatal uterine epithelium and pathological conditions such as endometrial cancer, where similar regulatory mechanisms may reactivate, driving abnormal epithelial differentiation and tumorigenesis. These results not only deepen our understanding of early uterine development but also offer a valuable model for studying the progression of reproductive diseases and cancers.",

RpSP1 interacts with and stabilizes a HSP40 family protein GmSPIP1 and is dependent on GmSPIP1 to induce cell death. We show that a critical 22-amino acid peptide within RpSP1 acts as an intracellular insect-derived elicitor. Furthermore, RpSP1 enhances insect-feeding efficiency. The dual functionality of RpSP1 is highlighted by the significant reduction of soybean staygreen-like syndrome following its overexpression in soybean plants or knockdown in insects.

However, electron microscopy (EM) has long ago revealed the presence of particles inside the lumens of neuronal MTs, of yet unknown identity and function. Here, we use cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) to analyze the three-dimensional (3D) organization and structures of MT lumenal particles in primary hippocampal neurons, human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons, and pluripotent and differentiated P19 cells. We obtain in situ density maps of several lumenal particles from the respective cells and detect common structural features underscoring their potential overarching functions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics combined with structural modeling suggest that a subset of lumenal particles could be tubulin-binding cofactors (TBCs) bound to tubulin monomers. A different subset of smaller particles, which remains unidentified, exhibits densities that bridge across the MT protofilaments. We show that increased lumenal particle concentration within MTs is concomitant with neuronal differentiation and correlates with higher MT curvatures. Enrichment of lumenal particles around MT lattice defects and at freshly polymerized MT open-ends suggests a MT protective role. Together with the identified structural resemblance of a subset of particles to TBCs, these results hint at a role in local tubulin proteostasis for the maintenance of long-lived neuronal MTs.",

DOX-induced DNA damage activates Tp53 class mediators across ovarian cell types. In the mesenchyme, cotreatment with AMH halts theca progenitor differentiation and reduces apoptotic gene expression. In preantral granulosa cells, DOX upregulates the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a and dysregulates Wnt signaling, which are ameliorated by AMH cotreatment. Finally, AMH induces Id3 , a gene involved in DNA repair, which is necessary to prevent the accumulation of DNA lesions marked by γ-H2AX. Altogether these mechanisms of AMH protection contribute to sustained fertility in mice, offering promising broad avenues for fertility preservation in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Carrier-free nanomedicines exhibited significant potential in elevating drug efficacy and safety for tumor management, yet their self assembly typically relied on chemical modifications of drugs or the incorporation of surfactants, thereby compromising the drug’s inherent pharmacological activity. To address this challenge, we proposed a triethylamine (TEA)-mediated protonation–deprotonation strategy that enabled the adjustable-proportion self assembly of dual drugs without chemical modification, achieving nearly 100% drug loading capacity. Molecular dynamic simulations, supported by experiment evidence, elucidated the underlying self-assembly mechanism. Specifically, TEA facilitated the deprotonation of Doxorubicin (Dox) and α-Tocopherol succinate (α-tos), causing Dox to transition from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state, while simultaneously increasing the hydrophilicity of α-tos. This allowed for a fine-tuned balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the two compounds, enabling their precise self assembly into a carrier-free nanomedicine (DT) with a tailored drug ratio. The engineered DT demonstrated the ability to accumulate at the tumor sites and release its therapeutic drugs in a controlled manner. The combination of Dox and α-tos synergistically generated reactive oxygen species and modulated the expression of tumor matrix metalloproteinase-9, leading to superior antitumor efficacy without significant metastasis, while maintaining excellent safety profiles. Our findings provided unique perspectives on the design of carrier-free nanomedicine for cancer therapy, thereby laying a solid foundation for its potential clinical translation.",

Although the disulfide bond formed between Cys57 and Cys146 in the active state has been well studied, the role of the reduced cysteine residues, Cys6 and Cys111, in SOD1 filament formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of reduced cysteine residues by determining and comparing cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of wild-type (WT) and C6A/C111A SOD1 filaments under thiol-based reducing and metal-depriving conditions, starting with protein samples possessing enzymatic activity. The C6A/C111A mutant SOD1 formed filaments more rapidly than the WT protein. The mutant structure had a unique paired-protofilament arrangement, with a smaller filament core than that of the single-protofilament structure observed in WT SOD1. Although the single-protofilament form developed more slowly, cross-seeding experiments demonstrated the predominance of single-protofilament morphology over paired protofilaments, regardless of the presence of the Cys6 and Cys111 mutations. These findings highlight the importance of the number of amino acid residues within the filament core in determining the energy requirements for assembly. Our study provides insights into ALS pathogenesis by elucidating the initiation and propagation of filament formation, which potentially leads to deleterious amyloid filaments.",

          "abstract": "In the pregenomic era, scientists were puzzled by the observation that haploid genome size (the C-value) did not correlate well with organismal complexity. This phenomenon, called the “C-value paradox,” is mostly explained by the fact that protein-coding genes occupy only a small fraction of eukaryotic genomes. When the first genome sequences became available, scientists were even more surprised by the fact that the number of genes (G-value) was also a poor predictor of complexity, which gave rise to the “G-value paradox.” The proposed explanations usually invoke mechanisms that increase the information content of each individual gene (protein–protein interactions, intrinsic disorder, posttranslational modifications, alternative splicing, etc.). Less attention has been paid to mechanisms that increase the amount of genetic material but do not increase (or not to the same extent) the amount of information encoded in the genome, such as gene duplication and domain shuffling. Proteins belonging to the same family and/or sharing the same domains often carry out similar or even redundant functions. We thus hypothesized that an organism’s number of different protein families and domains should be suitable predictors of organismal complexity. In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed that the number of protein families, clans, domains, and motifs increases from simple to progressively more complex organisms. In addition, these metrics correlate with the number of cell types better than and independently of the number of protein-coding genes and several previously proposed predictors of organismal complexity. Our observations have the potential to represent a resolution to the G-value paradox.",

          "abstract": "Classical tissue recombination experiments demonstrate that cell-fate determination along the anterior–posterior axis of the Müllerian duct occurs prior to postnatal day 7 in mice. However, little is known about how these cell types are maintained in adults. In this study, we provide genetic evidence that a balance between antagonistic retinoic acid (RA) and estrogen signaling activity is required to maintain simple columnar cell fate in adult uterine epithelium. Transdifferentiation of simple columnar uterine epithelium into stratified cervicovaginal-like epithelium was observed in three related mouse genetic models, in which RA signaling was perturbed in the postnatal uterus. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified the transformed epithelial cell populations and revealed extensive immune cell infiltration resulting from loss of RA signaling. Surprisingly, disruption of RA signaling led to dysregulated expression of a substantial number of estrogen target genes, suggesting that these two pathways may functionally oppose each other in determining and maintaining uterine epithelial cell fate. Consistent with this model, neonatal exposure to the strong synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol, downregulated expression of a group of RA target genes and led to epithelial stratification and immune cell infiltration in wild-type uterus. Treating RA receptor triple conditional knockout pups with fulvestrant, an estrogen antagonist, reestablished the balance between the two signaling pathways, and effectively prevented the transformation of mutant simple columnar epithelia to metaplastic stratified epithelia. These findings implicate an essential role for RA signaling in maintaining uterine cytodifferentiation by antagonizing estrogen signaling in the postnatal uterus.",

Compared to controls, for which viremia rebounded 2 wk following ATI, mAb infusion delayed rebound for both groups ( P = 0.0003). Animals that received the 4-mAb regimen rebounded 3 to 6 wk post-ATI while the 2-mAb regimen rebounded 5 to 22 wk post-ATI. Envelope escape mutations emerged in rebound virus of mAb-treated animals that abrogated neutralization by ITS103.01, the most potent in the cocktail.

This accomplishment was a precursor to an unprecedented burgeoning of large language models (LLMs) in the life sciences. That was just the beginning. In recent months, we have moved into a hyperaccelerated phase of new foundation models , pretrained on massive datasets, with the ability to perform a wide range of tasks that are helping us understand the structure, biology, evolution, and design of proteins, RNA, DNA, and ligands, as well as their biomolecular interactions. Unlike multimodal LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude, which process text, audio, and images, these large language of life models (LLLMs) are multiomic. That is to say, they are not only multimodal but pertain to different layers of molecular biology. For example, Evo , a foundation model trained on 2.7 million diverse phage and prokaryotic genomes (equivalent to about 300 billion DNA nucleotides), predicts the impact of variants in DNA, RNA, or proteins on structure and function, as well as how essential genes are to cell function, and can generate new DNA sequences.",

This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease, which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation.

          "abstract": "Studying the functional consequences of structural variants (SVs) in mammalian genomes is challenging because (i) SVs arise much less commonly than single-nucleotide variants or small indels and (ii) methods to generate, map, and characterize SVs in model systems are underdeveloped. To address these challenges, we developed Genome-Shuffle-seq, a method that enables the multiplex generation and mapping of thousands of SVs (deletions, inversions, translocations, and extrachromosomal circles) throughout mammalian genomes. We also demonstrate the co-capture of SV identity with single-cell transcriptomes, facilitating the measurement of SV impact on gene expression. We anticipate that Genome-Shuffle-seq will be broadly useful for the systematic exploration of the functional consequences of SVs on gene expression, the chromatin landscape, and three-dimensional nuclear architecture, while also initiating a path toward a minimal mammalian genome.",

However, quantifying how individual responses to environmental change integrate and scale to influence population dynamics in polar bears has yet to be achieved. We developed an individual-based bioenergetic model and hindcast population dynamics across 42 years of observed sea ice conditions in Western Hudson Bay, a region undergoing rapid environmental change. The model successfully captured trends in individual morphometrics, reproduction, and population abundance observed over four decades of empirical monitoring data. Our study provides evidence for the interplay between individual energetics and environmental constraints in shaping population dynamics and for the fundamental role of a single limiting mechanism—energy—underpinning the decline of an apex Arctic predator.",

To address this gap, we applied CRISPR prime editing to insert recombination handles into repetitive sequences, up to 1697 per cell line, which enables generating large-scale deletions, inversions, translocations, and circular DNA. Recombinase induction produced more than 100 stochastic megabase-sized rearrangements in each cell. We tracked these rearrangements over time to measure selection pressures, finding a preference for shorter variants that avoided essential genes. We characterized 29 clones with multiple rearrangements, finding an impact of deletions on expression of genes in the variant but not on nearby genes. This genome-scrambling strategy enables large deletions, sequence relocations, and the insertion of regulatory elements to explore genome dispensability and organization.",

The ensuing Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) eroded ~270 million m 3 of sediment, which overwhelmed infrastructure, including hydropower installations along the Teesta River. The physical scale and human and economic impact of this event prompts urgent reflection on the role of climate change and human activities in exacerbating such disasters. Insights into multihazard evolution are pivotal for informing policy development, enhancing Early Warning Systems (EWS), and spurring paradigm shifts in GLOF risk management strategies in the Himalaya and other mountain environments.",

G -factors reached magnitudes as high as 1.30 for drop-cast films and 1.06 for patterned films, approaching theoretical limits. By controlling the evaporation geometry, various domain shapes and sizes were achieved, with homochiral domains exceeding 6 square millimeters that transition smoothly between left- and right-handed chirality. Our results uncovered fundamental relationships between meniscus deposition processes, the alignment of supramolecular filaments and their MSC constituents, and their connection to emergent chiral properties.",

Loss of Casz1 resulted in transdifferentiation of IHCs into OHCs, without affecting OHC production. However, long-term OHC survival was compromised in Casz1 mutant mice. In addition, the transcription factor Gata3 was down-regulated in Casz1 -deleted IHCs and overexpressing Gata3 partially rescued IHC properties, OHC numbers, and hearing in Casz1 -deleted mice. Thus, Casz1 plays critical roles in early IHC fate stabilization and OHC survival and could potentially provide a lead for therapies aimed at regenerating both IHCs and OHCs.",

Recording from large ensembles of hippocampal place cells in freely behaving rats, we observed that replay content is strictly organized over multiple timescales and governed by self-avoidance. After movement cessation, replays avoided the animal’s previous path for 3 seconds. Chains of replays avoided self-repetition over a shorter timescale. We used a continuous attractor model of neural activity to demonstrate that neuronal fatigue both generates replay sequences and produces self-avoidance over the observed timescales. In addition, replay of past experience became predominant later into the stopping period, in a manner requiring cortical input. These results indicate a mechanism for replay generation that unexpectedly constrains which sequences can be produced across time.",

In-flight, most hippocampal place cells were socially modulated and represented the identity and sex of conspecifics. Upon social interactions, neurons represented specific interaction types. During active observation, neurons encoded the bat’s own position and head direction, together with the position, direction, and identity of multiple conspecifics. Identity-coding neurons encoded the same bat across contexts. The strength of identity coding was modulated by sex, hierarchy, and social affiliation.

However, the mechanisms through which scratching exacerbates inflammation and whether scratching provides benefit to the host are largely unknown. We found that scratching was required for skin inflammation in mouse models dependent on FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. Scratching-induced inflammation required pain-sensing nociceptors, the neuropeptide substance P, and the mast cell receptor MrgprB2. Scratching also increased cutaneous inflammation and augmented host defense to superficial Staphylococcus aureus infection. Thus, through the activation of nociceptor-driven neuroinflammation, scratching both exacerbated allergic skin disease and provided protection from S. aureus , reconciling the seemingly paradoxical role of scratching as a pathological process and evolutionary adaptation.",

Protection was antibody dose–dependent yet independent of Fc-mediated effector functions at the dose tested. Macaques receiving MEDI8852 at 10 milligrams per kilogram or higher had negligible impairment of respiratory function after infection, whereas control animals were not protected from severe disease and fatality.

Unlike CODH, the multidomain ACS undergoes large conformational changes to form an internal connection to the CODH active site, accommodate the CoFeSP for methyl transfer, and protect the reaction intermediates. Altogether, the structures allow us to draw a detailed reaction mechanism of this enzyme, which is crucial for CO 2 fixation in anaerobic organisms.",

The mechanism by which the transcription machinery coordinates the deposition of H3K36me3 is not well understood. Here we provide cryo–electron microscopy structures of mammalian RNA polymerase II–DSIF-SPT6-PAF1c-TFIIS-IWS1-SETD2-nucleosome elongation complexes, revealing that the transcription machinery regulates H3K36me3 deposition by SETD2 on downstream and upstream nucleosomes.

Here, we use public complaint and inspection data from 16 cities around the world to estimate trends in rat populations. Eleven of 16 cities (69%) had significant increasing trends in rat numbers, including Washington D.C., New York, and Amsterdam. Just three cities experienced declines. Cities experiencing greater temperature increases over time saw larger increases in rats. Cities with more dense human populations and more urbanization also saw larger increases in rats. Warming temperatures and more people living in cities may be expanding the seasonal activity periods and food availability for urban rats.

Fusing pneumatic actuation and control capabilities into a simple soft module remains challenging. Here, we present a class of bistable fabric mechanisms (BFMs) that merge soft bistable actuators and valves for electronics-free autonomous robots. The BFMs comprise two bonding fabric chambers with embedded tubes, where the straightening of one chamber compels the other to buckle for the bistability of the structure and the switching of the tube kinking. Our BFMs can facilitate fast bending actuation (more than 1166° s −1 ), on/off and continuous pressure regulation, pneumatic logic computations, and autonomous oscillating actuation (up to 4.6 Hz). We further demonstrate the capabilities of BFMs for diverse robotic applications powered by one constant-pressure air supply: a soft gripper for dynamic grasping and a soft crawler for autonomous jumping. Our BFM development showcases unique features and huge potential in advancing entirely soft, electronics-free autonomous robots.",

We applied a proteomic workflow to characterize the human skeletal muscle interstitial fluid proteome at rest and in response to exercise. Following exhaustive exercise, markers of skeletal muscle damage accumulate in the interstitial space followed by the appearance of immune cell–derived proteins. Among the proteins up-regulated after exercise, we identified cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) as a bioactive molecule regulating muscle fiber development. Treatment with the bioactive peptide derivative of CAMP (LL-37) resulted in the growth of larger C2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes. Phosphoproteomics revealed that LL-37 activated pathways central to muscle growth and proliferation, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and mammalian target of rapamycin. Our findings provide a proof of concept that the interstitial fluid proteome is quantifiable via microdialysis sampling in vivo.

          "abstract": "Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluids has been an elusive goal for centuries. Even with modern computers, anything beyond the simplest turbulent flows is too chaotic and multiscaled to be directly simulatable. An alternative is to treat turbulence probabilistically, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Such PDFs are neither chaotic nor multiscale, yet remain challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here, we overcome the dimensionality problem by encoding turbulence PDFs as highly compressed “tensor networks” (TNs). This enables single CPU core simulations that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a 5 + 1 dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of O ( 10 6 ) and O ( 10 3 ) , respectively, compared to standard finite-difference algorithms. A future path is opened toward something heretofore thought infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that can usefully be described probabilistically.",

Here, we introduce Motion Hologram, a holographic technique that accurately portrays photorealistic and speckle-free 3D scenes. This technique leverages a single hologram and a learnable motion trajectory, which are jointly optimized within a deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrated that the proposed technique could achieve a 4- to 5-dB PSNR improvement of focal stacks in comparison with traditional holography and could successfully depict speckle-free, high-fidelity, and full-color 3D displays using only a commercial SLM. We believe that the proposed method promises a prospective form of holographic displays that will offer immersive viewing experiences for audiences.",

We herein report an unprecedented nanosonosensitizer of one-dimensional bamboo-like multisegmented manganese dioxide@manganese–bismuth vanadate (BMMBV) to boost multiple branches of immune responses targeting MHC-I–deficient tumors. BMMBV markedly augments sonodynamic activity contributed by manganese heteroatoms in the lattice of bismuth vanadate with narrowing bandgaps. Under sonoirradiation, BMMBV enhances tumor antigen spreading and emission of adjuvant signals, which potentiate dendritic cell maturation, thereby eliciting high aptitude of CTLs. This therapy substantially up-regulates MHC expression on tumor cells, which are reversely sensitive to CTLs. Alongside, extensive innate immune cells complement the cytolytic activity of CTLs for eliminating mouse urologic tumors. This study offers a reinforced strategy against antigen-loss immune-evasive tumor.",

Popular cavity ring-down spectroscopy can provide ultrahigh precision, below 0.01‰, but its accuracy is often worse than 5‰ due to inaccuracies in light intensity measurements. To eliminate this problem, we exploit optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a high-fidelity dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. We demonstrate the sub–per-mil accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results for CO line intensity and for HD line shape, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10 −4 level. We see potential for our approach in atmospheric remote sensing, isotope ratio metrology, thermometry, and establishment of primary gas standards.",

However, currently, inducing room-temperature nonequilibrium polariton condensation in perovskite microcavities requires optical pulsed excitations with high excitation densities. Here, we demonstrate continuous-wave optically pumped polariton condensation with an exceptionally low threshold of ~0.53 W cm −2 and a narrow linewidth of ~0.5 meV. Polariton condensation is unambiguously demonstrated by characterizing the nonlinear behavior and coherence properties. We also unveil the trapping potential landscape strategy to facilitate polariton relaxation and accumulation.

To address these challenges, we introduce ChromoGen, a generative model based on state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques that efficiently predicts three-dimensional, single-cell chromatin conformations de novo with both region and cell type specificity. These generated conformations accurately reproduce experimental results at both the single-cell and population levels. Moreover, ChromoGen successfully transfers to cell types excluded from the training data using just DNA sequence and widely available DNase-seq data, thus providing access to chromatin structures in myriad cell types. These achievements come at a remarkably low computational cost. Therefore, ChromoGen enables the systematic investigation of single-cell chromatin organization, its heterogeneity, and its relationship to sequencing data, all while remaining economical.",

However, the mechanism behind its evolution and transmission remain elusive. Here, four virulence plasmid types were identified from 310 hv-CRKP isolates collected nationwide during 2017–2018, based on their aerobactin ( iuc locus) lineage and IncFIB replicons. Notably, pIUC1-IncFIB(K) 37 and pIUC1-IncFIB(Mar), representing two epidemic virulence plasmids in Asia and Europe, respectively, accounted for &gt;90% of the hv-CRKP episodes. Analysis of 494 K. pneumoniae isolates (376 from 2010–2013; 118 from 2017–2018) and 2578 public K. pneumoniae genomes indicated the notable role of IncFIB(Mar) plasmids in the hv-CRKP emergence and spread. Conjugation assays showed the helper IncFIB(Mar) plasmid could efficiently transfer into a hypervirulent strain and uniquely retromobilize with pIUC1-IncFIB(K) 37 back into CRKP. Thereafter, the IncFIB(Mar) plasmid either lost rapidly or recombined with pIUC1-IncFIB(K) 37 , generating the hybrid pIUC1-IncFIB(Mar) plasmid.

In this study, we find that both preclinical murine and clinically available human PD-L1 antibodies limit DC migration. We show that cis interactions between PD-L1 and CD80 are critical for promoting migration and define specific regions within these proteins necessary for migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that αPD-L1 significantly impedes DC migration in a B16 melanoma tumor model. Last, we outline how blocking cis PD-L1:CD80 interactions or mutation of the intracellular domain of PD-L1, in an imiquimod-induced murine model of psoriasis, limits DC migration to the lymph node, decreases interleukin-17 production by CD4 + T cells in the lymph node, and reduces epidermal thickening. Therefore, PD-L1 and CD80 interactions are important regulators of DC migration to the draining lymph node.",

We analyzed 117 canid skulls, representing 40 domestic dog breeds and 18 wild subspecies, using geometric morphometric techniques and k -means clustering. Results show near-full overlap in kennel-club groups and with natural species, except for companion dogs having extreme snout shape. When categorized by task-specific historic function (i.e., bite work and scent work), this morphology overlap remains.

Most existing approaches addressing this trade-off require controlled “labels,” i.e., metamaterials or contrast agents, to be deposited close to the objects and to either remain static or be tracked precisely during imaging. We propose a “blind-label” approach for acoustic subwavelength imaging. The blind labels are randomly distributed acoustic scatterers with deep-subwavelength sizes whose exact locations and trajectories are not necessary information in image reconstruction. The proposed method achieves the resolution of 0.24 wavelengths in ultrasound imaging experiments and 0.2 wavelengths in simulations, providing over 10 times improvement compared to the diffraction limit. We also elucidate the influence of scatterer size and concentration on imaging performance. The proposed “blind-label” approach relaxes the restrictions of existing acoustic subwavelength imaging technologies relying on controlled labels, therefore substantially improving the practicality of acoustic subwavelength imaging in biomedical ultrasound imaging, sonar, and nondestructive testing.",

We achieve robust and designable superconductivity in Pd-metalized twisted bilayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe 2 ) and observe anomalous superconducting effects in high-quality junctions across ~20 moiré cells. Unexpectedly, the junction develops enhanced, instead of weakened, superconducting behaviors, exhibiting fluctuations to a higher critical magnetic field compared to its adjacent Pd 7 MoTe 2 superconductor. In addition, the critical current further exhibits a notable V-shaped minimum at zero magnetic field. These features are unexpected in conventional Josephson junctions and absent in junctions of natural bilayer MoTe 2 created using the same approach. We discuss implications of these observations, including the possible formation of mixed even- and odd-parity superconductivity at the moiré junctions. Our results also demonstrate a pathway to engineer and investigate superconductivity in fractional Chern insulators.",

          "abstract": "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects nearly 90% of adults globally and is linked to over 200,000 annual cancer cases. Immunocompromised individuals from conditions such as primary immune disorders, HIV, or posttransplant immunosuppressive therapies are particularly vulnerable because of EBV’s transformative capability. EBV remodels B cell metabolism to support energy, biosynthetic precursors, and redox equivalents necessary for transformation. Most EBV-driven metabolic pathways center on mitochondria. However, how EBV regulates B cell mitochondrial function and metabolic fluxes remains unclear. Here, we show that EBV boosts cardiolipin (CL) biosynthesis, essential for mitochondrial cristae biogenesis, via EBV nuclear antigen 2/MYC-induced CL enzyme transactivation. Pharmacological and CRISPR genetic analyses underscore the essentiality of CL biosynthesis in EBV-transformed B cells. Metabolomic and isotopic tracing highlight CL’s role in sustaining respiration, one-carbon metabolism, and aspartate synthesis. Disrupting CL biosynthesis destabilizes mitochondrial matrix enzymes pivotal to these pathways. We demonstrate EBV-induced CL metabolism as a therapeutic target, offering synthetic lethal strategies against EBV-associated B cell malignancies.",

Our study showcases the remarkable precision of x-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) in conducting an advanced three-dimensional examination of gut cellular composition and structure. The exploitation of micro- and nano-XPCT on various AD mouse models unveiled relevant alterations in villi and crypts, cellular transformations in Paneth and goblet cells, along with the detection of telocytes, neurons, erythrocytes, and mucus secretion by goblet cells within the gut cavity.

In the MC38 mouse model, we identified 22 LSTV-derived neoepitopes encoded by a synthesized mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccine.

While previous studies have primarily focused on direct modulation of neuronal activity for post-stroke treatment, accumulating evidence suggests that astrocytes may play a critical role in post-stroke progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for recovery. In this study, we investigate the effects of selective modulation of astrocytic calcium signals on chronic stroke using OptoSTIM1, an optogenetic tool that activates endogenous calcium channels. In contrast to channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), OptoSTIM1 robustly elevates astrocytic calcium levels, sustaining the increase for over 10 min upon a single activation. The calcium elevation in astrocytes in the ipsilesional sensory-parietal cortex leads to remarkable recovery from post-stroke impairment. Thus, manipulating intracellular calcium levels in astrocytes holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for improving recovery following a stroke.",

Through analysis of the shifts in free energy profiles within the nanomotors, our results unveil not only the heterogeneous energy release patterns of individual enzyme molecules but also the dynamic disorder of a particular enzyme in energy release over extended monitoring periods. By exploring six distinct types of single-molecule enzymatic reactions, we provide the direct evidence supporting the argument that the reaction enthalpy governs the enzymatic energy release.

Here, we design a class of selectively fluorinated aromatic lithium salts (SFALS) as single conducting lithium salts to regulate the solvation structure and interfacial chemistry for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. By tuning the anionic structure, the Li + -polyether coupling is weakened, and the Li + -anion coordination is enhanced. The hydrogen bonding between the SFALS and polymer matrix induces a special “triad”-type solvation structure, which improves the electrolyte homogeneity and mechanical strength, and promotes the formation of an ultrathin and robust Li 2 O-rich solid electrolyte interphase. Therefore, the stable cycling of more than 1650 cycles (Coulombic efficiency, 99.8%) for LiFePO 4 /Li half cells and 580 cycles (97.4% capacity retention) for full cells is achieved. This molecular engineering strategy could inspire further advancements of functional lithium salts for practical application of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries.",

In systems from sheared glassy materials to buckling beams to crumpled sheets, this behavior is dominated by return-point memory, in which revisiting a past extremum of driving restores the system to a previous state. Cyclic driving with both positive and negative strains forms multiple nested memories, as in a single-dial combination lock, while asymmetric driving (only positive strain) cannot. We study this case in a general model of hysteresis that considers discrete elements called hysterons. We show how two hysterons with a frustrated interaction can violate return-point memory, realizing multiple memories of asymmetric driving. This reveals a general principle for designing systems that store sequences of cyclic driving, whether symmetric or asymmetric. In disordered systems, asymmetric driving is a sensitive tool for the direct measurement of frustration.",

We show that the inner edge of the habitable zone can now be mapped among exoplanets using their lack of surface water, which, unlike the presence of water, can be unambiguously revealed by atmospheric sulfur species. Using coupled climate-chemistry modeling, we find that the observability of sulfur gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: Most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalize this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the habitable zone in the near future.",

Our model predicted that a 1°C increase in average dry season temperature would reduce the mean apparent survival of the understory bird community by 63%.

Notably, late waves were modulated by perceived value and predicted behavioral choice in a two-whisker discrimination task. We found that the late wave feature was (i) modulated by motor feedback, (ii) differentially engaged a sparse ensemble reactivation pattern across layer 2/3, which a balanced-state network model reconciled via feedback-induced inhibitory stabilization, and (iii) aligned to regenerative layer 5 apical dendritic Ca 2+ events.

The existing whisker-like sensors cannot detect slip information effectively. To address this challenge, this study develops a multitasking electronic brush (e-brush) composed of bundle of whiskers powered by reservoir computing (RC). Four pressure sensors are integrated into the brush to monitor its motion, speed, force, slip, and target surface. These sensors can provide long-term, low-pressure detection as low as 50 pascals, allowing for the precise monitoring of brush movements. A RC algorithm is developed to extract multiple brush motion parameters, including the slip.

However, how SnRK2s are released under osmotic stress is unclear. Here, we outline how subgroup I SnRK2s sense molecular crowding to interrupt PP2C-mediated inhibition in plants. Severe hyperosmotic stress triggers condensate formation to activate the subgroup I SnRK2s, which requires their intrinsically disordered region. PP2Cs interact with and inhibit subgroup I SnRK2s, and this interaction is disrupted by phase separation of SnRK2s. The subgroup I SnRK2s are critical for severe osmotic stress responses.

Despite thermal insulation provided by blubber and fur layers and low Arctic temperatures, their fur is typically observed to be free of ice. This study investigates the anti-icing properties of polar bear fur. Here, we show that polar bear fur exhibits low ice adhesion strengths comparable to fluorocarbon-coated fibers, with the low ice adhesion a consequence of the fur sebum (hair grease). Lipid analyses reveal the presence of cholesterol, diacylglycerols, anteisomethyl-branched fatty acids, and the unexpected absence of squalene. Quantum chemical calculations predict low ice adsorption energies for identified lipids and high adsorption for squalene, suggesting that sebum composition is responsible for the observed anti-icing properties. Our work enhances understanding of polar bears and their interactions with their environment and builds on Inuit knowledge of natural anti-icing materials.",

The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)–type paradoxes are proofs of contextuality that reveal this incompatibility with deterministic logical arguments. However, the GHZ-type paradox whose events can be included in the fewest contexts and that brings the strongest nonclassicality remains elusive. Here, we derive a GHZ-type paradox with a context-cover number of 3 and show that this number saturates the lower bound posed by quantum theory. We demonstrate the paradox with a time-domain fiber optical platform and recover the quantum prediction in a 37-dimensional setup based on high-speed modulation, convolution, and homodyne detection of time-multiplexed pulsed coherent light. By proposing and studying a strong form of contextuality in high-dimensional Hilbert space, our results pave the way for the exploration of exotic quantum correlations with time-multiplexed optical systems.",

Realizing high-visibility HOM interference with massively parallel optical channels is challenging due to the lack of available natural optical references for aligning independent arrayed laser pairs. Here, we demonstrate 50 parallel comb-teeth pairs of continuous-wave weak coherent photons HOM interference using two independently frequency post-aligned soliton microcombs (SMCs), achieving an average fringe visibility over 46%. The frequencies of all comb-teeth pairs are long-term aligned by developing two sets of fully frequency-stabilized SMCs with independent reference and adjusting free spectral range beyond 100 kilohertz through perturbations in soliton state. The verification experiment proves the feasibility of constructing massively quantum information channels by co-opting classical wavelength division multiplexing optical communications, which paves the way for practical large-scale quantum communication systems.",

However, how phytoplasmas evade this immune response to promote their propagation in insect vectors remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that infection of leafhopper vectors with rice orange leaf phytoplasma (ROLP) activates the mild melanization response in hemolymph. ROLP-encoded effector protein SRP1 is highly expressed in leafhopper hemolymph, where it competitively binds to SP2, thereby inhibiting SP2-mediated cleavage of prophenoloxidase into active phenoloxidase. Consequently, microinjection of SRP1 effectively suppresses the melanization response and enhances ROLP propagation. The histidine residue at position 23 of SRP1 is essential for SRP1-SP2 interaction, and the mutation of this position abolishes its ability to inhibit such SP2-meidated cleavage, ultimately promoting melanization response and inhibiting ROLP propagation. Our findings provide insights into how phytoplasmas antagonize insect melanization response to facilitate their persistent transmission.",

The adaptive Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof hybrid density functional (aPBE0) improves energetics, electron densities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps in QM9, QM7b, and GMTKN55 benchmark datasets. A model uncertainty-based constraint reduces the method smoothly to PBE0 in extrapolative regimes, ensuring general applicability with limited training. By tuning exact exchange fractions for different spin states, aPBE0 effectively addresses the spin gap problem in open-shell systems such as carbenes. We also present a revised QM9 (revQM9) dataset with more accurate quantum properties, including stronger covalent binding, larger bandgaps, more localized electron densities, and larger dipole moments.",

Thus, understanding the factors that promote UPEC intestinal colonization is of critical importance to designing therapeutics to reduce rUTI incidence. Although E. coli is found in high abundance in large intestine mucus, little is known about how it is able to maintain residence in this continuously secreted hydrogel. We discovered that the FimH adhesin of type 1 pili (T1P) bound throughout the secreted mucus layers of the colon and to epithelial cells in mouse and human samples. Disruption of T1P led to reduced association with colon mucus. Notably, this mutant up-regulated flagellar production and infiltrated the protective inner mucus layer of the colon.

Herein, we introduced an initiator-free cross-linkable monomer (2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) 5-(dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoate (FTA), which can chemically passivate defects and enable real-time fine regulation of crystallization. The resulting perovskite film exhibited higher crystallinity, enlarged grain size, and reduced dependence on the substrate. In addition, the cross-linked FTA [CL(FTA)] distributed along the grain boundaries effectively released the residual stress and securely bound the grains together. Consequently, the CL(FTA)-modified flexible PSCs achieved a record-breaking efficiency of 24.64% (certified 24.08%). Moreover, the scalable potential has been verified by the corresponding rigid and flexible modules, delivering impressive efficiencies of 19.53 and 17.13%, respectively. Furthermore, the optimized device demonstrated bending durability and improved operational stability, thereby advancing the progress of f-PSCs toward industrialization.",

The capacity to damage the phagosomal membrane has emerged as central to Mtb virulence. While Mtb factors driving membrane damage have been described, host factors that maintain phagosomal integrity or repair Mtb-induced damage to contain the pathogen remain largely unknown. We used a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify host factors required to repair Mtb-damaged phagosomal membranes. Vacuolar protein sorting–associated protein 18 (VPS18), a member of the HOPS and CORVET trafficking complexes, was among the top hits. VPS18 colocalized with Mtb in macrophages beginning shortly after infection, and VPS18 -knockout macrophages demonstrated increased damage of Mtb-containing phagosomes without impaired autophagy. Mtb grew more robustly in VPS18 -knockout cells, and the first-line antituberculosis antibiotic pyrazinamide was less effective. Our results identify VPS18 as required for phagosomal membrane integrity in Mtb-infected cells and suggest that modulating phagosome integrity may hold promise for improving the efficacy of antibiotic treatment for TB.",

Our findings reveal that regional estimates substantially understate sea level rise in parts of San Francisco and Los Angeles, projecting more than double the expected rise by 2050. Additionally, temporally variable (nonlinear) VLM, driven by factors such as hydrocarbon and groundwater extraction, can increase uncertainties in 2050 projections by up to 0.4 meters in certain areas of Los Angeles and San Diego.

The reaction uses an inexpensive and commercially available phosphonium ylide as the carbon source to furnish a wide range of substituted naphthalenes. The key to the success of this transformation is the formation of a triene intermediate through ring opening, which undergoes 6π-electrocyclization and elimination processes to afford the naphthalene product. Furthermore, this strategy enables the facile synthesis of 13 C-labeled naphthalenes using 13 CH 3 PPh 3 I as a commercial 13 C source and facilitates modifying the directing group for C─H functionalization.",

We use global manipulations and single-qubit–resolved state detection to efficiently learn the all-to-all–coupled Ising model Hamiltonian, with the required quantum resources scaling at most linearly with the qubit number.

Here, using statistical analysis and numerical experiments, we reveal that changes of tropical oceans throughout the 20th century drive the long-term Antarctic snowfall trend. A pronounced warming over the tropical Atlantic and a moderate cooling over the equatorial Pacific have driven an adjustment of moisture transport and thus snowfall pattern in West Antarctica. Our study reveals a centennial tropical-polar teleconnection, producing long-term trends with opposing changes across the regions.

Unexpectedly, mouse liver and primary hepatocytes consumed ketone bodies to support fatty acid biosynthesis via both de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) elongation. While an acetoacetate intermediate was not absolutely required for ketone bodies to source DNL, PUFA elongation required activation of acetoacetate by cytosolic acetoacetyl–coenzyme A synthetase (AACS). Moreover, AACS deficiency diminished free and esterified PUFAs in hepatocytes, while ketogenic insufficiency depleted PUFAs and increased liver triacylglycerols.

We develop a series of age predictor models and find that, contrary to our predictions, rates of epigenetic aging were not slower in female lizards. However, methylation states at loci acquiring age-associated changes appear to be more “youthful” in young females, suggesting that female DNA methylomes are preemptively fortified in early life in opposition to the direction of age-related drift.

Chemo-optogenetically activating proprioceptors resulted in hyperalgesic priming that favored chronic pain induced by acidosis. In humans, intramuscular acidification induced acid perception but not pain. Conversely, in a spinal cord–injured patient who lost pain sensation in the right leg, proprioception and sngception were remaining somatosensory functions, associated with the spinal dorsal column.

Evidence suggests that one such PTM, adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP)–ribosylation, is important for viral replication, but the host and viral components involved are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that several human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins, including the zinc-finger domain containing PARP7 (TiPARP) and PARP12, directly ADP-ribosylate the alphaviral nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP3 and nsP4. These same human PARP proteins inhibit alphavirus replication in a manner that can be antagonized by the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of the virally encoded macrodomain. Last, we find that knockdown of any of the three CCCH zinc-finger domain containing PARPs, PARP7, PARP12, or the enzymatically inactive PARP13 (ZAP/ZC3HAV1), attenuates the antiviral effects of interferon-γ on alphavirus replication. Combined with evolutionary analyses, these data suggest that zinc-finger PARPs share an ancestral antiviral function that can be antagonized by the activity of viral macrodomains, indicative of an ongoing evolutionary conflict between host ADP-ribosylation and viruses.",
