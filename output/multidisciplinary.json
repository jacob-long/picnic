          "title": "Legislative Capture in Hungary: Well-Managed Autocratization",
          "authors": "Zsolt Enyedi, Bálint Mikola",
          "abstract": "We discuss the case of Hungary’s rapid democratic backsliding under Viktor Orbán as an example of legislative capture. We show that, despite relatively unfavorable conditions for autocratization, Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party have supervised a well-crafted project of institutional transformation and a comprehensive regrouping of financial resources, all of which have led to an effective and stable concentration of power. This power concentration has its limits, given the country’s membership in the European Union, resistance by parts of the judiciary, media initiatives focused on corruption, and local opposition victories; but the national government’s room for maneuver has increased every year since 2010. We provide an overview of the changes that facilitated democratic erosion and an inventory of the actors that still retain a capacity to hinder further autocratization.",

          "title": "Democratic Backsliding Through Legislative Capture in Serbia: A One-Man Show",
          "authors": "Filip Milačić",
          "abstract": "Serbia’s democracy has been in a state of continuous erosion since the Serbian Progressive Party and Aleksandar Vučić came to power in 2012. Vučić exploited his popularity as a self-proclaimed defender of the Serbian nation to gain full control of the party and initiate democratic backsliding through “legislative capture.” Vučić’s capture of the parliament and its appointment powers made possible a subsequent capture of many democratic institutions. The rest, mindful of Vučić’s broad electoral appeal, deferred to the executive. Challenges to Serbia’s democratic backsliding were attempted through popular mobilizations and electoral resistance, but they have not been successful. There are several reasons for such an outcome: the uneven playing field, a fragmented and ideologically heterogeneous opposition, a misguided choice of resistance strategies, the absence of an alternative political platform that addressed the issue of Kosovo—the antecedent condition that precipitated backsliding, and insufficient support from external prodemocracy actors.",

          "authors": "Murat Somer",
          "abstract": "Since 2002, governments led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his party have taken Turkey’s political regime from electoral democracy to electoral autocracy. This has been principally accomplished through legislative capture: control, abuse, and weaponization of Parliament to pass democracy-eroding laws, discredit opposition, and legitimize executive authoritarianism. But other tools, such as executive power grabs, were also used against strong state institutions, civil society, and even by Erdoğan against his own party. Democratic backsliding advanced through crises that polarized the electorate and through fierce political warfare between the incumbent government and its opponents. Like other cases on the legislative capture pathway, opposition parties have resisted backsliding predominantly through electoral mobilization, but their partial access to the legislature has, for the most part, limited their capacity to join forces with grassroots contentious politics. The opposition has not developed solutions for programmatic renewal that might heal formative rifts and lead to sustainable recovery.",

          "authors": "Shelley A. McConnell",
          "abstract": "Nicaragua has followed an unusual path from democracy to authoritarianism. In 2000, despite deep political polarization, outgoing Liberal president Arnoldo Alemán colluded with opposition leader Daniel Ortega to convert politically neutral judicial and electoral institutions into partisan tools. Their pact constrained the party system and lowered the electoral threshold, enabling Ortega to win the presidency in 2006. From a minority position in the legislature, Ortega’s Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party used the politicized judiciary and electoral infrastructure to remove presidential term limits and manipulate elections. After gaining a legislative majority, the FSLN then reformed the constitution to consolidate power. Public resistance to democratic decline came slowly and too late: Initially offset by social spending funded in part by international authoritarian allies, it was ultimately repressed. The Nicaragua case shows that a gradualist pathway toward democratic backsliding may be available to minority parties in poor countries.",

          "abstract": "This case study explores democratic backsliding in Brazil that was accompanied by Jair Bolsonaro’s rise to power and his push for autocratization. Bolsonaro’s presidency was characterized by systematic attacks on democratic institutions, including efforts to undermine the judiciary, the legislature, and electoral integrity. A broad prodemocracy coalition of political parties, state governors, civil society, and the judiciary emerged to resist Bolsonaro’s authoritarian drive. The coalition played a pivotal role in preserving Brazil's democratic framework and preventing further erosion of democratic norms, but structural weaknesses in Brazil’s political system—which include growing affective polarization, ineffective governance, and the creeping influence of organized crime—present significant challenges to sustaining democracy. In the face of these enduring threats, maintaining democratic resilience in Brazil will likely be difficult.",

          "abstract": "Until the 1990s, Venezuela had one of the longest-running democracies in Latin America. Today it is one of the region’s most entrenched authoritarian regimes. I discuss Venezuela’s 25-year autocratization process, focusing on the contingent nature of democratic backsliding. This article is useful to understand how executive power grabs shape the ways in which those who oppose autocrats act to protect a democracy, as well as how the opposition can jeopardize, protect, and open spaces for democratic contestation in both democratic and authoritarian contexts.",

          "title": "Elite Collusion in Indonesia: How It Has Both Enabled and Limited Executive Aggrandizement",
          "authors": "Marcus Mietzner",
          "abstract": "After a largely successful post-authoritarian transition, Indonesia has experienced democratic backsliding since the 2010s. This backsliding accelerated under the presidency of Joko Widodo (2014-2024), but it has not yet pushed the Indonesian polity into a full-blown autocracy. I argue that Indonesia’s specific pathway to democratic backsliding prefigured this outcome. While elites have colluded to share power and allow the president to engage in executive aggrandizement, they have set limits to the latter’s potential authoritarian ambitions. For example, they rejected Widodo’s attempt to extend his time in power beyond the constitutionally allowed two terms. Thus, elites have both produced executive aggrandizement and contained its scope. This pattern has protected Indonesian democracy from a full collapse, but it has produced a gradual decline, reducing the chances of democratic revitalization through formal or contentious politics.",

          "authors": "Manuel Meléndez-Sánchez, Lucas Perelló",
          "abstract": "Guatemala is a case study in democratic backsliding led not by an aggrandized executive, but by a coalition of elites who collude to maximize and protect their collective power. Beginning in the mid-2010s, a decentralized but deeply entrenched network of elites dismantled democracy when anticorruption efforts threatened their common interests. The 2023 election was widely expected to consolidate this authoritarian turn but, instead, delivered an unexpected democratic resurgence when a moderate anticorruption reformer secured a shocking victory and then successfully resisted a “slow-motion coup” aimed at preventing the transfer of power. The Guatemalan case suggests that, under elite collusion, elites can be more prone to splits and strategic errors than in other authoritarian settings. These missteps provide unexpected opportunities to reverse backsliding, but democrats must be prepared to capitalize on regime errors and repel authoritarian counteroffensives by building broad coalitions that work simultaneously across multiple arenas of democratic contestation.",

          "abstract": "“Democratic careening” aptly captures Poland’s recent oscillation between liberal democracy, illiberalism, and efforts toward the recovery of liberal democratic norms. In contrast to the recent experience of Hungary, Poland’s hard right governing party was unable to amend the nation’s constitution as it attempted to consolidate power, so it relied on ordinary legislation and changes of personnel in the judiciary and other state institutions. This analysis shows how Poland’s complex constitutional framework, its elections, and the contentious politics of resistance contributed to the nation’s democratic resilience. I also reflect on the challenges faced by Poland’s new government in undoing illiberal changes while avoiding legal and political instability, highlighting the broader implications of this case for democratic theory and the study of illiberalism.",

          "title": "Legislative Capture in India: Is Democracy Back from the Brink?",
          "authors": "Milan Vaishnav",
          "abstract": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won consecutive parliamentary majorities in India’s 2014 and 2019 elections, ushering in a period of single-party dominance that has replaced a quarter-century of coalition politics. This new era has been marked by a growing concentration of executive power, crackdowns on dissent, and rising Hindu majoritarianism. The roots of India’s democratic backsliding predate the BJP’s resurgence, but the trends have intensified in the past 10 years. While the party’s disappointing performance in the 2024 elections suggests a possible corrective, legislative capture in India will not easily unravel: The BJP remains in a commanding political position and shows little inclination toward moderation; questions about electoral integrity abound; referee institutions are abdicating their authority; and constraints on civil society endure. Given India’s outsize geopolitical importance, foreign pressure is unlikely to be decisive in reversing these trends.",

          "authors": "Rachel Beatty Riedl, Jennifer McCoy, Kenneth Roberts, Murat Somer",
          "abstract": "We provide an analytical framework that identifies three distinct institutional pathways for democratic backsliding that culminate in executive aggrandizement: legislative capture, plebiscitary override, and executive power grabs. We also identify a fourth pathway of elite collusion that erodes democracy without necessarily concentrating powers in the executive. These four pathways reflect different combinations of ruling and opposition party strength, institutional legitimacy, and levels of popular support and political mobilization. The pathways also open and close different institutional and societal arenas where opposition forces can counter backsliding, and they create different opportunities, challenges, and dilemmas for democratic actors. The 15 case studies featured in this volume illustrate how backsliding occurs along these pathways, and how democratic actors achieved partial reversal in some cases. The cases also suggest focal points of resistance and institutional and programmatic reform that may be helpful to policymakers and advocates working to defend democracy.",

I describe the political resistance to backsliding and why it has failed to date, analyzing the roles of specific institutions and individual actors in that resistance. I argue that two key dynamics explain why efforts to mobilize against Saied’s power grab have failed to slow democratic erosion in Tunisia: top-down regime control of key government institutions and a deep popular frustration with the country’s political class, which limited bottom-up mobilization against Saied’s power grab.",

          "abstract": "Ecuador experienced a dramatic process of democratic backsliding during Rafael Correa’s decade-long administration, which began in 2007. The Correa administration brought plebiscitary overrides and constitutional reengineering that made the government a hyperpresidential one, weakening political institutions and undermining basic civil liberties. When Correa left power in 2017, Ecuador’s democracy recovered; but, even with the promise of an enduring democratic future, the country has not been able to consolidate a functioning representative democratic regime, and new processes of backsliding have occurred. A combination of weak political institutions, poor democratic culture, and major threats to political stability—including the infiltration of organized crime into the political arena—seems to have stagnated Ecuador at the status of a low-quality delegative democracy.",

After a long history of authoritarian rule, Malawi’s 1994 constitution envisioned a robust separation of powers, yet power remains concentrated in the presidency. Presidents have repeatedly attempted to consolidate power but have been rebuffed at crucial moments. Presidents have attempted to constrain political opposition through personalist ties, the bureaucracy, control over executive appointments, regulation, and coercion. But the courts and civil society have been key actors in countering executive overreach, exemplified by the Constitutional Court’s annulment of the 2019 presidential election. Despite recent legal reforms, Malawi’s parliament, opposition parties, and other political institutions still struggle to check the executive.",

          "authors": "Ion Marandici",
          "abstract": "I examine two pathways of democratic backsliding in Moldova and the ways in which the country was able to reverse the backsliding trends. The first episode (2001–2009) started with a political party gaining a supermajority in Parliament and setting up a semi-authoritarian system of governance. Prodemocracy protests and coercive attempts by the state to suppress them led to an institutional stalemate, culminating in snap elections that brought a victory for the political opposition. The second backsliding episode (2014–2019) was characterized by oligarchic collusion: Major oligarchs funded and controlled the ruling parties while engaging in grand corruption and contributing to a gradual democratic decline. Recovery from this backsliding episode was enabled by cross-ethnic, transideological protests against corruption, strategic institutional changes, and interoligarchic wars. The analysis underscores how contentious politics, electoral processes, and the empowerment of weakened political institutions can help generate democratic recovery.",

According to multiple measures, Benin’s democracy declined continuously between 2016 and 2023. This article highlights how the complacency and weakness of elites in Benin created an environment in which democracy deteriorated. Notably, the influence—or lack of influence—of elites resulted in limited competitiveness of the electoral process and worsening freedom of expression and assembly. Better cooperation of opposition forces in 2023 has helped to halt further backsliding, but it has not reversed the decline.",

An example is to use an untrusted remote device to generate random bits that can be certified to contain a certain amount of entropy 3 . Certified randomness has many applications but is impossible to achieve solely by classical computation. Here we demonstrate the generation of certifiably random bits using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the Internet. Our protocol leverages the classical hardness of recent random circuit sampling demonstrations 4,5 : a client generates quantum ‘challenge’ circuits using a small randomness seed, sends them to an untrusted quantum server to execute and verifies the results of the server. We analyse the security of our protocol against a restricted class of realistic near-term adversaries. Using classical verification with measured combined sustained performance of 1.1 × 10 18 floating-point operations per second across multiple supercomputers, we certify 71,313 bits of entropy under this restricted adversary and additional assumptions. Our results demonstrate a step towards the practical applicability of present-day quantum computers.",

          "abstract": "An increased level of phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit-α (eIF2α, encoded by EIF2S1; eIF2α-p) coupled with decreased guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B is a hallmark of the ‘canonical’ integrated stress response (c-ISR)1. It is unclear whether impaired eIF2B activity in human diseases including leukodystrophies2, which occurs in the absence of eIF2α-p induction, is synonymous with the c-ISR. Here we describe a mechanism triggered by decreased eIF2B activity, distinct from the c-ISR, which we term the split ISR (s-ISR). The s-ISR is characterized by translational and transcriptional programs that are different from those observed in the c-ISR. Opposite to the c-ISR, the s-ISR requires eIF4E-dependent translation of the upstream open reading frame 1 and subsequent stabilization of ATF4 mRNA. This is followed by altered expression of a subset of metabolic genes (for example, PCK2), resulting in metabolic rewiring required to maintain cellular bioenergetics when eIF2B activity is attenuated. Overall, these data demonstrate a plasticity of the mammalian ISR, whereby the loss of eIF2B activity in the absence of eIF2α-p induction activates the eIF4E–ATF4–PCK2 axis to maintain energy homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Regulatory T (Treg) cells, which specifically express the master transcription factor FOXP3, have a pivotal role in maintaining immunological tolerance and homeostasis and have the potential to revolutionize cell therapies for autoimmune diseases1,2,3. Although stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells in the presence of TGFβ and IL-2 can induce FOXP3+ Treg cells in vitro (iTreg cells), the resulting cells are often unstable and have thus far hampered translational efforts4,5,6. A systematic approach towards understanding the regulatory networks that dictate Treg differentiation could lead to more effective iTreg cell-based therapies. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screen to catalogue gene regulatory determinants of FOXP3 induction in primary human T cells and characterized their effects at single-cell resolution using Perturb-icCITE-seq. We identify the RBPJ–NCOR repressor complex as a novel, context-specific negative regulator of FOXP3 expression. RBPJ-targeted knockout enhanced iTreg differentiation and function, independent of canonical Notch signalling. Repeated cytokine and T cell receptor signalling stimulation in vitro revealed that RBPJ-deficient iTreg cells exhibit increased phenotypic stability compared with control cells through DNA demethylation of the FOXP3 enhancer CNS2, reinforcing FOXP3 expression. Conversely, overexpression of RBPJ potently suppressed FOXP3 induction through direct modulation of FOXP3 histone acetylation by HDAC3. Finally, RBPJ-ablated human iTreg cells more effectively suppressed xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease than control iTreg cells in a humanized mouse model. Together, our findings reveal novel regulators of FOXP3 and point towards new avenues to improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy for autoimmune disease.",

We compiled 2,133 publications covering 97,783 impacted and reference sites, creating an unparallelled dataset of 3,667 independent comparisons of biodiversity impacts across all main organismal groups, habitats and the five most predominant human pressures 1,6 . For all comparisons, we quantified three key measures of biodiversity to assess how these human pressures drive homogenization and shifts in composition of biological communities across space and changes in local diversity, respectively. We show that human pressures distinctly shift community composition and decrease local diversity across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Yet, contrary to long-standing expectations, there is no clear general homogenization of communities. Critically, the direction and magnitude of biodiversity changes vary across pressures, organisms and scales at which they are studied. Our exhaustive global analysis reveals the general impact and key mediating factors of human pressures on biodiversity and can benchmark conservation strategies.",

To understand the basis of brain activity and behaviour, there is a need to define the molecular energetic landscape of the brain5,6,7,8,9,10. Here, to bridge the scale gap between cognitive neuroscience and cell biology, we developed a physical voxelization approach to partition a frozen human coronal hemisphere section into 703 voxels comparable to neuroimaging resolution (3 × 3 × 3 mm). In each cortical and subcortical brain voxel, we profiled mitochondrial phenotypes, including OXPHOS enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA and volume density, and mitochondria-specific respiratory capacity. We show that the human brain contains diverse mitochondrial phenotypes driven by both topology and cell types. Compared with white matter, grey matter contains >50% more mitochondria. Moreover, the mitochondria in grey matter are biochemically optimized for energy transformation, particularly among recently evolved cortical brain regions. Scaling these data to the whole brain, we created a backwards linear regression model that integrates several neuroimaging modalities11 to generate a brain-wide map of mitochondrial distribution and specialization. This model predicted mitochondrial characteristics in an independent brain region of the same donor brain. This approach and the resulting MitoBrainMap of mitochondrial phenotypes provide a foundation for exploring the molecular energetic landscape that enables normal brain function. This resource also relates to neuroimaging data and defines the subcellular basis for regionalized brain processes relevant to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

State-of-the-art neuromorphic computers, such as Intel’s Loihi 2 or IBM’s NorthPole 3 , implement ANNs using bio-inspired neuron- and synapse-mimicking circuits made of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, at least 18 per neuron and six per synapse. Simplifying the structure and size of these two building blocks would enable the construction of more sophisticated, larger and more energy-efficient ANNs. Here we show that a single CMOS transistor can exhibit neural and synaptic behaviours if biased in a specific (unconventional) manner. By connecting one additional CMOS transistor in series, we build a versatile 2-transistor-cell that exhibits adjustable neuro-synaptic response (which we named neuro-synaptic random access memory cell, or NS-RAM cell). This electronic performance comes with a yield of 100% and an ultra-low device-to-device variability, owing to the maturity of the silicon CMOS platform used—no materials or devices alien to the CMOS process are required. These results represent a short-term solution for the implementation of efficient ANNs and an opportunity in terms of CMOS circuit design and optimization for artificial intelligence applications.",

Machine learning is transforming numerical weather prediction (NWP) by replacing the numerical solver with neural networks, improving the speed and accuracy of the forecasting component of the prediction pipeline 1,2,3,4,5,6. However, current models rely on numerical systems at initialisation and to produce local forecasts, limiting their achievable gains. Here we show that a single machine learning model can replace the entire NWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system, ingests observations and produces global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. The global forecasts outperform an operational NWP baseline for multiple variables and lead times. The local station forecasts are skillful up to ten days lead time, competing with a post-processed global NWP baseline and a state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from human forecasters. End-to-end tuning further improves the accuracy of local forecasts. Our results show that skillful forecasting is possible without relying on NWP at deployment time, which will enable the full speed and accuracy benefits of data-driven models to be realised. We believe Aardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-end models that will reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude, and enable rapid, affordable creation of customised models for a range of end-users.",

The structural mechanics of how glutamate gating occurs in full-length iGluRs is not well understood. Here, using the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid subtype iGluR (AMPAR), we identify the glutamate-gating mechanism. AMPAR activation by glutamate is augmented at physiological temperatures. By preparing AMPARs for cryogenic-electron microscopy at these temperatures, we captured the glutamate-gating mechanism. Activation by glutamate initiates ion channel opening that involves all ion channel helices hinging away from the pore axis in a motif that is conserved across all iGluRs. Desensitization occurs when the local dimer pairs decouple and enables closure of the ion channel below through restoring the channel hinges and refolding the channel gate. Our findings define how glutamate gates iGluRs, provide foundations for therapeutic design and demonstrate how physiological temperatures can alter iGluR function.",

Here we report the identification and characterization of the lasso peptide antibiotic lariocidin and its internally cyclized derivative lariocidin B, produced by Paenibacillus sp. M2, which has broad-spectrum activity against a range of bacterial pathogens. We show that lariocidins inhibit bacterial growth by binding to the ribosome and interfering with protein synthesis. Structural, genetic and biochemical data show that lariocidins bind at a unique site in the small ribosomal subunit, where they interact with the 16S ribosomal RNA and aminoacyl-tRNA, inhibiting translocation and inducing miscoding. Lariocidin is unaffected by common resistance mechanisms, has a low propensity for generating spontaneous resistance, shows no toxicity to human cells, and has potent in vivo activity in a mouse model of Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Our identification of ribosome-targeting lasso peptides uncovers new routes towards the discovery of alternative protein-synthesis inhibitors and offers a novel chemical scaffold for the development of much-needed antibacterial drugs.",

Some signals, for example, land warming more than the ocean and the Arctic warming the most, were expected and successfully predicted. Underlying this success was the application of physical laws under the assumption that large and small spatial scales are well separated. This established what we call the standard approach, climate science’s dominant paradigm. With additional warming, however, discrepancies between real-world signals and expectations based on this standard approach are piling up, especially at regional scales. At the same time, disruptive computational approaches are advancing new paradigms. Philosophers of science characterize situations where accumulating discrepancies (anomalies) and disruptions lead to a loss of confidence in the dominant paradigm as a ‘crisis’. Here we articulate what we consider to be the dominant paradigm, or standard approach, and the discrepancies and disruptions that have emerged in recent years. The policy implications of a purported crisis are discussed, as well as paths forward, crisis or no crisis. These paths include using signals to test assumptions and processes driving a warming Earth for the first time, developing testable hypotheses, and revitalizing conceptual thinking by filling gaps across climate-system components and spatial scales.",

          "abstract": "The efficient and modular diversification of molecular scaffolds, particularly for the synthesis of diverse molecular libraries, remains a significant challenge in drug optimization campaigns.1–3 The late-stage introduction of alkyl fragments is especially desirable due to the high sp³-character and structural versatility of these motifs.4 Given their prevalence in molecular frameworks, C(sp²)−H bonds serve as attractive targets for diversification, though this process often requires difficult pre-functionalization or lengthy de novo syntheses. Traditionally, direct alkylations of arenes are achieved by employing Friedel–Crafts reaction conditions using strong Brønsted or Lewis acids.5,6 However, these methods suffer from poor functional group tolerance and low selectivity, limiting their broad implementation in late-stage functionalization and drug optimization campaigns. Herein, we report the application of a novel strategy for the selective coupling of differently hybridized radical species, which we term dynamic orbital selection. This mechanistic paradigm overcomes common limitations of Friedel-Crafts alkylations via the in situ formation of two distinct radical species, which are subsequently differentiated by a copper-based catalyst based on their respective binding properties. As a result, we demonstrate herein a general and highly modular reaction for the direct alkylation of native arene C−H bonds using abundant and benign alcohols and carboxylic acids as the alkylating agents. Ultimately, this solution overcomes the synthetic challenges associated with the introduction of complex alkyl scaffolds into highly sophisticated drug scaffolds in a late-stage fashion, thereby granting access to vast new chemical space. Based on the generality of the underlying coupling mechanism, dynamic orbital selection is expected to be a broadly applicable coupling platform for further challenging transformations involving two distinct radical species.",

          "abstract": "The tumour-suppressor protein BRCA2 has a central role in homology-directed DNA repair by enhancing the formation of RAD51 filaments on resected single-stranded DNA generated at double-stranded DNA breaks and stimulating RAD51 activity1,2. Individuals with BRCA2 mutations are predisposed to cancer; however, BRCA2-deficient tumours are often responsive to targeted therapy with PARP inhibitors (PARPi)3,4,5,6. The mechanism by which BRCA2 deficiency renders cells sensitive to PARPi but with minimal toxicity in cells heterozygous for BRCA2 mutations remains unclear. Here we identify a previously unknown role of BRCA2 that is directly linked to the effect of PARP1 inhibition. Using biochemical and single-molecule approaches, we demonstrate that PARPi-mediated PARP1 retention on a resected DNA substrate interferes with RAD51 filament stability and impairs RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange. Full-length BRCA2 protects RAD51 filaments and counteracts the instability conferred by PARPi-mediated retention by preventing the binding of PARP1 to DNA. Extending these findings to a cellular context, we use quantitative single-molecule localization microscopy to show that BRCA2 prevents PARPi-induced PARP1 retention at homologous-recombination repair sites. By contrast, BRCA2-deficient cells exhibit increased PARP1 retention at these lesions in response to PARPi. These results provide mechanistic insights into the role of BRCA2 in maintaining RAD51 stability and protecting homologous-recombination repair sites by mitigating PARPi-mediated PARP1 retention.",

          "abstract": "Carbohydrates are an abundant, inexpensive and renewable biomass feedstock that could be a cornerstone for sustainable chemical manufacturing, but scalable and environmentally friendly methods that leverage these feedstocks are lacking. For example, 1-allyl sorbitol is the foundational building block for the polypropylene clarifying agent Millad NX 8000, which is produced on the multi-metric ton scale annually, but the manufacturing process at present requires superstoichiometric amounts of tin1,2. The NX 8000 additives dominate about 80% of the global clarified polypropylene market3 and are used in concentrations of 0.01–1% during polypropylene production to improve its transparency and resistance to high temperatures, translating to 300–30,000 metric tons annually. The market volume of polypropylene in 2022 was approximately 79.01 million metric tons (MMT), with demand expected to rise by nearly 33% to 105 MMT by 2030 (ref. 4). The cost and sustainability benefits of clarified polypropylene are driving this demand, necessitating more clarifying agents5. Here we report a high-yielding allylation of unprotected carbohydrates in water using a catalytic amount of indium metal and either allylboronic acid or the pinacol ester (allylBpin) as donors. Aldohexoses, aminohexoses, ketohexoses and aldopentoses are all allylated in high yield under mild conditions and the indium metal is recoverable and reusable with no loss of catalytic activity. Leveraging these features, this process was translated to a scalable continuous synthesis of 1-allyl sorbitol in flow6 with high yield and productivity through Bayesian optimization of reaction parameters.",

          "abstract": "Calorie-rich foods, particularly those that are high in fat and sugar, evoke pleasure in both humans and animals 1 . However, prolonged consumption of such foods may reduce their hedonic value, potentially contributing to obesity 2–4 . Here we investigated this phenomenon in mice on a chronic high-fat diet (HFD). Although these mice preferred high-fat food over regular chow in their home cages, they showed reduced interest in calorie-rich foods in a no-effort setting. This paradoxical decrease in hedonic feeding has been reported previously 3–7 , but its neurobiological basis remains unclear. We found that in mice on regular diet, neurons in the lateral nucleus accumbens (NAcLat) projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encoded hedonic feeding behaviours. In HFD mice, this behaviour was reduced and uncoupled from neural activity. Optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased hedonic feeding in mice on regular diet but not in HFD mice, though this behaviour was restored when HFD mice returned to a regular diet. HFD mice exhibited reduced neurotensin expression and release in the NAcLat→VTA pathway. Furthermore, neurotensin knockout in the NAcLat and neurotensin receptor blockade in the VTA each abolished optogenetically induced hedonic feeding behaviour. Enhancing neurotensin signalling via overexpression normalized aspects of diet-induced obesity, including weight gain and hedonic feeding. Together, our findings identify a neural circuit mechanism that links the devaluation of hedonic foods with obesity.",

Intracellular hydrogen peroxide oxidizes cysteine residues in VPS35, resulting in retromer dissociation from endosomal membranes and subsequent plasma membrane remodelling. We demonstrate that plasma membrane localization of the retromer substrate SLC7A1 is required to sustain mitochondrial translation. Furthermore, decreasing VPS35 levels or oxidation of its ROS-sensing cysteines confers resistance to ROS-generating chemotherapies, including cisplatin, in ovarian cancer models.

In particular, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is believed to be the main driver of epidemic outbreaks of AFM in recent years4, yet not much is known about EV-D68 host interactions. EV-D68 is a respiratory virus5 but, in rare cases, can spread to the central nervous system to cause severe neuropathogenesis. Here, we used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify the poorly characterized multipass membrane transporter MFSD6 as a host entry factor for EV-D68. Knockout of MFSD6 expression abrogated EV-D68 infection in cell lines and primary cells corresponding to respiratory and neural cells. MFSD6 localized to the plasma membrane and was required for viral entry into host cells. MFSD6 bound directly to EV-D68 particles via its third extracellular loop (L3). We determined the cryo-EM structure of EV-D68 in complex with L3 at 2.1 Å resolution, revealing the interaction interface. A decoy receptor, engineered by fusing MFSD6(L3) to Fc, blocked EV-D68 infection of human primary lung epithelial cells, and provided near complete protection in a lethal mouse model of EV-D68 infection. Collectively, our results reveal MFSD6 as an entry receptor for EV-D68, and support targeting MFSD6 as a potential mechanism to combat infections by this emerging pathogen with pandemic potential.",

Antigen cross-presentation, primarily occurring at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of dendritic cells, is essential for protein-based vaccines to induce CD8+ T cell responses4. Current efforts have focused on antigen delivery at the tissue and cellular levels, whereas subcellular delivery has been limited to facilitating antigen escape from lysosomes into the cytosol. In the absence of a small-sized high-affinity ER-targeting molecule, the importance of the ‘last mile’ from the cytosol to the ER remains elusive. Here we developed stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist-based ER-targeting molecules (SABER), which effectively deliver antigens to the ER and cluster key machinery in cross-presentation to form microreactors by folding the ER membrane. Conjugation of SABER to various antigens substantially enhances the induction of CD8+ T cell immune responses to tumour neoantigens and conserved viral epitopes, far exceeding that achieved by mixtures of antigens with STING agonists or conventional adjuvants. SABER also retains a potent adjuvant effect, effectively enhancing the ability of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. This study provides a high-affinity ER-targeting delivery system and vaccine adjuvant, demonstrating that precise subcellular delivery targeting the last mile of cross-presentation can lead to a qualitative leap.",

Computing these parallel spatial features requires a large and diverse network of neurons. Consequently, from flies to humans, visual regions in the brain constitute half its volume. These visual regions often have marked structure–function relationships, with neurons organized along spatial maps and with shapes that directly relate to their roles in visual processing. More than a century of anatomical studies have catalogued in detail cell types in fly visual systems 1–3 , and parallel behavioural and physiological experiments have examined the visual capabilities of flies. To unravel the diversity of a complex visual system, careful mapping of the neural architecture matched to tools for targeted exploration of this circuitry is essential. Here we present a connectome of the right optic lobe from a male Drosophila melanogaster acquired using focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy. We established a comprehensive inventory of the visual neurons and developed a computational framework to quantify their anatomy. Together, these data establish a basis for interpreting how the shapes of visual neurons relate to spatial vision. By integrating this analysis with connectivity information, neurotransmitter identity and expert curation, we classified the approximately 53,000 neurons into 732 types. These types are systematically described and about half are newly named. Finally, we share an extensive collection of split-GAL4 lines matched to our neuron-type catalogue. Overall, this comprehensive set of tools and data unlocks new possibilities for systematic investigations of vision in Drosophila and provides a foundation for a deeper understanding of sensory processing.",

For example, the evolutionarily oldest brain regions have a lower density of mitochondria than newer regions.\n\nThe map, which the study’s authors call the MitoBrainMap, is “both technically impressive and conceptually groundbreaking”, says Valentin Riedl, a neurobiologist at Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen, Germany, who was not involved in the project.\n\nFrom cell to brain\n\nThe brain’s mitochondria are not just bit-part players. “The biology of the brain, we know now, is deeply intertwined with the energetics of the brain,” says Martin Picard, a psychobiologist at Columbia University in New York City, and a co-author of the study. And the brain accounts for 20% of the human body’s energy usage2.\n\nWielding a tool typically used for woodworking, the study’s authors divided a slice of frozen human brain ― from by a 54-year-old donor who died of a heart attack ― into 703 tiny cubes. Each cube measured 3 × 3 × 3 millimetres, which is comparable to the size of the units that make up standard 3D images of the brain. “The most challenging part was having so many samples,” says Picard.\n\nCubic millimetre of brain mapped in spectacular detail\n\nThe team used biochemical and molecular techniques to determine the density of mitochondria in each of the 703 samples. In some samples, the researchers also estimated the mitochondria’s efficiency at producing energy.\n\nTo extend their findings beyond a single brain slab, the authors developed a model to predict the numbers and types of mitochondria across the entire brain. They fed it brain-imaging data and the brain-cube data. To check their model, they applied it to other samples of the frozen brain slice and found that it accurately predicted the samples’ mitochondrial make-up.",

          "abstract": "Marathon runners saw myelin levels drop temporarily post-race in areas of the brain involved in motor control and sensory and emotional processing.Credit: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty\n\nA fatty substance that insulates the electrical signals transmitted by nerve cells might also be a source of energy for the brain — especially when reserves are running low. This intriguing possibility has been raised by scans of long-distance runners’ brains, taken before and after they ran marathons.\n\nThe scans suggest that levels of the insulating substance — called myelin — decreased in brain areas involved in motor control and sensory and emotional processing after these gruelling endeavours, only to bounce back to normal within two months.\n\nHumans evolved for distance running — but ancestor ‘Lucy’ didn’t go far or fast\n\nAlthough the idea of myelin as an energy source is not completely new, nobody had thought of examining whether this was the case for runners, says Carlos Matute, a marathon runner and neuroscientist at the University of the Basque Country in Leioa, Spain, who led the research, which is published today in Nature Metabolism1. “These findings open the way to consider that myelin lipids contribute to brain energy metabolism, at least in certain conditions.”\n\nThe temporary loss of myelin after a race is not something that runners should be concerned about, Matute adds. His team is currently conducting studies to examine whether the reduction in myelin has a temporary effect on cognitive function, and have so far come up empty, suggesting that the effect is either very small or non-existent. “There are no gross changes in brain function,” he says. In fact, Matute suspects that the use and replenishment of myelin is beneficial because it “exercises the brain’s metabolic machinery”.\n\nMustapha Bouhrara, who studies brain imaging and ageing at the US National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, agrees. The reduction in myelin lasts for only a short time, so is not concerning, he says, and the process teaches the brain how to quickly repair myelin, and “could be very, very beneficial”.\n\nMarathon inspiration\n\nThe idea for the study came to Matute, who has run 18 marathons, during training. He pondered how people are able to complete such demanding races. Given myelin’s abundance in the brain — it comprises up to 40% of the central nervous system by weight — and its fatty composition, Matute wondered whether the brain might use the substance “strategically”, allowing it to power on when other energy sources are low.\n\nHis team used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to scan the brains of ten runners — eight men and two women — in the 48 hours before and after they competed in various marathons in Spain in 2022 and 2023. The authors found that myelin levels were significantly lower in 12 brain regions after the race, compared with before. “It was not much, but it was a clear reduction in certain areas of the brain,” says Matute.\n\nThe lonely marathon run that transformed my approach to graduate school\n\nThe areas affected are involved in motor coordination, sensory perception and emotions, and are regions you would expect to be active during a marathon, says Matute. “We feel a lot of things during the run and we have to talk to ourselves quite a bit to continue,” he says.\n\nThe researchers imaged the brains of some of the runners again in the weeks and months after the races. They observed that some ‘remyelination’ had occurred after two weeks and that myelin levels had fully recovered after two months.",

Marenfeld\n\nFresh data have bolstered the discovery that dark energy, the mysterious force that makes galaxies accelerate away from each other, has weakened over the past 4.5 billion years.\n\nThe effect was first tentatively reported in April last year, but the latest results — presented on 19 March by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, California — are based on three years’ worth of data-taking, versus one year for the results announced in 2024.\n\n“Now I’m really sitting up and paying attention,” says Catherine Heymans, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh, UK, and the Astronomer Royal for Scotland.\n\nIf the findings hold up, they could force cosmologists to revise their ‘standard model’ for the history of the Universe. The model has generally assumed that dark energy is an inherent property of empty space that does not change over time — a ‘cosmological constant’.\n\n“The gauntlet has been thrown down to the physicists to explain this,” says Heymans.\n\nCosmic mapping\n\nThe DESI telescope is located at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. It uses 5,000 robotic arms to point optical fibres at selected points where galaxies or quasars are located within its field of view. The fibres then deliver light to sensitive spectrographs that measure how much each object is redshifted — meaning the degree to which its light waves were stretched by the expansion of space on their way to Earth. Researchers can estimate an object’s distance using its redshift, to produce a 3D map of the Universe’s expansion history.\n\nIn that map, researchers then look at the density of galaxies to identify variations that are left over from sound waves called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), which existed before stars began to form. Those variations have a characteristic scale that started out at 150 kiloparsecs (450,000 light years) in the primordial Universe and has been increasing with the cosmic expansion; they have now grown by a factor of 1,000 to 150 megaparsecs across — making them the largest known features in the current Universe.\n\nA slice of the 3D map of galaxies based on data collected by DESI in the first year of its survey. Credit: DESI Collaboration/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/R. Proctor\n\nBy tracking the evolving size of BAOs, researchers can reconstruct how the Universe’s rate of expansion has changed over the eons. Around 5 billion years ago, the expansion switched from decelerating to accelerating under the push of dark energy. Until last year, cosmology data were all consistent with dark energy being a cosmological constant — which meant that the Universe should continue to expand at an increasingly fast rate.\n\nBut the results of DESI’s latest analysis imply that the cosmic expansion is accelerating less now than it was in the past, which does not fit the assumption that dark energy is a cosmological constant. Instead, the data suggest that its energy density — the amount of dark energy per cubic metre of space — is now around 10% lower than it was 4.5 billion years ago.",

          "abstract": "Shiba Subedi (left) explains plate tectonics to Dilip Subba during an earthquake exhibition at the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology.Credit: Atul Karn\n\nGrowing up in Jaljala, a remote village in western Nepal, Shiba Subedi was a bright student with a passion for extracurricular activities. He excelled in debates, essay competitions and poetry, but one interest stood above the rest: a deep fascination with Nepal’s folk melodies.\n\nAfter finishing secondary school, Subedi pursued a two-year science degree at Prithvi Narayan Campus in Pokhara, a bustling city in western Nepal. As well as growing academically, he was drawn into the vibrant world of folk music in the local bars.\n\nHowever, his father thought that pursuing music would ruin Subedi’s chances of having a serious career. Determined to change his son’s mind, he travelled by bus for five hours to Pokhara. “He stayed for four days, trying to convince me to give up music,” Subedi recalls. “But I was resolute.”\n\nDismissing his father’s concerns, Subedi continued his musical journey alongside his studies. In 2009, he wrote songs that brought him national recognition and commercial success, earning nearly 200,000 Nepalese rupees — a sum that, at the time, equated to roughly US$2,700 and was more than the average middle-class annual income in Nepal. “My father never questioned my musical pursuit after that,” he adds.\n\nHowever, after 2015, when a disastrous earthquake struck Nepal, Subedi’s dual careers would become intertwined. At the time, he was pursuing a master’s degree in physics at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, but the disaster’s aftermath shifted his focus and the rest of his studies towards geophysics. Now a geophysicist at the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology in Lalitpur, Subedi combines his songwriting passion with an expertise in earthquake monitoring and analysis. He visits schools, educating students and teachers about earthquake preparedness, and uses his melodies to reach even broader audiences.\n\nFor his efforts, Subedi was honoured last November with the Judges Commendation in the John Maddox Prize for standing up for sound science and evidence. The prize is a joint initiative of the London-based charity Sense about Science and Nature.\n\nA quake jumpstarts a career\n\nIn April 2015, when the massive 7.8-magnitude Gorkha earthquake struck Nepal, Subedi was on Tribhuvan University’s campus and witnessed a person die when the university’s gate collapsed onto their car. “It was a devastating scene,” he says.\n\nNearly 9,000 people were killed. Subedi heard about tragic but preventable deaths, such as one in Melamchi: probably following bad advice, a teenage girl who was standing in a garden ran back into her house during the earthquake to take cover under a table instead of remaining outside in an open space. Subedi began searching for ways to better prepare Nepalese society for future quakes.\n\nThat led him to earn a second master’s degree, this time in exploratory geophysics at the Paris Institute of Planetary Physics in 2016. Subedi’s master’s supervisor connected him with György Hetényi, a geophysicist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, to discuss pursuing a PhD in Hetényi’s group. However, Hetényi was hesitant. He recalls thinking at the time: “If he gets a PhD in a classical research domain and goes back to Nepal, then he will not have adequate instruments or resources.” Instead, Hetényi invited Subedi to work in his group while pursuing a PhD in educational seismology, focusing on outreach to students and teachers to raise awareness about earthquakes.\n\nWhen Subedi enrolled in his PhD in 2018, Nepal’s primary and secondary schools had scarce resources for teaching earthquake science. Hetényi and Subedi co-founded the Seismology at School in Nepal campaign, showing teachers and students how to use earthquake sensors and teaching the basics of earthquake waves, energy levels and seismic activity. “If students can measure even small-scale earthquakes, it could spark their interest and inspire future scientists,” he explains.\n\nSubedi observes a house damaged in the 2023 Jajarkot earthquake in western Nepal.Credit: Shiba Subedi\n\nThere were some advantages to Subedi’s side career in popular folk music. First, his social-media connections helped him to quickly identify schools to participate in the campaign. Second, “people love celebrities”, he adds. “When I introduce people to the songs I’ve written and then explain my academic interests, they are much more receptive to my message.”\n\nShreedhar Dhakal, a science teacher at Shree Shiva Secondary School in Kawasoti in southern Nepal, has participated in the teachers’ awareness workshops. He recalls when he first started teaching students about earthquake safety drills — classic manoeuvres such as ‘drop, cover and hold’, meaning to drop to the floor, find cover under a table or cover your head with your arms and hold your position until the shaking stops — the parents complained. “They thought it was unnecessary,” Dhakal says. But over time, he says, they came to appreciate these efforts.\n\nMaking an awareness song\n\nUntil the school-outreach work, Subedi had never revealed his musical career to Hetényi. “I thought it was important to keep my academic and musical pursuits separate,” he says. “Otherwise, people might think I dabble in everything, and question my credibility.”\n\nBut during one of the teachers’ workshops, which Hetényi attended, Subedi invited a singer friend to provide some entertainment, and another attendee casually mentioned Subedi’s musical success to Hetényi.\n\n“I was very surprised,” Hetényi recalls. But he immediately followed up with a request: “Why don’t you make a song about earthquake awareness?”\n\nSubedi was initially dismissive. Hetényi remembers him saying: “No. Earthquakes are not a topic for a song. Period.”\n\nHetényi says he isn’t usually one to push, but after attending several teachers’ workshops in Nepal, he noticed how deeply participants engaged with the folk-music entertainers. He realized that songs, with their brevity and pleasing melodies, could resonate more powerfully with some people than could scientific papers or lectures. After some gentle persistence, Subedi agreed to give it a try.\n\nHowever, translating complex academic terms into catchy, relatable phrases that can sync to rhythmic and repeated musical beats was no easy task. “For example, how do you explain plate tectonics to people with no formal education?” Subedi asks. There are no direct translations for such terms in everyday Nepali language. “If I used jargon, someone like my granny wouldn’t connect with it,” he adds.\n\nInstead of using technical terms, Subedi’s song describes how the movement of rocks beneath the Earth triggers quakes. He embraces simplicity, crafting lyrics that are easy to understand and sing along to — an approach that ultimately captured widespread attention. For example, one verse states: “To this day, science has not determined when or how big an earthquake will be, or where exactly it will strike.” The song’s catchy refrain reinforces the message: “Just as you learn A-B-C, everyone can learn how to prepare to survive an earthquake.”\n\nSubedi’s team wanted to shoot a music video for the song, using a school setting to engage students and create a ripple effect: the idea was that children and teenagers would watch the video and discuss the message with their parents and grandparents, spreading awareness throughout their communities. The music video highlights simple but crucial topics, including how earthquakes originate, building earthquake-resistant homes, how to prepare for an earthquake and how to behave during one.",

          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Animals do not always need to be used in preclinical studies.Credit: Evgenyi Eg / Getty\n\nWhile Catharine Krebs was working in a human-genetics laboratory during her PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles, there was a line that she got used to seeing at the end of papers: “These findings will need to be confirmed in vivo.“\n\nWhat that usually means is in an animal model. “You just say it without even thinking, because you’ve been trained to think that that’s the next best line of investigation,” she reflects.\n\nKrebs is now the medical-research programme manager for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), a non-profit organization in Washington DC that advocates for alternatives to animal-based research.\n\nIn this role, she and other attendees at a 2022 workshop coined a term that helped to make sense of what she’d noticed as a researcher: animal-methods bias.\n\nThey define animal-methods bias as indicating “a reliance on or preference for animal-based methods despite the availability of potentially suitable non-animal-based methods”.\n\nIn 2023, Krebs and her co-authors at the PCRM and at Humane Society International Europe in Brussels, published the results of a survey of life-sciences researchers and peer reviewers1.\n\nThe authors note that the sample of 90 respondents was small, but provides preliminary evidence of animal-methods bias.\n\nSome researchers felt that some of the requests from peer reviewers to add an animal-research component to their studies were unjustified and unnecessary, such as for researchers doing purely computational work.\n\n“The issues are mostly with journals and funders,” Krebs says. In her experience, researchers who are using animal-free models are “extremely frustrated” by such pushback.\n\nA spokeperson for Springer Nature, which publishes Nature, says: “As part of the peer-review process, our editors carefully evaluate requests by reviewers for animal studies and any arguments made against this by the authors.\"\n\nThe spokeperson adds that at all times, its journal editors follow the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments guidelines 2.0, which were last updated in 20202. Nature is editorially independent of its publisher.\n\nAnimal research is not always king: researchers should explore the alternatives\n\nKrebs and her colleagues are now following up with larger-scale research. One aspect Krebs is interested in investigating is whether the bias interacts with researchers’ experience. “The impact of animal-methods bias may be especially strong with early-career researchers,” Krebs hypothesizes. “If they undergo an experience where they feel like they have to use an animal research model to publish or get a grant or publish in a high-impact journal, then that just reinforces it, and it can set them on a career path where they’re using animals instead of other models that may more reliably mimic human biology but are not yet as common in the field.”\n\n“We all know that our in vitro studies do not capture every aspect of biology or physiology,” says Abhijit Majumder, a chemical engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in Mumbai. “But at the same time, animal studies do not capture the many aspects of human physiology.” A commonly cited statistic is that about 90% of candidate drugs in early-stage clinical trials fail before reaching the market, in part owing to heavy reliance on animal models in preclinical research.\n\nMajumder thinks that broader scientific acceptance of NAMs (an acronym that has been applied variously to “new approach methodologies”, “novel alternative methods”, “new alternative methods” and “non-animal models”) will take some time.\n\nFunding opportunities opening up\n\nFunding from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) has been crucial for Laura Sinclair, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Exeter, UK. She started out doing a non-funded PhD related to adipose tissue and diabetes. She then switched to a PhD on cellular ageing in an animal-research-free lab. She took advantage of an innovative funding model offered by the London-based charity Animal Free Research UK, which provided three years of funding for her PhD studentship, three years for her postdoc and three years for another fellowship. The stability has been very welcome for her as an early-career researcher, she says.\n\nIn general, Krebs says, NGO grants for animal-free research tend to be smaller than the longer-term, multimillion-dollar awards offered by government sources such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s biggest funder of biomedical research.\n\nAnother change is the number of grants awarded to support the use of alternative methods. In 2021, alternative methods made up about 8% of competitive (non-clinical, non-invertebrate) awards disbursed by the NIH. In the early 1980s, that figure was essentially zero.\n\n“It’s still small compared to the overall NIH funding,” acknowledges Danilo Tagle, director of the Office for Special Initiatives at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), an NIH institute based in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nLaura Sinclair was grateful for an animal-free-research grant that gave her stability in the early stages of her career.Credit: Dr Laura R Sinclair\n\nTagle started his science career as a geneticist modelling human diseases in mice, which exposed him to some of the weaknesses in rodent models. He says that there’s been a gradual increase in NIH funding for NAMs, especially in the past decade.\n\nIn 2010, a European Union directive established an ambitious goal to fully replace live animals used for scientific purposes with non-animal methods such as organoids or computer simulations. However, the number of animals used in science in the EU barely moved between 2017 and 2022.\n\nIn terms of EU funding schemes and general acceptance of non-animal methods, there are more doors open to emerging researchers today, says Mathieu Vinken, who obtained his PhD in pharmaceutical sciences in 2006. Vinken is now a professor at the Free University of Brussels, with research interests including reducing the use of animals in space toxicology. His funding sources have included large EU grant programmes.\n\nOverall, Majumder thinks that funders are further along than many scientists in being open to alternative models. For instance, a 2025 call for discovery research proposals from the Indian Council of Medical Research in New Delhi explicitly states that both animal and non-animal models are covered, and gives examples of non-animal methods.\n\nMajumder and other scientists have found niches in which alternative methods are especially needed to plug research gaps. One example is investigating how safe medicines are likely to be during pregnancy because “most of the drugs, when they go through clinical trials, cannot be tested on pregnant women”, Majumder explains. For this, researchers are working on developing an organ-on-a-chip model, a microfluidic system that uses cultured cells to simulate the processes in various organs — in this case, the placenta.\n\nSimilarly, the NIH programme Complement Animal Research In Experimentation, established in 2024, is identifying areas in which animal models are lacking, including rare diseases and sepsis. The programme is a coordinated approach to funding NAMs across the NIH, says Tagle, who spoke to Nature’s careers team before the Trump administration paused some external communications and related activities at the organization.\n\n“We’re looking at at least $30 million per year over the course of the next 10 years to develop NAMs,” Tagle says.\n\nHow a shift in research methodology could reduce animal use\n\nAlthough there is uncertainty about the future of US government funding of biomedical research, Krebs thinks that there’s a case to be made that animal research can be quite wasteful, which could align with the new administration’s messaging about reducing government waste.\n\nFor the time being, duplicating research using different models — while more funders, regulators and scientists become comfortable with NAMs — can add time and expense.\n\n“Essentially today we are in the cusp period where doing all this research has become expensive,” says Deepak Modi, a biologist focused on reproductive health at India’s National Institute for Research in Reproductive and Child Health in Mumbai, who collaborates with Majumder.\n\nModi thinks that in the future, some steps in the chain could be omitted, which would speed up the process and bring down costs without losing rigour. There might also be more “ready-to-play” organ-on-chip solutions once the technology matures, Modi says.\n\nSinclair thinks costs are coming down in response to consumer demand, noting a shift towards more synthetic, reproducible materials since she did her animal-free PhD. She and her colleagues have created a guide to working with tissue cultures that are relevant to humans and not derived from animals — the type of resource that would have been useful to her earlier in her career, she says.\n\nFrom a funder’s perspective, value for money can be complex. “The translational implications have to be weighed in, because one can invest in animal models, but if the animal models are not necessarily human-relevant ... then that’s a big waste in terms of time and resources,” says Tagle, who adds that with organs-on-chips, there are examples of moving from developing models to screening drugs and then going on to clinical trials much faster than when animal models were used. An example is researchers who used a lung tissue-chip to test the chemical azeliragon as a treatment for inflammatory lung diseases, an application that has moved on to phase III clinical trials.\n\nPublication perils",

          "title": "How to know whether a conference is right for you",
          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Illustration: Sébastien Thibault\n\nAfter coming across a UK conference that sounded interesting, Carme Arnan Ros, a laboratory manager and research technician at the -Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain, was concerned. The event was organized by a private UK company whose name was similar to that of a prestigious university, although they were not related. She couldn’t be sure that this wasn’t a ‘predatory conference’ — one that typically is weak on organization and academic merit, focusing instead on profitability. Sometimes, these conferences come with misleading claims to entice researchers into attending.\n\nSo Arnan did her research: she verified with the venue that the conference was taking place there. She contacted some announced speakers and companies that would be present. She also sent e-mails and messages on the professional networking platform LinkedIn to speakers who had attended the conference before.\n\nThe results were mixed. She couldn’t find the programme for either the previous year’s conference or the upcoming one online, which worried her. A previous attendee didn’t recommend paying to present a poster “because the meeting is more intended for networking rather for scientific discussions”. Another attendee “told me that the meeting was good for applied and translational sciences rather than basic biology”, Arnan said. Even after speaking to several people about the conference, she still wasn’t sure.\n\nGiven that scientists have limited time, energy, money and perhaps carbon budgets for attending international conferences, how can they decide which ones are worth attending? Some experienced conference-goers offer a few suggestions.\n\nCheck the scope and focus\n\nLike many researchers, Rose Joudi seeks to optimize her conference travel. And her employer, Carya, a non-profit organization in Calgary, Canada, that provides carer support, counselling and other programmes to strengthen families and communities, doesn’t usually fund conference travel.\n\nJoudi had been seeking opportunities to learn about European gerontology and present her research on Carya’s project on abuse of older people in minority ethnic communities. So she planned to attend the conference of the British Society of Gerontology, in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, last July. But when a colleague on LinkedIn later told her about a gerontology conference in London that would take place only a week after the Newcastle one, it seemed like a fortuitous opportunity to give her talk twice.\n\nBats on film: scientific storytelling from a recovering academic\n\nThis event — the European Conference on Aging & Gerontology, run by the International Academic Forum (IAFOR), a non-profit organization based in Nagoya, Japan — was also attended by a Nature reporter investigating the different types of academic conference.\n\nJoudi reached out to the conference organizer beforehand, and their communications were promising, she thought. It wasn’t until a few days before the event, when she was reading the presentation abstracts to decide which talks to attend, that she became confused. Among the variety of topics, one that kept cropping up was children’s education. “I thought, ‘Am I looking at the right conference timetable?’ So that caught me off guard.”\n\nThe IAFOR’s conference model often involves several general conferences that occur at the same location and have overlapping schedules. Non-academics can give presentations, and IAFOR members receive discounts on registration fees. Attendees also often find themselves conducting some of the conference administration themselves: they review each other’s abstracts, help to time each other’s talks and chair multi-speaker sessions.\n\nThe London conference had a combination of themes, including gerontology, education, language learning and the arts and humanities — and hosted several hundred people. In the first two days of the conference, many of the keynote speeches were delivered by academics working for the IAFOR or who were on the -education-centred conference committees. The poster sessions for this portion did, however, include gerontology topics. In one case, in lieu of a poster, a researcher had printed out their research manuscript on A4 paper and pinned it to a board. Because almost nothing on these first two days was relevant to her, Joudi didn’t stay for long. Eventually, she thought, “I love London, and there’s so many other things that I could be doing right now, exploring and just walking around and appreciating the weather. And I thought ‘That’s what I’m going to do.’” So she left.\n\nA discerning eye is needed when choosing which conferences to attend.Credit: Robert Stainforth/Alamy\n\nThese first two days of combined keynote and poster sessions were followed by two days of in-person presentations spread across ten rooms (with audiences of about 7–25 attendees) and one day of online presentations. Only one of these days, and one of the conference rooms, was focused on gerontology. “I came from Canada thinking that this was purely gerontology,” Joudi says. “When you invite hundreds of people from a variety of disciplines that don’t necessarily overlap, I think it’s a bit daunting.”\n\nJoudi wasn’t the only disgruntled gerontologist in attendance. A medical researcher from India who attended the same conference told a Nature reporter that, in his opinion, it was not good value for money. (On-site registration generally cost between £350 (US$453) and £450 for those who were not IAFOR members.) The event might be useful for early-career researchers who want to network, he thought — but for more established professionals, there wasn’t enough scientific content. And a physician from New Zealand who also spoke to Nature was angry. What irked her most was that she felt it had not been made clear during registration that this conference would focus on several fields simultaneously, although some of the communications about the conference seen by Nature’s reporters did indicate this overlap.\n\nHowever, many attendees of this conference, and others put on by the IAFOR, were satisfied. The IAFOR sees its -interdisciplinarity as an asset, not a detriment. Education -researchers were especially well represented at this conference — but some of them who spoke to Nature’s journalists felt that the highly general, interdisciplinary model did not serve them well. The IAFOR did not respond to requests to comment from Nature’s -journalists.\n\nMore broadly, there are trade-offs between conferences that are more egalitarian and ones that are more selective. A key benefit of less elite conferences is the greater likelihood of being accepted for a presentation slot — although such a presentation could be delivered to fewer attendees with less expertise in the field. And if people without in-depth knowledge in a particular area are speaking about that topic, that’s a worrying sign, says David Kaye, a legal scholar at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, who runs the blog Flaky Academic Conferences. This blog was inspired by his forensic-science blog, whose readers were interested in discussing conference quality.\n\nKaye uses the term ‘flaky’ because he’s reluctant to endorse or decry journals or conferences. There are a number of conference practices he calls ‘borderline’, such as listing invited speakers as though they have committed. “Just because a conference is low quality does not mean that the practices are predatory,” he notes. For high-quality conferences, some selectivity in who speaks is needed, Kaye argues.\n\nCheck the organizer\n\nOlivier Sandre, a researcher at the Organic Polymer Chemistry Laboratory in Bordeaux, France, is fortunate. He used to travel to two or three international conferences each year, deeming this necessary for his career. But now that he’s been promoted, he doesn’t feel this pressure and attends roughly one international conference every other year.\n\nHe’s been to some conferences that he describes as questionable. In 2017, he attended a conference on nanoscience that was poorly organized, he says, and had broad session themes (such as ‘energy materials’). But he and his fellow attendees managed to organize themselves, ultimately making the conference a fruitful one.\n\nPredatory conferences are on the rise. Here are five ways to tackle them\n\nSandre advises students to be cautious with unfamiliar conferences, advising them to attend established ones at which they can be confident about making useful contacts. “When you’re younger, you need to make your name in your community,” he recognizes. “I think it’s part of the job of scientists to present their work results.”",

          "abstract": "Part of the quantum computer at Innsbruck University, on which researchers did simulations using qutrits and ququints. Credit: C. Lackner/University of Innsbruck\n\nQuantum computing has so far nearly always involved calculating with qubits — quantum objects that can take the value ‘0’ or ‘1’, like ordinary computer bits, but that can also be in a range of combinations of 0 and 1. Now researchers are producing the first applications of ‘qudits’: units of information that offer combinations of three or more simultaneous states.\n\nIn a paper published on 25 March in Nature Physics1, physicists describe how they used ‘qutrits’ and ‘ququints’ — qudits with three and five states respectively — to simulate how high-energy quantum particles interact through an electromagnetic field. The work follows a result published in Physical Review Letters (PRL) in September2 that reproduced the behaviour of another quantum field, that of the strong nuclear force, using qutrits.\n\nQuantum stock whiplash: what’s next for quantum computing?\n\nSuch simulations of quantum fields are seen as one of the most promising applications of quantum computers, because these machines could predict phenomena in particle colliders or chemical reactions that are beyond the abilities of ordinary computers to calculate. Qudits are naturally suited to this task, says theoretical physicist Christine Muschik, a co-author of the Nature Physics paper who also pioneered such simulations with qubits in 20163 together with colleagues at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. “If I could go back in time to my old self, I would tell her: why waste time with qubits?” says Muschik, who is now at the University of Waterloo, Canada.\n\n“This qudit approach is not a solution to everything, but it helps you when it is suitable to the problem,” says Martin Ringbauer, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and the lead author of the paper.\n\nMore generally, qudits can help to make calculations on a quantum computer more efficient and less error-prone, at least on paper. With qudits, each computational unit that previously encoded a qubit — such as a trapped ion or a photon — can suddenly pack in more information, helping the machines to scale up faster. But the tactic is less mature than approaches based on qubits, and the devil could be in the detail. “Qudits are also more complicated to work with,” says Benjamin Brock, an experimental physicist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nSystem tweaks\n\nIn most types of quantum computer, the qubits that researchers use are two possible states of a system that would naturally have many more states. Such a system could therefore host qudits as well. “Existing qubit processors such as those of IBM and Google can already be operated as qutrits, and would require minor tweaks to operate as high-dimensional qudits,” says Machiel Blok, a physicist at the University of Rochester, New York. (Blok and his team have done experiments in their laboratory in which superconductors encoded qudits of up to 12 levels4.)\n\nQuantum-computing approach uses single molecules as qubits for first time\n\nFor their quantum-field simulations, the authors of the PRL paper encoded qutrits on a superconducting quantum chip that IBM makes available to researchers, and that is normally used as a qubit machine. Ringbauer, Muschik and their colleagues used excited states of calcium ions to represent their five-level ququints. A ququint is a natural way to represent a field that can be in a lowest-energy state (with value 0) or have positive or negative values from −2 to +2 at any point in space, Muschik says.",

          "abstract": "Microorganisms have shaped Earth for almost four billion years. At least a trillion microbial species sustain the biosphere — for instance, by producing oxygen or sequestering carbon1. Microbes thrive in extreme environments and use diverse energy sources, from methane to metals. And they can catalyse complex reactions under ambient temperatures and pressures with remarkable efficiency.\n\nThe potential to exploit these microbial abilities to substantially reduce the impact of human activities on the planet has been recognized by many2. And bacteria or fungi are already being used to produce materials, fuels and fertilizers in ways that reduce energy consumption and the use of fossil-fuel feedstocks, as well as to clean up waste water and contaminants3.\n\nDespite their wide-ranging potential, however, microbe-based technologies remain largely overlooked in international plans to combat climate change or reduce the loss of biodiversity4. For example, discussions about the role of microbial technologies in achieving fossil-free alternatives to current products and processes were minimal or absent at the United Nations conferences of the parties (COPs) in 2023 and 2024 on climate change, and on biodiversity in 2022 and 2024 (see Nature 636, 17–18; 2024).\n\nIs the COP29 climate deal a historic breakthrough or letdown? Researchers react\n\nTo better leverage microbiology in addressing climate change and other sustainability challenges, the International Union of Microbiological Societies and the American Society for Microbiology brought us (the authors) together in December 2023 — as a group of microbiologists, public-health scientists and economists with expertise in health, energy, greenhouse gases, agriculture, soil and water. In a series of meetings, we have assessed whether certain microbe-based technologies that are already on the market could contribute to sustainable solutions that are scalable, ethical and economically viable. We have identified cases in which the technical feasibility of an approach has already been demonstrated and in which solutions could become competitive with today’s fossil-based approaches in 5–15 years.\n\nThis work has convinced us that microbe-based interventions offer considerable promise as technological solutions for addressing climate change and — by reducing pollution and global warming — biodiversity loss. Here, we explain why they could be so important5 and highlight some of the issues that we think microbiologists, climate scientists, ecologists and public-health scientists, along with corporations, economists and policymakers, will need to consider to deploy such solutions at scale6.\n\nMicrobial possibilities\n\nThe use of genomics, bioengineering tools and advances in artificial intelligence are greatly enhancing researchers’ abilities to design proteins, microbes or microbial communities. Using these and other approaches, microbiologists could help to tackle three key problems.\n\nFirst, many products manufactured from fossil fuels (energy, other fuels and chemicals) could be produced by ‘feeding’ microbes with waste plastics, carbon dioxide, methane or organic matter such as sugar cane or wood chips.\n\nMicrobes that grow underneath artificial floating islands can transform lakes from net methane sources into carbon sinks.Credit: WaterClean Technologies\n\nAmong the many companies applying microbe-based solutions to address climate change, LanzaTech, a carbon-upcycling company in Skokie, Illinois, is working on producing aviation fuel on a commercial scale from the ethanol produced when microbes metabolize industrial waste gases or sugar cane. Meanwhile, the firm NatureWorks in Plymouth, Minnesota, is producing polymers, fibres and bioplastics using the microbial fermentation of feedstocks, such as cassava, sugar cane and beets.\n\nSecond, microbes could be used to clean up pollution — from greenhouse gases, crude oil, plastics and pesticides to pharmaceuticals.\n\nFor instance, a start-up firm called Carbios, based in Clermont-Ferrand, France, has developed a modified bacterial enzyme that breaks down and recycles polyethylene terephthalate (PET), one of the most common single-use plastics. Another company — Oil Spill Eater International in Dallas, Texas — uses microbes to clean up oil spills, and large waste-management corporations in North America are using bacteria called methanotrophs to convert the methane produced from landfill (a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2) into ethanol, biofuels, polymers, biodegradable plastics and industrial chemicals.\n\nDrill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway\n\nThe company Floating Island International in Shepherd, Montana, is even building artificial floating islands on lakes and reservoirs that have been polluted by excessive nutrient run-off, so that methane-metabolizing microbes (which colonize the underside of the islands) can remove methane originating from lake sediments. The goal in this case is to transform inland lakes and reservoirs from net methane sources into carbon sinks.\n\nFinally, microbes could be used to make food production less reliant on chemical fertilizers and so more sustainable.\n\nThe chemical process needed to produce ammonia for fertilizer involves burning fossil fuels to obtain the high temperatures and pressures needed (up to 500 °C and 200 atmospheric pressures), releasing 450 megatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year (1.5% of all CO2 emissions)7. Furthermore, excess chemical fertilizers that flow into rivers, lakes and oceans cause algal blooms, which enhance the emission of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is more potent than either CO2 or methane.\n\nMany bacteria and archaea can be used to produce nitrogen fertilizer with much lower greenhouse-gas emissions than synthetic fertilizers. This is because the microbes fix nitrogen at room temperature and at sea-level atmospheric pressure using enzymes known as nitrogenases that convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3).\n\nSeveral companies are now selling biofertilizers, which are formulations containing bacteria called rhizobia or other microbes that can increase the availability of nutrients to plants (see ‘Towards a bioeconomy’ and go.nature.com/3fs2xqf). A growing number of microbial biopesticides are also offering food producers a way to control crop pests without harming human or animal health or releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere8.\n\nSource: https://www.precedenceresearch.com/fertilizer-market\nKeeping it safe\n\nAs more microbe-based solutions enter the market — whether bioengineered or naturally existing — biosafety considerations will become increasingly important.\n\nMany solutions, such as using bacteria to degrade crude oil or plastics, have been shown to be effective and safe in a laboratory setting9. Yet scaling up their use to the levels needed to reduce global emissions or global biodiversity loss could lead to unforeseen complications.\n\nBacteria are being designed to break down plastic waste.Credit: Carbios–AgenceSkotchProd\n\nCertain safeguards — designing bacteria that can persist in an ecosystem for only a short time or that can exist under only specific environmental conditions — are already being developed and applied4. And, in a similar way to phased clinical trials in biomedical research, laboratory experiments could be followed by contained tests in the outdoor environment, which could then be followed by larger-scale field testing. Investigators will also need to monitor systems over time, which could involve the sequencing of environmental DNA from waste water and other approaches that are used in infectious-disease surveillance.\n\nUltimately, the effective deployment, containment and monitoring of large-scale microbe-based solutions will require scientific communities, governments and corporations to collaboratively develop evidence-based policies and engage in clear and transparent communication about the enormous opportunities and the potential risks.\n\nMaking it pay",

It is not clear how many COVID-19 grants will be terminated.\n\n‘Boggles the mind’: US defence department slashes research on emerging threats\n\nThe crackdown on COVID-19 research comes as the NIH under US President Donald Trump has halted nearly 400 grants in the past month. An earlier version of the documents, obtained by Nature on 5 March, directed staff to identify and potentially cancel projects on transgender populations; gender identity; diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the scientific workforce; and environmental justice.\n\nThe NIH, which is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, has awarded grants to nearly 600 ongoing projects that include ‘COVID’ in the title, worth nearly US$850 million. Together these projects make up nearly 2% of the NIH’s $47 billion budget. And the CDC plans to cancel $11.4 billion in funds for pandemic response, NBC News reports.\n\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has killed more than 7 million people globally, including more than 1.2 million people in the United States, and continues to infect and kill people. Studying the virus, how it infects people and the government’s response to the pandemic is also crucial to preventing the next one, say scientists.\n\nAmong the terminations at the NIH is a $577 million programme to identify and develop antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and six other types of viruses with pandemic potential.\n\n“These terminations are clearly shortsighted — we desperately need new treatments against viruses,” says Jason McLellan, a structural virologist at the University of Texas, Austin, whose project to develop broad-spectrum treatments that work against multiple types of viruses was part of the programme and terminated on 24 March. “To cancel the entire grant because a small portion involved SARS-CoV-2 is going to be dangerous for future pandemic preparedness.”\n\nThe NIH did not respond to Nature’s queries about the grant terminations or scientists’ concerns about them. Its parent organization, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), told Nature that “the COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”\n\nUpdated guidance\n\nThe updated guidance document that Nature obtained (see Supplementary Information below) was sent on 25 March to NIH staff members who oversee the business side of awarding research grants, called ‘grants-management specialists’. This document includes COVID-19 on a list of “research activities that NIH no longer supports”, in addition to research on China, DEI, “transgender issues” and vaccine hesitancy. The latest guidance also says that grants related to South Africa and climate change should be terminated.\n\nIn addition to these research topics, the document outlines a new category of research that should be terminated: any project on a list sent by the NIH director or the HHS, which is currently helmed by longtime anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nNIH has cut one mRNA-vaccine grant. Will more follow?\n\nSuch large-scale grant terminations are unprecedented; the agency typically terminates only a few dozen projects each year in response to serious concerns about research misconduct or fraud — and does so only as a last resort, after taking other actions such as suspension.\n\nGrants-management specialists will be tasked with identifying and terminating projects, because the agency’s scientific staff members are considered to be too biased by the NIH’s current leadership to make these determinations, says an NIH official who requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press.",

          "abstract": "In January, at least 29 people were killed and more than 18,000 homes and buildings were burnt or destroyed by fires in the Los Angeles area — one of the worst disasters in California’s history.\n\nInsurance offers one way to support people who have suffered catastrophic losses. But insurance companies are more cautious than ever to provide aid for damages associated with wildfires and other weather-related risks. Last year, insurers worldwide paid out more than US$140 billion in claims relating to natural catastrophes, the fifth consecutive year with losses exceeding $100 billion.\n\nHow scientists can drive climate action: celebrate nature and promote hope\n\nMost major natural disasters that cause substantial insurance claims, including storms, wildfires and flooding, are expected to worsen with climate change. But even for those perils for which recent spikes in payouts have been down to factors such as more properties possessions being insured, economic inflation and population growth, climate change still provides an unwelcome boost to risk, and therefore premiums.\n\nClimate scientists are being drawn into the industry to model these risks. I’m one of them. After spending most of my career working in government and academia, in 2021, I joined Willis Towers Watson, a global insurance broker headquartered in London that serves as an intermediary between corporate clients, insurers and reinsurers.\n\nTypically, insurers have used past claims to predict future losses from the same perils. So long as there had been no major unexpected disasters or big shifts in risk or exposure in a specific area, insurers could be confident that the premiums paid by the many would be enough to finance the claims of the few.\n\nBut in 1992, destruction from Hurricane Andrew in the Gulf of Mexico exposed the fragility of that approach by causing insured losses three times higher than expected by industry insiders in Florida alone. Insurers switched to sophisticated catastrophe models — tools that combine the physics of specific natural hazards with details about building construction and insurance information — to estimate possible financial losses. And in the past few years, as the imprint of global warming on natural hazards has become more obvious, the insurance industry has been recruiting climate and Earth scientists to reduce the likelihood of being taken by surprise in the future.\n\nExtreme fire seasons are looming — science can help us adapt\n\nToday, insurers have more realistic views of their customers’ exposure to weather- and climate-related risks and the scale of potential claims. Within the limits set by government regulators, insurers decide how much risk they can tolerate across their portfolio, raise premiums for owners of more-exposed homes and purchase reinsurance to prepare for losses larger than they could normally afford.\n\nBankrupt insurers can’t pay claims. Policyholders therefore benefit from risks being estimated correctly so that losses can be paid by charged premiums. But insurers also use the latest catastrophe modelling and climate science to justify higher prices, which are fast becoming unaffordable. Too many people are forced to choose between paying more for the same insurance, accepting lesser coverage to keep premiums manageable or letting their insurance lapse.",

The question of whether a paper should have more than one first author can lead to fraught negotiations. And the discussions can be just as thorny when deciding which of two first authors is named in the very first slot.\n\nBut new results might help to take the edge off such discussions. Research published last month in the journal Scientometrics suggests that there is no reputational penalty for shared first authorships, even for the person named second ― at least under experimental conditions1.\n\n“There was no disadvantage of sharing credit. That wasn’t something we expected to find,” says Miriam Schilbach, a co-author of the study and an organizational psychologist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. She and her co-lead author — organizational psychologist Julian Decius at the University of Bremen, Germany — determined whose name would be listed first by rolling dice. (Decius won.)\n\nUp first is...\n\nAuthorship is the currency of academic life, and first authorship of a prestigious publication can make or break a career. The stakes are so high that in 2002, two molecular biologists in Germany ended up in court over changed author positions.\n\nAs research projects become more complex and require a greater range of skills, the practice of sharing the top name slot, known as shared first authorship, is increasing. This has raised concerns that the co-author listed first gets the most kudos and that sharing first authorship is deemed less significant than heading the pack on your own.\n\nThe authorship rows that sour scientific collaborations\n\nTo test such ideas, Decius and Schilbach created a CV for a fictitious experimental physicist named Kim Mueller. They recruited a panel of roughly 170 researchers outside physics — mostly academics with psychology and management backgrounds — to evaluate the CV. They told the panellists that Mueller was an applicant for an assistant professorship and their top three articles were published in prestigious experimental-physics journals.\n\nThe pair then randomly assigned to each panel member one of four versions of Mueller’s CV. In each version, Mueller was listed on all three papers as either sole first author, second author, joint first author listed first or joint first author listed second.\n\nEach panellist was then asked to rank six aspects of Mueller’s academic success, such as their likelihood of becoming editor of a journal over the next five years. The panel members were also asked to estimate Mueller’s h-index, a common metric reflecting the impact of someone’s publications.\n\nSharing the credit\n\nOn average, the panellists judged Mueller higher on all six aspects of academic success when the fictitious physicist was the sole first author than when they were second author — confirming the importance of first authorship.",

The Japanese man was one of four individuals in a first-of-its-kind trial that used reprogrammed stem cells to treat people who are paralysed.\n\nAnother man can now move his arms and legs following the treatment, but the two others did not show substantial improvements. The trial was run by Hideyuki Okano, a stem-cell scientist at Keio University in Tokyo, and his colleagues.\n\nThe results, which were announced at a press conference on 21 March and have not yet been peer reviewed, suggest that the treatment is safe, say researchers.\n\n“That’s a great positive outcome. It’s very exciting for the field,” says James St John, a translational neuroscientist at Griffith University in the Gold Coast, Australia.\n\nPrevious trials using other types of stem cell have also demonstrated that the therapy is safe, but have so far shown mixed results. “Nothing’s really worked so far,” says St John.\n\nLarger trials will be needed to establish whether the improvements observed in the two individuals in the current study were a result of the treatment. It’s possible the patients experienced a natural recovery, says St John.\n\nIn 2019, roughly 0.9 million people globally experienced a spinal cord injury, and some 20 million people were living with the condition1.\n\nReprogrammed cells\n\nReprogrammed or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are created by reverting adult cells to an embryonic-like state, from which they can be coaxed to develop into other cell types.\n\nIn this trial, iPS cells derived from a donor were used to create neural precursor cells. Two million of these were injected into each patient’s injury site, in the hope that they would eventually develop into neurons and glial cells.\n\nThe trial’s first surgery was performed in December 2021; the other three were conducted between 2022 and 2023. All four recipients were adult males and two were aged 60 or older. They all had surgery between two and four weeks after the damage was done, says Okano. Recipients were given immune-suppressing drugs to prevent their bodies from attacking the cells for six months after the surgery.\n\nThe results are the latest in a series of small human trials testing the potential of iPS cells to regenerate tissue and treat disease.\n\nLearning to walk\n\nAt the one-year follow-up, the researchers did not observe any serious adverse effects.\n\nAll individuals started the trial with the highest injury classification of A, as measured by the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS). People with this level of impairment have no sensory or motor function below the point of injury. Two of the participants did not show improvements in their ability to feel or move in the lowest section of their spinal cord. One individual moved up to a classification of C in the period after surgery, and can move some of their arm and leg muscles but cannot stand on their own.

          "abstract": "Brain scans suggest that an infant’s hippocampus can encode memories.Credit: Getty\n\nBabies as young as one year old can form memories, according to the results of a brain-scanning study published today in Science1. The findings suggest that infantile amnesia — the inability to remember the first few years of life — is probably caused by difficulties in recalling memories, rather than creating them.\n\n“One really cool possibility is that the memories are actually still there in adulthood. It’s just that we’re not able to access them,” says study co-author Tristan Yates, a neuroscientist at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nMemory mystery\n\nTry as they might, adults can’t remember events from their earliest months or years. But whether this is because a baby’s hippocampus, a key brain region in storing such memories, is not sufficiently developed or because adults cannot recall these memories has long been an open question.\n\nTo shed light on the issue, Yates and her colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to scan the brains of 26 young children, aged 4 months to 2 years, who were performing a task involving memory.\n\nYoung brain fluid improves memory in old mice\n\nThe team measured hippocampal activity as the children viewed an image of a new face, object or scene for 2 seconds, and when they were shown the same image again about a minute later.\n\nThey found that the greater the hippocampal activity when a baby was looking at a new image, the longer they looked at that image when shown it again. Because babies tend to spend more time looking at familiar things, this result suggests that they were remembering what they had seen.\n\nThe researchers saw the strongest encoding activity in the posterior part of the hippocampus — the area most associated with memory recall in adults.\n\n“What this study shows is a proof of concept that the encoding capability exists,” says study co-author Nick Turk-Browne, a cognitive psychologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n“Although we saw this across all the infants in our study, the signal was stronger in those older than 12 months of age, suggesting a kind of developmental trajectory for the ability of the hippocampus to encode individual memories,” says Yates.\n\nResearchers scanned the brains of young children as they lay in an MRI scanner and performed a memory task.Credit: 160/90",

          "authors": "Tom J. Battin, Albert van Wijngaarden, Birgit Sattler, Alexandre M. Anesio, Joseph Cook, Matthias Huss, Arwyn Edwards",
          "abstract": "Nearly half of Earth’s glaciers are projected to vanish by 2100, even if the increasingly improbable goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels is met1. Already, Venezuela and Slovenia have lost all their glaciers — the first countries to do so in modern times.\n\nTo draw attention to such losses and to highlight the crucial part played by glaciers, snow and ice in the climate system, the United Nations has declared 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation. Yet, there is remarkably little consensus on how to save a glacier.\n\nThirty years ago, when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change came into force, the answer was clear: reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Today, as carbon emissions continue to rise, mitigation alone seems to be insufficient. Technological interventions are starting to be explored — including making ice more reflective using tiny glass beads, enhancing snowfall through cloud seeding and wrapping glaciers in protective films and geotextiles2.\n\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet is fracturing faster than expected\n\nHowever, glaciers are much more than frozen ice. Just like oceans and rainforests, glaciers and ice sheets are teeming with life3–5. The glacial biome is composed mainly of microorganisms, and it is visible to the human eye only during colourful algal blooms. This microscopic ecosystem contains members of all three domains of life — archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes.\n\nThese microbes are far from typical, having genes that are adapted to extreme cold, scarce nutrients and oscillation between intense sunlight in summer and snow-covered darkness of winter. Some microorganisms found in the Tibetan glaciers, for example, seem to make antibiotics so that they can outcompete other ice-dwelling microbes5. This genetic potential has triggered interest in bioprospecting for antimicrobials and enzymes that can work at low temperatures6.\n\nGlacier microbes have also been shown to accumulate and store heavy metals and other environmental pollutants, slowing the downstream release of these contaminants. Disruption to the glaciers’ microbial communities could therefore diminish their efficacy as contaminant buffers, with knock-on effects elsewhere in the environment.\n\nAs momentum builds for technical interventions to slow, halt and even reverse glacier melting, we argue that these must incorporate the complexity of the icy biome that they aim to preserve. Here, we outline the types of intervention that are being seriously considered, how to assess their impact and the regulatory guard rails that are urgently required.\n\nSlowing ice melt\n\nLocalized interventions to preserve mountain glaciers fall roughly into two categories: those that aim to retain existing ice and those that promote the formation of fresh ice2. So far, all have major, yet poorly studied, consequences for life on and inside the glacier. Serious academic investigations must begin before these techniques are adopted widely.\n\nFor example, researchers have tested the effect of spreading hollow microspheres, made of silica-based glass and 10–200 micrometres in diameter, on the ice of an Arctic lake7. The intervention increased surface reflectivity and therefore delayed melting. However, by blocking sunlight, such approaches could harm the algae and cyanobacteria present in the ice.\n\nReflective geotextiles on this small glacier in Switzerland helped to slow down melting.Credit: Matthias Huss\n\nAnother method is being trialled on Dagu Glacier in China: spreading a thin film of cellulose acetate — a synthetic material made from cotton or wood pulp8 — onto the ice. Initially designed for preserving frozen food, this material scatters incoming sunlight and thereby reduces melting8. However, its capability to mitigate glacier mass loss at scales larger than a few square metres, and its long-term sustainability and ecological impacts, have not yet been assessed.\n\nWrapping glaciers in reflective geotextiles (polypropylene, for example) can reduce ice melt by 50–70% per year9. Such synthetic blankets are already being used commercially — for instance, to save the artificial ice grotto of the Rhône Glacier in Switzerland. Although enveloping the ice in a blanket-like material does slow melting, it also blocks sunlight and nutrients.\n\nFurthermore, polymer-based geotextiles release microplastics into the environment — first into the ice and then into downstream ecosystems. On an Austrian glacier where geotextiles have been used for nearly two decades, up to 3 kilometres of such microplastic fibres were recovered per square metre of ice. Small invertebrates ingest these microplastics, facilitating the entry of these particles into the food chain. Larger fibres can also entrap animals, mirroring many of the problems associated with marine plastic waste.\n\nClimate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice\n\nApproaches that aim to create fresh ice also have downsides. For example, in one small trial, researchers managed to seed snowfall from clouds over the Muz Taw Glacier in the Sawir mountains that span the border of Kazakhstan and China10. However, assessing this intervention’s efficiency is challenging because of difficulties in targeting its use and minimizing environmental costs.\n\nPumping water onto the ice and using snow cannons have also been suggested. These interventions were trialled on the Morteratsch Glacier in Switzerland11. Test results show that they work in principle. However, their real-world implementation was abandoned owing to high cost, shortage of water resources and the lack of detailed environmental impact assessments.\n\nTechnical interventions on glaciers are in some ways reminiscent of large-scale climate geoengineering proposals, such as spraying particles into the upper atmosphere and carbon capture and storage. However, glacial interventions are almost exclusively local in application and effects if the implementation is robust. Although some cross-border issues might arise, they involve fewer ethical and governance challenges in general, making them more appealing for early adoption as the harmful effects of climate change ramp up.\n\nYet, the ecological consequences of these interventions have received hardly any attention from governments and policymakers. Furthermore, it is unclear what impacts these strategies would have on downstream communities, particularly on the supply of drinking water.\n\nGlaciers can be inhospitable places to research and difficult to access.Credit: Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty\n\nCurrently available interventions are also expensive and hard to scale up, making them suitable only for the most economically valuable locations. Many glaciers are difficult to access. And interventions need to be repeatedly applied or renewed. Researchers have estimated a price tag of up to US$1.6 billion if all of the glaciers in Switzerland alone were to be blanketed12.\n\nIt is a matter of concern that many of the early attempts to protect glaciers have been driven by commercial interests, in which incentives to disregard environmental concerns are high.",

The discovery shows that “there is terrifically interesting stuff hiding in plain sight”, says Kim Lewis, a microbiologist at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, who was not involved in the research. “Kudos to them that they knew what to look for.”\n\nThe latest molecule targets bacteria’s protein-making factory, the ribosome, in a way that other antibiotic drugs don’t. The ribosome is an attractive antibiotic target because bacteria don’t easily develop resistance to drugs targeting the structure, adds Lewis.\n\nThe search for new antibiotics is necessary because bacteria acquire resistance to existing drugs with continued use. In 2021, bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs was associated with 1.1 million deaths globally, a figure that could increase to 1.9 million by 2050.\n\n“The antibiotic-resistance crisis is an existential threat to medicine,” says Gerry Wright, a chemical biologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and a co-author of the study, which is published in Nature today.\n\nGarden-variety bacteria\n\nWright and his colleagues set out to find microbes that have developed previously unknown tricks to kill pathogens. They collected soil samples in Petri dishes with growth medium and stored them for a year. The researchers then exposed the microbes from these samples to Escherichia coli, a common gut bacterium that can cause serious disease.\n\nOne sample showed potent antibacterial activity — by a species belonging to the genus Paenibacillus.\n\nFurther rounds of screening, genome sequencing and structural analysis revealed that the bacterium produces a molecule that belongs to a group of peptides that form a lasso-shaped knot. These peptides are known for being robust and can probably even survive being digested. “It’s a nice, really compact and incredibly robust structure,” says Wright.\n\nThe molecule, which the researchers named lariocidin, binds to the ribosome and also to transfer RNA, which supplies the ribosome with the amino-acid building blocks it needs to string together peptide chains. By doing so, it prevents the genetic code from being read correctly, and also corrupts the code, jumbling the output. Ultimately, this means that the ribosome produces incorrect peptides, some of which probably end up being toxic to the bacterium and killing it, says Lewis. And because lariocidin uses a different mode of action to other antibiotics, pathogens haven’t already developed resistance to it, he adds.\n\nPathogen killer",

Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/SPL\n\nImmune cells in the skin ‘cauterize’ open wounds and create ‘band-aids’ to prevent the spread of harmful bacteria and foreign molecules from injury sites, finds a study1 in mice.\n\nThe works shows that white blood cells called neutrophils form gooey, protein-rich rings around sites where the skin has been breached. These rings trap pathogens, ensuring that they don’t penetrate into deeper tissues.\n\nSuperpowered skin\n\nScientists have long known that neutrophils wage chemical warfare by releasing toxins to kill invading microorganisms. But the new work, published today in Nature, reveals “an additional role for neutrophils here that we had not appreciated”, says Niki Moutsopoulos, a clinical immunologist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, who was not involved with the study. The findings show that neutrophils aid in wound healing — and are not just immune warriors, she adds.\n\nThe study also highlights a new defence tactic that the immune system deploys to protect the body beyond destroying germs. To the authors’ surprise, neutrophils “prevent conflict before they go into this biochemical war. They build the structures to separate self from non-self, to keep pathogens [away]”, says study co-author Andrés Hidalgo, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nMulti-talented immune cells\n\nNeutrophils are known to poison invading microbes and to swallow them. But these strategies cause “collateral damage” to the body by killing healthy bystander cells, Hidalgo says.\n\nThe skin’s ‘surprise’ power: it has its very own immune system\n\nTo investigate whether neutrophils have another trick up their sleeves, the researchers examined samples of mouse skin, lungs and gut — organs that have contact with the external environment and are lined with protective layers to help ward off pathogens and foreign substances. Hidalgo and his colleagues found that a high percentage of neutrophils in these tissues produce collagen and other proteins that are important for forming ‘extracellular matrix’, a scaffolding that surrounds cells and gives tissues structure. By contrast, neutrophils in blood did not release collagen.",

          "abstract": "Work is under way to develop mRNA vaccines against a host of diseases, but scientists fear the NIH will pull funding for such research. Credit: Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via Getty\n\nThe US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has expanded its cuts to science funding, terminating a growing list of research projects that now encompasses hundreds of grants funding studies on a wide range of topics — from HIV in children to reducing mould exposure and its effect on asthma. And concern is growing among scientists that research investigating mRNA vaccines might be next.\n\nExclusive: NIH to terminate hundreds of active research grants\n\nNature has learnt that the agency has already terminated at least one grant that supported a scientist at Columbia University in New York City who was investigating the body’s immune response to an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nThe fears over mRNA-vaccine grant cancellations come after NIH staff members were instructed to compile a list of grants for studying the technology, according to an e-mail sent on 6 March that Nature has obtained. Acting NIH director Matthew Memoli “has requested information on NIH’s investment in mRNA vaccines research” — including current and planned grants, the e-mail said, setting a one-day deadline. By the time the deadline came around, a spreadsheet with more than 130 entries had been compiled, according to an NIH official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAlthough grants on mRNA-vaccine research have not yet been terminated en masse as they have for other topics — including the health of people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) — the request is an ominous sign, says Justin Richner, a viral immunologist at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago.\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?\n\nNIH workers are worried enough that they have started advising grant applicants not to mention mRNA vaccines in their research proposals, according to reporting by KFF Health News, a health-care and policy news outlet in Washington DC. Sources who spoke to Nature have indicated that this wasn’t an official directive from NIH leadership, but a recommendation from individual programme officers.\n\n“To take away a tool to fight infectious diseases that has been shown to be effective — it’s hard to fathom that we’d do this as a society,” says Richner, who is designing an mRNA vaccine against dengue virus.\n\nThe NIH, the world’s largest funder of biomedical research, did not respond to Nature’s queries about whether mRNA-vaccine research will be terminated or about scientists’ concerns over political meddling in scientific research.\n\nTurning against research\n\nThe panic over mRNA-vaccine grants comes hot on the heels of the agency’s termination of more than 40 grants for studying vaccine hesitancy. Similarly to the call for a list of mRNA-vaccine projects, the agency asked for a spreadsheet containing all active projects on vaccine hesitancy. NIH workers were informed that certain grants should be cancelled by the end of the day in a 10 March e-mail that Nature has obtained. “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses [sic] gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the termination letters said.\n\nWill RFK Jr’s vaccine agenda make America contagious again?\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, was chosen by US President Donald Trump as the nation’s health secretary, and now runs the NIH’s parent agency. In 2021, he unsuccessfully petitioned government regulators to rescind approval of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and falsely claimed that this type of jab is the “deadliest vaccine ever made”, pointing to unverified claims of side effects on a government-run database.\n\nmRNA vaccines rose to fame during the COVID-19 pandemic, not only for their safety and efficacy in preventing severe disease, but also for the speed with which they were developed and deployed — mostly during the first Trump administration. The jabs include genetic instructions that tell a person’s cells to create copies of viral proteins, also known as antigens. This process stimulates the body to generate protective antibodies and virus-fighting immune cells.\n\nModelling studies suggest that, worldwide, mRNA vaccines saved more than 14 million lives in the first year they were administered1, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers are now testing the technology against a litany of conditions, including mosquito-borne diseases and cancer, for which there are more than 100 ongoing trials. Yet some US officials, including Florida’s surgeon general, have called for a moratorium on the technology and have made baseless claims that the jabs cause cancer and are not safe.\n\n“Never in my life did I think that the government would turn against a field of research for non-scientific reasons,” says Drew Weissman, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who shared the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for laying the groundwork needed to create mRNA vaccines. “I feel mostly bewildered, because the potential for RNA is so enormous.”",

          "abstract": "The dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and reductions in aid budgets over the next 3–5 years announced by other Western donor countries, including the United Kingdom (40%), France (37%), the Netherlands (30%) and Belgium (25%), threaten to reverse decades of progress in reducing malnutrition1.\n\nThese cuts — equivalent to 44% of the US$1.6 billion in donor aid provided in 2022 to support the World Health Assembly nutrition targets — will lead to hardship and death among the most vulnerable people in the world2. The implications for public health, economic growth and societal stability are profound.\n\nSevere acute malnutrition, or severe wasting, is the most lethal form of undernutrition and is responsible for up to 20% of deaths of children under the age of five years, and affects 13.7 million children a year worldwide. Left untreated, up to 60% of affected children might die3.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nProven programmes, such as community-based management of severe acute malnutrition, which combine screening, treatment and counselling, can reduce mortality to below 5%3 and have been used in more than 70 countries. In 2022, the United States and other donors reporting to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development spent $591 million on severe-wasting treatment2, which was matched by receiving countries.\n\nThe abrupt withdrawal of donor support leaves millions of critically ill children without access to these life-saving programmes. It is already undermining the institutional capacity, expertise and data infrastructures required to deliver essential nutrition services.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, withdrawal of USAID Advancing Nutrition funding has meant that the charity Helen Keller International has had to stop a programme that provides nutrition services for 5.6 million children. In Sudan, almost 80% of emergency food kitchens are closed. In Ethiopia, supplies of nutrient-rich foods used to treat around one million severely malnourished children annually will run out by May. And the global FEWS-NET network — a leading source of data on famine risks — sits idle, disrupting early-warning systems for humanitarian planning and emergency resource allocation.\n\nLoss of donor funding is also jeopardizing the procurement and distribution of ready-to-use therapeutic food, a life-saving treatment for severe acute malnutrition. The product comes as a dense micronutrient paste that contains peanuts, milk powder, sugar, oils, vitamins and minerals. USAID supported half of the world’s supply4.\n\nThe impacts of these cuts will be dire. To illustrate, here we assess their scale.\n\nMillions of lives in peril\n\nAltogether, we estimate that reductions of $290 million in donor funding for severe acute malnutrition (see ‘Nutrition funding collapse’) will cut off treatment for 2.3 million children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This would lead to 369,000 extra child deaths a year that would otherwise have been prevented.\n\nSource: Ref. 2\n\nOf those, the termination of US-funded programmes (worth $128 million in 2022) alone will keep one million children from accessing such treatments, causing an extra 163,500 child deaths yearly.\n\nThese worst-case scenarios are based on 2022 donor disbursement data for severe wasting treatment, drawn from the Creditor Reporting System of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and analysed by Results for Development, a global non-profit organization2 (see Supplementary information). These treatments are included in community-based management of severe acute malnutrition programmes, which screen and treat children with severe acute malnutrition and follow them to prevent relapse after recovery.\n\nWill RFK Jr’s vaccine agenda make America contagious again?\n\nCutting all US financing and on average 35% of aid from other donors results in $704 million less funding for nutrition programmes overall, and $290 million less for severe acute malnutrition treatment. These numbers assume that disbursements would have otherwise been similar to those in 2022, that the 35% average cuts to aid that were announced by European donor countries will reduce funding for nutrition by 35%, and that donor funding is matched by contributions from LMIC governments, as is often the case.\n\nThe No Time to Waste report4 by the United Nations children’s fund UNICEF estimated that 1.2 million deaths were averted in 2023 by treating 7.4 million children with severe acute malnutrition in 47 high-risk countries. Because 80% of cases worldwide were in these countries, we increased these numbers to cover 100% of cases globally, to 9.3 million children treated and 1.5 million deaths averted.\n\nWe calculated the percentage of reduction in donor funding compared with the 2022 disbursements and assessed how many of the children treated in 2022 would now not receive aid. Similarly, we analysed how many of the prevented deaths because of treatment in 2022 would now not be averted.\n\nGlobal consequences\n\nAlthough shocking, the number of deaths might be an underestimate, because the aid cuts threaten a huge array of nutrition-supporting programmes, including health, agriculture, school feeding and water and sanitation. Soon we might see many more millions of children around the world developing wasting, stunted growth and micronutrient malnutrition.\n\nSevere wasting is responsible for up to 20% of deaths of children under the age of five.Credit: Tiksa Negeri/Reuters",

          "authors": "Nic Fleming",
          "abstract": "As anyone seeking to lose weight knows, diets come in and out of fashion. The Sexy Pineapple diet, launched by a Danish psychologist in 1970, never really took off. Kellogg’s no longer promotes the Special K diet, which swaps out two meals a day for a bowl of the breakfast cereal of that name. These days, you don’t hear much about eating according to blood type, cutting out acidic foods or following the potato diet.\n\nIntermittent fasting has, however, had unusual staying power for more than a decade — and has grown even more popular in the past few years. One survey1 found that almost one in eight adults in the United States had tried it in 2023.\n\nThe surprising cause of fasting’s regenerative powers\n\nThe enduring popularity of intermittent fasting has been fed by celebrity endorsements, news coverage and a growing number of books, including several written by researchers in the field. More than 100 clinical trials in the past decade suggest that it is an effective strategy for weight loss. And weight loss generally comes with related health improvements, including a reduced risk of heart disease and diabetes. What is less clear is whether there are distinct benefits that come from limiting food intake to particular windows of time. Does it protect against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, enhance cognitive function, suppress tumours and even extend lifespan? Or are there no benefits apart from those related to cutting back on calories? And what are the potential risks?\n\nNeuroscientist Mark Mattson at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, and author of the 2022 book The Intermittent Fasting Revolution, has been studying fasting for 30 years. He argues that, because ancient humans went for long periods without food as hunter-gatherers, we have evolved to benefit from taking breaks from eating. “We’re adapted to function very well, perhaps optimally, in a fasted state,” he says.\n\nFasting’s deep roots\n\nFasting is far from new. Periodic abstentions from food have long been practised in many religions. In the fifth century bc, the Greek physician and philosopher Hippocrates prescribed it for a range of medical conditions.\n\nRecent scientific interest in fasting has its roots in questions raised by research on calorie restriction. Since the 1930s, studies have shown that putting rodents on low-calorie diets can increase their lifespans. Hypotheses proposed to explain this effect include that calorie restriction slows growth, lowers fat intake or reduces cellular damage caused by unstable free radicals.\n\nBut an observation made in 1990 by researcher Ronald Hart, who was then studying ageing, nutrition and health at the US National Center for Toxicological Research in Jefferson, Arkansas, highlighted another intriguing possibility. Calorie-restricted rodents fed once daily consumed all their food in a few hours. Perhaps the calorie-restricted rodents lived longer because they repeatedly went for 20 or so hours without eating.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of a meal, cells use glucose from carbohydrates in food as fuel, either straight away or following storage in the liver and muscles as glycogen. Once these sources are depleted — in humans, typically around 12 hours after the last meal — the body enters a fasted state during which fat stored in adipose tissue is converted to ketone bodies for use as an alternative energy source.\n\n‘Intermittent fasting’ generally refers to various diets that include repeated periods of zero- or very low-calorie intake that are long enough to stimulate the production of ketone bodies. The most common are time-restricted eating (TRE), which involves consuming all food in a 4- to 12-hour window, usually without calorie counting; alternate-day fasting (ADF), whereby people either abstain from food every other day or eat no more than around 500 calories on that day; and the 5:2 diet, which stipulates a 500-calorie limit on 2 days per week (see ‘Three forms of fasting’).\n\nSome researchers say the resulting shift between sources of energy, called metabolic switching, triggers key adaptive stress responses, including increased DNA repair and the breakdown and recycling of defective cellular components. Those responses, the thinking goes, provide health benefits beyond those from reduced calorie consumption alone. Observational studies have suggested that some religious fasters who fast long enough for metabolic switching to occur see such health benefits, although these studies have a lot of limitations.\n\nGetting slim fast\n\nControlled diet trials are notoriously difficult to conduct. People’s diets and behaviours, together with their genetic inheritance and baseline health, make for a lot of variables. Often, people don’t stick with the study, and getting participants to track calorie intake accurately is a known challenge.\n\nYour diet can change your immune system — here’s how\n\nStill, the weight of the evidence suggests that intermittent fasting can help people to lose weight. In 2022, for example, Courtney Peterson, who researches nutrition at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and her colleagues reported results from a trial involving 90 adults with obesity who also received counselling to help them lose weight. She found that those who followed TRE for an average of 6 days per week over 14 weeks lost an average of 6.3 kilograms, compared with the 4 kg lost by participants who ate over 12 or more hours2. Peterson says that many people find following a rule about when to eat and when not to eat easier than counting calories or eating healthier. “We and others have found that TRE also makes people less hungry, so they tend to naturally eat less and lose weight,” says Peterson.\n\nAlso in 2022, nutritionist Krista Varady at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and her colleagues reviewed 22 randomized trials looking at the effects of ADF, the 5:2 diet and TRE on body weight. ADF and the 5:2 diet produced 4–8% weight loss after 8–12 weeks in those with obesity, whereas TRE helped people to lose 3–4% of their body weight over the same period3.\n\nVarady has a long-standing interest in fasting. The cover of one version of her 2013 book The Every Other Day Diet features pizza, a doughnut and a burger to illustrate that those doing ADF don’t need to cut out unhealthy foods. In the book, Varady argues that restricting intake to no more than 500 calories every other day is a more effective way to lose weight than conventional calorie counting and cutting out fatty and sugary foods.\n\nAlthough most researchers who study intermittent fasting agree that it can help people to lose weight, they’re split on whether there are any benefits beyond those that come from simply eating less. Michelle Harvie, a research dietitian at the University of Manchester, UK, sought to address this question in collaboration with Mattson in a 2010 trial. They found that overweight women who followed a 5:2 diet for 6 months had larger reductions in fasting insulin and insulin resistance than did those on a reduced-calorie diet4. Both groups had the same weekly calorie intake and lost an average of around 6 kg. But the difference in insulin levels was small, and the researchers relied on participants to track consumption by keeping food diaries.\n\nIntermittent fasting often appeals to people who prefer to restrict when, rather than what, they eat.Credit: Roger Bamber/Alamy\n\nIn a 2018 study, Peterson and her team carefully monitored the diets of prediabetic, overweight men, matching their diets to energy consumption. The participants ate all their food either within 6 hours before 3 p.m. daily, or over 12 hours, for 5 weeks before switching to the other eating schedule. Although both regimes resulted in equivalent small weight loss over the study period, when men were on the more time-restricted diet, they had improved insulin sensitivity, lower blood pressure and reduced oxidative stress, a form of molecular damage5.\n\n“We showed for the first time that intermittent fasting has health benefits and effects beyond weight loss in humans,” says Peterson. But the study was relatively small: only 12 adults started the trial, only 8 completed it, and all were male and overweight.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is that other trials have reached seemingly contradictory conclusions. Nisa Maruthur, a physician at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and her colleagues asked 41 obese adults with pre-diabetes or diabetes to consume diets that matched their energy needs, eating either during a 10-hour daily window or according to their normal schedule. After 12 weeks, there was little difference between the two groups in the average changes to weight, glucose regulation, blood pressure, waist circumference or lipid levels6. “Weight loss seen in prior studies of TRE was probably the result of eating fewer calories,” says Maruthur, whose study was published in 2024. If so, metabolic switching might not come with added health benefits.\n\nPeterson, a co-author of that study, disagrees and suggests that the 10-hour eating window might have been too long to achieve the results seen in trials of shorter TRE windows.\n\nEven though Varady thinks that intermittent fasting can help people to lose weight, she remains unconvinced that it has effects independent of calorie restriction. “Based on current human evidence, I don’t think that there are any benefits of intermittent fasting beyond weight loss,” she says.\n\nMattson is equally sure of the opposite: “There is considerable evidence of benefits of intermittent fasting that cannot be explained by reduction in calorie intake.”\n\nMattson and others have looked to animal research in their efforts to understand the physiology of fasting, and to identify mechanisms that could underpin any extra health benefits.",

I’m employed by the palace’s management body to study the biodiversity in this vast complex — which has more than 2.5 million visitors per year. We manage the water features and gardens, not only to enhance their aesthetic appeal but also to protect their wildlife, with a focus on amphibians.\n\nIn this photograph, taken just after sunset, when amphibians are active, I’m checking the number of Iberian ribbed newts (Pleurodeles waltl) in the pool and assessing their life stages. When I began working here, only two amphibian species remained; the others had disappeared owing to water pollution. These pools are common in the Alhambra, but much of the wildlife has been lost in recent centuries. Now, thanks to reintroduction efforts and careful management, four species are thriving. The individuals I’m observing today are the direct descendants of those I released years ago.\n\nIt is valuable that so many people can see these animals in an urban environment. This raises awareness about the importance of biodiversity and how engaging with it can enhance our well-being. We now maintain the pools so that they remain transparent without the use of any chemical products, which enables invertebrates to thrive and, in turn, attracts birds that prey on them.

          "abstract": "US military personnel in San Diego at the US-Mexico border.Credit: Carlos Moreno/NurPhoto/Getty\n\nWhat are the implications of allowing artificial intelligence (AI) to make critical decisions about life and death in combat? That’s a question that Nicholas Evans, a social scientist at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, was hoping his research could answer — until funding for his grants was cut by the US Department of Defense (DoD) this month.\n\nThe grants were among 91 social-science studies terminated by the DoD, including many that were part of the flagship Minerva Research Initiative, which supports basic social-science research so as to better understand emerging threats to national security.\n\n“One of the brilliant parts” of Minerva is that it takes “the notion of security broadly”, says Leonardo Villalón, a political scientist at the University of Florida in Gainesville who studies the Sahel region in Africa. Minerva grants fund research on global dynamics such as violence, instability, natural catastrophes, human displacement and migration, he says.\n\nThe defence department stated in a press release that it was “scrapping its social science research portfolio as part of a broader effort to ensure fiscal responsibility and prioritize mission-critical activities”. Termination notices, seen by Nature, state that the grants no longer served DoD’s “program goals or agency priorities”.\n\n“The big challenge”, says Evans, “is that there is almost nowhere else in the United States where you can get two and a half million dollars to do social-sciences research, and that limits our ability to get funded.” He and his collaborators received US$5.3 million in research grants in 2021 and 2024, as part of Minerva. With the funding cut, he will lose $4.3 million.\n\nNational interest\n\nThe Minerva initiative was launched in 2008, and grants are managed by research offices run by the army, air force and navy. A portion of the funds go towards educating students at US military schools and academies in key areas of the social sciences, and many of those grants have also been terminated.\n\nNeil Johnson, a physicist at George Washington University in Washington DC, received termination notices for two grants, each worth about $2.5 million. One of them, close to the end of its five-year term, supported research on how threats, hate and extremism spread through online and offline social networks. The other focused on security threats along national borders.\n\n“The rationale was really weird,” says Johnson. For years, he has participated in calls and briefs at DoD agencies. Among other things, he has advised intelligence officers at military bases of his research findings, from the weaponization of health to gun violence. Now that all stops, he says.\n\nSpending money on military preparedness — on armaments and technology, for example — but not on understanding the nature and causes of potential military conflicts is incredibly short-sighted, says Kathy Baylis, a development economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “It kind of boggles the mind,” she says. The Minerva initiative accounts for a fraction of the DoD’s budget. In its 2024 budget request, the department requested $64.3 million for Minerva out of a total budget of $842 billion.\n\nBaylis has also had her Minerva grant terminated. Awarded in 2023, it enabled her to study the effects of climate shocks on food security in sub-Saharan Africa. It was initially guaranteed for three years, with an option of two more. Between the Minerva losses and cuts to grants from the US Agency for International Development, Baylis has lost roughly $5 million over the past few weeks. Since then, she has been scrounging for money to pay salaries and working out ways to share the limited data that she and her team managed to collect. “They just wasted a whole pile of money that had been spent on research that can no longer be fulfilled,” she says.\n\nVillalón, who was studying the impact of climate hazards on societies in the Sahel and how those communities were responding to changes, had already spent most of the $1.6 million awarded as a three-year grant in 2022. He and his team had only about $200,000 left over, which would have been used to support data analysis and publication.",

          "title": "The expanding Universe — do ongoing tensions leave room for new physics?",
          "authors": "Wendy Freedman",
          "abstract": "On 1 January 1925, US astronomer Henry Norris Russell made a startling announcement to the American Astronomical Society in Washington DC: observations by fellow astronomer Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way did not encompass the cosmos, and that myriad galaxies exist beyond our own. Hubble’s findings revolutionized humanity’s perspective on the Universe and continue to challenge astronomers even now, one century on.\n\nHubble had gained these insights from a handful of intriguing black dots on glass photographic plates1 — stars of variable brightness known as Cepheids. He had discovered these objects while working at the Mount Wilson observatory near Pasadena, California, including in images of a striking ‘spiral nebula’ in the constellation of Andromeda, a fuzzy object among the stars that looked like a whirlpool. The embedded variable stars proved that the Andromeda nebula was much farther away than the stars that comprised the Milky Way. Andromeda was therefore a separate galaxy — similar to, yet distinct from, our own.\n\nIs dark energy getting weaker? Fresh data bolster shock finding\n\nAnd Andromeda wasn’t alone. The night sky was peppered with hundreds of spiral and irregular-shaped nebulae hiding among the stars. The Milky Way didn’t go on forever; rather the Universe was filled with other galaxies (now known to number in the hundreds of billions). This was just the beginning. Hubble set about searching for Cepheids in these far-away galaxies so that he could pinpoint their distances, too. By 1929, Hubble had noticed a correlation between the galaxies’ distances and the velocities at which they seemed to be receding from Earth.\n\nA few years earlier, astronomer Vesto Slipher had reported a shift to longer (redder) wavelengths of key atomic signatures in the spectra of nebulae, indicating that the objects were travelling away from Earth2. Together with Hubble’s distances, these data implied that more-distant galaxies were moving away faster, suggesting that the Universe must be growing with time3. It was an astounding revelation.\n\nTheoretical physicists had already allowed for this expansion using mathematical models, based on Albert Einstein’s 1915 general theory of relativity4 and calculations by Alexander Friedmann5 and Georges Lemaître6. (Interestingly, Einstein had considered expansion, but dismissed it.) These models — and an emerging understanding of nuclear physics — implied that the Universe had burst forth from the explosion of a dense primeval fireball, and had been expanding and cooling ever since.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nFirm evidence supporting this ‘Big Bang’ theory came in 1965 with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background7 — remnant radiation from when the Universe became transparent some 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nAstronomer Fred Hoyle coined the catchy name in a 1949 radio programme, to help explain the phenomenon to the public. Although the term was interpreted by many people as derisive, he later said he did not intend it in that way.\n\nScientists have since worked hard to pinpoint how fast the Universe is expanding, and how long ago the Big Bang took place. It’s a compelling tale, with lots of twists and turns. But, 100 years on, there’s still much that we don’t know. And there might even be room for some new physics.\n\nMeasuring the expansion\n\nThe Hubble constant is a measure of the rate at which the Universe is currently expanding. From his measurements3, Hubble derived an initial value of around 500 kilometres per second per megaparsec (where 1 parsec is 3.26 light years). In other words, for each megaparsec a galaxy lies farther away, we see it receding 500 kilometres per second faster.\n\nExtrapolating that back in time, the Universe must have been ever smaller and denser. Thus, the expansion rate can tell us how old the Universe is — how long it has been expanding for. And Hubble initially projected that the cosmos was just two billion years old. However, that didn’t make sense, because at the time, radioactive dating of the oldest known rocks on Earth suggested that they were at least three billion to four billion years old. Earth couldn’t have existed longer than the Universe itself.\n\nAstronomers redoubled their efforts to measure the rate of expansion more accurately. By the 1970s, the constant had come down from 500 to between 50 and 100, suggesting that the Universe was roughly 10 billion to 20 billion years old8. That frustrating factor of two, however, remained stubbornly in contention for another 30 years.\n\nPinning down the constant\n\nAstronomers face formidable challenges when measuring cosmic distances. Hubble relied on Cepheid variables for his measurements — analysing stars that exhibit a cycle of brightening and fading. The more luminous the Cepheid, the longer its pulsation cycle, a relationship discovered by astronomer Henrietta Leavitt9. The rate at which the star pulsates is related to its intrinsic brightness. By comparing this brightness to how bright the star seems, Hubble could calculate its distance.\n\nUnfortunately, the measurement of distances has proved a lot more challenging than was apparent to Hubble. In practice, systematic effects — such as calibration uncertainties in instruments, dimming of distant stars by intervening interstellar dust grains, differences in the chemical compositions of stars, our inability to resolve individual stars when they are clustered and small sample sizes — are a persistent obstacle.\n\nEdwin Hubble’s annotated plate of the Andromeda galaxy.Credit: Courtesy of Carnegie Science\n\nSeveral pieces of the cosmological puzzle fell into place around the turn of the twenty-first century. Digital detectors had replaced photographic plates, improving precision. Innovative methods were developed to correct for the effects of dust. Importantly, the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and a key project to measure the Hubble constant — which I led — enabled observations of hundreds of Cepheids in 24 distant galaxies with 10 times the resolution of Earth-based telescopes.\n\nThese advances narrowed the value of the Hubble constant markedly10, to a value of 72 with a precision of 10% — finally resolving the long-standing ‘factor of two debate’ in the distance scale. But solving one problem merely revealed another. When a value of 72 was input into the most up-to-date cosmological models of the time, it implied that the Universe had existed for just 9 billion years. However, by this point, astronomers had measured that the oldest stars in the Milky Way were at least 12 billion years old.\n\nA striking discovery in 1998 — that the expansion of the Universe was not steady but accelerating — potentially offered a way out of this unwelcome crisis. This cosmic acceleration is driven by what astronomers now refer to as ‘dark energy’, a repulsive form of gravity that is allowed by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. A Universe that is accelerating wouldn’t always have been expanding as fast as it is today. The presence of dark energy allows for the Universe to be older, and even for its age to be consistent with that of stars in the Milky Way. But, still, there were more puzzles to solve.\n\nShort-lived consensus\n\nMeasuring distances to galaxies is just one way of judging the expansion rate of the Universe. In 2001, a satellite was launched that provided a new and independent means of estimating the Hubble constant. NASA’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)11 measured tiny differences across the sky in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background, at the level of a few parts in 100,000. By comparing these differences to cosmological models, the expansion rate could be deduced.\n\nHow dwarf galaxies lit up the Universe after the Big Bang\n\nBy then, cosmological models had incorporated several exotic ingredients. As well as dark energy, there had previously arisen strong evidence for the presence of ‘cold dark matter’, a form of matter that is currently thought to comprise as-yet-unidentified particles produced in the Big Bang. This dark matter does not emit or absorb light, but does interact gravitationally with the ordinary, visible matter that makes up the Universe’s luminous components, including stars and planets.\n\nOverall, ordinary matter makes up only 5% of the cosmos. Dark energy dominates the overall mass-energy density of the Universe, comprising 68% of the total12, and dark matter contributes the remaining 27%.\n\nFitting the WMAP data led to a value of 71 for the Hubble constant — very close to the estimate of 72 based on Hubble Space Telescope Cepheid data. But this comforting consensus in cosmology was short-lived.\n\nIn 2009, the European Space Agency launched a satellite, called Planck, that had a greater sensitivity than did WMAP, to measure the cosmic microwave background. In 2013, the Planck collaboration announced its first results13, including a Hubble-constant value that was markedly lower than that found using Cepheids: 67.3, with a precision of better than 2%. In 2018, this was sharpened to a value12 of 67.4 ± 0.5, indicating a precision better than 1%.",

          "abstract": "RNA structure poses unique challenges for computational models.Credit: Getty\n\nAt a virtual conference in November 2020, the winner of a biennial protein-structure-prediction challenge was announced: AlphaFold. Created by Google DeepMind, this computational tool had blown its competitors out of the water by solving dozens of protein structures with atomic-level accuracy, accomplishing a feat that researchers had been attempting for decades.\n\nThe challenge, known as the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP), was launched in 1994 to advance computational tools for modelling 3D protein configurations from their amino-acid sequences. Teams of scientists pitted their computational models against each other, trying to generate the most accurate predictions for previously unknown protein structures that, before the event, are solved experimentally using methods such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy.\n\nAlphaFold’s 2020 predictions rivalled those solved with these tried-and-tested techniques, and it has since become a favourite of the structural-biology community. Its repository — the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database — contains some 200 million structures, and, in 2024, AlphaFold’s developers shared half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work.\n\n‘The entire protein universe’: AI predicts shape of nearly every known protein\n\nBut that’s proteins. In 2022 the organizers of CASP turned their attention towards a different, yet still challenging, class of biomolecules: RNA.\n\nAs with proteins, determining RNA structure typically requires costly and time-consuming experimental methods. Computational tools can help, but RNA is a tougher nut to crack. One simple reason, according to Yu Li, a computer scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, is historical. For a long time, most scientists didn’t think RNA biology was interesting enough to study. But RNA also poses unique molecular challenges, and relatively few data are available to train computational models of the type that have performed so well with proteins.\n\nResearchers have been getting creative, however, and there is a growing toolkit of computational tools emerging to aid the prediction of RNA structure. Many of these incorporate the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI), including the large language models (LLMs) that underlie popular chatbots, such as ChatGPT.\n\n“RNA folding is a very tough problem,” concedes Shi-Jie Chen, a computational biophysicist at the University of Missouri in Columbia. But AI, he adds, is getting “better and better”.\n\nElusive targets\n\nFor a long time, RNA was seen simply as an intermediary between two more interesting classes of molecule: DNA, the ‘blueprint of life’, and proteins, the ‘building blocks’ of the cell. Only a small fraction of the human genome encodes proteins, yet much of the non-coding genome is transcribed into RNA. Over the past few decades, scientists have discovered that these non-coding RNAs mediate essential functions in healthy cells — and contribute to many diseases.\n\nHow these RNAs work remains, in many cases, a mystery. Researchers hope that, by determining their shape, they will be able to understand better the role that these molecules have in making our cells tick — a question of form dictating function. “In biology, we assume that the sequence is very likely to determine the structure, and that the structure is very likely to determine the function,” says Li.\n\nBut computational tools for predicting RNA structure lag behind their protein equivalents. Even AlphaFold3, the latest version of DeepMind’s structure-prediction tool — falls short when it comes to RNA.\n\n‘Remarkable’ AI tool designs mRNA vaccines that are more potent and stable\n\n“If you look at the recent CASP competitions, we are at the point where, on the protein structure side of things, fully automated teams are as good as human teams,” says Lydia Freddolino, a systems biologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and a scientific advisory board member for CircNova, a company that uses deep-learning tools to design circular RNA-based therapeutics. “For RNA, we are nowhere near that — all the top groups make heavy use of human intervention.”\n\nRNA-structure prediction featured in CASP competitions in 2022 and 2024, and Freddolino participated in both. The team that ranked first for predicting RNA structures at the latest event, CASP16, used a hybrid approach: combining AI with a defined, physics-based algorithm. According to Chen, who led the winning group, they first used AlphaFold3 to generate ensembles of possible RNA structures, and then applied a physics-based model that probes the ‘energy landscape’ of possible structures to pinpoint the conformations that are most likely to form. (Chen’s team has licensed their software to several biotechnology firms.)\n\nResearchers developing AI-only tools for predicting RNA structure face numerous obstacles. One is that RNA molecules have features that make their structures inherently hard to predict. RNA molecules have more flexible backbones than do proteins, and their structures are more dynamic, meaning that they can undergo substantial conformational changes while carrying out their biological tasks.\n\nOn top of that, RNA molecules lack the different chemistries that can be found in proteins, such as acidic and basic residues, that allow for stable connections to form. Instead, segments of RNA interact in all kinds of “weird and wonderful ways”, Freddolino says, such as through different base pairings and the involvement of metal ions. As a result, the subtle variations between the best and worst models are trickier to spot than with proteins.\n\nNatural (R1116 and R1149) and synthetic (R1138) RNA structures, used in the structure-prediction task CASP15, measured experimentally (grey) and predicted using an AI tool (red).Credit: W. Wang et al./Nature Commun.\n\nThe chemical alphabet of RNA is also harder to interpret: the four chemical bases that make up RNA are less distinct than the 20 amino acids found in proteins. That means that each RNA base contains less information than an amino acid. One reason tools such as AlphaFold have been so successful, Freddolino notes, is the ability to use large sequence databases to pinpoint patterns of interactions between different amino acids — and this is much more difficult to do with RNA.\n\nAnd then there’s the paucity of known RNA structures. The Protein Data Bank, a repository of 3D macromolecular structures, contains nearly 200,000 protein structures and fewer than 2,000 RNAs. This dearth of data means that there is less information to feed the algorithms that underlie AI-based structure prediction.\n\n“We’re doing as well as we can with the limited data that we have,” says Jim Collins, a biomedical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. “The field would advance considerably with the collection and curation of many more structures.”\n\nBringing in AI\n\nResearchers have been working to address these challenges, and, in recent years, several AI-based RNA-structure-prediction tools have emerged. Before 2020, most of the methods for predicting RNA structure were based on algorithms defined by specific physical or mathematical models, according to Jianyi Yang, a computational biologist at Shandong University in Qingdao, China. But the success of AlphaFold has inspired people in the RNA field to apply AI to this problem, too, he says.\n\nYang and his colleagues designed a fully automated (and freely available) AI tool, trRosettaRNA, which combines deep learning with elements of Rosetta, a computational tool used for determining molecular structures that was created by David Baker at the University of Washington in Seattle, who shared the 2024 chemistry Nobel with the creators of AlphaFold.\n\nJust as for proteins, the structure of RNA occurs on multiple levels: nucleotide sequence (primary); intermediary structures that form when base pairs find their complements (secondary); and the final, 3D structure (tertiary). RNAs can also form complexes with each other and other molecules (quaternary). First, trRosettaRNA generates predictions of primary and secondary structures, then, with the help of a classical physics-based model, it reconstructs tertiary structures. Secondary structures — such as ‘hairpins’ that form when short segments of sequence pair up with one another — are much more important for RNA than they are for proteins, Yang says, and using these in-between structures is one of the keys to this model’s success.\n\nYang’s team pitted trRosettaRNA against other automated tools and found, on the basis of an assessment with two independent data sets of dozens of RNAs, that it surpassed those tools in accuracy1. In 2024, the software placed fourth at CASP16.\n\nLearning RNA structure prediction from crowd-designed RNAs",

Associations representing universities in these regions say this threatens academic freedom and undermines scientific advancement.\n\nSeveral universities or university associations have confirmed to Nature that some of their staff or members were sent a detailed survey asking whether their US-funded projects relate to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), climate and environmental justice or what the survey calls gender ideology. In the United States, President Donald Trump’s administration has cut funding for research related to these topics. Other questions ask specifically about institutions’ funding ties and collaborations with entities that could be against US interests.\n\nThe survey “is at the extreme end of foreign influence in a way that we have never seen from any of our research partners”, says Vicki Thomson, chief executive of the Group of Eight (Go8) consortium of Australia’s leading research universities, some of which have received the survey. It could “tip over to foreign interference if it is contrary to our values and national interests”, she says.\n\nMany universities in Europe have advised their researchers not to respond to the survey, but some in Australia have responded.\n\nThe questions\n\nThe 36-point survey also asks researchers whether their institutions work with communist, socialist or any parties that espouse anti-American beliefs, according to copies of the questionnaire posted online by UK newspaper The Guardian and by Resource, a magazine published by Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands.\n\nResponses to questions are scored out of a total of 180 points. Projects get higher scores if they don’t contribute to DEI, climate or gender “ideology”, or if the researcher confirms that their organization doesn’t work with communist or socialist parties, or with any parties that “espouse anti-American beliefs”. Projects that contribute to preventing illegal immigration to the United States; to combating prosecution of Christians; and to supporting efforts to secure rare-earth minerals also score highly. By contrast, institutions that receive funding from China, Russia, Cuba or Iran score lower.\n\nThomson says that, although funding agencies often ask about universities’ policies on modern slavery, gender-equality plans and other good research practices, many questions in the survey are “beyond the traditional scope of grant compliance”. Researchers were given 48 hours to respond to the questionnaires, she says.\n\nChad Gaffield, chief executive of the U15-Group of Canadian Research Universities in Ottawa, says that although the questionnaire asks some familiar and appropriate questions about accountability, transparency and security, other points “politicize the research enterprise”. The questions threaten the ability of US-led research projects to address crucial questions and thereby undermine the advancement of knowledge, says Gaffield.\n\nIn the Netherlands, where researchers in at least one university were sent the survey, Caspar van den Berg, president of the umbrella group Universities of the Netherlands, said the survey was an example of the deteriorating climate for the freedom of scientific practice in the United States — and that this is affecting Dutch universities and Dutch researchers. It “underlines the importance of all of us standing up for free science”, van den Berg said in the daily Dutch newspaper NRC.\n\nUniversity response\n\nThe survey has been forwarded to foreign researchers either from their research partners in the United States or directly from US government departments. Copies of the survey that have been shared online state that the document has been sent on the instruction of the US Office of Management and Budget, a large office in the executive branch of government, which oversees the federal budget.\n\nRuben Puylaert, spokesperson for Wageningen University & Research, confirmed in an e-mail to Nature that a researcher at Wageningen University & Research had received the questionnaire from the US Geological Survey. Thomson says that Australian researchers have also received the survey from the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of State. And the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich told Nature that it had also received the questionnaire. Markus Gross, a spokesperson for the institute, said it was consulting with other Swiss universities on how to respond.",

          "abstract": "An energy-efficient concert by the UK trip-hop band Massive Attack.Credit: Kristian Buus/Getty\n\nA battery-powered live outdoor concert headlined by the UK trip-hop band Massive Attack, and attended by more than 32,000 fans, slashed energy-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 98%, according to a report by climate researchers.\n\nHaving no diesel generator back-up helped organizers of the Act 1.5 event, held in Bristol, UK, last August, to achieve marked reductions in the on-site carbon emissions, alongside reductions associated with transport and food, the report adds.\n\nResearchers at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, UK, evaluated the event’s climate impact against the Super-Low Carbon Live Music road map, which was designed by centre director Carly McLachlan and her team at Tyndall in 2021.\n\nAct 1.5’s greenhouse-gas-emissions data were compared with a counterfactual show of the same size that used standard industry practices. Artists’ transport emissions were reduced by 73% because they shunned air travel in favour of lower-carbon alternatives such as coaches and ferries.\n\nUsing two trucks instead of four to transport equipment and switching from diesel to hydrotreated vegetable oil reduced fuel emissions by 70%.\n\nAlso, all of the meals sold at the event were vegan, delivering an 89% reduction in emissions.\n\nMcLachlan, who co-authored the report with Chris Jones, an environment researcher at Tyndall, attributed Act 1.5’s achievements to an ethos of collaboration and openness to doing things differently, alongside a respect for music-industry professionals with extensive experience.\n\n“Having unwavering commitment from multiple key actors in any sector or project is essential — so that when bumps in the road happen, there is a commitment to finding a super-low-carbon solution,” she adds.\n\nMatt Brennan, whose research at the University of Glasgow, UK, includes music sustainability and the climate crisis, says: “Part of the challenge for the live sector is the amount of cooperation between different actors — sometimes with competing interests — needed to really reduce emissions. It’s great to see that Act 1.5 not only saw ‘rivals’ collaborating, but also indications that seeds were sown for future collaboration.”\n\nCatherine Bottrill, the chief executive of Pilio, a net-zero and nature-innovation company based in London, commended the report for “bringing through the science and the evidence base to help support some better decision-making”. Speaking to Nature before Act 1.5 last year, McLachlan said: “If you suggest something, and people say, ‘Well that would never happen’, but then they can see it already has happened, it just unlocks a totally different way of thinking.”\n\nAct 1.5 provided incentives for audiences to choose low-carbon travel options, including VIP-bar wristbands for rail travellers and free electric shuttle bus tickets between stations and the venue, alongside offering a local pre-sale for people living in Bristol postcodes to minimize how far audience members travelled.",

In particular, he developed algebraic tools to solve tough problems such as differential equations, and he greatly extended the scope of the mathematical theory of symmetry known as representation theory. “He is a master in combining tools from geometry, algebra and analysis to obtain new insights and combinations,” says mathematician Helge Holden, who chairs the Abel Committee.\n\nHe is the first Japanese national — and the first person based outside North America, Europe or Israel — to win the prize, which is one of the highest honours for a mathematician. Kashiwara told Nature that he was surprised to find out he had won. “I was just asked to attend a Zoom meeting. I didn’t know what was the subject of the meeting,” he says.\n\nMathematical mastery\n\nKashiwara, 78, was born in Yuki, near Tokyo, and studied at the University of Tokyo and at Kyoto University. He has been at Kyoto University’s Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences (RIMS) since 1978.\n\nSome of his most celebrated work focuses on the theory of representations, which has its origins with the mathematical concept of a group — a set of symmetries such as all the possible rotations of a sphere. A representation of a group is how the group can act as a set of symmetries of another space, such as the space of all possible quantum states of a physical system. Representations of the group of rotations are what produces the familiar structure of a hydrogen atom’s electronic orbitals, for example.\n\nAbel Prize: pioneer of ‘smooth’ physics wins top maths award\n\n‘Classical’ representation theory emerged in the late 1800s and became a mature subject in the 1930s. Kashiwara and other mathematicians later developed broad generalizations of the theory, such as for infinite-dimensional groups and even for mathematical constructs that are not groups at all. Kashiwara’s work is so foundational that it has cast even the classical group representations in a new light, says Olivier Schiffmann, a mathematician at the University of Paris-Saclay who has co-authored papers with Kashiwara. “Anybody who’s done representation theory in the past 35 years has used some [of his] work.”\n\nIn particular, Kashiwara’s notion of a ‘crystal base’ has enabled mathematicians to interpret any representation as permutations on a finite set of objects — think of a deck of cards being shuffled. Previously, this was possible only for special types of classical groups.",

          "authors": "Abdullahi Tsanni",
          "abstract": "Changemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates people who fight racism in science and who champion inclusion. It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nOne of the world’s top hunters of hominid fossils, palaeoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie, appears on the Zoom screen from his home in Arizona, wearing a casual collared shirt. In the background is a photo of a field worker, silhouetted against the dimming blue sky, carrying a big sieve, an essential piece of equipment for excavating fossil remains.\n\nHaile-Selassie says he finds the image stunning. In some ways, it takes him back to his humble beginnings, working as a fossil hunter and support-staff member for foreign scientists. He describes how far he has come since then and why he is confronting the history of a field that is overshadowed by the long reach of colonialism, through which wealthy nations still swoop in and exploit the resources of poor countries. Speaking his mind, he addresses the elephant in the room.\n\n“A lot of the evidence that comes out of Africa informs us about our origins,” he says. He bridles at the exclusion of African researchers from many fossil discoveries made on the continent. Parachute science — the practice of Western scientists working in other nations without involving local researchers — still thrives in palaeontology, according a 2024 analysis of nearly 30,000 fossil discoveries published in Science. The study found that many palaeontology papers published in the preceding 34 years have no authors at all from the nations in which the fossils were unearthed.\n\nI want to ensure that Africans take part in the AI revolution\nBorn and raised in Adigrat, Ethiopia, Haile-Selassie studied history at Addis Ababa University. Later, he earned a PhD in integrative biology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2001. Now the director of theInstitute of Human Originsat Arizona State University (ASU) in Tempe, Haile-Selassie works to try to stop parachute science occurring in his home country. He calls for the decolonization of palaeoanthropology and radical, systemic change in who gets to tell the story of human origins, and how.\n\nHaile-Selassie is best known for scientific discoveries that upended strongly held beliefs about human evolution. He recovered and described MRD, a remarkably complete 3.8-million-year-old skull in the Afar Desert region of Ethiopia in 20161, after Afar worker Ali Bereino discovered the first part of the skull. The specimen belongs to a species known as Australopithecus anamensis and is the most complete skull of an early human ancestor found so far from the time period. Haile-Selassie’s work showed that, rather than being the direct, linear evolutionary ‘ancestor’ of Australopithecus afarensis (the species to which the fossil known as Lucy belongs), A. anamensis and A. afarensis co-existed for a time.\n\nShortly before heading to Ethiopia to undertake annual fieldwork, he spoke to Nature about why he fights for inclusion and how he plans to increase the number of African palaeoanthropologists.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a scientist?\n\nGoing out into the field helped me to develop a great passion. I got what we call ‘hominid fever’ when I didn’t find something right away, but someone else did. And, when you find these fossils, you’re told that it reshapes how we think about human evolution.\n\nPalaeoanthropology was also an opportunity for me to pursue my education. As a historian, I didn’t see an opportunity to go further in Ethiopia at the time. But working with palaeoanthropologists from other countries made me realize that I could further my studies and contribute to the discoveries from my country. In 2001, just before I finished my PhD, I published a paper in Nature, as the sole author2, naming a new species, one of the earliest human ancestors, Ardipithicus ramidus kadabba. That was a big start for my career. It shaped my vision of who I wanted to be — an active player in palaeoanthropology. Not a member of support staff, but someone who can find fossils, do the analysis and description themselves and publish their work on the world stage.\n\nWhy is inclusion work important to you?\n\nI have been asked by fellow Ethiopians, “Scientists are finding all these fossils from the Afar region of Ethiopia, but what are you doing to help train locals in palaeoanthropology?” Now, in my position at ASU, and considering the colonial legacy of our field, I want to make a difference. During the 50th anniversary celebration of Lucy’s discovery, last year, I felt it was a good opportunity to bring these issues into the limelight. We’re celebrating a fossil that was found in Africa, but we should go beyond celebrating the discoverer, Donald Johanson, a white American who founded the institute where I work. The one university in Afar, Samara University, does not have even a master’s programme in palaeoanthropology.\n\nPromoting palaeontology across Sudan\nSo some ASU colleagues and I took a group of scientists, friends and members of the institute’s board to Ethiopia. We visited several significant places, including the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa, the site where Lucy was discovered and Samara’s campus. The university honoured us and named its College of Social Science and Humanities building after Donald Johanson. When we got back, I had a lot of conversations about Samara University with ASU. Now, we are working on a memorandum of understanding between our universities to establish an online master’s programme in palaeoanthropology to train local scholars and build research capacity in the Afar region.\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to address decolonization in science?\n\nThe natural laboratories where we collect many of the fossils that are needed to understand our history are in Africa. But often, when you look at who is collecting and studying these fossils, contributing to the science and telling the story of our origins, you don’t find any Africans. You might find some Africans named in the acknowledgments or the list of participants, but most of these people are either fossil hunters or members of support staff who help to sieve samples in the field. Why can’t we have more Africans like me? Western researchers fly to Africa, get all the raw data, then take everything back to Europe and the United States to do all the analysis and publish the work, while all the Africans they work with in the field are not part of it. That’s unfair.\n\nSome people might say, “Oh, now there are Africans with PhDs in palaeoanthropology”. Well, that’s great, but it shouldn’t stop there. If we have the natural laboratories there, why can’t we also have the physical laboratories in Africa?\n\nHow have you dealt with racism or discrimination in your personal and professional life?",

          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "Two organizations representing faculty at Columbia University today filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the administration of US President Donald Trump's cancellation of US$400 million in research grants and contracts to the university. The lawsuit follows a controversial decision by university leaders to alter campus and academic policies in accordance with the government’s demands ― a move that many scientists and academics fear will encourage the federal government to ask for even more concessions from Columbia and other schools.\n\n“The Trump administration’s threats and coercion at Columbia are part of a clear authoritarian playbook meant to crush academic freedom and critical research in American higher education,” Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), a non-profit group in Washington DC that advocates for academic freedom, said in a statement. The AAUP filed the lawsuit with the American Federation of Teachers, a union based in Washington DC that represents university faculty members, among others.\n\n‘My career is over’: Columbia University scientists hit hard by Trump team’s cuts\n\nThe US Department of Education, one of the agencies named in the suit, did not respond before publication to a request for comment. Officials with the department and other agencies have justified the cancellations by saying that the university had failed to protect its Jewish students.\n\nAdministration officials said earlier this month that they would not negotiate with the university about government funding unless Columbia acceded to the administration’s ultimatums on an array of security, admissions and academic policies. In response, on 21 March, the university announced a range of measures, including restrictions on the wearing of face masks, new campus disciplinary rules and a review of Columbia’s Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies (MESAAS), which has become a flashpoint of controversy.\n\nSome scientists who have lost funding nonetheless have misgivings about the university’s efforts to cooperate with the administration. Others argue that the university’s acquiescence will embolden an administration that has sought to exert control over academic institutions by withholding funding mandated by Congress. It should have been Columbia, not organizations representing faculty, filing the lawsuit against the administration today, says Sheldon Pollock, who twice chaired MESAAS and is now retired.\n\n“This is a real-time experiment in how totalitarianism inserts itself into a democratic society,” Pollack says. “I do not feel that that is an exaggeration.”\n\nThe White House declined to address these and other allegations in this story.\n\nList of conditions\n\nThe administration alleges that Columbia failed in its obligations under the US Civil Rights Act to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. That war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.\n\nIn a letter issued on 13 March, the administration laid out nine conditions that Columbia must meet to start negotiations over funding. Most of the conditions focused on security and disciplinary measures, but the administration also waded into academic affairs by demanding that MESAAS be placed under ‘academic receivership’.\n\n‘All this is in crisis’: US universities curtail staff, spending as Trump cuts take hold\n\nReceivership is a relatively rare action used to relieve members of a department of control and bring in new leadership. MESAAS has been the subject of particular controversy since one of its faculty members, Joseph Massad, described Hamas’s attack on Israel as a “stunning victory of the Palestinian resistance”.\n\nAn analysis posted online by a group of Columbia law professors says that the cancellation of grants is illegal under the Civil Rights Act, which lays out specific procedures for handling alleged violations, including “an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing”. The analysis adds that the law stipulates that any penalties be applied to the programme in question, not to unrelated programmes at the same academic institution.\n\nThe Department of Education declined to answer questions from Nature, but spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement that the Trump team “followed all applicable law in holding Columbia University to account for the lawless antisemitism that it allowed to occur on its campus”.\n\nPolitics at play\n\nOn 21 March, Columbia University’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, released a conciliatory response that laid out a suite of relevant actions the university has already taken, as well as further commitments to bolster security, foster “intellectual diversity” and review admissions policies to ensure that they are “unbiased”.\n\nOne provision in particular has caught the eye of academics: a plan to appoint a new senior vice-provost with broad powers to review academic programmes focused on specific geographic regions, “starting immediately with the Middle East” and including MESAAS. Critics fear that the university is surrendering to political demands and putting long-standing principles of self-governance by faculty members at risk.",

And US scientists who are not citizens are weighing their own travel plans, fearful that, if they leave the country, they will not be allowed to return.\n\n“The anxiety is palpable,” says Jonathan Grode, a managing partner at the immigration law firm Green and Spiegel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Grode is fielding at least 20 calls a day from clients who ask whether it is safe for them to travel.\n\nHigh-profile cases\n\nThe pressure has been building for months as the second administration of US President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise to toughen border security, takes shape.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nMany scientists have been alarmed by several incidents involving academics in the past month. In one, a kidney-transplant specialist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, was deported to Lebanon after trying to re-enter the United States with a valid visa. It was later reported that pictures on her phone had linked her with Hezbollah, which US authorities consider a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nIn another, US border officials detained and ejected a French scientist who was travelling to a scientific conference near Houston, Texas, earlier this month. The French government says that he was expelled after border officials searched his personal devices and found messages expressing a “personal opinion” on US research policy. The US Department of Homeland Security says that the scientist had confidential information from a US national laboratory on his devices, “in violation of a non-disclosure agreement” and that “any claim that his removal was based on political beliefs is blatantly false”.\n\nThe researcher is a planetary scientist who has worked with NASA on Mars science, multiple sources confirmed to Nature. He did not attend the conference.\n\n‘Exhausted and insulted’: how harsh visa-application policies are hobbling global research\n\nAndrea Liu, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, was “shocked” to hear of the French scientist’s experience. “It makes me think that if you really want to come and visit to do science, be on the safe side — bring a burner phone and empty laptop so this doesn’t happen to you.”\n\nUS border officials have the right to search the phones and laptops of anyone entering the country, even citizens, says Carolina Regales, an attorney at Klasko Immigration Law Partners in Philadelphia. Since 2019, applicants for visas to the United States must also submit their social-media usernames, although messages on those accounts have rarely been used to deny entry in the past, she says.\n\nGrode says that most travellers to the United States need not fear. Despite a handful of high-profile cases, hundreds of thousands of people enter the United States each month and have continued to do so smoothly, he says.\n\nBut if someone’s record is not pristine, Grode advises extra caution. A previous overstayed visa or encounter with the law, even if seemingly minor, could pose a problem in the current administration, which is “being as strict as possible”, he says.\n\nSafety concerns\n\nConcerns over travel are particularly heightened for researchers who feel targeted by the Trump administration’s opposition to transgender rights; diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes; and specific subjects of research, such as climate change and misinformation. A geophysicist in Canada, who spoke to Nature on the condition of anonymity for her safety, is now re-evaluating a planned trip to the United States in May to meet with collaborators and conduct fieldwork. The researcher, who is a transgender woman, says that she doesn’t know what information US border authorities have on her from previous visits to the country, when she had identification documents under a different name.\n\n‘All this is in crisis’: US universities curtail staff, spending as Trump cuts take hold\n\n“It seems like in the current political environment, any kind of irregularities or discrepancies are being seized on for immediate action,” she says.",

Academic institutions are responding to the administration of US President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting campaign with hiring freezes, travel restrictions and moratoria on pay raises. At least one US university has shed staff, and other campuses are contemplating lay-offs and furloughs.\n\nThe number of schools and programmes known to have restricted graduate-student admissions continues to rise. The administration is threatening even more extensive cuts, leading some scholars to fear for the future of the US academic system, which relies on federal funding to finance everything from graduate students’ stipends to building maintenance and utility bills.\n\n“The academic model on which the universities relied to conduct their research, to fund their students, to fund postgraduate students — all this is in crisis, because a lot of it, in some way, was funded through federal grants,” says Aseem Prakash, a political scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “This is a massive shock.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment before the time of publication.\n\nAbrupt change\n\nThe administration has choked off multiple revenue streams to universities. The US National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies have terminated research grants and halted review of new grant applications. Universities could also face steep cuts to federal income for indirect expenses — money that is used to run research facilities — and hikes in taxes on endowments.\n\nDozens of campuses face even harsher restrictions. The US Department of Education has announced that 60 US institutions of higher education are under investigation for potentially antisemitic harassment and discrimination. The department cited demonstrations that began on many campuses after Israel invaded Gaza in 2023 in response to attacks by Hamas.\n\nProtests over Israel–Hamas war have torn US universities apart: what’s next?\n\nThe administration has already cancelled US$400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University in New York City “due to the school’s continued inaction to protect Jewish students from discrimination”, according to an official statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, news outlets reported that the administration had put on hold $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, over its support for transgender athletes. A spokesperson for the university said that its policies on student participation in athletic teams comply with those of national athletic bodies.\n\n“The speed and scope of the assault from the federal government is entirely novel,” says Daniel Greene, an information scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park.\n\nSour job market\n\nIn response to the funding cuts and worries about the future, hiring freezes for all staff and faculty have been announced at institutions such as the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. Other schools, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, and the University of Pennsylvania, have frozen hiring mainly for non-faculty positions.\n\nMoney-saving measures at universities include calling off pay raises and job promotions, and directives to avoid non-essential travel and training. Spending has been frozen on conferences, food and events — “the types of things to bring people together, which hurts morale even more in many ways”, says Jevin West, a computational scientist at the University of Washington. Universities are pausing spending on memberships, dues and subscriptions, and some are reviewing spending on new buildings and renovations.\n\nThe University of Washington is restricting researchers from spending grant funding until the money has been delivered. “That’s a big deal,” says West. “Having that eliminated really slows the research process.”\n\nChoking off the pipeline\n\nA substantial number of universities are limiting graduate-student admissions. Many departments at MIT have admitted fewer graduates this year. West Virginia University’s Health Sciences Office of Research and Graduate Education in Morgantown rescinded offers to students who had not yet returned acceptance letters. And a few dozen applicants to UMass Chan Medical School’s Morningside Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in Worcester, Massachusetts, were told in early March that their provisional offers of acceptance had been rescinded.\n\nHarvard’s graduate school in Cambridge will reject all applicants on its waiting list, according to an e-mail sent to faculty members from the school’s dean, Hopi Hoekstra. “Given the situation in Washington DC, I don’t know what else the university can do,” says Michael Desai, co-director of graduate studies at Harvard’s Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. Still, he says, the policy is “hitting hard at the pipeline of scientific talent in the US”.",

          "abstract": "The integration of embodied cognition and cognitive load theory offers a promising framework for advancing educational practices. Cognitive load theory emphasizes the constraints of working memory and the importance of managing cognitive load through effective instructional design. Embodied cognition highlights the role of physical actions, such as gestures, object manipulation and whole-body activities, in enhancing cognitive processes. This Review highlights the importance of bridging these frameworks by exploring their theoretical foundations and synthesizing empirical evidence on the benefits of physical actions in learning. Here we present the introduction of the relevance–integration taxonomy as a transformative advancement in embodied cognition research, offering new perspectives for educational interventions. Additionally, we identify current gaps in cognitive load theory applications and propose future research directions to unify these approaches, aiming to optimize learning outcomes across diverse educational settings. This work has broad implications for advancing evidence-based instructional design.",

We then discuss recent findings in genomics research in light of the hypothesis that SES is a dynamic social construct that involves genetically influenced traits that help in achieving or retaining a socio-economic position, and can affect the distribution of genes associated with such traits. Social stratification results in people with differing traits being sorted into strata with different environmental exposures, which can result in evolutionary selection pressures through differences in mortality, reproduction and non-random mating.

          "abstract": "The human brain is characterized by idiosyncratic patterns of spontaneous thought, rendering each brain uniquely identifiable from its neural activity. However, deep general anaesthesia suppresses subjective experience. Does it also suppress what makes each brain unique? Here we used functional MRI scans acquired under the effects of the general anaesthetics sevoflurane and propofol to determine whether anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness diminishes the uniqueness of the human brain, both with respect to the brains of other individuals and the brains of another species. Using functional connectivity, we report that under anaesthesia individual brains become less self-similar and less distinguishable from each other. Loss of distinctiveness is highly organized: it co-localizes with the archetypal sensory–association axis, correlating with genetic and morphometric markers of phylogenetic differences between humans and other primates. This effect is more evident at greater anaesthetic depths, reproducible across sevoflurane and propofol and reversed upon recovery. Providing convergent evidence, we show that anaesthesia shifts the functional connectivity of the human brain closer to the functional connectivity of the macaque brain in a low-dimensional space. Finally, anaesthesia diminishes the match between spontaneous brain activity and cognitive brain patterns aggregated from the Neurosynth meta-analytic engine. Collectively, the present results reveal that anaesthetized human brains are not only less distinguishable from each other, but also less distinguishable from the brains of other primates, with specifically human-expanded regions being the most affected by anaesthesia.",

          "abstract": "In response to the alarming recent decline in US math achievement, we conducted a national megastudy in which 140,461 elementary school teachers who collectively taught 2,992,027 students were randomly assigned to receive a variety of behaviorally informed email nudges aimed at improving students’ progress in math. Specifically, we partnered with the nonprofit educational platform Zearn Math to compare the impact of 15 different interventions with a reminder-only megastudy control condition. All 16 conditions entailed weekly emails delivered to teachers over 4-wk in the fall of 2021. The best-performing intervention, which encouraged teachers to log into Zearn Math for an updated report on how their students were doing that week, produced a 5.06% increase in students’ math progress (3.30% after accounting for the winner’s curse). In exploratory analyses, teachers who received any behaviorally informed email nudge (vs. a reminder-only megastudy control) saw their students’ math progress boosted by an average of 1.89% during the 4-wk intervention period; emails referencing personalized data (i.e., classroom-specific statistics) outperformed emails that did not by 2.26%. While small in size, these intervention effects were consistent across school socioeconomic status and school type (public, private, etc.) and, further, persisted in the 8-wk post-intervention period. Collectively, these findings underscore both how difficult it is to change behavior and the need for large-scale, rigorous, empirical research of the sort undertaken in this megastudy.",

          "abstract": "When talking to other people, we naturally form impressions based not only on what they say but also on how they say it—e.g., how confident they sound. In modern life, however, the sounds of voices are often determined not only by intrinsic qualities (such as vocal anatomy) but also by extrinsic properties (such as videoconferencing microphone quality). Here, we show that such superficial auditory properties can have surprisingly deep consequences for higher-level social judgments. Listeners heard short narrated passages (e.g., from job application essays) and then made various judgments about the speakers. Critically, the recordings were modified to simulate different microphone qualities, while carefully equating listeners’ comprehension of the words. Though the manipulations carried no implications about the speakers themselves, common disfluent auditory signals (as in “tinny” speech) led to decreased judgments of intelligence, hireability, credibility, and romantic desirability. These effects were robust across speaker gender and accent, and they occurred for both human and clearly artificial (computer-synthesized) speech. Thus, just as judgments from written text are influenced by factors such as font fluency, judgments from speech are not only based on its content but also biased by the superficial vehicle through which it is delivered. Such effects may become more relevant as daily communication via videoconferencing becomes increasingly widespread.",

          "authors": "Stylianos Syropoulos, Gregg Sparkman",
          "abstract": "Religious leaders shape the attitudes and beliefs of their congregations. In a nationally representative sample of U.S. religious leaders ( N = 1,600), the majority of which were of a Christian faith, we find that nearly 90% believe in anthropogenic climate change to some degree. From this 90%, a total of 60% believe humans play a major role and an additional 30% believe they play a role, but a more minor one. Yet roughly half have never discussed it with their congregation, and only a quarter have mentioned it more than once or twice. In a sample of Christian Americans representative of the proportions of major national denominations ( N = 987), we find that Christians underestimate the prevalence of their leaders who believe in climate change by 39 to 45 percentage points. Conversely, having a religious leader who talks about climate change predicts greater willingness to discuss it with fellow churchgoers and attend climate events. In an experimental intervention on another sample matching major Christian American denomination ( N = 959), we find that providing the actual consensus level of religious leaders’ belief in climate change reduces congregants’ misperception of religious leaders, increases their perception that other church members believe in and are open to discussing climate change, and leads Christians to believe that taking climate action is consistent with their church’s values while voting for politicians who will not take climate action is not.",

          "abstract": "Information search platforms, from Google to AI-assisted search engines, have transformed information access but may fail to promote a shared factual foundation. We demonstrate that the combination of users’ prior beliefs influencing their search terms and the narrow scope of search algorithms can limit belief updating from search. We test this “narrow search effect” across 21 studies (14 preregistered) using various topics (e.g., health, financial, societal, political) and platforms (e.g., Google, ChatGPT, AI-powered Bing, our custom-designed search engine and AI chatbot interfaces). We then test user-based and algorithm-based interventions to counter the “narrow search effect” and promote belief updating. Studies 1 to 5 show that users’ prior beliefs influence the direction of the search terms, thereby generating narrow search results that limit belief updating. This effect persists across various domains (e.g., beliefs related to coronavirus, nuclear energy, gas prices, crime rates, bitcoin, caffeine, and general food or beverage health concerns; Studies 1a to 1b, 2a to 2g, 3, 4), platforms (e.g., Google—Studies 1a to 1b, 2a to 2g, 4, 5; ChatGPT, Study 3), and extends to consequential choices (Study 5). Studies 6 and 7 demonstrate the limited efficacy of prompting users to correct for the impact of narrow searches on their beliefs themselves. Using our custom-designed search engine and AI chatbot interfaces, Studies 8 and 9 show that modifying algorithms to provide broader results can encourage belief updating. These findings highlight the need for a behaviorally informed approach to the design of search algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is intricately influencing the accumulation of neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) in human food webs, potentially leading to uneven exposure risks across regions. Here, we reveal that climate change will elevate MeHg risks in China, with implications for regional inequalities in Asia through a climate-mercury-food-health nexus. Using a compiled fish mercury dataset from 13,000 samples and machine learning, we find that freshwater wild fish—an essential component of the Asian diet—is an underappreciated MeHg source. Specifically, MeHg concentrations in freshwater wild fish are 2.9 to 6.2 times higher than in freshwater farmed fish and 1.7 times higher than in marine wild fish. Individual climate factors influence MeHg accumulation differently, while their combined effects significantly increase MeHg concentrations in freshwater wild fish. Under SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 by 2031 to 2060, national average MeHg concentrations in freshwater wild fish are projected to increase by about 60%, adding a maximum annual economic loss of US$18 million (2022 USD) from intelligence quotient decrements in Chinese newborns. This loss may vary regionally within China and among Asian countries, disproportionately affecting less developed areas. Coordinating climate action with mercury emission reduction strategies could mitigate these overlooked regional risks, reduce regional inequalities in food safety, and ultimately contribute to sustainable development.",

Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm and extend the cryo-EM findings. The ARF6 lattice exhibits features that are distinct from those formed by other membrane-bending proteins. We identify protein contacts critical for lattice assembly and how membrane insertion results in constricted tubules. The lattice structure also enables docking by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) to achieve vesiculation. We have also modeled ARF1 onto the ARF6 lattice, and then pursued vesicle reconstitution by the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex to further confirm that the ARF lattice acts in vesicle fission. By elucidating how an ARF protein tubulates membrane at the structural level, we have advanced the molecular understanding of how this class of transport factors promote the fission stage of vesicle formation.",

          "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) are constantly exposed to hemodynamic forces, which play a crucial role in regulating EC functions. Pulsatile laminar shear stress (PS), representing atheroprotective flow, maintains the anti-inflammation and homeostatic phenotype of ECs, but the comprehensive mechanism underlying the PS-repression of inflammatory genes remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated the role of chromatin organization in mediating the effects of PS on inflammatory gene expression in ECs. We demonstrated that PS induced the expression of histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 to promote heterochromatin formation via H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) enrichment, a hallmark gene repression mechanism. SUV39H1 interacts with lamin-associated proteins and facilitates the perinuclear localization of the H3K9me3-enrichment. Silencing the lamin-associated protein emerin (EMD) not only led to the reductions of cytoskeletal F-actin formation and perinuclear H3K9me3 enrichment; but also the impairment of PS-induced SUV39H1 expression, H3K9me3 enrichment at E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 loci to revert their PS-repressed expression. Hence, EMD acts as a hub to transmit mechanical cues from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus and recruits SUV39H1, which regulate nuclear organization, chromatin state, and gene expression. These results accentuate the critical role of nuclear architecture in mechanotransduction and EC responses to mechanical stimuli.",

          "abstract": "α-hydroxy acids (αHAs), simple and prebiotically plausible organic monomers, were likely present in various environments on and off Earth and could have played a role in directing the emergence of the first homochiral living systems. Some αHAs, which could have been of varying chirality, can undergo dehydration polymerization into polyesters, which could assemble into membraneless microdroplets upon rehydration; understanding these processes is critical for unraveling how simple prebiotic molecules transitioned into more complex systems capable of supporting selective chemical reactions, a key step toward the origin of life. Here, we focused on tartaric acid (TA), a prebiotically relevant αHA with multiple chiral forms, to probe plausible mechanisms by which primitive αHA and polyester-based systems could have participated in selective homochiral polymer synthesis. Enantiopure solutions of d -TA or l -TA polymerize efficiently via dehydration, while racemic dl -TA polymerization is inhibited due to stereochemical incompatibility. We found that Ca 2+ ions influence this process in two significant ways: 1) regulating TA monomer availability through selective crystallization, removing equal amounts of both enantiomers in racemic proportion and thereby enriching the enantiomeric excess of the remaining nonracemic TA solution; and 2) modulating polymerization by suppressing enantiopure TA polymerization while enabling dl -TA polymerization. These findings suggest that the differential availability of simple inorganic ions, such as Ca 2+ , could have indirectly mediated the selection of simple organic chiral monomers and the emergence of homochirality in primitive protocell-forming polymers, offering a pathway from nonliving to living matter in early Earth environments.",

Arkani-Hamed and Trnka conjectured that each way of iterating the BCFW recurrence gives a “triangulation” or “tiling” of the m=4 amplituhedron. In this article, we prove the BCFW tiling conjecture of Arkani-Hamed and Trnka. We also prove the cluster adjacency conjecture for BCFW tiles of the amplituhedron, which says that facets of tiles are cut out by collections of compatible cluster variables for the Grassmannian Gr4,n. Moreover we show that each BCFW tile is the subset of the Grassmannian where certain cluster variables have particular signs.",

In this study, we investigated two KS domains in a eukaryotic microalgal DHA synthase, KS A and KS B , which show low similarities to those of prokaryotic marine enzymes, together with almost all the acyl-ACP intermediates. C6-, C12-, and C18-ACPs were exclusively accepted by KS A while KS B utilized C-8. C14- and C20-ACPs. In contrast, both KS A and KS B showed activities against C2-, C4-, and C10-ACPs.

          "abstract": "Desiccation-tolerant cyanobacteria are able to survive frequent cycles of hydration and dehydration, which are closely linked to diurnal light oscillations. Previous studies have shown that light serves as a crucial anticipatory cue, activating desert cyanobacteria to prepare for desiccation. However, the mechanisms underlying their light-coupled desiccation tolerance remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that red-light-induced photosynthetic genes are positively regulated by a LuxR family transcription factor NfSrr1. We further identified the cyanobacteriochrome NfPixJ as interacting with NfSrr1 and functioning as a red light sensor. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the red-light signaling module NfPixJ-NfSrr1 plays a key role in preparing cyanobacteria for desiccation tolerance. This module also regulates the synthesis of protective compatible solutes, suggesting that red light functions as a global regulatory signal for the broader stress response. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the presence of this red-light signaling pathway, mediated by NfPixJ-NfSrr1 module, correlates with the ability of cyanobacteria to thrive in water-deficit habitats. Overall, our findings uncover a red-light signaling pathway that enhances desiccation tolerance as desert cyanobacteria encounter red light at dawn, before water limitation. These results provide insights into the mechanisms behind light-induced anticipatory stress tolerance in photosynthetic organisms.",

          "abstract": "Plant hydraulic dysfunction by embolism formation can impair photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction and, in severe cases, lead to death. Embolism reversal, or “refilling,” is a hypothesized adaptive process in which xylem functionality is rapidly and sustainably restored. This study investigated xylem embolism refilling during recovery from severe drought stress using entirely noninvasive measurements of the same plants. These results were considered in relation to functional traits to address long-standing gaps in understanding the consequences of severe drought stress. Leaf and stem xylem embolism as well as transpiration, photosynthesis, and stem water potential were characterized nondestructively on intact barnyard grass plants during an acute drought event. Plants were rewatered and returned to growth conditions for 10 d, during which time recovery of stem xylem embolism and transpiration were monitored. Leaf xylem embolism and declines in leaf gas exchange occurred mostly between −1.0 MPa and −2.0 MPa, whereas stem xylem embolism occurred mostly between −3.0 MPa and −4.0 MPa. In all measured plants, which included embolism levels up to 88%, stem xylem embolism reversed completely within 24 h after rewatering, and this refilling supported recovery of transpiration and growth after plants were returned to growth conditions. This study provides direct evidence of complete and functional stem xylem refilling. These results present a clear need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and the adaptive significance of this phenomenon as well as its prevalence in nature.",

          "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) carries out the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) along the luminal surface of capillaries. LPL activity is regulated by the angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, ANGPTL8), which control the delivery of TRL-derived lipid nutrients to tissues in a temporal and spatial fashion. This regulation of LPL mediates the partitioning of lipid delivery to adipose tissue and striated muscle according to nutritional status. A complex between ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 (ANGPTL3/8) inhibits LPL activity in oxidative tissues, but its mode of action has remained unknown. Here, we used biophysical techniques to define how ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3 interact with LPL and how they drive LPL inactivation. We demonstrate, by mass photometry, that ANGPTL3/8 is a heterotrimer with a 2:1 ANGPTL3:ANGPTL8 stoichiometry and that ANGPTL3 is a homotrimer. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies revealed that ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3 use the proximal portion of their N-terminal α-helices to interact with sequences surrounding the catalytic pocket in LPL. That binding event triggers unfolding of LPL’s α/β -hydrolase domain and irreversible loss of LPL catalytic activity. The binding of LPL to its endothelial transporter protein (GPIHBP1) or to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans protects LPL from unfolding and inactivation, particularly against the unfolding triggered by ANGPTL3. Pulse-labeling HDX-MS studies revealed that ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3 catalyze LPL unfolding in an ATP-independent fashion, which categorizes these LPL inhibitors as atypical unfoldases. The catalytic nature of LPL unfolding by ANGPTL3/8 explains why low plasma concentrations of ANGPTL3/8 are effective in inhibiting a molar excess of LPL in capillaries.",

          "abstract": "The Twomey effect brightens clouds by increasing aerosol concentrations, which activates more droplets and decreases cloud supersaturation in response to more competition for water vapor. To quantify this competition response, we used marine low cloud observations in clean and smoky conditions at Ascension Island in the tropical South Atlantic during the Layered Aerosol Smoke Interactions with Cloud (LASIC) campaign. These observations show similar increases in droplet number for increased accumulation-mode particles from surface-based and satellite cloud retrievals, demonstrating the importance of below-cloud aerosol measurements for retrieving aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI) in clean and smoky aerosol conditions. Four methods for estimating cloud supersaturation from aerosol–cloud measurements were compared, with cloud scene-based and parcel-based methods showing sufficient variability for a strong dependence on both aerosol accumulation number concentration and cloud-base updraft velocities. Decomposing aerosol-related changes in cloud albedo and optical depth shows the calculated competition response accounts for dampening the activation response by 12 to 35%, explaining the diminished Twomey effect at high aerosol concentrations observed for smoky conditions at LASIC and previously around the world. This result was consistent for independent supersaturation retrievals by cloud scene-based droplet number and cloud condensation nuclei and parcel-based multimode size-resolving Lagrangian methods. Translating aerosol effects to local radiative forcing with clean conditions as a proxy for preindustrial and smoky conditions for present-day showed that the competition response reduces cooling from the Twomey radiative forcing by 12 to 35%, providing an essential process-specific constraint for improving the representation of aerosol competition in climate model simulation of indirect aerosol forcing.",

Emerging evidence suggests these lipid second messengers may be present in membranes beyond the plasma membrane, yet their spatial regulation within other membrane compartments is not well understood. To dissect the spatial regulation of specific 3-PI species, we developed genetically encodable biosensors with selectivity for PIP 3 or PI(3,4)P 2 . Using these biosensors, we showed that PIP 3 significantly accumulated at the lysosome upon growth factor stimulation, in contrast to the conventional view that PIP 3 is exclusively present in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we showed that lysosomal PIP 3 originates from the plasma membrane and relies on dynamin-dependent endocytosis for lipid internalization. Thus, PIP 3 can exploit dynamic trafficking pathways to access subcellular compartments and regulate signaling in a spatially selective manner.",

We found that zebrafish larvae would respond to predator-like visual stimuli with immobility and bradycardia, both hallmarks of freezing, in a head-fixed behavioral paradigm. We then imaged the zebrafish visual system while larvae responded to different visual stimuli with hunting, freezing, and escape behaviors and systematically identified visually driven neurons and behaviorally correlated sensorimotor neurons. Our analyses indicate that within the optic tectum, broadly tuned sensory neurons are functionally correlated with sensorimotor neurons which respond specifically during one behavior, indicating that it contains suitable information for sensorimotor transformation. We also identified sensorimotor neurons in four other areas downstream of the tectum, and these neurons are also specific for one behavior, indicating that the segregation of the pathways continues in other areas. While our findings shed light on how sensorimotor neurons may integrate visual inputs, further investigation will be required to determine how sensorimotor neurons in different regions interact and where the decision to behave is made.",

          "abstract": "Designing the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) is critical for stable, fast-charging, low-temperature Li-ion batteries. Fostering a “fluorinated interphase,” SEI enriched with LiF, has become a popular design strategy. Although LiF possesses low Li-ion conductivity, many studies have reported favorable battery performance with fluorinated SEIs. Such a contradiction suggests that optimizing SEI must extend beyond chemical composition design to consider spatial distributions of different chemical species. In this work, we demonstrate that the impact of a fluorinated SEI on battery performance should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Sufficiently passivating the anode surface without impeding Li-ion transport is key. We reveal that a fluorinated SEI containing excessive and dense LiF severely impedes Li-ion transport. In contrast, a fluorinated SEI with well-dispersed LiF (i.e., small LiF aggregates well mixed with other SEI components) is advantageous, presumably due to the enhanced Li-ion transport across heterointerfaces between LiF and other SEI components. An electrolyte, 1 M LiPF 6 in 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2MeTHF), yields a fluorinated SEI with dispersed LiF. This electrolyte allows anodes of graphite, μSi/graphite composite, and pure Si to all deliver a stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% and excellent rate capability at low temperatures. Pouch cells containing layered cathodes also demonstrate impressive cycling stability over 1,000 cycles and exceptional rate capability down to −20 °C. Through experiments and theoretical modeling, we have identified a balanced SEI-based approach that achieves stable, fast-charging, low-temperature Li-ion batteries.",

Herein, we report a strategy to evolve a protease for the programmed degradation of α-Synuclein, a presynaptic protein closely linked to Parkinson’s disease. Our structure-guided evolution campaign uses the protease from botulinum neurotoxin and showcases the stepwise change of specificity from its native substrate SNAP25 to the selective degradation of α-Synuclein. The protease’s selectivity is further demonstrated in human cells where near complete degradation of overexpressed human α-Synuclein is observed with no significant effects on cell proliferation. This stepwise strategy may serve as a general approach to evolve highly selective proteases targeting dysregulated proteins.",

          "abstract": "Mass extinctions are rare but catastrophic events that profoundly disrupt biodiversity. Widely accepted consequences of mass extinctions, such as biodiversity loss and the appearance of temporary “disaster taxa,” imply that species–area relationships (SARs, or how biodiversity scales with area) should change dramatically across these events: Specifically, both the slope (the rate of accumulation of new species with increasing area) and intercept (the density of species at local scales) of the power–law relationship should decrease. However, these hypotheses have not been tested, and the contribution of variation in the SAR to diversity dynamics in deep time has been neglected. We use fossil data to quantify nested SARs in North American terrestrial tetrapods through the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction (Campanian–Ypresian). We show that SARs vary substantially through time and among groups. In the pre-extinction interval (Maastrichtian), unusually shallow SAR slopes (indicating low beta diversity or provinciality) drive low total regional diversity in dinosaurs, mammals, and other tetrapods. In the immediate postextinction interval (Danian), the explosive diversification of mammals drove high regional diversity via a large increase in SAR slope (indicating higher beta diversity or provinciality), and only a limited increase in SAR intercept. This contradicts the expectation that postextinction biotas should be regionally homogenized by the spread of disaster taxa and impoverished by diversity loss. This early postextinction increase in SAR slope was followed in the Thanetian–Selandian ( ∼ 4.4. myr later) by increases in the intercept, indicating that diversity dynamics at local and regional scales did not change in synchrony.",

Remarkably, these trajectories had remained unobserved in the population despite nearly five decades of monitoring. Our results indicate substantial among-trajectory heterogeneity in growth, senescence, life history trade-offs, fitness, and contributions to population growth. Some trajectories suggest the presence of life history trade-offs while others include silver spoon effects, leading to heterogenous life-history outputs. Then, we show that mother identity and year of birth are relatively good predictors of heterogeneity, indicating that individual trajectories could be largely set during early life. Critically, our results demonstrate that heterogeneity in life-history trajectories can be inconspicuous, yet substantial and structured across multiple traits within a population. Uncovering and understanding this heterogeneity in other wild populations will be key to advancing our knowledge of ecoevolutionary processes across populations and species.",

Various motor proteins with different properties are essential for spindle self-organization. The minimal set of components required to organize dynamic microtubules into a bipolar network remains however unknown. Here, we use computer simulations to explore whether two types of microtubule-crosslinking motors with opposite directionality can organize dynamic microtubules into bipolar spindles in three-dimensional space around a local microtubule nucleation source. We find that two motors are indeed sufficient, provided their properties resemble the main human spindle motors kinesin-5 and dynein, revealing the core mechanism of spindle self-organization. It is based on the synergistic interplay of a slow plus-directed symmetric motor and a fast minus-directed asymmetric motor. A hypothetical symmetric minus-directed motor can also support spindle formation together with kinesin-5, but only in a limited and unphysiological parameter range. In agreement with its accessory role in human cells, a minus motor with human kinesin-14 properties does not assemble stable bipolar spindles together with kinesin-5. These results reveal fundamental principles for the self-organization of dynamic bipolar microtubule architectures and highlight how distinct molecular designs of mitotic motors are optimized for their task.",

Here, we optimize IAV inoculation to enhance replication in the nasal turbinate (NT) and study local B cell immunity.

NT GC contributes to local tissue-resident B cell generation and enhances local antibody production. Furthermore, URT-focused immunization also induces significant GC formation in the NT.

          "abstract": "During fetal stage, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergo rapid proliferation with a tight control of genomic stability. Although histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation has been reported to stabilize the genome in proliferating cells, its specific role in HSPC development remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat protein 5 (Wdr5)-mediated H3K4 methylation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability of proliferating HSPCs in zebrafish embryos. Loss of wdr5 led to a severe reduction of HSPC pool in the caudal hematopoietic tissue, accompanied with attenuated H3K4 methylation level and evident p53 -dependent apoptosis in the HSPCs. Mechanistically, Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation maintains genomic stability by inhibiting the formation of abnormal R-loops in the HSPCs, whereas accumulation of R-loops exacerbates DNA damage. Moreover, the absence of H3K4 trimethylation leads to an inactivated DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, which is deleterious to DNA damage repair and genomic stability. Subsequently, we found that DDR-associated genes, mutL homolog 1 and breast and ovarian cancer interacting helicase 1 , are important to ensure HSPC survival, likely by stabilizing their genome. In summary, these findings reveal that Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation is essential for HSPC development through tight control of R-loop accumulation and DDR-associated program to ensure genomic stability and survival of proliferating HSPCs.",

The diode effect is evidenced by pronounced rectification and photogalvanic effects under electromagnetic modulation and radiation at radio frequency. Our experimental results and modeling suggest that these prominent effects are intimately tied to the spatially inhomogeneous formation of topological surface states (TSS) at the intermediate temperature. This work provides a manner of breaking the mirror symmetry (in addition to the inversion symmetry), resulting in the formation of pn -junctions between puddles of metallic TSS.

          "abstract": "Macrocyclic peptides have emerged as promising drug candidates, filling the gap between small molecules and large biomolecules in drug discovery. The antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) is crucial for numerous cancers, yet it presents challenges for selective targeting by traditional inhibitors. In this study, we identified a macrocyclic peptide, 5L1, that strongly binds to MCL1, with a dissociation constant ( K D ) of 7.1 nM. This peptide shows the potential to specifically inhibit the function of MCL1, and demonstrates effective antitumor activity against several blood tumor cell lines with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values for cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated 5L1 in the range of 0.6 to 3 μM. Structural analysis revealed that it functions similarly to molecular glue, capable of binding to two MCL1 molecules simultaneously and inducing their homodimerization. This unique mechanism of action distinguishes it from traditional small-molecule MCL1 inhibitors, underscoring the potential of macrocyclic peptides functioning as molecular glues. Moreover, it inspires the development of highly selective inhibitors targeting MCL1 and other related targets with this glue-like mechanism.",

UTe 2 , which was found to feature an exceedingly large upper critical field and striking reentrant behavior at low temperatures, is widely believed to possess a spin-triplet pairing symmetry. However, unambiguous evidence for such a pairing symmetry is still lacking, especially at zero and low magnetic fields. The presence of an inversion crystalline symmetry in UTe 2 requires that, if it is indeed a spin-triplet superconductor, the order parameter must be of odd parity. We report here phase-sensitive measurements of the symmetry of the orbital part of the order parameter using the Josephson effect. The selection rule in the orientation dependence of the Josephson coupling between In, an s -wave superconductor, and UTe 2 suggests strongly that UTe 2 possesses the odd-parity pairing state of B 1 u symmetry near zero magnetic field, making it a spin-triplet superconductor. We also report the apparent formation of Andreev surface bound states on the (1−10) surface of UTe 2 .",

          "abstract": "Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been achieved in various cytomimetic (protocell) models, but controlling molecular condensation using noninert crowders to systematically alter protocell function remains challenging. Intracellular ATP levels influence protein–protein interactions, and dysregulation of ATP can alter cellular crowding dynamics, thereby disrupting the normal formation or dissolution of condensates. Here, we develop a membranized protocell model capable of endogenous LLPS and liquid–gel-like phase separation through precise manipulation of intermolecular interactions within semipermeable polysaccharide-based microcapsules (polysaccharidosomes, P-somes), prepared using microtemplate-guided assembly. We demonstrate that intraprotocellular diffusion-mediated LLPS can be extended into the liquid–gel-like domain by the uptake of the biologically active crowder ATP, resulting in a range of modalities dependent on the fine-tuning of molecular condensation. Endogenous enzyme activity in these crowded polysaccharidosomes is enhanced compared to free enzymes in solution, though this enhancement diminishes at higher levels of intraprotocellular condensation. Additionally, increased molecular crowding inhibits intraprotocell DNA strand displacement reactions. Our findings introduce an expedient and optimized approach to the batch construction of membranized protocell models with controllable molecular crowding and functional diversity. Our mix–incubate–wash protocol for inducing endogenous LLPS in membranized protocells offers potential applications in microreactor technology, environmental sensing, and the delivery and sustained release of therapeutics.",

We analyzed de novo mutations (DNMs) and very rare transmitted/unphased damaging variants in 248 prespecified genes in 11,555 CHD probands. The results identified 60 genes with a significant burden of heterozygous damaging variants. Variants in these genes accounted for CHD in 10.1% of probands with similar contributions from de novo and transmitted variants in parent–offspring trios that showed incomplete penetrance. DNMs in these genes accounted for 58% of the signal from DNMs. Thirty-three genes were linked to a single CHD subtype while 12 genes were associated with 2 to 4 subtypes. Seven genes were only associated with isolated CHD, while 37 were associated with 1 or more extracardiac abnormalities. Genes selectively expressed in the cardiomyocyte lineage were associated with isolated CHD, while those widely expressed in the brain were also associated with neurodevelopmental delay (NDD). Missense variants introducing or removing cysteines in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of NOTCH1 were enriched in tetralogy of Fallot and conotruncal defects, unlike the broader CHD spectrum seen with loss of function variants. Transmitted damaging missense variants in MYH6 were enriched in multiple CHD phenotypes and account for ~1% of all probands. Probands with characteristic mutations causing syndromic CHD were frequently not diagnosed clinically, often due to missing cardinal phenotypes. CHD genes that were positively or negatively associated with development of NDD suggest clinical value of genetic testing. These findings expand the understanding of CHD genetics and support the use of molecular diagnostics in CHD.",

When the crowd is isotropic—comprising individuals moving in all different directions—the collective motion is disordered. In contrast, if it is possible to identify two dominant directions of motion, for example in a corridor, the crowd spontaneously organizes into contraflowing lanes or stripes. In this article, we characterize the physics of the transition between these two distinct phases by using a synergy of theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and stylized experiments. We develop a hydrodynamic theory for collisional flows of heterogeneous populations, and we analyze the stability of the disordered configuration. We identify an order–disorder transition occurring as population heterogeneity exceeds a theoretical threshold determined by the collision avoidance maneuvers of the crowd. Our prediction for the onset of pedestrian ordering is consistent with results of agent-based simulations and controlled experiments with human crowds.",

Phase separation is mediated by multivalent interactions of macromolecules including intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDRs). Despite considerable advances in experiments, theory, and simulations, the prediction of the thermodynamics of IDR phase behavior remains challenging. We combined coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and active learning to develop a fast and accurate machine learning model to predict the free energy and saturation concentration for phase separation directly from sequence. We validate the model using computational and previously measured experimental data, as well as new experimental data for six proteins. We apply our model to all 27,663 IDRs of chain length up to 800 residues in the human proteome and find that 1,420 of these (5%) are predicted to undergo homotypic phase separation with transfer free energies &lt; −2 k B T . We use our model to understand the relationship between single-chain compaction and phase separation and find that changes from charge- to hydrophobicity-mediated interactions can break the symmetry between intra- and intermolecular interactions. We also provide proof of principle for how the model can be used in force field refinement. Our work refines and quantifies the established rules governing the connection between sequence features and phase-separation propensities, and our prediction models will be useful for interpreting and designing cellular experiments on the role of phase separation, and for the design of IDRs with specific phase-separation propensities.",

On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure t-J model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of doping ( δ = 0.1 to 0.2 ), hosts robust d-wave superconductivity possibly coexisting with weak unidirectional pair density wave. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping t 2 suppresses pair and charge density waves, resulting in a uniform d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems.

Interestingly, much of this strategy carries over to the Euler equations in Euclidean space, leading to the weaker result that there exist analytic steady solutions on T 3 such that the only analytic steady Euler flows in a C 1 -neighborhood must belong to a certain linear space of dimension six. For comparison, note that in any C k -neighborhood of a shear flow, there are infinitely many linearly independent analytic shears.",

The knowledge about the genetic and molecular mechanisms that govern seed size is crucial for improving crop yield. Here, we report that the Mediator subunit OsMED23 associates with the histone demethylase OsJMJ703 and the transcription factor OsWOX3A to control grain size and weight in rice. Loss of function of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 causes narrow and light grains, while overexpression of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 results in large and heavy grains. OsMED23 physically interacts with OsJMJ703 and the transcription factor OsWOX3A. OsMED23, OsJMJ703, and OsWOX3A associate with the common promoter regions of two key grain size genes GW2 and OsLAC and repress their transcription by influencing H3K4me3 levels. Field trials demonstrate that overexpression of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 can significantly increase grain yield. Therefore, our findings identify a mechanism by which the transcriptional repressor complex OsJMJ703-OsMED23-OsWOX3A determines grain size and weight by regulating gene expression and influencing H3K4me3 levels in rice, suggesting that this pathway has a great potential for improving grain yield in key crops.",

          "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are closely related mosquito-borne neurotropic flaviviruses that share common transmission cycle and can infect humans. However, while human infections by WNV are widespread, infections by USUV are comparatively less frequent, less severe, and currently limited to Africa and Europe. To identify human host factors that contribute to the pathogenic signatures of these two flaviviruses, we carried out an arrayed expression screen of over 1,300 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several ISGs known to target flaviviruses, including IFI6, SHFL, and RTP4 were among the strongest hits. Interestingly, we also found MITD1, an ISG with no previously reported antiviral activity, among the strongest hits. We demonstrated that the antiviral activity of MITD1 was not limited to USUV and WNV, since it also inhibited Zika and dengue virus replication. We found MITD1 to interfere with viral RNA replication by sequestering specific endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) proteins involved in the formation of viral replication factories. MITD1 expression was not increased by type I interferon (IFN-I) in most human cells and mouse tissues that we examined, although WNV and USUV replication was strongly inhibited by IFN-I. Strikingly, MITD1 was induced in the brain of USUV-infected mice and importantly, in human monocyte-derived microglia. Using human microglial-like cells, we confirmed that MITD1 is an essential mediator of the anti-flavivirus activity of IFN-I in these cells. We conclude that MITD1 plays a key role in the cellular defenses against neurotropic flaviviruses.",

In this study, we present an electrochemical nanodevice based on a θ-nanopipette designed to coanalyze calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) at a single mitochondrion and its surrounding cytosol, thereby enhancing our understanding of their trafficking within the signaling pathways of cellular autophagy. Two independent nanosensors integrated within the channels of the θ-nanopipette spatially isolate a single target mitochondrion from the cytosol and simultaneously measure the release of Ca 2+ and ROS with high spatial–temporal resolution. Dynamic tracking reveals the direct trafficking of lysosomal Ca 2+ to the mitochondrion rather than to the cytosol, which triggers ROS-induced ROS release within the mitochondria. Furthermore, highly temporal and concurrent observations revealed a second burst of Ca 2+ in both the mitochondrion and the cytosol, which is not consistent with the change in ROS. These dynamic data elucidate the potential role of a beneficial feedback loop between the Ca 2+ signaling pathway and the subsequent generation of mitochondrial ROS in ML-SA-induced autophagy. More importantly, this innovative platform facilitates detailed profiling of the molecular interactions between trafficking molecules within the mitochondria and the adjacent cytosolic environment, which is hardly realized using the current superresolution optical microscopy.",

In particular, SWCNT fluorescence quenching induced by biopolymer dispersants facilitates flexible design of molecular nanosensors, yet challenges remain in analyte selectivity and lack of rational design strategies. A sought-after alternative to haphazard molecular modulation of SWCNT-based fluorescence is to couple the movement of a quencher to the SWCNT surface, enabling fluorescence energy transfer to modulate molecular recognition with high selectivity. This study presents the rational design of SWCNT-based nanosensors with fluorescence energy transfer, leveraging the unique properties of methylene blue (MB) proximity–mediated fluorescence quenching. MB-SWCNT-based nanosensors exhibit 1- stability in redox environments and 2- analyte-specific displacement-driven fluorescence modulation. By designing hybridization-induced displacement of MB-conjugated ssDNA from the SWCNT surface, we calculate that SWCNT fluorescence modulation can occur within a 6.8 nm fluorescence resonance energy transfer distance from the SWCNT surface and develop a robust and versatile platform to synthesize oligonucleotide nanosensors with tunable Δ F / F 0 of up to 150%. Building upon this strategy, we developed four distinct nanosensors capable of selectively detecting tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) viral RNA fragments, which successfully differentiated TMV-infected plants from mock controls. Finally, we demonstrate the potential expansion of our design to target a wider scope of biomolecules using the biotin-avidin system as a model. Taken together, our study presents a generalizable platform that enables rational engineering of SWCNT NIR fluorescence intensity through MB distance-dependent fluorescence energy transfer, overcoming the intrinsic selectivity challenges of current SWCNT nanosensors.",

We hypothesized that MMP activity induces immediate mechanical alterations in the ECM, which are subsequently detected by cells. We observed that both fibrillar collagen and synthetic degradable matrices exhibit enhanced stress relaxation following MMP exposure. Cells responded to these variations in relaxation by modulating their spreading and focal adhesions.

In healthy mice, the circadian clock factor BMAL1 is required for skeletal muscle function and metabolism. However, the importance of muscle BMAL1 in the development of metabolic diseases, such as diet-induced obesity (DIO), remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that skeletal muscle–specific BMAL1-deficient mice exhibit worsened glucose tolerance upon high-fat diet feeding, despite no evidence of increased weight gain. Metabolite profiling from Bmal1 -deficient muscles revealed impaired glucose utilization specifically at early steps in glycolysis that dictate the switch between anabolic and catabolic glucose fate. We provide evidence that this is due to abnormal control of the nutrient stress–responsive hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Genetic HIF1α stabilization in muscle Bmal1 -deficient mice restores glucose tolerance and expression of 217/736 dysregulated genes during DIO, including glycolytic enzymes. Together, these data indicate that during DIO, skeletal muscle BMAL1 is an important regulator of HIF-driven glycolysis and metabolic flexibility, which influences the development of high-fat-diet-induced glucose intolerance.",

Yet there is large individual variation in attentional capacity and response to MP. It is unclear whether this variation is driven by individual differences in relative density of dopamine receptor subtypes, magnitude of dopamine increases induced by MP, or both. Here, we extensively characterized the brain dopamine system with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (including striatal dopamine D1 and D2/3 receptor availability and MP-induced dopamine increases) and measured attention task-evoked fMRI brain activity in two separate sessions (placebo and 60 mg oral MP; single-blind, counterbalanced) in 37 healthy adults. A network of lateral frontoparietal and visual cortices was sensitive to increasing attentional (and working memory) load, whose activity positively correlated with performance across individuals (partial r = 0.474, P = 0.008; controlling for age). MP-induced change in activity within this network correlated with MP-induced change in performance (partial r = 0.686, P &lt; 0.001). The ratio of D1-to-D2/3 receptors in dorsomedial caudate positively correlated with baseline attentional network activity and negatively correlated with MP-induced changes in activity (all pFWE &lt; 0.02). MP-induced changes in attentional load network activity mediated the association between D1-to-D2/3 ratio and MP-induced improvements in performance (mediation estimate = 23.20 [95%CI: −153.67 −81.79], P = 0.004). MP attention-boosting effects were not linked to the magnitude of striatal dopamine increases, but rather showed dependence on an individual’s baseline receptor density.

          "abstract": "Silicon-induced responses play a key role in plant defense against herbivory, though the underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. In this study, we examined how mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) affect tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) defense against an invasive and highly destructive lepidopteran herbivore, the tomato pinworm (TPW), Phthorimaea absoluta . In tomato plants supplemented with MSN, prior exposure to TPW oviposition shifted subsequent egg-laying from a preference for leaves to an even distribution between stems and leaves. This shift was not observed in nonsilicon-supplemented plants. Prolonged oviposition triggered pigmentation in the basal cells of type I glandular trichomes on the stems of silicon-supplemented plants. Chemical analysis by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the pigmented trichome was rich in soluble sugars (sucrose and l -arabinose) and waxes, dominated by the saturated hydrocarbon tetracosane. Bioassays with the crude extract of the pigmented trichome and a three-component sugar–wax blend replicated the oviposition and caterpillar response observed with the pigmented trichome, while individual components produced variable effects. While l -arabinose alone replicated the oviposition effects of the three-component sugar–wax blend, sucrose increased oviposition and caterpillar feeding and survival, while l -arabinose and tetracosane caused the highest caterpillar mortality. Additionally, these treatments altered caterpillar gut microbiota composition and influenced frass volatiles, which attracted the TPW natural enemies, Nesidiocoris tenuis (predator) and Neochrysocharis formosa (parasitoid). Our findings suggest that silicon supplementation increases tomato defense against TPW through oviposition-induced responses, which promotes recruitment of natural enemies.",

          "abstract": "Glucose is the preferred carbon source of most studied microorganisms. However, we now report that glucose loses preferred status when the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium experiences cytoplasmic magnesium (Mg 2+ ) starvation. We establish that this infection-relevant stress drastically reduces synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the allosteric activator of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), master regulator of carbon utilization. The resulting reduction in cAMP concentration, which is independent of carbon source, decreases transcription of CRP-cAMP-activated carbon utilization genes, hinders carbon source uptake, and restricts metabolism, rendering wild-type bacteria phenotypically CRP − . A cAMP-independent allele of CRP overcame the transcriptional, uptake, and metabolic restrictions caused by cytoplasmic Mg 2+ starvation and significantly increased transcription of the glucose uptake gene when S. Typhimurium was inside murine macrophages. The reduced preference for glucose exhibited by S. Typhimurium inside macrophages reflects that transcription of the glucose uptake gene requires higher amounts of active CRP-cAMP than transcription of uptake genes for preferred carbon sources, such as gluconate and glycerol. By reducing CRP-cAMP activity, low cytoplasmic Mg 2+ alters carbon source preference, adjusting metabolism and growth.",

This study uses a high-density, genome-wide CRISPR interference screen to examine the influence of gene-specific transcriptional variation on the growth of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 under environmental extremes. Surprisingly, many partial knockdowns enhanced fitness under cold monochromatic conditions. Transcriptional repression of genes for core subunits of the NDH-1 complex, which are important for photosynthesis and carbon uptake, improved growth rates under both red and blue light but at distinct, color-specific optima. Most genes with fitness-improving knockdowns were distinct to each light color, and dual-target transcriptional repression produced nonadditive effects. Findings reveal diverse routes to improved acclimation in cyanobacteria (e.g., attenuation of genes involved in CO 2 uptake, light harvesting, translation, and purine metabolism) and provide an approach for using gradients in sgRNA activity to pinpoint biochemically influential transcriptional changes in cells.",

In this study, advanced Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations were used to investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of peptide bond formation at air–water interfaces using diglycine, the simplest dipeptide, as a model molecule. The results show that peptide bonds can be rapidly formed via a unique isomerization-then-OH − -elimination pathway. In this mechanism, the diglycine initially isomerizes into its acidic form at the air–water interface, followed by a reaction that releases an OH − anion rather than the previously hypothesized H 2 O. The free-energy barriers for the interfacial pathway with the assistance of an interfacial electric field are much lower than those in the gas phase by &gt;25 kcal/mol. Further calculations suggest that this mechanism can be extended to the formation of some larger peptides, such as tetraglycine.

Here, we introduce a synthetic model designed to measure friction forces between biomimetic membranes and substrates. The model consists of a vesicle with precisely controlled properties, fabricated via microfluidics, encapsulating a single ferromagnetic particle that is magnetically driven to rotate. The rotation of the particle generates a confined rotational flow, setting the vesicle membrane into motion. By adjusting the magnetic field frequency and vesicle size, the rotation frequency of the vesicle can be finely controlled, resulting in a rolling vesicle that functions as an effective tribological tool across a wide frequency range. At low frequencies, molecular contact between the membrane and substrate dominates frictional interactions, which enables determination of the contact friction coefficient. At higher frequencies, lubrication becomes predominant, causing the vesicles to slip rather than roll. Adjusting membrane fluidity and incorporating specific ligand–receptor interactions within this model will enable detailed studies of frictional forces in more complex biomimetic systems, providing key insights into the mechanisms of cell movement and mechanotransduction.",

Different from the mitochondrial and bacterial enzymes, F 1 F O from photosynthetic organisms have evolved diverse structural and mechanistic details to adapt to the light-dependent reactions. Although complete structure of chloroplast F 1 F O has been reported, no high-resolution structure of an F 1 F O from photosynthetic bacteria has been available. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of an intact and functionally competent F 1 F O from Chloroflexus aurantiacus ( Ca F 1 F O ), a filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium from the earliest branch of photosynthetic organisms. The structures of Ca F 1 F O in its ADP-free and ADP-bound forms for three rotational states reveal a previously unrecognized architecture of ATP synthases. A pair of peripheral stalks connect to the Ca F 1 head through a dimer of δ-subunits, and associate with two membrane-embedded a-subunits that are asymmetrically positioned outside and clamp Ca F O ’s c 10 -ring. The two a-subunits constitute two proton inlets on the periplasmic side and two proton outlets on the cytoplasmic side, endowing Ca F 1 F O with unique proton translocation pathways that allow more protons being translocated relative to single a-subunit F 1 F O . Our findings deepen understanding of the architecture and proton translocation mechanisms of F 1 F O synthases and suggest innovative strategies for modulating their activities by altering the number of a-subunit.",

Choanocyte chambers can possess scores or even hundreds of such cells, which drive complex flows entering through porous walls and exiting into the sponge channels. One of the mysteries of the choanocyte chamber is its spherical shape, as it seems inappropriate for inducing directional transport since many choanocyte flagella beat in opposition to such a flow. Here, we combine direct imaging of choanocyte chambers in living sponges with computational studies of many-flagella models to understand the connection between chamber architecture and directional flow. We find that those flagella that beat against the flow play a key role in raising the pressure inside the choanocyte chamber, with the result that the flow rate and mechanical pumping efficiency reach a maximum at a small outlet opening angle. Comparison between experimental observations and the results of numerical simulations reveal that the chamber diameter, flagellar wave number, and the outlet opening angle of the freshwater sponge Ephydatia muelleri , as well as several other species, are related in a manner that maximizes the mechanical pumping functions. These results indicate the subtle balances at play during morphogenesis of choanocyte chambers, and give insights into the physiology and body design of sponges.",

          "abstract": "Diapause, a developmental arrest mechanism, helps animals to survive seasonal changes via endocrine regulation. While obligate diapause is genetically programmed, facultative diapause is typically triggered by environmental cues such as photoperiod. In insects, this often leads to reproductive diapause characterized by reduced juvenile hormone (JH) signaling, resulting in ovarian arrest and lipid accumulation. However, the molecular link between photoperiod and hormonal control remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi as our model system. This species exhibits a photoperiodic response, where short-day (SD) conditions promote reproduction, whereas long-day (LD) conditions induce diapause. Our research identified the PBAP chromatin remodeling complex as a key regulator of LD-induced summer diapause entry. Through RNAi screening of 56 transcriptional regulators that were differentially expressed between SD and LD females, we identified BAP170, a PBAP-specific component, as a key mediator of diapause. Knockdown of bap170 in SD females induced reproductive diapause traits, which were reversed by treatment with methoprene, a JH analog, suggesting that the PBAP complex regulates diapause by influencing JH production. We further demonstrated that the PBAP complex modulates JH biosynthesis via SET1/COMPASS-mediated trimethylation of H3K4. Transcriptome analysis and a second RNAi screen identified calmodulin , a calcium-binding messenger protein gene, as a direct target of PBAP-SET1/COMPASS-H3K4me3 signaling in the corpora allata (CA), the primary source of JH. These findings reveal how the chromatin remodeling machinery translates photoperiod signals into endocrine responses governing seasonal adaptation.",

We apply this measure to all vetted mitigation scenarios assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report and two scenarios that model current policies and pledges, using an illustrative equal per capita allocation of a remaining 1.5 °C carbon budget starting in 1990. The resulting regional carbon debt estimates inform i) the scale and pace of regional carbon drawdown obligations necessary to address budget exceedance and ii) relative regional responsibilities for increased lifetime exposure to extreme heatwaves across age cohorts due to budget exceedance.

Combination antimicrobial therapies may be an important strategy to overcome resistance and broaden the spectrum of existing antibiotics.

Here, we deployed a high-throughput combinatorial screening platform, DropArray, to evaluate the interactions of over 30,000 compounds with up to 22 antibiotics and 6 strains of gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, totaling to over 1.3 million unique strain-antibiotic-compound combinations. In this dataset, compounds more frequently exhibited synergy with known antibiotics than single-agent activity. We identified a compound, P2-56, and developed a more potent analog, P2-56-3, which potentiated rifampin (RIF) against antibiotic-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae . Using phenotypic assays, we showed P2-56-3 disrupts the outer membrane of A. baumannii . To identify pathways involved in the mechanism of synergy between P2-56-3 and RIF, we performed genetic screens in A. baumannii . CRISPRi-induced partial depletion of lipooligosaccharide transport genes ( lptA - D , lptFG ) resulted in hypersensitivity to P2-56-3/RIF treatment, demonstrating the genetic dependency of P2-56-3 activity and RIF sensitization on lpt genes in A. baumannii. Consistent with outer membrane homeostasis being an important determinant of P2-56-3/RIF tolerance, knockout of maintenance of lipid asymmetry complex genes and overexpression of certain resistance-nodulation-division efflux pumps—a phenotype associated with multidrug-resistance—resulted in hypersensitivity to P2-56-3. These findings demonstrate the immense scale of phenotypic antibiotic combination screens using DropArray and the potential for such approaches to discover new small molecule synergies against multidrug-resistant ESKAPE strains.",

Here, we report that FBXW7 expression is gradually downregulated in CAFs during the progression of human pancreatic and lung cancers. Mechanically, FBXW7 inhibits histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (KMT2) methyltransferase activity via retinoblastoma binding protein 5 (RbBP5) binding, whereas FBXW7 depletion abrogates the binding to activate KMT2, leading to increased H3K4 methylations and global upregulation of gene expression. Activation of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway triggers the secretion of cytokines and chemokines to promote migration, invasion, and sphere formation of lung cancer cells. Coinjection of Fbxw7-depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts with cancer cells enhances in vivo tumor growth, demonstrating a paracrine effect. Hypoxia downregulates CAF FBXW7 via ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) to increase H3K4 methylation, whereas conditioned media from hypoxia-exposed CAFs promotes migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, highlighting FBXW7’s tumor-suppressing role through KMT2 inactivation.",

TREM2 is a receptor that activates microglia, which are crucial for clearing myelin debris and promoting remyelination. Previous studies in a mouse model of demyelination induced by the copper-chelating agent Cuprizone (CPZ) have shown that stimulation of TREM2 with a monoclonal antibody reduces demyelination, while deleting the Trem2 gene in mice impairs remyelination. Here, we blocked TREM2 function acutely with an antibody during both the demyelination and remyelination phases of the CPZ model and analyzed the impact of the antibody treatment on myelination and gene expression in single cells. We found that blocking TREM2 depleted a distinct population of microglia with high expression of the transcription factor MAFB during remyelination. The loss of these MAFB-high microglia was linked to impaired generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Importantly, we identified MAFB + microglia in acute and acute-chronic brain lesions from individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), but not in inactive lesions. We conclude that TREM2 is essential for maintaining a population of MAFB-high microglia that is associated with myelin repair. This finding has significant implications for understanding demyelinating diseases like MS and suggests that stimulating TREM2 could be a promising therapeutic approach for myelin repair.",

          "abstract": "Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells and organisms is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a nonequilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial motility in spatially structured environments impacts a variety of natural and engineering processes. Constructing models to predict, control, and design bacterial motility for these processes remains challenging because bacteria and active swimmers have complex interactions with surfaces and because the precise environment geometry is unknown. Here, we present a method for deriving bacterial diffusion coefficients in disordered media in terms of cell and environmental parameters. The approach abstracts the dynamics in the full geometry to “surface states,” which encode how cells interact with surfaces in the environment. Then, a long-time diffusion equation can be derived analytically from the state model. Applying this method to a run-and-tumble particle in a 2D Lorentz gas environment provides analytical predictions that show good agreement with particle simulations. Like past studies, we observe that the diffusivity depends nonmonotonically on the cell’s run length. Using the analytical expressions, we derive the optimal run length, revealing an intuitive dependence on environmental length scales. Furthermore, we find that rescaling length and time by the average distance and time between trap events collapses all of the diffusivities onto a single curve, which we derive analytically. Thus, our approach extracts interpretable, macroscopic diffusive behavior from complex microscopic dynamics, and provides tools and intuitions for understanding bacterial diffusion in disordered media.",

Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a pivotal role in circuit organization and present prime candidates for orchestrating remodeling of neural connections in response to drug exposure. However, the contribution of CAMs to opioid-induced rewiring of the reward circuit has not been explored. Here, we used unbiased molecular profiling to identify CAMs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) modulated by morphine administration. We found that opioid exposure induces the expression of ELFN1, a CAM selectively expressed in cholinergic interneurons in the NAc. We determined that ELFN1 acts trans-synaptically to modulate the strength and plasticity of the glutamatergic inputs onto cholinergic neurons via the recruitment of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4). Disruption of Elfn1 diminished morphine reward and intake in self-administering mice. Together, our findings identify a key molecular factor responsible for adjusting the strength of opioid effects by modulating the configuration of striatal circuitry in an experience-dependent fashion and unveil potential therapeutic target for combating opioid abuse.",

Impaired TYK2 signaling within the central nervous system (CNS) may impart the protective effects of TYK2 P1104A allele in MS. We deployed brain-penetrant TYK2 inhibitors (cTYK2i) alongside the peripherally restricted TYK2 inhibitor (pTYK2i; BMS-986165) to untangle the contributions of central TYK2 inhibition in diverse models of neuroinflammation. While pTYK2i had little impact, cTYK2i reduced clinical score, lymphoid cell infiltration, and cytokines/chemokines in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Microglial activation was attenuated in cTYK2i-treated EAE spinal cords and circulating neurofilament light (NfL) was reduced in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Additionally, cTYK2i was protective in an antibody-mediated mouse model of primary progressive MS (PPMS). Finally, we demonstrate TYK2 inhibition has a robust impact on a unique subset of activated astrocytes termed Interferon-Responsive-Reactive-Astrocytes (IRRA).

This first, taxonomically diverse assessment for mainland North America north of Mexico reveals that 22.6% (20.6 to 29.6%) of the 1,579 species in the best-studied vertebrate and insect pollinator groups have elevated risk of extinction. All three pollinating bat species are at risk and bees are the insect group most at risk (best estimate, 34.7% of 472 species assessed, range 30.3 to 43.0%). Substantial numbers of butterflies (19.5% of 632 species, range 19.1 to 21.0%) and moths (16.1% of 142 species, range 15.5 to 19.0%) are also at risk, with flower flies (14.7% of 295 species, range 11.5 to 32.9%), beetles (12.5% of 18 species, range 11.1 to 22.2%), and hummingbirds (0% of 17 species) more secure. At-risk pollinators are concentrated where diversity is highest, in the southwestern United States. Threats to pollinators vary geographically: climate change in the West and North, agriculture in the Great Plains, and pollution, agriculture, and urban development in the East. Woodland, shrubland/chaparral, and grassland habitats support the greatest numbers of at-risk pollinators. Strategies for improving pollinator habitat are increasingly available, and this study identifies species, habitats, and threats most in need of conservation actions at state, provincial, territorial, national, and continental levels.",

          "abstract": "Biodiversity hotspots in Earth’s mountain ranges suggest a strong connection between topographic development and biological processes. However, it remains unclear whether high biodiversity in mountain ranges is an evolutionary response to the rate of relief generation during mountain building. Focusing on small mammals, such as rodents, we used coupled landscape-biological simulations to show that biodiversity increases with the magnitude and rate of tectonic uplift. This relationship, visible in depositional lowlands over millions of years, underscores the considerable role of mountain building in shaping past and present terrestrial biodiversity. Our results provide insights into the influence of topographic changes on evolutionary processes, offering a potential link between mountain formation and paleodiversity records.",

We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia.",

          "abstract": "For cells to polarize collectively along a tissue plane, asymmetrically localized planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes must form intercellular contacts between neighboring cells. Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.",

Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species.

          "abstract": "Despite advances in theory and experiments, how biodiversity influences the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems remains debated. By applying new theory to data on 84,695 plant, animal, and protist assemblages, we show that the general positive effect of species richness on stocks of biomass, as well as much of the variation in the strength and sign of this effect, is predicted by a fundamental macroecological quantity: the scaling of species abundance with body mass. Standing biomass increases with richness when large-bodied species are numerically rare but is independent of richness when species size and abundance are uncoupled. These results suggest a new fundamental law in the structure of ecological communities and show that the impacts of changes in species richness on biomass are predictable.",

          "abstract": "Volcanism on the Moon has produced surface basalt deposits, which record lunar interior processes. The Chang’e-6 mission retrieved samples from the South Pole–Aitken basin (SPA) on the Moon’s far side. We analyzed basalt fragments collected by Chang’e-6 and found that their composition resembles that of low-titanium basalts previously sampled by the Apollo missions. Uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating indicated a basalt age of 2823.0 ± 5.9 million years and a source 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio (μ-value) of 480 ± 56. This high μ-value indicates that the source contained materials that formed during the late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. The results are consistent with the LMO model, but the Chang’e-6 basalt deviates from the trend in Apollo mission samples of younger basalts having higher μ-values. We suggest that this indicates post-LMO modification of the mantle by the SPA impact.",

          "abstract": "On 3 October 2023, a multihazard cascade in the Sikkim Himalaya, India, was triggered by 14.7 million cubic meters of frozen lateral moraine collapsing into South Lhonak Lake. The impact generated an ~20-meter tsunami-like impact wave, which breached the moraine and drained ~50 million cubic meters of the lake’s water. The ensuing glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) eroded ~270 million cubic meters of sediment, which overwhelmed infrastructure, including hydropower installations along the Teesta River. The physical scale and human and economic impacts of this event prompt urgent reflection on the role of climate change and human activities in exacerbating such disasters. Insights into multihazard evolution are pivotal for informing policy development, enhancing early warning systems (EWS), and spurring paradigm shifts in GLOF risk management strategies in the Himalaya and other mountain environments.",

Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a self-assembly growth mechanism resulted from the intertube van der Waals attraction and the ultralow sliding friction of SWNTs on the atomically flat hBN substrate. Field-effect transistors constructed from the grown SWNT array exhibit high performance at room temperature, with mobilities of up to 2000 square centimeters per volt per second, on/off ratios of ~10 7 , and a maximum current density of ~6 milliamperes per micrometer.",

We defined the basis of this selectivity using mice in which T reg cells reactive to a single prostate-specific self-peptide were selectively depleted. We found that self-peptide–specific T reg cells were dispensable for the control of T conv cells of matched specificity at homeostasis. However, they were required to control such T conv cells and prevent autoimmunity toward the prostate after exposure to elevated self-peptide during infection. Notably, the T reg cell response to self-peptide did not affect protective T conv cell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide. Thus, self-peptide–specific T reg cells promoted self-nonself discrimination during infection by selectively controlling T conv cells of shared self-specificity.",

          "abstract": "Visual attention and object recognition are two critical cognitive functions that shape our perception of the world. While these neural processes converge in the temporal cortex, the nature of their interactions remains largely unclear. Here, we systematically investigated the interplay between visual attention and stimulus feature coding by training macaques to perform a free-gaze visual search task with natural stimuli. Recording from a large number of units across multiple brain areas, we found that units exhibiting visual feature coding showed stronger attentional modulation of responses and spike–local field potential coherence than units without feature coding. Across brain areas, attention directed toward search targets enhanced the neuronal pattern separation of stimuli, with this enhancement more pronounced for units encoding visual features. Together, our results suggest a complex interplay between visual feature and attention coding in the primate brain, likely driven by interactions between brain areas engaged in these processes.",

In this work, we achieve nanosecond-pulsed electroluminescence (EL) from a solution-processed fast-response quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED). By modeling the QLED with a resistor-capacitor equivalent circuit and analyzing the transient current of the circuit, the dynamic of the carrier injection and transport process that fundamentally affects the transient EL of QLED is revealed, which helps to guide the optimization of fast-response QLED. Driven by a high current source, the optimized QLED can output stable and repeatable ultrashort EL with a pulse duration of 20 nanoseconds, a repetition rate of 50 kilohertz, and a high radiant exitance of 5.4 watts per square centimeter. Enabled by the nanosecond-pulsed EL, the developed QLED can be directly used as an instantaneous excitation source for time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Meanwhile, its use as an exposure flash for high-speed imaging is also demonstrated.",

This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler’s ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out-of-equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to d -dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path toward the study of competitive events in complex media.",

          "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that monazite-type materials are excellent candidates for nuclear waste forms, and hence, their facile synthesis is of great importance for the needed sequestration of existing nuclear waste. The synthesis of monazite, LaPO 4 , requires inconveniently high temperatures near 1000°C and generally involves the conversion of the presynthesized rhabdophane, LaPO 4 •nH 2 O, to the LaPO 4 monazite phase. During this structure transformation, the rhabdophane converts irreversibly to the thermodynamically stable monoclinic monazite structure. A low-temperature (185° to 260°C) mild hydrothermal acid-promoted synthesis of monazite is described that can both transform presynthesized rhabdophane or assemble reagents to the monoclinic monazite structure.

However, dysfunction and impairment of sensory nerves, accompanied by excessive inflammation impede tissue regeneration. Consequently, specific induction of sensory innervation to mediate immunoregulation becomes a promising therapeutic approach. Herein, we developed a cell/drug-free strategy to selectively boost endogenous sensory innervation to harness immune responses for promoting tissue rehabilitation. Specifically, a dual-functional phage was constructed with a sensory nerve–homing peptide and a β-subunit of nerve growth factor (β-NGF)–binding peptide. These double-displayed phages captured endogenic β-NGF and localized to sensory nerves to promote sensory innervation. Furthermore, regarding bone regeneration, phage-loaded hydrogels achieved rapid sensory nerve ingrowth in bone defect areas. Mechanistically, sensory neurotization facilitated M2 polarization of macrophages through the Sema3A/XIAP/PAX6 pathway, thus decreasing the M1/M2 ratio to induce the dissipation of local inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight the essential role of sensory innervation in manipulating inflammation and provide a conceptual framework based on neuroimmune interactions for promoting tissue regeneration.",

          "abstract": "In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (T regs ) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes T regs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD + with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing T regs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral T regs , sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD + axis disrupts T regs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.",

We report RBness as a pan-cancer phenomenon, associated with patient outcome and chemotherapy response in multiple cancer types, and predictive of CDK4/6 inhibitor response in estrogen-positive breast cancer. Using RNA interference and a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in isogenic models, we find that RBness cancers also phenocopy synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cells with RB1 genomic defects.

To address the limitations of M2 macrophage transplantation, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating Mms6 mRNA targeting macrophages ( Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs). The targeting efficiency and therapeutic effect of these LNPs in SCI mice were evaluated. Intravenous administration of Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs delivered more Mms6 mRNAs to lesion-site macrophages than those in the Mms6 mRNA-LNP group, which resulted in enhancing motor function recovery, reducing lesion area and scar formation, and promoting neuronal survival and nerve fiber repair. These effects were nullified when macrophages were depleted. These findings suggest that macrophage-targeted delivery of Mms6 mRNA is a promising therapeutic strategy for promoting spinal cord repair and motor function recovery in patients with traumatic SCI.",

We demonstrate that the metabolism of the paradigmatic medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid leads to a metabolic shift toward the SOG and methionine pathways. PHGDH plays a role in both the forward direction, contributing to the production of S-adenosylmethionine, and the reverse direction, generating the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to epigenomic reprogramming and phenotypic plasticity. The methionine cycle is closely linked to the transsulfuration pathway. Consequently, we observe that the shift increases the antioxidant glutathione, which mitigates reactive oxygen species (ROS), enabling survival of a subset of cells that have undergone DNA damage.

          "abstract": "Malaria, one of the most serious infectious diseases worldwide, is caused by the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites through repeated cycles of intraerythrocytic development. The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 in Plasmodium berghei (PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption of pbsip2 resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN 4–6 GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites.",

Notably, the signal component linear in the FM magnetization agrees excellently with the shape of the incident terahertz electric field at 1 to 13 terahertz and beyond. Analysis indicates that the birefringence arises from the terahertz-field–driven spin accumulation at the FM/HM interface through the spin Rashba-Edelstein effect (SREE). Because of spin-momentum locking, the SREE decays by electron momentum relaxation in &lt;10 femtoseconds, substantially faster than a spin-Hall-effect–induced bulk spin accumulation.

This SRET occurs as a two-step process mediated by interfacial excitations with mixed charge-transfer and local excitation features. We further validate this model through studies on planar heterojunctions, precisely controlling the thickness of interlayers.

Our observations provide the basis for a model of cellulose fibril network development in protoplasts driven by an interplay of multiscale dynamics that includes rapid diffusion and coalescence of nascent cellulose fibrils, processive elongation of single fibrils, and cellulose fibrillar network rearrangement during maturation. This study provides fresh insights into the dynamic and mechanistic aspects of cell wall synthesis at the single-cell level.",

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels are particularly attractive, but their preparation often requires toxic additives. Here, we introduced a nutritive sweetener, d -sorbitol, as a nontoxic additive to create soft and stretchable PEDOT:PSS conductive hydrogels. These hydrogels exhibit mechanical properties comparable with biological tissues, reducing adverse immune responses. The hydrogels can be patterned on elastic substrates using a simple, low-cost micromolding technique to fabricate soft and stretchable implantable devices for electrical stimulation and recording. The hydrogel electrodes show much lower electrochemical impedance and higher charge storage and injection capacity compared to platinum electrodes. In addition, the properties of hydrogels and devices remain stable after long-term storage and exposure to extreme conditions. We demonstrate the use of soft hydrogel-based electronic devices for effective electrical stimulation and high-quality electrical recordings in live animal models.",

          "abstract": "Maintaining camouflage while moving is a challenge faced by many predators. Some exploit background motion to hide while hunting, and others may use coloration and behavior to generate motion noise that impairs detection or recognition. Here, we uncover a unique form of motion camouflage, showing that broadclub cuttlefish pass dark stripes downward across their head and arms to disguise their hunting maneuvers. This “passing-stripe” display reduces the probability of response to predatory expanding stimuli by prey crabs in a lab-based experiment, is modulated according to approach speed during a hunt, and generates a motion pattern that is different from that of looming predators. This form of motion camouflage likely functions by overwhelming the threatening motion of the approaching predator with nonthreatening downward motion generated by the rhythmic stripes.",

Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U 3 Bi 4 Ni 3 . Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 kelvin and dominates transport properties below 150 kelvin, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB 6 and YbB 12 . At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected. The similarities and differences between U 3 Bi 4 Ni 3 and the other two Kondo insulators will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators and their interplay with strong electron correlations.",

However, the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Craniofacial integument displays dramatic diversity, exemplified by the Polish chicken (PC) with a homeotic transformation of comb-to-crest feathers, caused by a 195–base pair (bp) duplication in HoxC10 intron. Micro-C analyses show that HoxC-containing topologically associating domain (TAD) is normally closed in the scalp but open in the dorsal and tail regions, allowing multiple long-distance contacts. In the PC scalp, the TAD is open, resulting in high HoxC expression. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the 195-bp duplication reduces crest feather formation, and HoxC misexpression alters feather shapes. The 195-bp sequence is found only in Archelosauria (crocodilians and birds) and not in mammals. These findings suggest that higher-order regulation of the HoxC cluster modulates gene expression, driving the evolution of adaptive integumentary appendages in birds.",

MurinecPIIRS models recapitulated this pathway predominance and treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, confirmed a mechanistic requirement for this pathway in disease pathology. Ruxolitinib treatment improved markers of neuronal damage, reduced activated T cell and myeloid cells, and improved weight. On the basis of these findings, we conducted a first-in-human ruxolitinib treatment of patients with cPIIRS (NCT00001352). Ruxolitinib treatment of six patients led to demonstrated tolerability, reductions in inflammatory biomarkers and activated immune cells, and improved brain imaging.

Here, we train data-driven models using climatic data, satellite images, and geographic factors to reconstruct surface DO and quantify the climatic contribution to DO variations in 15,535 lakes from 2003 to 2023. Our analysis indicates a continuous deoxygenation in 83% of the studied lakes. The mean deoxygenation rate in global lakes (−0.049 milligrams per liter per decade) is faster than that observed in the oceans and in rivers. By decreasing solubility, climatic warming contributes 55% of global lake deoxygenation. Meanwhile, heatwaves exert rapid influences on DO decline, resulting in a 7.7% deoxygenation compared to that observed under climatological mean temperatures. By the end of the century, global lake DO is projected to decrease by 0.41 milligrams per liter (4.3%) under SSP2-4.5 and 0.86 milligrams per liter (8.8%) under SSP5-8.5 scenarios.",

The synchronization regions generally broaden monotonically with the strength of the forcing, thereby featuring a tongue-like shape in parameter space, known as Arnold’s tongue. Such a shape is universal, prevailing in many diverse synchronized systems. Theoretical studies suggest that, under strong external forcing, the shape of the synchronization regions can change substantially and even holes can appear in the solid patterns. However, experimentally accessing these abnormal regimes is quite challenging mainly because many real-world systems displaying synchronization become fragile under strong forcing. Here, we are able to observe these intriguing regimes in a breathing-soliton laser. Two types of abnormal synchronization regions are unveiled, namely, a leaf- and a ray-like shape. High-resolution control of the loss allows holes to be revealed in the synchronization regions. Our work opens the possibility to study intriguing synchronization dynamics using a simple breathing-soliton laser as a test bed.",

Using AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq, we assessed the on-target activity and off-target profiles of these systems across multiple genomic loci. FrCas9 demonstrated higher on-target efficiency and substantially fewer off-target effects than SpCas9 and OpenCRISPR-1. Furthermore, TREX2 fusion with FrCas9 reduced large deletions and translocations, enhancing genomic stability. Through screening of 1903 sgRNAs targeting 21 CGT-relevant genes using sequential AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq analysis, we identified optimal sgRNAs for each gene.

However, in most cases, noble metal–containing phosphors are required as sensitizers for MR-TADF emitters to improve their electroluminescence (EL) performances, which may lead to high cost and environmental pollution. Herein, an efficient purely organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) material, 3,2-PIC-TXT, with fast phosphorescence radiation is developed. It not only exhibits impressive EL performances as an emitter with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 33.2%, higher than that of Ir(ppy) 3 (25.2%), but also functions remarkably as a sensitizer for green MR-TADF emitters (BN2, tCzphB-Ph, and tCzphB-Fl).

Here, we propose a lensless imaging method with programmable Fresnel zone aperture (FZA), termed LIP. With a commercial liquid crystal display, we designed an integrated LIP module and demonstrated its capability of high-quality artifact-free reconstruction through dynamic modulation and offset-FZA parallel merging. Compared to static-modulation approaches, LIP achieves a 2.5× resolution enhancement and a 3 decibels improvement in signal-to-noise ratio in “static mode” while maintaining an interaction frame rate of 15 frames per second in “dynamic mode.” Experimental results demonstrate LIP’s potential as a miniaturized platform for versatile advanced imaging tasks like virtual reality and human-computer interaction.",

However, the in vivo metabolic pathways of NMN and NR remain to be elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the fate of orally and intravenously administered NMN and NR in mice using NAD + metabolomics. We found that only a small portion of orally administered NMN and NR was directly absorbed from the small intestine and that most of them underwent gut microbiota–mediated deamidation and conversion to nicotinic acid (NA). Moreover, intravenously administered NMN and NR were rapidly degraded into nicotinamide and secreted to bile followed by deamidation to NA by gut microbiota. Thus, enterohepatic circulated NA is preferentially used in the liver. These findings showed that NMN and NR are indirectly converted to NAD + via unexpected metabolic pathways.",

Here, we developed acid-resistant, gut-environment–responsive composite microparticles based on microfluidic electrospray for the oral codelivery of probiotic [ Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA)] biofilm and postbiotics (indole-3-propionic acid). Montmorillonite was selected for supporting biofilm formation due to its cation-exchange capability and clearly defined biosafety. The montmorillonite-LA biofilm was effectively protected by the microparticles and markedly improved the intestinal retention. Upon oral administration, the composite microparticles notably alleviated colitis in mice, including reducing the inflammatory response, improving intestinal barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiota. Consequently, the composite microparticles show high potential for enhancing probiotic delivery efficacy and present a promising strategy for UC treatment.",

The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicating Drosophila salivary gland and Bombyx silk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr. Together, our study demonstrates that USP8 and Hsp70 regulate endoreplication by synergistically maintaining Fzr stability though deubiquitination.",

This study explores low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) as a resuscitation strategy. Cervical LIPUS stimulation effectively elevated blood pressure in shocked rats. It also improved cerebral and multiorgan perfusion. Mechanistically, LIPUS activated pathways related to sympathetic nerve excitation and vascular smooth muscle contraction, increasing plasma catecholamines and stimulating blood pressure–regulating neural nuclei. Partial sympathetic nerve transection reduced LIPUS efficacy, while complete inhibition of these nuclei abolished the response. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated LIPUS’s ability to raise blood pressure in shock patients. The findings suggest that LIPUS enhances sympathetic nerve activity and activates blood pressure–regulating nuclei, offering a noninvasive, neuromodulation-based approach to shock treatment. This method holds potential for improving blood pressure and organ perfusion in shock patients, especially in resource-limited environments.",

In this study, we characterized the function of y + LAT1-4F2hc complex in mammalian cells and determined the cryo-EM structures of the human y + LAT1-4F2hc complex in two distinct conformations: the apo state in an inward-open conformation and the native substrate-bound state in an outward-open conformation. Structural analysis suggests that Asp 243 in y + LAT1 plays a crucial role in coordination with sodium ion and substrate selectivity.

After use in affinity selection, treatment with dithiothreitol enables near-quantitative reduction, rendering linear peptide analogs for standard tandem mass spectrometry. We use these libraries to discover macrocyclic binders to cadherin-2 and anti-hemagglutinin antibody clone 12ca5. Structure-activity relationship studies of an initial cadherin-binding peptide [ CBP ; apparent dissociation constant ( K d ) = 53 nanomolar] reveal residues responsible for driving affinity (hotspots) and mutation-tolerant residues (coldspots). Two original macrocyclic libraries are prepared in which these hotspots and coldspots are derivatized with nonnatural amino acids. Following discovery and validation, high-affinity ligands are discovered from the coldspot library, with NCBP-4 demonstrating improved affinity ( K d = 29 nanomolar).

The abundance of labile proteinaceous material diminishes from epipelagic to mesopelagic waters but notably increases in bathypelagic waters, where it exhibits a short turnover time (days) and resembles surface plankton in molecular composition. This observation coincides with peak zooplankton biomass recorded over the year. The nonmonotonic depth trend suggests a deep-sea replenishment of organic particles from mesopelagic migrating zooplankton.

Here, we propose an innovative concept of selective antibacterial starvation therapy based on interfering with proton and electron transfer on the bacterial membrane. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, a special Schottky heterojunction film composed of gold and alkaline magnesium-iron mixed metal oxides (Au/MgFe-MMO) was constructed on the titanium implant. Once bacteria contacted this implant, the Au/MgFe-MMO film continuously captured the proton and electron participated in respiratory chain of bacteria to impede their energy metabolism, leading to the deficit of adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Prolonged exposure to this starvation state inhibited numerous biosynthesis processes and triggered severe oxidative stress in bacteria, ultimately leading to their death due to DNA and membrane damage. In addition, this heterojunction film was comfortable for mammalian cells, without inhibiting mitochondrial function. This proposed starvation antibacterial therapy gives a notable perspective in designing biosafe smart antibacterial biomaterials.",

PPDPF was predominantly expressed in healthy proximal tubules of human and mouse kidneys via single-cell analysis. Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD + levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD + and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries. Consequently, knockout of PPDPF notably accelerated the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mouse models induced by aging, chemical exposure, and obstruction. These findings strongly support targeting PPDPF as a potential therapy for kidney fibrosis, offering possibilities for future CKD interventions.",

Intriguingly, cell cycles of host and endosymbiont are synchronized. The molecular mechanisms underlying this notable level of integration are unknown. Previously, we identified a nucleus-encoded dynamin-like protein, called ETP9, that localizes at the endosymbiont division site of A. deanei . Here, we found by comparative genomics that endosymbionts throughout the Strigomonadinae lost the capacity to autonomously form a division septum. We describe the cell cycle–dependent subcellular localization of ETP9 that follows accumulation of the bacterium-encoded division protein FtsZ at the endosymbiont division site. Furthermore, we found that ETP9 is essential in symbiotic but dispensable in aposymbiotic A. deanei that lost the endosymbiont. In the symbiotic strain, ETP9 knockdowns resulted in filamentous, division-impaired endosymbionts. Our work unveiled that in A. deanei an endosymbiont division machinery of dual genetic origin evolved in which a neo-functionalized host protein compensates for losses of endosymbiont division genes.",

Here, we identified an SlKD1-interacting transcription factor GATA transcription factor 6 (SlGATA6), which is required for maintaining the auxin-response gradient and preventing abscission. SlGATA6 up-regulates the expression of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 . The AUXIN RESISTANT/LIKE AUXIN RESISTANT (AUX/LAX) proteins SlLAX2-dependent asymmetric auxin distribution causes differential accumulation of Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid 3 (SlIAA3) and its homolog SlIAA32 across different abscission zone cells. It is also required for SUMOylation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2a (SlARF2a), a key suppressor of auxin signaling and abscission initiator. Moreover, SlIAA3 and SlIAA32 depress SUMOylated SlARF2a, thus suppressing SlARF2a function. The interaction between SlKD1 and SlGATA6 suppresses SlGATA6 binding to the promoters of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 , thereby disrupting the auxin-response gradient and triggering abscission. This regulatory mechanism is conserved under low light–induced abscission in diverse Solanaceae plants. Our findings reveal a critical role of SlKD1 in modulating the auxin-response gradient and abscission initiation.",

          "abstract": "The amplified wintertime Arctic warming has accelerated in recent decades. However, whether and how the warming can cause Eurasian cooling remains debated. By identifying daily Arctic warming events, we find direct observational evidence that the Arctic warming tends to cause substantial Eurasian cooling and an increase in occurrence frequency of Eurasian cooling events with a roughly 2-day lag. We propose a mechanism explaining the causality. We find that the Arctic warming causes a large suppression in activities of daily weather disturbances (referred to as synoptic eddies) over high-latitude Eurasia. This produces a meridional dipole in geopotential height anomalies characterized by an equivalent-barotropic anomalous low (high) and a lower-level cooling (warming) over mid-latitude Eurasia (the Arctic) via a nonlinear eddy–to–mean flow feedback. The feedback induces near-surface northeasterly anomalies that enlarge the Eurasian cooling via cold advection.

Current models depict a global connection between mRNA synthesis and degradation, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that changes in RNA metabolism following depletion of TIP60/KAT5, the acetyltransferase subunit of the NuA4 transcriptional coactivator complex, reveal that transcript buffering occurs at a gene-specific level. By combining RNA sequencing of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and newly synthesized transcript fractions with biophysical modeling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that transcriptional changes caused by TIP60 depletion are offset by corresponding changes in RNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability, indicating gene-specific buffering. Disruption of the unrelated ATAC coactivator complex also causes gene-specific transcript buffering. We propose that cells dynamically adjust RNA splicing, export, and degradation in response to individual RNA synthesis alterations, thereby sustaining cellular homeostasis.",

To examine this, we use rain and aerosol Hg speciation data and high-resolution surface DMHg measurements, collected on a transect from Alaskan coastal waters to the Bering and Chukchi Seas. We observed a significant fivefold increase in the MeHg:THg fraction in rain and a 10-fold increase for aerosols, closely linked to elevated surface DMHg and the highest DMHg evasion (~9.4 picomoles per square meter per hour) found in upwelling waters near the Aleutian Islands. These data highlight a previously underexplored aspect of MeHg air-sea exchange and its importance to Hg cycling and human health concerns.

By performing a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified the transcription factors IRF1 and TFAP4 as key regulators for Galectin-9 expression by binding its regulatory elements. Whereas IRF1 was observed exclusively on the promoter, TFAP4 binding was detected at an enhancer solely in T-ALL cells associated with higher Galectin-9 levels. Together, our results show that IRF1 is responsible and indispensable for Galectin-9 expression and TFAP4 further fine-tunes its expression.

Spd-2/CEP192 proteins, defined by a conserved “Spd-2 domain” (SP2D) comprising two closely spaced AspM-Spd-2-Hydin (ASH) domains, play a critical role in centrosome assembly. Here, we show that the SP2D does not target Drosophila Spd-2 to centrosomes but rather promotes PCM scaffold assembly. Crystal structures of the human and honeybee SP2D reveal an unusual “extended cradle” structure mediated by a conserved interaction interface between the two ASH domains. Mutations predicted to perturb this interface, including a human mutation associated with male infertility and Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy, disrupt PCM scaffold assembly in flies. The SP2D is monomeric in solution, but the Drosophila SP2D can form higher-order oligomers upon phosphorylation by PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1). Crystal-packing interactions and AlphaFold predictions suggest how SP2Ds might self-assemble, and mutations associated with one such potential dimerization interface markedly perturb SP2D oligomerization in vitro and PCM scaffold assembly in vivo.",

This mechanism exhibits low robustness due to its high dependence on the physical properties and flow conditions of fluids. Here, we report a robust emulsification mechanism—wetting-induced interfacial instability—for droplet emission. We find that, when pendant microdroplets in the air contact with an immiscible wetting bulk phase, it triggers interfacial instability in the hanging droplets and then their rapid breakup into the bulk phase. This simplifies the monodisperse microdroplet production using a nozzle positioned above an air-liquid interface, requiring no complex microchannels. We demonstrate that this method exhibits highly scalable production and exceptional robustness against variations in physical properties and flow conditions of fluids, including highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid (56,600 millipascal-seconds). This mechanism provides a simpler alternative to the traditional Rayleigh-Plateau instability for emulsification, offering opportunities for industrial applications and insights into microscale interfacial science.",

While polarimetry allows for in vivo sensing up to 1 mm depth using ultraviolet-visible light, it is limited by dominant light scattering beyond this depth. We propose that photoacoustic sensing in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window can enable deep tissue sensing as acoustic waves scatter less than light. To achieve this, we developed a photoacoustic polarization–enhanced optical rotation sensing (PAPEORS) system, capable of estimating optical rotation from photoacoustic signals and correlating it with chiral molecular concentration for depths up to 3.5 mm. Experiments were conducted using aqueous glucose solutions, naproxen, serum-based glucose samples, and ex vivo chicken tissue. PAPEORS achieved a detection limit of 80 mg/dl while using circularly polarized light with serum samples, demonstrating the potential for deep-tissue chiral molecular sensing.

Despite the known links between the medial habenula (MHb) and nicotine avoidance, the ionic mechanisms underlying MHb neuronal responses to nicotine remain unclear. Here, we report that MHb neurons use a long-lasting refractory period (LLRP) as an unconventional inhibitory mechanism to curb hyperexcitability. This process is initiated by nicotine-induced calcium influx through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which activates a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). Owing to high intracellular chloride levels in MHb neurons, chloride efflux through CaCC, coupled with high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels, sustains MHb depolarization near the chloride equilibrium potential of −30 millivolts, thereby enabling LLRP. Concurrently, calcium-activated BK potassium channels counteract this depolarization, promoting LLRP termination. Our findings reveal an atypical inhibitory mechanism, orchestrated by synergistic actions between calcium-permeable and calcium-activated channels. This discovery advances our understanding of neuronal excitability control and nicotine addiction.",

By canceling the spin currents from Pt layers, the OFF state is attained in Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device. Notably, under a strong negative gate electric field applied to the Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device, the damping-like spin-orbit torque is markedly enhanced over sixfold compared with the applied positive gate electric field.

In addition, nMITO selectively targeted damaged endothelial cells via β-integrins and were delivered to injured tissues through tunneling nanotubes, enhancing their regulatory effects on inflammation and cell damage. In mouse models of acute myocardial injury, liver injury, and pancreatitis, nMITO notably reduced inflammatory responses and repaired tissue damage.

Conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometers generate sinusoidal output intensities, limiting spectral engineering capabilities.

Designed corrugated gratings couple these modes, enabling energy exchange akin to a beam splitter for easy multimode handling. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate spectra with independently tunable linewidth and free spectral range, along with distinct spectral shapes for various transverse modes.

Here, we use an extended dynamical adjustment method to separate the effects of internal dynamics and thermodynamically forced BKS warming on atmospheric circulation, relying solely on observations. Evidence shows that the observed link between BKS warming and Eurasian cooling is influenced by both atmospheric internal variability and forced BKS warming. Internal variability, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly contributed to the observed Eurasian cooling from 1991 to 2012. While BKS warming has a weaker impact on Eurasian cooling on interannual to interdecadal timescales, it notably affects multidecadal scales, contributing to the observed “warming hole” in central Eurasia during 1980–2022. Our findings suggest a weak but non-negligible Eurasian cooling response to BKS warming on multidecadal timescales.

Here, we present the structure of a partially expanded phi29 procapsid that reveals distinct conformations of MCPs and allows visualization of SPs in multiple oligomeric states. These results suggest that formation of SP dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers drives dissociation of SP from MCP to actuate capsid expansion. Hexons expand first, and we propose penton maturation is delayed by a symmetry match with SP oligomers. We further show that the prolate shape of phi29’s capsid is possible due to concave hexons in the equatorial region of the capsid that may alter interactions with SP and explain the observed dependence of the prolate shape on SP.",
