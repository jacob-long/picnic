          "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in phenotypically normal tissue are common across adult organs 1,2 . This suggests that multiple events need to converge to drive tumorigenesis and that many processes such as tissue differentiation may protect against carcinogenesis. WNT–β-catenin signalling maintains zonal differentiation during liver homeostasis 3,4 . However, the CTNNB1 oncogene—encoding β-catenin—is also frequently mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in aberrant WNT signalling that promotes cell growth 5,6 . Here we investigated the antagonistic interplay between WNT-driven growth and differentiation in zonal hepatocyte populations during liver tumorigenesis. We found that β-catenin mutations co-operate with exogenous MYC expression to drive a proliferative translatome. Differentiation of hepatocytes to an extreme zone 3 fate suppressed this proliferative translatome. Furthermore, a GLUL and Lgr5 -positive perivenous subpopulation of zone 3 hepatocytes were refractory to WNT-induced and MYC-induced tumorigenesis. However, when mutant CTNNB1 and MYC alleles were activated sporadically across the liver lobule, a subset of mutant hepatocytes became proliferative and tumorigenic. These early lesions were characterized by reduced WNT pathway activation and elevated MAPK signalling, which suppresses zone 3 differentiation. The proliferative lesions were also dependent on IGFBP2–mTOR–cyclin D1 pathway signalling, in which inhibition of either IGFBP2 or mTOR suppressed proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, we propose that zonal identity dictates hepatocyte susceptibility to WNT-driven tumorigenesis and that escaping WNT-induced differentiation is essential for liver cancer.",

          "abstract": "During the past decade, our understanding of eukaryotic evolution has increased immensely. Newly recognized eukaryotic supergroups have been established1,2,3, and most enigmatic orphan lineages have had their relationships resolved4,5,6. Studies on unicellular protist eukaryotes have also been key to understanding the evolution of mitochondria, the fundamental organelles of the eukaryotic cell, which originated from an alphaproteobacterial ancestor. The retention of ancestral alphaproteobacterial pathways in some protist lineages reveals that the mitochondrion of the last eukaryotic common ancestor was more metabolically versatile than are the highly derived mitochondria that are found in most modern eukaryotes7,8. Here we report the discovery of such a unicellular eukaryote, Solarion arienae gen. et sp. nov., an inconspicuous, free-living heterotrophic protist with two morphologically distinct cell types and a novel type of predatory extrusome. We assign Solarion to the new phylum Caelestes. Together with Provora, hemimastigophoreans and Meteora, they form a new eukaryotic supergroup, Disparia. Moreover, S. arienae has some noteworthy traits associated with the mitochondrial genome; in particular, the mitochondrially encoded secA gene, a remnant of an ancestral alphaproteobacterial protein secretion pathway, which has been lost almost entirely in extant mitochondria9,10. The discovery of S. arienae broadens our understanding of early eukaryotic evolution and facilitates the study of proto-mitochondrial metabolic remnants, shedding light on the complexity of ancestral eukaryotic life.",

Despite this constraint, however, there exists incredible diversity in the world’s 7,000 spoken languages, each of which is learned through extensive experience hearing speech in language-specific contexts 1 . It remains unknown which elements of speech processing in the brain depend on daily language experience and which do not. In this study, we recorded high-density cortical activity from adult participants with diverse language backgrounds as they listened to speech in their native language and an unfamiliar foreign language. We found that, regardless of language experience, both native and foreign languages elicited similar cortical responses in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), associated with shared acoustic–phonetic processing of foundational speech sound features 2,3 , such as vowels and consonants. However, only during native language listening did we observe enhanced neural encoding in the STG for word boundaries, word frequency and language-specific sound sequence statistics. In a separate cohort of bilingual participants, this encoding of word- and sequence-level information appeared for both familiar languages in the same individual and in the same STG neural populations. These results indicate that experience-dependent language processing involves dynamic integration of both shared acoustic–phonetic and language-specific sequence- and word-level information in the STG.",

However, while the selective chemical synthesis of molecules where the stereogenicity arises from a carbon atom is well-established, enantioselective approaches to nitrogen-stereogenic molecules are much less common,1-3 and in case of acyclic, N-stereogenic amines, even elusive, due to their rapid pyramidal inversion. We describe here the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of stable, acyclic N-stereogenic amines by the addition of enol silanes to nitronium ions that ion pair to a confined chiral anion. In the produced so-called anomeric amines, the commonly observed isomerization is slowed down by two N-oxy-substituents, which hamper nitrogen inversion. The critical stereogenicity creating step challenges previously established stereochemical descriptors of enantiodifferentiation. Computational studies provide additional insight into the origin of the observed stereocontrol. Our work opens up a new avenue to investigate the fascinating and previously underexplored chemistry of enantiopure anomeric amines.",

Despite the critical role of ZAK during cellular stress, a mechanistic and structural understanding of ZAK–ribosome interactions and how these lead to activation remain elusive. Here we combine biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to discover distinct ZAK–ribosome interactions required for constitutive recruitment and for activation. We find that upon induction of ribosome collisions, interactions between ZAK and the ribosomal protein RACK1 enable its activation by dimerization of its SAM domains at the collision interface. Furthermore, we discover how this process is negatively regulated by the ribosome-binding protein SERBP1 to prevent constitutive ZAK activation. Characterization of novel SAM variants as well as a known pathogenic variant of the SAM domain of ZAK supports a key role of the SAM domain in regulating kinase activity on and off the ribosome, with some mutants bypassing the ribosome requirement for ZAK activation. Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic blueprint of the kinase activity of ZAK at the collided ribosome interface.",

          "abstract": "Flexible control of motor timing is crucial for behaviour 1–4 . Before volitional movement begins, the frontal cortex and striatum exhibit ramping spiking activity, with variable ramp slopes anticipating movement onsets 5–12 . This activity in the cortico-basal ganglia loop may function as an adjustable ‘timer,’ triggering actions at the desired timing. However, because the frontal cortex and striatum share similar ramping dynamics and are both necessary for timing behaviours, distinguishing their individual roles in this timer function remains challenging. Here, to address this, we conducted perturbation experiments combined with multi-regional electrophysiology in mice performing a flexible lick-timing task. Following transient silencing of the frontal cortex, cortical and striatal activity swiftly returned to pre-silencing levels and resumed ramping, leading to a shift in lick timing close to the silencing duration. Conversely, briefly inhibiting the striatum caused a gradual decrease in ramping activity in both regions, with ramping resuming from post-inhibition levels, shifting lick timing beyond the inhibition duration. Thus, inhibiting the frontal cortex and striatum effectively paused and rewound the timer, respectively. These findings are consistent with a model in which the striatum is part of a network that temporally integrates input from the frontal cortex and generates ramping activity that regulates motor timing.",

          "abstract": "Generative genomic models can design increasingly complex biological systems 1 . However, controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains challenging. Here, we show that Evo, a genomic language model, can leverage genomic context to perform function-guided design that accesses novel regions of sequence space. By learning semantic relationships across prokaryotic genes 2 , Evo enables a genomic ‘autocomplete’ in which a DNA prompt encoding genomic context for a function of interest guides the generation of novel sequences enriched for related functions, which we refer to as ‘semantic design’. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and type II and III toxin–antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant sequence similarity to natural proteins. In-context design of proteins and non-coding RNAs with Evo achieves robust activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural priors, known evolutionary conservation or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to complete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a database containing over 120 billion base pairs of artificial intelligence-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic design across many functions. More broadly, these results demonstrate that generative genomics with biological language models can extend beyond natural sequences.",

          "abstract": "Non-invasive skin permeation is widely used for convenient transdermal delivery of small-molecule therapeutics (less than 500 Da) with appropriate hydrophobicities 1 . However, it has long been deemed infeasible for large molecules—particularly polymers, proteins and peptides 2,3 —due to the formidable barrier posed by the skin structure. Here we show that the fast skin-permeable polyzwitterion poly[2-( N -oxide- N,N -dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OP) can efficiently penetrate the stratum corneum, viable epidermis and dermis into circulation. OP is protonated to be cationic and is therefore enriched in the acidic sebum and paracellular stratum corneum lipids containing fatty acids, and subsequently diffuses through the intercorneocyte lipid lamella. Beneath the stratum corneum, at the normal physiological pH, OP becomes a neutral polyzwitterion, ‘hopping’ on cell membranes, enabling its efficient migration through the epidermis and dermis and ultimately entering dermal lymphatic vessels and systemic circulation. As a result, OP-conjugated insulin efficiently permeates through the skin into the blood circulation; transdermal administration of OP-conjugated insulin at a dose of 116 U kg −1 into mice with type 1 diabetes quickly lowers their blood glucose levels to the normal range, and a transdermal dose of 29 U kg −1 normalizes the blood glucose levels of diabetic minipigs. Thus, the skin-permeable polymer may enable non-invasive transdermal delivery of insulin, relieving patients with diabetes from subcutaneous injections and potentially facilitating patient-friendly use of other protein- and peptide-based therapeutics through transdermal delivery.",

          "abstract": "Proper brain function requires the precise assembly of neural circuits during development. Despite the identification of many cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that help guide axons to their targets 1,2 , it remains mostly unknown how multiple CSPs work together to assemble a functional circuit. Here we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit 3,4 to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN), which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male–male courtship, we switched its connection nearly completely from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type to a new PN type that promotes courtship. From this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attraction between synaptic partners and repulsion between non-partners 5,6 . The anatomical switch changed the odour response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male–male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring—increasing repulsion with the old partner, decreasing repulsion with the new partner and matching attraction with the new partner—to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work shows that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving the way to investigations of how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity.",

          "abstract": "Precise genome-editing technologies such as base editing 1,2 and prime editing 3 can correct most pathogenic gene variants, but their widespread clinical application is impeded by the need to develop new therapeutic agents for each mutation. For diseases that are caused by premature stop codons, suppressor tRNAs (sup-tRNAs) offer a more general strategy. Existing approaches to use sup-tRNAs therapeutically, however, require lifelong administration 4,5 or show modest potency, necessitating potentially toxic overexpression. Here we present prime editing-mediated readthrough of premature termination codons (PERT), a strategy to rescue nonsense mutations in a disease-agnostic manner by using prime editing to permanently convert a dispensable endogenous tRNA into an optimized sup-tRNA. Iterative screening of thousands of variants of all 418 human tRNAs identified tRNAs with the strongest sup-tRNA potential. We optimized prime editing agents to install an engineered sup-tRNA at a single genomic locus without overexpression and observed efficient readthrough of premature termination codons and protein rescue in human cell models of Batten disease, Tay–Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. In vivo delivery of a single prime editor that converts an endogenous mouse tRNA into a sup-tRNA extensively rescued disease pathology in a model of Hurler syndrome. PERT did not induce detected readthrough of natural stop codons or cause significant transcriptomic or proteomic changes. Our findings suggest the potential of disease-agnostic therapeutic genome-editing approaches that require only a single composition of matter to treat diverse genetic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Insulating nanomaterials have large energy gaps and are only electrically accessible under extreme conditions, such as high-intensity radiation and high temperature, pressure or voltage 1,2 . Lanthanide-doped insulating nanoparticles (LnNPs) are widely studied owing to their exceptional luminescence properties, including bright, narrow-linewidth, non-blinking and non-bleaching emission in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) range 3,4 . However, it has not been possible to electrically generate excited states in these insulating nanomaterials under low biases and, therefore, not possible to fabricate optoelectronic devices from these systems. Here we report an electrical excitation pathway to obtain emission from LnNPs. By forming LnNP@organic molecule nanohybrids, in which the recombination of electrically injected charges on the organic molecule is followed by efficient triplet energy transfer (TET) to the LnNP, it is possible to turn on LnNPs under a low operating bias. We demonstrate this excitation pathway in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with low turn-on voltages of about 5 V, very narrow electroluminescence (EL) spectra and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) greater than 0.6% in the NIR-II window 5 . Our LnNP-based LEDs (LnLEDs) also allow for widely tunable EL properties, by changing the type and concentration of lanthanide dopants. These results open up a new field of hybrid optoelectronic devices and provide new opportunities for the electrically driven excitation sources based on lanthanide nanomaterials for biomedical and optoelectronic applications.",

Previous studies linking neural coding and cortical connectivity have focused on input-driven activity in the sensory cortex1,2,3. Here we studied neural activity in the motor cortex while mice gathered rewards with multidirectional tongue reaching. This behaviour does not require training, allowing us to probe neural coding and connectivity before activity is shaped by extended learning. Motor cortex neurons were tuned to target location and reward outcome, and typically responded during and after movements. We studied the underlying network interactions in vivo by estimating causal neural connections using an all-optical method3,4,5,6. Mapping connectivity between more than 20,000,000 excitatory neuron pairs showed a multi-scale columnar architecture in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. Neurons displayed local (less than 100 µm) like-to-like excitatory connectivity according to target-location tuning, and inhibition over longer spatial scales. Connectivity patterns comprised a continuum, with abundant sparsely connected neurons and rare densely connected neurons that function as network hubs. Hub neurons were weakly tuned to target location and reward outcome but influenced more neighbouring neurons. This network of neurons, encoding location and outcome of movements to different motor goals, may be a general substrate for rapid learning of complex, goal-directed behaviours.",

Here, using conventional and imaging flow cytometry, we show that from 21 out of 21 human melanoma metastases, we could isolate heterotypic clusters, comprising CD8 + T cells interacting with one or more tumour cells and/or antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that T cells from clusters were enriched for gene signatures associated with tumour reactivity and exhaustion. Clustered T cells exhibited increased TCR clonality indicative of expansion, whereas TCR-matched T cells showed more exhaustion and co-modulation when conjugated to APCs than when conjugated to tumour cells. T cells that were expanded from clusters ex vivo exerted on average ninefold increased killing activity towards autologous melanomas, which was accompanied by enhanced cytokine production. After adoptive cell transfer into mice, T cells from clusters showed improved patient-derived melanoma control, which was associated with increased T cell infiltration and activation. Together, these results demonstrate that tumour-reactive CD8 + T cells are enriched in functional clusters with tumour cells and/or APCs and that they can be isolated and expanded from clinical samples. Typically excluded by single-cell gating in flow cytometry, these distinct heterotypic T cell clusters are a valuable source to decipher functional tumour–immune cell interactions and may also be therapeutically explored.",

          "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a prevalent and devastating form of oncogene amplification in cancer 1,2 . Circular megabase-sized ecDNAs lack centromeres, stochastically segregate during cell division 3–6 and persist over many generations. It has been more than 40 years since ecDNAs were first observed to hitchhike on mitotic chromosomes into daughter cell nuclei, but the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear 3,7 . Here we identify a family of human genomic elements, termed retention elements, that tether episomes to mitotic chromosomes to increase ecDNA transmission to daughter cells. Using Retain-seq, a genome-scale assay that we developed, we reveal thousands of human retention elements that confer generational persistence to heterologous episomes. Retention elements comprise a select set of CpG-rich gene promoters and act additively. Live-cell imaging and chromosome conformation capture show that retention elements physically interact with mitotic chromosomes at regions that are mitotically bookmarked by transcription factors and chromatin proteins. This activity intermolecularly recapitulates promoter–enhancer interactions. Multiple retention elements are co-amplified with oncogenes on individual ecDNAs in human cancers and shape their sizes and structures. CpG-rich retention elements are focally hypomethylated. Targeted cytosine methylation abrogates retention activity and leads to ecDNA loss, which suggests that methylation-sensitive interactions modulate episomal DNA retention. These results highlight the DNA elements and regulatory logic of mitotic ecDNA retention. Amplifications of retention elements promote the maintenance of oncogenic ecDNA across generations of cancer cells, and reveal the principles of episome immortality intrinsic to the human genome.",

Each CSP pair exhibits inverse expression patterns in the select ORN–PN partners. Loss of each CSP in ORNs led to similar synaptic partner matching deficits as the loss of its partner CSP in PNs, and mistargeting phenotypes caused by overexpressing one CSP could be suppressed by loss of its partner CSP.

Through careful control of dopant composition and concentration in nanocrystals, we also achieve wide-ranging multicolour EL without altering the device architecture, reaching an external quantum efficiency exceeding 5.9% for Tb3+.

At temperatures below 10 K, the superconductivity in PtBi 2 gaps out its topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, whereas its bulk states remain normal 2 . The nodes in the superconducting gap that we observe are located exactly at the centre of the Fermi arcs and imply the presence of topologically protected Majorana cones around this locus in momentum space.

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "No one could accuse Demis Hassabis of dreaming small.\n\nIn 2016, the company he co-founded, DeepMind, shocked the world when an artificial intelligence model it created beat the best human player of the strategy game Go. Then Hassabis set his sights even higher: in 2019, he told colleagues that his goal was to win Nobel prizes with the company’s AI tools.\n\nChemistry Nobel goes to developers of AlphaFold AI that predicts protein structures\n\nIt took only five years for Hassabis and DeepMind’s John Jumper to do so, collecting a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for creating AlphaFold, the AI that revolutionized the prediction of protein structures.\n\nAlphaFold is just one in a string of science successes that DeepMind has achieved over the past decade. When he co-founded the company in 2010, Hassabis, a neuroscientist and game developer, says his aim was to make “a world-class scientific research lab, but in industry”. In that quest, the company sought to apply the scientific method to the development of AI, and to do so ethically and responsibly by anticipating risks and reducing potential harms. Establishing an AI ethics board was a condition of the firm’s agreement to be acquired by Google in 2014 for around US$400 million, according to media reports.\n\nNow Google DeepMind is trying to replicate the success of AlphaFold in other fields of science. “We’re applying AI to nearly every other scientific discipline now,” says Hassabis.\n\nDemis Hassabis co-founded DeepMind in 2010.Credit: Antonio Olmos/Guardian/eyevine\n\nBut the climate for this marriage of science and industry has changed drastically since the release of ChatGPT in 2022 — an event that Hassabis calls a “wake-up moment”. The arrival of chatbots and the large language models (LLMs) that power them led to an explosion in AI usage across society, as well as a scramble by a growing number of well-funded competitors to achieve human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nGoogle DeepMind is now racing to release commercial products — including iterations of the firm’s Gemini LLMs — almost weekly, while continuing its machine-learning research and producing science-specific models. The acceleration has made doing responsible AI harder, and some staff are unhappy with the firm’s more commercial outlook, say several former employees.\n\nAll of this raises questions about where DeepMind is headed, and whether it can achieve blockbuster successes in other fields of science.\n\nNobel bound\n\nAt Google DeepMind’s slick headquarters in London’s King’s Cross technology hub, gleaming geometric sculptures and the smell of espresso hang in the reception hall. Time is so precious that staff members — thought to number between 500 and 1,000 worldwide — can pick up a scooter to race the few hundred metres from one office to another.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the humble origins of the company, which sought to build general AI systems by melding ideas from neuroscience and machine learning. “They were absolutely just super geniuses,” says Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist and researcher in AI ethics at the Hertie School in Berlin. “They were these 12 guys that everybody wanted.”\n\nThe laboratory pioneered the deep-learning AI technique, which uses simulated neurons to learn associations in data after studying real-world examples, as well as reinforcement learning, in which a model learns by trial, error and reward. After applying these to teach models how to play arcade games1 in 2015 and master the ancient game of Go2 in 2016, DeepMind turned its sights to its first scientific problem — predicting the 3D structure of proteins3 from their constituent amino acids.\n\nA member of the AlphaFold team examines a prediction of a protein structure.Credit: Alecsandra Dragoi for Nature\n\nHassabis first came across the puzzle of protein structure as an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, UK, in the 1990s and noted it as being a problem that AI might one day help to solve. AI learning techniques require a database of examples as well as clear metrics of success that guide the model’s progress. Thanks to a long-standing database of known structures and an established competition that judged the accuracy of the predictions, proteins had both.\n\nProtein folding ticked a crucial box for Hassabis: it is a ‘root node’ problem that, once solved, opens up branches of downstream research and applications. Those kinds of problem “are worth spending five years or ten years on, and loads of computers and researchers”, he says.\n\nWhat’s next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution\n\nDeepMind released its first iteration of AlphaFold in 2018, and by 2020, its performance far outstripped that of tools from any other team. Today, a spin-off from DeepMind, Isomorphic Labs, is seeking to use AlphaFold in drug discovery. And DeepMind’s AlphaFold database of more than 200 million protein-structure predictions has been used in a range of research efforts, from improving bee immunity to disease in the face of global population declines to screening for antiparasitic compounds to treat Chagas disease, a potentially life-threatening parasitic infection4.\n\nScience is not just a source of problems to solve; the firm tries to approach all of its AI development in a scientific way, says Pushmeet Kohli, who leads the company’s science efforts. Researchers tend to go back to first principles for each problem and try fresh techniques, he says. Staff members at many other AI firms are more like engineers, applying ingenuity but not doing basic discovery, says Jonathan Godwin, chief executive of the AI firm Orbital Materials in London, who was a researcher at Google DeepMind until the end of 2022.\n\nJohn Jumper and Pushmeet Kohli speak to researcher Olaf Ronneberger in the DeepMind offices.Credit: Alecsandra Dragoi for Nature\n\nBut replicating the success of AlphaFold will be tough: “Not many scientific endeavours work like that,” says Godwin.\n\nUnlocking the genome\n\nGoogle DeepMind is throwing its resources at several problems for which it thinks AI could speed development, and which could have “transformative impact”, says Kohli. These include weather forecasting5 and nuclear fusion, which has the potential to become a clean, abundant energy source. The company picks projects through a strict selection process, but individual researchers can choose which to work on and how to tackle a problem, he says. AI models that work on such problems often require specialized data and researchers to program knowledge into them.\n\nOne project that shows promise, says Kohli, is AlphaGenome, which launched in June as an attempt to decipher long stretches of human non-coding DNA and predict their possible functions6. But the challenge is harder than for AlphaFold, because each sequence yields multiple valid functions.\n\nMaterials science is another area in which the company hopes that AI could be revolutionary. Materials are hard to model because the complex interactions of atomic nuclei and electrons can only be approximated. Learning from a database of simulated structures, DeepMind developed its GNoME model, which in 2023 predicted 400,000 potential new substances7. Now, Kohli says, the team is using machine learning to develop better ways to simulate electron behaviour, ones that are learnt from example interactions rather than by relying on the principles of physics. The end goal is to predict materials with specific properties, such as magnetism or superconductivity, he says. “We want to see the era where AI can basically design any material with any sort of magical property that you want, if it is possible,” he says.\n\nJohn Jumper and Pushmeet Kohli in the headquarters building.Credit: Alecsandra Dragoi for Nature\n\nAI models have a variety of known safety issues, from the risk of being used to create bioweapons to the perpetuation of racial and gender-based biases, and these come to the fore when releasing models into the world. Google DeepMind has a dedicated committee on responsibility and safety that works across the company and is consulted at each major stage of development, says Anna Koivuniemi, who runs its ‘impact accelerator’, an effort to scour society for areas in which AI could make a difference. Committee members stress-test the idea to see what could go wrong, including by consulting externally. “We take it very, very seriously,” she says.\n\nAnother advantage the firm has is that its researchers are pursuing the kind of AI that the world ultimately wants, says Godwin. “People don’t really want random videos of themselves being generated and put on a social-media network; they want limitless energy or diseases being cured,” he says.\n\nBut DeepMind now has company in the quest to use AI for science. Some firms that started out making LLMs seem to be coming around to Hassabis’ vision of AI for science. In the past two months, both OpenAI and the Paris-based AI firm Mistral have created teams dedicated to scientific discovery.\n\nCompany concerns\n\nFor AI companies and researchers, OpenAI’s 2022 release of ChatGPT changed everything. Its success was “pretty surprising to everyone”, says Hassabis.",

Credit: Christoph Burgstedt/Science Photo Library\n\nA single multipurpose gene-editing tool can correct several genetic conditions by restoring proteins that have been truncated by disease-causing mutations. The method might one day overcome a key stumbling block faced by gene-editing therapies: the need to design a bespoke treatment for each disease.\n\nThe new approach, called PERT, combines gene editing with engineered RNA molecules that allow protein synthesis to continue even when a mutation in the DNA tells it to stop prematurely. Such mutations are called nonsense mutations, and they comprise nearly one-quarter of known disease-causing DNA variants.\n\nPowerful CRISPR system inserts whole gene into human DNA\n\nSo far, PERT has overcome disease-linked nonsense mutations in mice and in human cells grown in culture, but further testing and refinement are needed before the approach can be studied in people, says David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a co-author of a paper about the technique.\n\nIf it does prove effective in humans, PERT could drive down the cost and speed up the development of gene-editing therapies for many conditions. “Disease-agnostic approaches like this raise a possibility that, I think, would be incredibly exciting for patients,” says Liu. He and his colleagues published their results on 19 November in Nature1.\n\nPERT proposal\n\nLiu first dreamt up the idea for PERT a few years ago while preparing for an event called science karaoke at his laboratory’s annual retreat. During this event, each member presents an out-of-the-box idea for a project that could send the lab in a new direction. Singing is not required.\n\nFor his project, Liu suggested that the team should investigate synthetic RNA molecules called suppressor tRNAs, which allow a cell’s protein-synthesis machinery to read through a nonsense mutation in the DNA and produce a full-length protein. Suppressor tRNAs, Liu proposed, could be inserted into a genome using a technique called prime editing. At the end of his ten-minute presentation, Liu asked his lab if anyone would be interested in taking on the project; a few members volunteered.\n\nPersonalized gene editing helped one baby: can it be rolled out widely?\n\nAs the team worked to develop PERT, other researchers published promising results using suppressor tRNAs without gene editing. One group used a virus to shuttle the tRNA into cells2; another encased their tRNAs in fatty particles similar to those used in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines3.\n\nEach of these approaches showed promise in animal models with genetic diseases. But viruses can provoke dangerous immune responses, and fatty particles required repeated doses, says Zoya Ignatova, a biochemist at the University of Hamburg in Germany.\n\nGene editing, by contrast, would allow researchers to insert a gene encoding the suppressor tRNA into a recipient’s genome. In theory, no further doses would be needed.",

The move ended US participation in what the White House described as “international agreements and initiatives that do not reflect our country’s values”. It marked a sharp break from decades of US leadership in the IPCC, where US scientists and diplomats have helped steer negotiations, shape reports and fund the process that underpins global climate action.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science cities\n\nAlthough some non-federal US scientists remain involved in the IPCC, funding for their participation is uncertain. At the same time, the US government is drastically cutting budgets and staff across the federal agencies that track and interpret climate data. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), responsible for more than 50% of global ocean monitoring, faces significant cuts of about 25% of its current budget which poses a threat to climate modelling and weather prediction. More than 100 climate-focused National Science Foundation grants have been cancelled. The US Global Change Research Program, a federal initiative that coordinates and integrates climate-change research across multiple agencies, has also lost its funding. Its website, a crucial repository for climate reports, has been shut down.\n\nThese cuts to US climate science leave American cities without the information they need to respond to weather emergencies. And further cuts are expected, including plans to shut down ten NOAA laboratories that study how climate change is altering weather patterns, for example, including a Miami-based team of ‘hurricane hunters’ that operates a specialized fleet of aircraft that fly directly into and around storms to gather lifesaving data that can more accurately warn communities when they need to move out of harm’s way.\n\nThis seismic shift in US science investment will send ripple effects across the globe. The United States owns 42% of the 1,309 Earth observation satellites in operation — far more than any other country. (China, with the second largest fleet, owns 25%.) With fewer US experts to analyse satellite data, coastal cities all over the world face increased risk without the climate intelligence needed for resilience planning.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago’s 2024 National Adaptation Plan, for instance, relies on methodologies and data from IPCC assessments, which themselves heavily integrate observational data and climate modelling generated by US institutions. In the Caribbean, researchers use US data sets to predict the potential impact of climate change on tourism and other major economic sectors.\n\nEfforts are in place to help cities and coastal communities produce their own climate data, but these are moving slowly. In 2017, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated the Programme for Building Regional Climate Capacity in the Caribbean to train local meteorologists and hydrologists and set up computing facilities for climate modelling and simulations. But a 2023 report on the progress in Jamaica found that there were still not enough skilled professionals who could independently produce Earth observation services. Another initiative, SERVIR, a joint NASA–USAID programme, has trained thousands of specialists around the world to access and interpret Earth observation data and integrate them into their national and regional planning, such as for flood forecasting and air-quality monitoring. But with the end of USAID in May, these efforts have now been cancelled.",

          "title": "Mind-reading devices can now predict preconscious thoughts: is it time to worry?",
          "authors": "Liam Drew",
          "abstract": "Before a car crash in 2008 left her paralysed from the neck down, Nancy Smith enjoyed playing the piano. Years later, Smith started making music again, thanks to an implant that recorded and analysed her brain activity. When she imagined playing an on-screen keyboard, her brain–computer interface (BCI) translated her thoughts into keystrokes — and simple melodies, such as ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’, rang out1.\n\nThe rise of brain-reading technology: what you need to know\n\nBut there was a twist. For Smith, it seemed as if the piano played itself. “It felt like the keys just automatically hit themselves without me thinking about it,” she said at the time. “It just seemed like it knew the tune, and it just did it on its own.”\n\nSmith’s BCI system, implanted as part of a clinical trial, trained on her brain signals as she imagined playing the keyboard. That learning enabled the system to detect her intention to play hundreds of milliseconds before she consciously attempted to do so, says trial leader Richard Andersen, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\nSmith is one of roughly 90 people who, over the past two decades, have had BCIs implanted to control assistive technologies, such as computers, robotic arms or synthetic voice generators. These volunteers — paralysed by spinal-cord injuries, strokes or neuromuscular disorders, such as motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) — have demonstrated how command signals for the body’s muscles, recorded from the brain’s motor cortex as people imagine moving, can be decoded into commands for connected devices.\n\nBut Smith, who died of cancer in 2023, was among the first volunteers to have an extra interface implanted in her posterior parietal cortex, a brain region associated with reasoning, attention and planning. Andersen and his team think that by also capturing users’ intentions and pre-motor planning, such ‘dual-implant’ BCIs will improve the performance of prosthetic devices.\n\nNancy Smith used a brain–computer interface to make music after a car accident left her paralysed from the neck down.Credit: Caltech\n\nAndersen’s research also illustrates the potential of BCIs that access areas outside the motor cortex. “The surprise was that when we go into the posterior parietal, we can get signals that are mixed together from a large number of areas,” says Andersen. “There’s a wide variety of things that we can decode.”\n\nThe ability of these devices to access aspects of a person’s innermost life, including preconscious thought, raises the stakes on concerns about how to keep neural data private. It also poses ethical questions about how neurotechnologies might shape people’s thoughts and actions — especially when paired with artificial intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, AI is enhancing the capabilities of wearable consumer products that record signals from outside the brain. Ethicists worry that, left unregulated, these devices could give technology companies access to new and more precise data about people’s internal reactions to online and other content.\n\nEthicists and BCI developers are now asking how previously inaccessible information should be handled and used. “Whole-brain interfacing is going to be the future,” says Tom Oxley, chief executive of Synchron, a BCI company in New York City. He predicts that the desire to treat psychiatric conditions and other brain disorders will lead to more brain regions being explored. Along the way, he says, AI will continue to improve decoding capabilities and change how these systems serve their users. “It leads you to the final question: how do we make that safe?”\n\nConsumer concerns\n\nConsumer neurotech products capture less-sophisticated data than implanted BCIs do. Unlike implanted BCIs, which rely on the firings of specific collections of neurons, most consumer products rely on electroencephalography (EEG). This measures ripples of electrical activity that arise from the averaged firing of huge neuronal populations and are detectable on the scalp. Rather than being created to capture the best recording possible, consumer devices are designed to be stylish (such as in sleek headbands) or unobtrusive (with electrodes hidden inside headphones or headsets for augmented or virtual reality).\n\nStill, EEG can reveal overall brain states, such as alertness, focus, tiredness and anxiety levels. Companies already offer headsets and software that give customers real-time scores relating to these states, with the intention of helping them to improve their sports performance, meditate more effectively or become more productive, for example.\n\nAI has helped to turn noisy signals from suboptimal recording systems into reliable data, explains Ramses Alcaide, chief executive of Neurable, a neurotech company in Boston, Massachusetts, that specializes in EEG signal processing and sells a headphone-based headset for this purpose. “We’ve made it so that EEG doesn’t suck as much as it used to,” Alcaide says. “Now, it can be used in real-life environments, essentially.”\n\nAnd there is widespread anticipation that AI will allow further aspects of users’ mental processes to be decoded. For example, Marcello Ienca, a neuroethicist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, says that EEG can detect small voltage changes in the brain that occur within hundreds of milliseconds of a person perceiving a stimulus. Such signals could reveal how their attention and decision-making relate to that specific stimulus.\n\nAlthough accurate user numbers are hard to gather, many thousands of enthusiasts are already using neurotech headsets. And ethicists say that a big tech company could suddenly catapult the devices to widespread use. Apple, for example, patented a design for EEG sensors for future use in its Airpods wireless earphones in 2023.\n\nYet unlike BCIs aimed at the clinic, which are governed by medical regulations and privacy protections, the consumer BCI space has little legal oversight, says David Lyreskog, an ethicist at the University of Oxford, UK. “There’s a wild west when it comes to the regulatory standards,” he says.\n\nIn 2018, Ienca and his colleagues found that most consumer BCIs don’t use secure data-sharing channels or implement state-of-the-art privacy technologies2. “I believe that has not changed,” Ienca says. What’s more, a 2024 analysis3 of the data policies of 30 consumer neurotech companies by the Neurorights Foundation, a non-profit organization in New York City, showed that nearly all had complete control over the data users provided. That means most firms can use the information as they please, including selling it.\n\nNeuralink brain chip: advance sparks safety and secrecy concerns\n\nResponding to such concerns, the government of Chile and the legislators of four US states have passed laws that give direct recordings of any form of nerve activity protected status. But Ienca and Nita Farahany, an ethicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, fear that such laws are insufficient because they focus on the raw data and not on the inferences that companies can make by combining neural information with parallel streams of digital data. Inferences about a person’s mental health, say, or their political allegiances could still be sold to third parties and used to discriminate against or manipulate a person.\n\n“The data economy, in my view, is already quite privacy-violating and cognitive- liberty-violating,” Ienca says. Adding neural data, he says, “is like giving steroids to the existing data economy”.\n\nSeveral key international bodies, including the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, have issued guidelines on these issues. Furthermore, in September, three US senators introduced an act that would require the Federal Trade Commission to review how data from neurotechnology should be protected.\n\nHeading to the clinic\n\nWhile their development advances at pace, so far no implanted BCI has been approved for general clinical use. Synchron’s device is closest to the clinic. This relatively simple BCI allows users to select on-screen options by imagining moving their foot. Because it is inserted into a blood vessel on the surface of the motor cortex, it doesn’t require neurosurgery. It has proved safe, robust and effective in initial trials4, and Oxley says Synchron is discussing a pivotal trial with the US Food and Drug Administration that could lead to clinical approval.\n\nElon Musk’s neurotech firm Neuralink in Fremont, California, has surgically implanted its more complex device in the motor cortices of at least 13 volunteers who are using it to play computer games, for example, and control robotic hands. Company representatives say that more than 10,000 people have joined waiting lists for its clinical trials.\n\nAt least five more BCI companies have tested their devices in humans for the first time over the past two years, making short-term recordings (on timescales ranging from minutes to weeks) in people undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Researchers in the field say the first approvals are likely to be for devices in the motor cortex that restore independence to people who have severe paralysis — including BCIs that enable speech through synthetic voice technology.\n\nAs for what’s next, Farahany says that moving beyond the motor cortex is a widespread goal among BCI developers. “All of them hope to go back further in time in the brain,” she says, “and to get to that subconscious precursor to thought.”\n\nLast year, Andersen’s group published a proof-of-concept study5 in which internal dialogue was decoded from the parietal cortex of two participants, albeit with an extremely limited vocabulary. The team has also recorded from the parietal cortex while a BCI user played the card game blackjack (pontoon)6. Certain neurons responded to the face values of cards, whereas others tracked the cumulative total of a player’s hand. Some even became active when the player decided whether to stick with their current hand or take another card.\n\nCasey Harrell (with his wife Levana Saxon) uses his brain implant to generate synthetic speech.Credit: Ian Bates/New York Times/Redux/eyevine\n\nBoth Oxley and Matt Angle, chief executive of BCI company Paradromics, based in Austin, Texas, agree that BCIs in brain regions other than the motor cortex might one day help to diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions. Maryam Shanechi, an engineer and computer scientist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, is working towards this goal — in part by aiming to identify and monitor neural signatures of psychiatric diseases and their symptoms7.\n\nBCIs could potentially track such symptoms in a person, deliver stimulation that adjusts neural activity and quantify how the brain responds to that stimulation or other interventions. “That feedback is important, because you want to precisely tailor the therapy to that individual’s own needs,” Shanechi says.\n\nShanechi does not yet know whether the neural correlates of psychiatric symptoms will be trackable across many brain regions or whether they will require recording from specific brain areas. Either way, a central aspect of her work is building foundation models of brain activity. Such models, constructed by training AI algorithms on thousands of hours of neural data from numerous people, would in theory be generalizable across individuals’ brains.",

          "abstract": "The surging value of firms such as NVIDIA has fuelled concerns about an AI stock market bubble.Credit: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nAfter years of hype and ballooning investment, the boom in artificial intelligence technology is beginning to show signs of strain. Many financial analysts now agree that there is an ‘AI bubble’, and some speculate it could finally burst in the next few months.\n\nIn economic terms, the rise of AI is unlike any other tech boom in history — there is now 17 times more investment in AI than in Internet companies before the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. And, valued at around US$4.6 trillion, the AI company NVIDIA was worth more than the economies of every nation except the United States, China and Germany.\n\nBut AI is not living up the promise of revolutionizing multiple sectors — nearly 80% of companies using AI found it had had no significant impact on their earnings, according to a report from management consulting firm McKinsey, and concerns over the basic architecture of chatbots is leading scientists to say that AI has the potential to harm their research. These doubts over the technology’s utility, and financial viability, is leading analysts and investors to speculate that a crash is coming. Even tech chief executives such as Sam Altman of ChatGPT’s parent company OpenAI in San Francisco, California, have admitted that parts of the field are “kind of bubbly right now”.\n\nSo, if a crash is imminent, how will it affect AI research and the scientists and engineers who make it happen?\n\nLessons from the noughties\n\nSome analysts say that an AI-market collapse would be even more catastrophic than the dot-com crash — a shock that wiped out more than $5 trillion in stock-market value and led to hundreds of thousands of job losses in the tech industry alone. Like those of other tech bubbles before it, the dot-com crash had a lasting impact on computer-science research, says John Turner, an economist and historian at Queen’s University Belfast, UK. “But it wasn’t all bad,” he adds.\n\n“In 2000, a lot of highly skilled electronic engineers and computer scientists lost their jobs” and demand for computer-science graduates plummeted, he says. This led to a drop in the numbers of computer-science graduates — but despite this, research output didn’t falter, and the average number of computer-science publications continued to rise each year during and after the dot-com crash (see Dot-com crash aftermath’). Similarly, the roll-out of telecommunication technologies such as mobile phones and the Internet continued unabated.\n\nSources: National Center for Education Statistics; Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025.\n\nBrent Goldfarb, an economist at University of Maryland in College Park, says similar lay-offs in AI researchers and developers would happen were the AI bubble to burst. The biggest impact “would be on the hoard of start-ups jumping on the AI bandwagon, like the tenth AI notetaking app or AI scientist”, he says. OpenAI, Google, NVIDIA and other major AI companies “will likely survive”, he says. “The last thing they’ll do is get rid of their scientific core; that’s the path to the future.”\n\nIn fact, crashes can have a silver lining: they can take innovation into other sectors when leading scientists change jobs, Turner says. Take, for instance the British bicycle crash of 1896. “Motorcycles, motorcars, the Wright brothers; all can trace their origins to the bicycle bubble,” he says. “The railway ‘manias’ of the nineteenth century left the legacy of railways for the benefit of people, much like the dot-com bubble gave society the Internet.”\n\nLiberated researchers\n\nCurrently, the tech industry eclipses academia when it comes to AI, in terms of both investment and publication output. Some researchers have called this an “AI brain drain”, which sidelines exploratory science in favour of commercial interest1. “If I’m an AI researcher working at OpenAI, why would I go to a university when I earn ten times the salary?” Goldfarb says.",

          "title": "Waste not: how researchers harness pee and poo for science",
          "authors": "Hannah Docter-Loeb",
          "abstract": "As Mathilde Poyet ushers me through the Global Microbiome Conservancy’s laboratory in Kiel, Germany, I’m met with all sorts of state-of-the-art equipment. It’s an impressive facility, with typical lab apparatus, such as incubators, the latest sequencing devices and anaerobic chambers for culturing bacteria. But the most important stuff in the lab is stored in a freezer at −80 ºC. The samples are so crucial that there is a back-up battery system — if the electricity to the freezers goes off, the materials will remain intact. These test-tube samples aren’t some immortality serum or cancer-fighting bacteria: they’re faeces.\n\nTo be precise, they’re suspended stool samples and bacteria that have been cultured from faeces. But at one point, this was poo that Poyet and her colleagues, including her partner Mathieu Groussin, had collected as part of their work for the Global Microbiome Conservancy (GMbC), of which Groussin is a co-founder. Poyet likes to call the project their “first baby” (one of their real babies, their infant daughter Aelis, joins us in their office as we speak).\n\n“We’ve seen all sorts of poop across the Bristol stool scale — all shapes, all sizes, all colours,” says Poyet, referring to the stool classification chart physicians use to assess digestive issues.\n\nPoyet and Groussin’s work is predicated on the idea that faeces provide an ideal snapshot of the human gut microbiome: the genetic content of the community of organisms found in intestines. This differs across populations1 and can serve as a health indicator. Most research on the human gut microbiome focuses on populations of European descent. But the GMbC solicits samples that are more globally representative. The samples in the freezer come from as far afield as Ghana, Tanzania, Finland and Thailand.\n\nSamples being collected and frozen for the GMbC’s biobank of waste products.Credit: F. Rondon/Global Microbiome Conservancy\n\nOver the past nine years of the programme, the team has sampled 50 populations spanning 19 countries. Its members have worked with local scientists, ethics boards and communities to collect the samples, and have taken cars, boats, helicopters and even quadbikes to sample sites. Back in the lab, researchers analyse the stool content, sequence the genetic material of bacteria cultured from samples and store the live samples in their biobank.\n\nTo outsiders, taking stool samples constantly might seem — and smell — disgusting. In Kiel, the scientists occasionally make “poop soup”, using a vessel called a bioreactor to see the effects of different scenarios on procured bacteria. They do this only a few times a year, because the process can be long and expensive, and the aromas pungent, prompting their more-conventional floor mates to give the workspace the nickname “smelly lab”.\n\nBut faeces provide a remarkable window into human health. “It’s our best way to interrogate what’s in the gut from healthy people,” says Groussin. “It’s a little bit gross, but that’s just our best way to access this incredible and important biodiversity.”\n\nA treasure trove for science\n\nWith the microbiome a buzzy research topic, other scientists around the globe are taking samples to study it themselves. And as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater analysis is a valuable public-health tool — providing scientists with the means to monitor pathogens in the population before an infection surges.\n\n“The waste we put into the environment is really data rich,” says Janelle Thompson, an environmental microbiologist at Nanyang Technological University’s Asian School of the Environment in Singapore. Thompson and her team sample Singapore’s wastewater to detect harmful microorganisms in the environment, looking for biological “signals” from organisms or viruses that are shed from the human body.\n\n“You can identify where signals are occurring and follow them over time to see when they’re occurring,” she explains. For example, in 2021 and 2022, Thompson and her colleagues were able to identify variants of concern for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at university campus sites and treatment plants2. This was long before these variants became dominant, indicating “minimal silent circulation”, according to the team.\n\nThe implications of research into human waste span several scientific disciplines. Amid a global fertilizer shortage, some scientists (and farmers) are looking to urine as fertilizer, owing to its nitrogen content. A study in Nature Water3, published earlier this year by a group of researchers at Stanford University, California, created a prototype system that extracts nutrients from urine. The team estimates that its design could generate up to US$4.13 per kilogram of nitrogen recovered. And research published in 20204 shows that urine-based fertilizer might also help to conserve other resources, reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and water use.\n\nA researcher pours urine-based fertilizer into a bottle.Credit: Marcin Szczepanski/Lead Multimedia Storyteller, Michigan Engineering\n\nAs well as a public-health bellwether, stool samples are being used in the development of a potentially life-saving process to treat infections of Clostridium difficile, through transferring healthy faecal bacteria and other microbes from one host to another.\n\nC. difficile infections are “really caused by a disturbed microbiota”, explains Josbert Keller, a gastroenterologist at the Haaglanden Medical Centre in The Hague, the Netherlands. Keller was part of a group that published an early clinical trial5 into the effectiveness of faecal transfers, also known as faecal microbiota transplants, in 2013. “If the patient is not able to restore this microbiota, then it can recur and recur, and that’s the moment that faecal microbiota transplants can really cure a patient.”\n\nNow, faecal transfers are being looked at as a way to treat obesity6, type 2 diabetes7, Parkinson’s disease8 and other conditions.\n\nHow to fix a gut microbiome ravaged by antibiotics\n\nSomething that’s often perceived as disgusting can actually have a lot of intrinsic value, says Bryn Nelson, whose 2022 book Flush: The Remarkable Science of an Unlikely Treasure was described by its publisher as “an urgent exploration of the world’s single most squandered natural resource”. As part of the research and writing process, the former microbiologist spent years looking at the applications of faeces — and found at least 24 fields that take important information from what we consider waste products. Referring to excrement’s ‘ick’ factor, he says: “We just have to kind of get past that hurdle to discover all the information that it contains.”\n\nGetting into the field\n\nPoyet comes from a wet-lab background. For her PhD, she studied the fruit fly Drosophila suzukii and often spent full days dissecting specimens of the insect. Her research now involves sifting through stool samples to access bacteria that are not exposed to oxygen. Some samples are more foul than others, she says, adding: “What is really gross when working with stool sample is actually when people don’t digest the food, and you can find food almost intact in the stool. I really don’t like it.”\n\nFor Thompson, working with waste materials was also a natural fit. “I’ve always just been fascinated by the microbial world and then accessing it for human benefit,” she says. “Microbes are slimy, they can be smelly, but I don’t find them gross.”\n\nStools and urine are also something that you get desensitized to over time. Chong Chun Wie, a microbiome researcher at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya, oversees stool-sample collection as part of his work on the human microbiome. His research looks at how the gut microbiome differs across ethnic groups9 in the region. Unlike Poyet and Groussin, he is not involved in fieldwork. Instead, bottles are sent to donors who deposit their samples at home, but there is still handling to be done in the lab.\n\n“The more you do it, the more you just get used to it because it’s something you do routinely,” he says.\n\nYour friends shape your microbiome — and so do their friends\n\nMarissa Ledger, a medical microbiology resident at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, studies the history of parasite infections. Ancient fossilized poo samples — decayed organic components that resemble soil — can be incredibly valuable in archaeology and palaeontology. Ledger’s undergraduate training was in anthropology, studying skeletal remains. She soon learnt that studying parasites in preserved faecal matter is a better way to chronicle infectious diseases throughout human history, likening the fossilized stools to time capsules that can yield nuanced details about infections and diets in a community.\n\n“When I decided that I wanted to look at parasite infections, understanding that they should have been a huge contributor to disease in the past, I was more like, ‘That’s a really cool goal,” she says. “I never really kind of thought of it as gross until I had the response of people talking to me saying, ‘You study ancient poo? That’s crazy.’”\n\nThere’s a stronger cultural taboo towards poo than towards pee, observes Marine Legrand, an anthropologist at OCAPI, an interdisciplinary action and research programme in Paris that looks at ways of recycling human waste, such as by using urine as fertilizer. Although funding is available for research on faeces, it seems to be directed more towards medical than agricultural applications. “When we look for funds, it’s easier to find funds to work on pee than to work on poo.”\n\nThe public restroom",

In the past three years, a parade of highly accomplished researchers has emigrated there.\n\nWolfgang Baumeister, a molecular biologist, started working in China in 2019, after more than three decades at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich, Germany.\n\nBaumeister is apioneer of cryo-electron tomography, a technique that enables researchers to construct 3D images of large molecules and the insides of cells in their physiological environment at nanometre resolution.

Now based at the iHuman Institute at ShanghaiTech University in China, he continues to study the molecular machinery involved in type 2 diabetes.\n\nNature met with Baumeister in Hong Kong. The following is an edited version of that conversation, and from his talk to journalists at the Hong Kong Laureate Forum 2025.\n\nWolfgang Baumeister receiving the Shaw Prize in life science and medicine this year.Credit: Hou Yu/China News Service/VCG via Getty\nWhy did you decide to move to ShanghaiTech University?\n\nMy colleagues and I had a big European Research Council grant for work on neurotoxic aggregates in cells. But we have mandatory retirement in Germany. My contract was extended beyond the normal retirement age, and my colleagues in China knew that and said, “Why not come to China and you can continue?”\n\nI also had offers from the United States to continue my research there, but those institutions would have requested that I move there permanently. With ShanghaiTech University, I can come and go. I have been there six times this year, typically for two weeks at a time.\n\nWhat is it like working as a scientist in China?\n\nThere are things I had to get used to. For instance, human-resources departments at universities are more powerful here than in Germany. In my role as director at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, I always tried to make sure that administration served the scientists and did not command them.\n\nIn Germany, when we bought an instrument, I was used to making that decision myself. What happens here is that the university wants the responsibility for such a decision to be with a committee, which is often made up of non-specialists. Frequently I say, okay, we can pay for the instrument, and then I will be told that the committee will meet in two months to make the decision. This is often a waste of time.\n\nBut when it comes to purchasing very expensive, high-end instrumentation, things are different. When I wanted to buy a US$15-million electron microscope, I just talked to the president of the university for ten minutes, and he approved it. The very big things are often decided spontaneously by the leadership. That is pretty good.",

Or are they more risk-averse?Credit: Westend61/Getty\n\nWomen are under-represented in medical research generally, but they are even more under-represented when it comes to retracted articles. A new study finds that women’s names filled just 23% of author slots in a sample of nearly 900 retracted articles published in medical journals between 2008 and 2017.\n\n“This is a really interesting, creative and robust study,” says Curt Rice, who promotes publishing literacy at the Publishing Unlocked project in Oslo, Norway. “The article invites us to dig into issues like negotiations about authorship and the likelihood of scrutiny.” The findings were reported on 19 November in PLoS ONE1.\n\nWhy retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science\n\nStudy author Paul Sebo, an internal-medicine specialist and researcher at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, used an artificial-intelligence tool that infers whether authors are male or female on the basis of their first names.\n\nHe found women’s names in 16.5% of first-author slots and 12.7% of last-author slots for the retracted papers. By contrast, an earlier study that used a similar tool for predicting author gender found that women accounted for 41–45% of first authors and 26–33% of last authors in all articles from the same selection of journals across the same time frame2.\n\nRisk and reward\n\nInterpreting the results is fraught. The gender-prediction tools used are imperfect. They do not capture non-binary identities, for example, and can be less accurate with non-Western names than Western ones. But in a manual check of 200 names, Sebo found no mismatches.\n\nAnd the findings themselves don’t come with a clear explanation. In an e-mail to Nature, Sebo wrote that his suspicion is that the disparity stems from how “women are still underrepresented in senior academic roles, lead fewer projects, and therefore may be less exposed to the kinds of responsibilities (and risks) that are more commonly associated with retractions”.\n\n“My speculation,” Rice says, ”would be that because men are more visible in science in general, their work is getting more scrutiny.”",

          "title": "Beyond growth — why we need to agree on an alternative to GDP now",
          "authors": "Robert Costanza, Joseph Eastoe, Rutger Hoekstra, Ida Kubiszewski, Daniel W. O’Neill",
          "abstract": "Gross domestic product (GDP) was never designed to be a measure of societal well-being. It tracks only market transactions, conflates costs and benefits, and ignores the distribution of income, the contributions of household labour and volunteer work, and social and environmental costs and benefits.\n\nIn the decades after the Second World War, GDP growth functioned as a reasonable proxy for well-being when rebuilding economies and increasing production and consumption were the main priorities. However, since about 1950, which some call the Anthropocene era, ecological limits, inequality and declining social cohesion have restricted further improvements in well-being. At the same time, the rapid development of artificial intelligence promises fresh opportunities and challenges.\n\nDegrowth can work — here’s how science can help\n\nMeasuring and modelling what truly matters, not just market transactions, is now essential. Processes are under way to develop indicators that move beyond GDP. In May, the United Nations secretary-general António Guterres appointed a High-Level Expert Group to develop such measures, with a focus on balancing economic, social and environmental dimensions of well-being. This initiative builds on the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): target 19 of SDG17 commits governments to adopt beyond-GDP metrics by 2030.\n\nYet progress remains slow. Overcoming decades of structures built around GDP is difficult. Nonetheless, several governments, including those of New Zealand, Scotland, Wales and Bhutan, have experimented with alternatives to GDP1 (see also go.nature.com/3ktuvhv). Others should follow suit, but it will be a steep climb.\n\nShifting all societies from a narrow focus on GDP growth to a comprehensive understanding of the multiple factors that support well-being and prosperity, and of how these factors interact over space and time, demands consensus on another approach2. Over the past seven decades, researchers and institutions have proposed hundreds of alternatives to GDP.\n\nParadoxically, this proliferation has helped GDP to keep its privileged status, by creating the impression that there is little agreement on what sustainable and inclusive well-being means or how to measure it. In fact, there is much that these approaches do agree on.\n\nHere, we identify areas of common ground and propose four ways forward: universally adopting the goal of sustainable and inclusive well-being; establishing agreed metrics to evaluate progress towards this goal; developing models that incorporate the drivers and dynamics of well-being; and addressing institutionalized societal ‘addictions’ that reinforce unsustainable behaviours.\n\nEmbrace sustainable and inclusive well-being\n\nThe concept of sustainable and inclusive well-being — encompassing the well-being of all people and of the ecosystems that sustain life — is emerging as a widely accepted overarching policy goal that can provide common ground for beyond-GDP metrics, models and policies.\n\nBy assigning a central role to natural ecosystems and planetary boundaries, the concept acknowledges that human prosperity depends on healthy ecological systems. Respecting ecological limits by constraining the material scale of the economy is therefore a precondition for lasting well-being. It also demands that human societies prevent significant harm to other species, protect the rights of future generations and guarantee that all people today have access to essential resources, services and participatory forms of decision-making.\n\nMarket workers in Kenya. Employment is a core factor in many indicators of well-being.Credit: Elen Marlen/Getty\n\nA 2009 report on the measurement of economic performance and social progress, chaired by economist Joseph Stiglitz, laid the groundwork for moving beyond GDP3. Since then, international bodies, including the UN, the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), have progressively adopted this conceptual foundation. Full international enforcement should follow; however, this might depend on a more-receptive US administration and stronger demand from civil society.\n\nAgree on well-being indicators\n\nConverging on an approach to evaluating sustainable and inclusive well-being is important if policymakers and organizations such as the UN are to embed these measures into official reporting and budgetary processes. Studies suggest that this is possible.\n\nAlthough more than 200 beyond-GDP indicators have been proposed, they share many similarities. These indicators often use different terminology to describe contributors to sustainable and inclusive well-being4. For example, ‘health’ might refer to mental health, physical health, health care, child welfare or any of more than 400 variants. Semantic modelling of the components of each indicator, which looks at the similarity between them, nevertheless reveals a high degree of agreement5. Nineteen key components capture a large proportion of the similarity (see ‘Well-being components’).\n\nWell-being components\n\nThese 19 core factors are common to most beyond-GDP indicators5.\n\nHuman\n\nLife satisfaction\n\nHealth\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\nEducation\n\nSocial\n\nCrime\n\nCivic engagement\n\nGovernance\n\nIncome equality\n\nGender equality\n\nBuilt\n\nHousing\n\nInfrastructure\n\nFinancial security\n\nEmployment\n\nPer capita consumption\n\nBusiness health\n\nNatural\n\nNatural capital\n\nWater quality\n\nAir quality\n\nGreenhouse-gas emissions\n\nResearchers and policymakers, led by an international convening body such as the UN, should now establish a core set of around 20 components to serve as the backbone of national statistical reporting and UN frameworks. The UN High-Level Expert Group and the ongoing update of the SDGs are already advancing the agenda. The expert group has committed to an inclusive process that invites contributions from all stakeholders.\n\nInterested parties are encouraged to submit ideas and insights to help strengthen the emerging global consensus (see go.nature.com/4gcebvr). This month, the expert group launched an online consultation about its progress, and is expected to present its recommendations in the first half of 2026, which falls within the 80th session of the UN General Assembly. After this, intergovernmental processes will consider their recommendations.\n\nTo build a better world, stop chasing economic growth\n\nOther efforts include the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting and the UN System of National Accounts 2025 initiative, which are revising economic accounts to include more well-being components. The 2024 UN Pact for the Future and recommendations from the secretary-general’s Our Common Agenda report call for measures of progress that complement GDP. But these efforts need help from researchers and the consensus recommendations of the High-Level Expert Group.\n\nThe UN can also play a central part in strengthening institutional capacity and securing stable funding to support the regular production of national estimates. Advances in citizen science, social-media analytics and remote sensing offer opportunities to reduce costs and improve data reliability. The world is awash with big data, so directing even a fraction of these resources towards measuring sustainable and inclusive well-being would enhance global monitoring and policy effectiveness.\n\nDevelop dynamic models that go beyond GDP\n\nGDP has retained its dominance partly because it is embedded in the models that underpin national accounts and policy analyses. For example, the input–output model developed by economist Wassily Leontief6 tracks monetary flows across sectors and into ‘final demand’, defined as GDP.\n\nWhy we need to measure people’s well-being — lessons from a global survey\n\nMainstream macroeconomic models also place growth at the centre of policy evaluation. For example, standard computable general equilibrium models assume a high degree of substitutability among factors of production, implying that labour or technology can largely replace natural resources. They neglect environmental limits and exclude well-being, equity and ecological integrity. Most importantly, they are optimization models that are intended to maximize a single objective — GDP — rather than being designed to evaluate policies against multiple goals, as is required for sustainable and inclusive well-being.\n\nNew models are needed. These must be dynamic, nonlinear and represent the economy as a subsystem of society embedded in the biosphere. Such models must be able to compare resource use and pollution to environmental limits, and social outcomes to the thresholds required to meet human needs7. They must track both stocks (natural, human, social and built capital) and flows (including monetary transactions, ecosystem services and social benefits) and capture their interactions, including feedbacks from transgressing environmental limits. Ecological macroeconomic models, rooted in the field of ecological economics, are one promising approach8.\n\nYoung people at a cultural arts centre in Kibera, an informal settlement in Nairobi, perform a traditional African dance.Credit: Eva-Maria Krafczyk/dpa/Alamy",

          "abstract": "Credit: Eco Clement/UPI/Alamy\n\nCosmologist George Smoot contributed to our understanding of the Universe on the largest scales and at the earliest observable times by measuring temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background. His key experiment in 1992 reported detecting these ‘ripples’ in the microwave sky. Smoot’s discovery, for which he won a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006, revealed the long-anticipated traces of the formation of structures including stars and galaxies (G. F. Smoot et al. Astrophys. J. 396, L1–L5; 1992). This work led to many similar experiments, which used ever-more-precise measurements to cement our modern description of the Universe. Smoot has died aged 80.\n\nHow did the Big Bang get its name? Here’s the real story\n\nThe cosmic microwave background is the radiation from the Big Bang, which marked the beginning of the Universe 13.8 billion years ago. Smoot led the design of the detector that flew on NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. The data it collected gave a snapshot of variations in the density of matter in the hot, young Universe only about 400,000 years after the Big Bang. The amplitude of these variations aligned closely with predictions assuming that today’s galactic structures were formed under the gravitational influence of dark matter, rather than plasma, from that early time.\n\nSmoot was born in Yukon, Florida, the son of a hydrologist and a science teacher. In 1966, he earned degrees in physics and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. He remained at MIT for his PhD in experimental particle physics, before joining the research group of Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he built his research career.\n\nSmoot was using a high-altitude weather balloon to study cosmic rays, until it crashed into the ocean. His team then explored new research directions, in particular Big Bang cosmology. In the early 1970s, prompted by a theoretical paper from one of us (J. Silk Nature 215, 1155–1156; 1967), he began to study the relic microwave radiation. “My physics colleagues dismissed this work as speculation,” he wrote in his Nobel lecture. “It seemed to me a field ripe for observations that would be important no matter how they came out.” Early results using differential microwave radiometers (DMRs) on U-2 spy planes made it possible to measure how the motion of the Solar System makes one side of the sky seem hotter than the other.\n\nWhy we still don’t understand the Universe — even after a century of dispute",

During this time, she has seen growing threats to the food security, cultural practices and mental health of the Inuit and other northern Indigenous peoples.\n\nInspired by her community connection with the people of Nunavut, Penney studies Inuit health, environmental issues and food sovereignty — the right of Indigenous communities to control their own food sources and access — from her current base at Toronto Metropolitan University. She is also a co-investigator on the Inuksiutit Project, an initiative by the University of Aberdeen, UK, and York University in Toronto to promote local control of food in Nunavut.\n\nPenney shares with Nature her research journey.\n\nTell us about your path from Iqaluit to a career in academia.\n\nIqaluit may seem small and remote, but with just over 8,000 people, it’s a large town by Inuit standards, and it’s the cultural hub of Nunavut. All of the issues I study as a sociologist — food sovereignty, poverty and the resonance of native traditions — are Nunavut issues.\n\nNature Spotlight: Canada\n\nThe educational system in Nunavut has some challenges. There’s a serious lack of Inuit teachers and resources. For the last two years of secondary school, I attended an international school on Vancouver Island on a full scholarship. After being exposed to so many cultures, I wanted to attend university abroad and I applied to universities all over the United Kingdom. The University of Glasgow offered me a scholarship in my preferred field of sociology and public policy, so the choice was easy.\n\nI stayed at the University of Glasgow for my master’s and PhD degrees, although I never lost my focus on the Indigenous peoples of northern Canada. Every summer, I would go back to Nunavut to work for the health-policy department, so I was able to link up my studies with my actual work. I did my master's in global health, and that also helped me start to see some of the connections between health and social issues in my community, as well as links to environmental issues, especially those relating to climate change.\n\nMy PhD thesis explored the social, political and economic disruptions caused by the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project, which dammed the Churchill River in the eastern province of Newfoundland and Labrador and was completed in 2021 at a cost of roughly Can$13 billion (US$9.3 billion). I interviewed local Inuit to document their concerns about the project and its anticipated environmental impacts. The dams changed the lives of locals, including their ability to hunt and fish, and many felt powerless and voiceless as construction went ahead.\n\nWhy is food sovereignty and security such a pressing issue in Nunavut?\n\nWherever they live, people should always have some control over their food supply. But control is slipping away in Nunavut. Most food has to be shipped from the south, and the few grocery shops in Nunavut are incredibly expensive — with some items priced at two to three times the national average — and stock limited supplies that are often of poor quality. In Nunavut, a family-sized box of cereal can cost nearly Can$18.\n\nTraditional methods for harvesting food are also under threat. The sea ice around my hometown of Iqaluit (see ‘Remote research’) and many other northern communities is less stable and dependable than it was a few decades ago, which means that local hunters have a harder time finding and reaching ringed seals (Pusa hispida), a major part of the traditional diet, clothing and culture. Inuit eat seal meat, blubber and organs. They still turn seal skins into trousers and parkas. Hunting, sharing and using seal products is a focus of community bonding and Inuit identity.\n\nClimate change isn’t the only challenge. The Canadian government has been considering listing ringed seals as a species of concern, a designation that could greatly limit hunting. As part of this effort, the government surveyed people in Nunavut. As noted by my Inuksiutit Project colleagues, the questionnaire was available only in English and French, which greatly limited input from Inuktut-speaking people who have some of the deepest knowledge of seal populations and have the most at stake. The survey was also conducted online, which limited input from elders and those without iInternet access.\n\nIn February, I co-authored a piece in The Conversation that documented the ongoing food security crisis faced by Inuit children in Nunavut. Canada’s 2022 Indigenous Peoples Survey found that 80% of Indigenous children in the territory live in households experiencing food insecurity. In that article, my co-authors and I advocated for the renewal of a federal voucher programme that provides Can$500 per child each month for groceries, and another Can$250 for children under four for formula milk and nappies. The programme had been at risk of expiring, which could have been catastrophic.\n\nWhat would you change about how science is conducted in Nunavut?",

          "abstract": "At the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, children across the country can gain access to promising trials of cancer treatments when standard therapies fail. Among these are several conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium — a network of 15 centres across the United States and Canada that are funded by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI).\n\nIn August, news broke that the consortium would be stopping people from enrolling in its clinical trials across North America, after losing federal funding beyond March 2026. The decision was handed down by the NCI, part of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). “The process of closing those studies, not just in Canada, but in the US, is beginning,” says Jim Whitlock, a paediatric oncologist at the Hospital for Sick Children. “This is a real tragedy.”\n\nNature Spotlight: Canada\n\nFor Whitlock and other Canadian scientists who have collaborations with US partners, the past ten months have been turbulent. With US scientific agencies such as the NIH, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeing billions of dollars in funding cuts and job losses under the administration of US President Donald Trump, the effects have also been felt in Canada. There, cancelled projects and uncertainty have caused scientists and academics undue stress.\n\nTotal losses to Canadian science are unclear. Among some US federal grant agencies, it can be difficult to see where the funding goes in Canada and who receives it, says Félix Proulx-Giraldeau, interim executive director at Evidence for Democracy in Ottawa, which promotes scientific evidence in governmental decision-making. He adds that whereas the NIH has “gold-standard” transparency about funding recipients, information on grants from organizations such as the EPA and the US National Science Foundation can be harder to keep track of. “It’s unequal across the board,” says Proulx-Giraldeau. As for the rationale behind the cuts to research funding, he highlights media reports that suggest some words and phrases — such as those mentioning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), transgender research and disparities faced by minority ethnic groups — might be used to flag grants for further scrutiny.\n\n“What we’re seeing has us really worried, especially about how these attacks on science translate to attacks on science in Canada, directly and indirectly,” he says.\n\nHealth divides\n\nThe Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium is not the only cancer-trial platform affected by US cuts. As a specialist in acute leukaemia, Whitlock is part of a broader collaboration called the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), which is the world’s largest research organization for childhood and adolescent cancers. The COG operates across more than 220 institutions, with over 100 clinical trials active globally. Of these, 76 involve patients at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children.\n\nBudget release: Canada courts US researchers and signals wider commitment to science\n\nThe first whisper of trouble came early on in the year, when Whitlock learnt that certain international research projects would no longer receive NIH funding, a development subsequently confirmed by the COG leadership. Not wanting to halt the group trials taking place at his hospital, Whitlock and his colleagues accessed funding through the hospital’s foundation. However, the longevity of this measure is unclear. “That puts us in a real dilemma,” he says.\n\nOther Canadian health researchers are feeling the pressure, too. Meghann Lloyd, a physical-activity and disability researcher at Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, investigates the incidence of preventable health conditions among children with disabilities globally. In June 2024, Lloyd was part of a team that submitted an NIH grant application with a US colleague. “We scored quite well, but just below the funding line,” she says. When they resubmitted a few months later, around the time of the 2024 US election, the proposal fell into what she calls “purgatory”. It was eventually sent back in May 2025 with a note about it “not aligning with the goals of the administration”, says Lloyd.\n\nClinical trials at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children have been affected by US funding cuts.Credit: Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images\n\nShe adds that it seems as if “disability has been enveloped or absorbed under this anti-equity, diversity and inclusion [rhetoric]”. For resubmission, she says that their application had to be stripped of keywords deemed by the grant officer at her institution and her US colleague as potentially problematic, including ‘inequity’, ‘disparity’ and ‘less access’. Because Lloyd is a full professor who has other projects, it’s not a make-or-break career issue, she says, but: “I’m a little bit nervous about my colleagues’ [careers] in the US.”\n\nBridging the gap\n\nThe cuts are also a concern for Canada’s early-career researchers, including health scientist Jean-Christophe Bélisle-Pipon at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, who does not have a tenured position. He studies the ethical, legal and social impacts of medical artificial intelligence, and his core research is NIH-funded. The impact of recent cuts to the agency were huge, he says, “especially in terms of stress”.\n\nAlthough Bélisle-Pipon is salaried, he had to reassure his university’s administrators that his team of about 20 research associates and graduate students, who were supported by a mixture of Canadian grants and an NIH grant, could be paid until the end of the year. And then he needed to talk to his team. Seeing the news about the US budget cuts, “I couldn’t give them formal or firm reassurance that everything will be fine,” says Bélisle-Pipon.\n\nStanding up for Inuit-led research in Canada’s changing Arctic\n\nCurrently, his team’s NIH funding has not been cancelled — but his approach has substantially shifted. In his US funding applications, Bélisle-Pipon now focuses on overall AI governance and oversight, instead of safeguards that relate to access and DEI. “I met with the NIH programme officer, and they reviewed my research programme to make sure that I don’t engage any more on DEI.”\n\nHowever, funding agencies in Canada, such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, continue to fund his DEI-focused research, particularly because it relates to ethics in medical AI. “I still think that it’s extremely important,” he says, but he now creates “a wall between the two”, making sure that everything pertaining to governance and ethics of his NIH-funded research is shielded from his Canadian-focused DEI research.\n\nComprehensive national data on the effects of the US cuts in Canada are lacking, but some institutions have been tracking the effects at a local level. Leah Cowen, who is vice-president for research, innovation and strategic initiatives at the University of Toronto, says that 4% of the university’s Can$1.5-billion (US$1.1-billion) annual research funding comes from foreign sources, of which the United States is one. Although that’s a small percentage overall, it “can have very profound impacts”, says Cowen, especially for those staff who have extensive collaborations with US investigators. “The impacts of the US cuts have been changing over time,” she says, because of various US executive orders and subsequent legal challenges. In vaccine-hesitancy research, for example, “we’ve seen programmes in that space specifically paused,” Cowen adds.\n\nLeah Cowen at the University of Toronto.Credit: Tim Fraser/Courtesy of the Connaught Fund\n\nIn response, the University of Toronto launched an emergency research fund last month to support faculty members for up to a year, allowing them to re-engage with US partners. In the interim, the university is encouraging researchers to diversify their funding sources, such as by looking to other international partners. Many scientists who spoke to Nature in October also hoped to see new funding for science in the Canadian government’s budget — released earlier this month, it indeed provided modest relief and optimism for Canadian researchers.\n\nCowen underlines that science spending accounts for just over 1% of all US federal funding, as noted in a February article by editors from the US microbiology community (I. Blader et al. ASM Case Rep. 1, e00043-25; 2025). This means that research cuts will not drastically alter or improve the US national budget, “but will decimate what’s been absolutely critical for US sovereignty and technological innovation and solving global challenges”, she says.\n\nNatural resources\n\nCross-border fieldwork is another area that has been imperilled by US funding cuts. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory conducts many environmental-monitoring programmes, including tracking levels of cyanobacterial blooms in waterways used for drinking, fishing and recreation — a task that relies on data from both sides of the US–Canada border. Municipal decisions on adjusting or stopping the drinking-water supply rely on this real-time data.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Suriya Silsaksom/Alamy\n\nPigeons can sense Earth’s magnetic field by detecting tiny electrical currents in their inner ears, researchers suggest. Such an inner compass could help to explain how certain animals can achieve astonishing feats of long-distance navigation.\n\nThe team performed advanced brain mapping as well single-cell RNA sequencing of pigeon inner-ear cells. Both lines of evidence point to the inner ear as the birds’ ‘magnetoreception’ organ. The results appeared in the Science on 20 November 1.\n\n“This is probably the clearest demonstration of the neural pathways responsible for magnetic processing in any animal,” says Eric Warrant, a sensory biology researcher at the University of Lund in Sweden. Studies have suggested that various animals, including turtles, trout and robins, can sense the direction and strength of magnetic fields, although the evidence has sometimes been contested — and the mechanisms have remained controversial.\n\nBird-brained navigation\n\nTwo leading hypotheses have led the research into how birds sense magnetic fields. One is a quantum-physics effect in retina cells where birds ‘see’ magnetic fields. Another is that microscopic iron oxide particles in the beak could act as tiny compass needles. However, it’s largely unknown where magnetic information is sensed in animals’ brains and how sensory neurons confer sensitivity to electromagnetic changes.\n\nIn 2011, researchers found hints that magnetic fields triggered pigeons’ vestibular system, the organ that enables vertebrates to sense accelerations (including gravity) and helps them to stay balanced2. The structure is made of three fluid-filled loops which are mutually perpendicular, so they can communicate to the brain the direction of an acceleration by breaking it down into three ‘x, y, z’ components.\n\nCompass protein attracts heap of criticism\n\nDavid Keays, a neuroscientist at Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, designed an experiment that could reveal how pigeons’ brains respond to magnetic fields.\n\nKeays’ team exposed six pigeons to a magnetic field slightly stronger than Earth’s for just over an hour. The birds’ heads were immobilized and the magnetic field was continually rotated to simulate the heads’ motions with respect to Earth’s geomagnetic field.\n\nNext, the team used a method for measuring activation patterns of neurons across the brain — by measuring a genetic marker of cell activity in pigeon brains made transparent by a technique called clearing. Maps of brain activity in birds that had been exposed to magnetic fields were compared to a control group that had not been exposed to magnetic fields.\n\nThe results showed neuronal activity related to magnetic fields in the brain region that receives input from the vestibular system, as well as in regions that help to integrate various sensory stimuli. This result narrowed down the list of potential compasses to one — the vestibular system — although it did not explain how pigeon neurons can physically sense magnetic fields.\n\nA magnetic sense organ\n\nIn principle, a conducting material in an organism could produce electric currents in response to magnetic fields, giving an animal a ‘magnetic sense’ — a mechanism that has been proposed as early as 1882 by French zoologist Camille Viguier3.\n\nIn previous research, Keays had looked for a molecular mechanism of this magnetoreception by following inspiration from the biophysics of sharks and skates, which have organs that sense minute electric fields to help them find prey4. These animals express a protein sensitive to changes in neurons’ electrical activity, but modified with a 10-amino-acid-long insertion that allows them to sense electrical currents generated from magnetic fields.\n\nFruit flies’ ability to sense magnetic fields thrown into doubt",

          "authors": "Dariusz Jemielniak",
          "abstract": "Credit: Adapted from Getty\n\nMore than half a century ago, information scientist Derek De Solla Price observed that the scientific literature was growing exponentially, doubling every 10–15 years1. Little did he know that this observation would spawn not just a field of study, but an entire industry devoted to counting, measuring, weighing and indexing every aspect of academic output2. Today, the modern academic doesn’t just publish — they generate metrics. They don’t just research — they optimize their h-indices. And they certainly don’t just think up new ideas — they maximize citation counts while maintaining a favourable paper output.\n\nUltimately, they produce ‘units of assessment’, according to the UK Research Assessment Framework (REF), which the United Kingdom uses to allocate £2 billion (US$2.7 billion) in public research funding across its universities. They don’t collaborate; they strategically co-author, to maximize citation networks. And they certainly don’t read any more — who has time when there are metrics to massage?\n\nThe rise of the h-index: when counting became culture\n\nIt began innocently enough. Twenty years ago, physicist Jorge Hirsch at the University of California, San Diego, proposed the h-index. It was elegantly simple: a scholar with an h-index of n has published n papers that have each been cited at least n times3. Hirsch’s original paper suggested that “for physics, a value for h of about 10–12 might be a useful guideline for tenure decisions at major research universities”.\n\nOh, sweet summer child, to quote a popular line from Game of Thrones.\n\nWhat Hirsch had unleashed was not merely a metric, but a compulsion. Within a decade, the h-index had metastasized across disciplines. And very quickly, rather than a metric, it became a target. Search committees began sorting candidates by h-index; promotion committees set h-index thresholds; graduate students started checking their h-indices with the frequency and anxiety typically reserved for checking a dating app.\n\nAn explosion of metrics\n\nBut why stop at one number when you could have dozens? The h-index begat the g-index (which gives more weight to highly cited articles)4, which begat the e-index (to account for citations beyond those considered in the h-index), the a-index (to measure the average number of citations in a researcher’s top papers) and the m-index (which takes career length into account). There is now the i10-index (the number of publications with at least ten citations), the h-core (the core set of papers considered by the h-index) and the contemporary h-index (which adds a decay function, because apparently citations should have a half-life).\n\nEach new metric arrived with its own justification, its own formula and its own promise to finally capture the true essence of scholarly impact.\n\nTo me, metrics are like trying to measure the ocean by counting waves, each new metric promising to quantify them more accurately than the last. The REF, for example, gave us ‘impact case studies’ — documents that describe research impact beyond academia. Australia’s Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) introduced ‘research quality indicators’ to assess research quality across disciplines. The Leiden Manifesto5 actually had to remind us that “quantitative evaluation should support qualitative, expert assessment” — a bit like reminding people that food should be chewed before swallowing. Naturally, these metrics are justified as ensuring accountability to taxpayers, who surely lie awake at night wondering about h-indices rather than, say, whether scientists have cured cancer or explained consciousness.\n\nMeanwhile, the publishers watched and learnt. We now have a panopticon of productivity, in which every citation is counted, every self-citation scrutinized and every collaboration strategically calculated for maximum metric optimization.\n\nEnter the j-index: the weight of true scholarship\n\nI humbly propose a new, maybe-slightly-ironic, metric. This captures what truly matters in academic work: physical heft. I call it the j-index, and its calculation is refreshingly straightforward:\n\nJ = W ÷ Y\n\nWhere W is the total weight (in kilograms) of all books a scientist has authored, and Y is the number of years since the author earned their doctorate.\n\nConsider the elegant simplicity. No longer must we worry about citation cartels (in which authors cite each others’ publications to boost citation counts) or gaming the system through self-citation. The j-index is immune to such manipulation — unless the books are printed on heavy paper stock, which should be discouraged through strict guidelines on acceptable paper weights. On the plus side, no longer will scholars insist on softcover editions: just think how many trees we can save!",

          "authors": "Brian Owens",
          "abstract": "The contents of Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first federal budget, released on 4 November, came as a relief to many researchers in Canada – because a large cut to the country’s three main research-funding councils failed to materialize. The nation has also poured further investment into attracting international scientists from abroad.\n\nWith the economic fallout from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the planned increases in expenditure on housing, infrastructure and national defence, Canada’s government departments had been asked to plan for 15% cuts in the lead-up to the 2025 budget. The scientific community feared that had those cuts been applied to the funding councils, they would have erased the large, multi-year increase promised in the 2024 budget. Much of this increase had been earmarked for long-overdue salary boosts for PhD students and postdoctoral fellows.\n\nNature Spotlight: Canada\n\nIn the end, the funding councils were spared the worst of the cuts and asked to find only 2% in savings. Three other areas were exempted from the 15% target: national security and public safety; Indigenous reconciliation; and gender equality, including for people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+).\n\n“Given the context, the fact that the government put science, research and innovation front and centre and said we cannot cut here is extremely encouraging for us,” says Félix Proulx-Giraldeau, interim executive director of the science-advocacy group Evidence for Democracy in Ottawa. “It shows that they understand that science is central to Canada’s competitiveness in this changing global context.”\n\nThe 2% cut leaves the planned funding increase from 2024 largely intact. The savings will be found from councils’ operational funding, leaving grants untouched, according to Robert Asselin, chief executive of U15 Canada, an association of 15 of the country’s most research-intensive universities.\n\nAsselin also welcomed five-year plans to invest Can$925 million (US$660 million) in artificial-intelligence infrastructure ($800 million of which had been promised in previous budgets), plus $334 million in quantum technologies — calling the plans “a great sign of the government’s commitment to science and technology”. He also hailed a promised $68-million investment over three years to establish the Bureau of Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Innovation and Science (BOREALIS). This would be focused on developing technologies related to national defence.\n\nScience on shaky ground: Canadian research shifts in the wake of US cuts\n\nBut the biggest science-related announcement in the budget was $1.7 billion in new money to attract more than 1,000 high-level international researchers to Canada. That includes $1 billion over 13 years to support new professorships through the Accelerated Research Chairs programme, $133 million over three years for the relocation of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows, and $120 million over 12 years for the recruitment of assistant professors. There will also be $400 million, spread over seven years, to improve research infrastructure to support people who are brought in through the chairs programme.\n\n“Canada is the best place to live, and top talent from around the world want to come here because they see opportunities and possibilities to contribute to cutting-edge research,” said finance minister François-Philippe Champagne in his budget speech. “We will make sure that the best and brightest continue to choose Canada to innovate, invent and grow our industry.”\n\nAlthough the initiative is not specifically aimed at US researchers, the budget includes a pledge to create an accelerated immigration pathway for those who already hold US H1-B visas, making the intent clear.\n\n“The budget is a reflection of the government’s priorities, and the fact that they came through with real dollars and clear language about science shows real leadership and a clear direction for the future,” says Asselin. “They want to compete and bring the best and brightest here.”\n\nStanding up for Inuit-led research in Canada’s changing Arctic",

Credit: Oliver Berg/dpa via Alamy\n\nThe obesity drug tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound, can suppress patterns of brain activity associated with food cravings, a study suggests. Researchers measured the changing electrical signals in the brain of a person with severe obesity who had experienced persistent ‘food noise’ — intrusive, compulsive thoughts about eating — shortly after the individual began taking the medication.\n\nThe study is the first to use electrodes to directly measure how blockbuster obesity drugs that mimic the hormone GLP-1 affect brain activity in people, and to hint at how they curb extreme food cravings.\n\n“It’s a great strategy to try and find a neural signature of food noise, and then try to understand how drugs can manipulate it,” says Amber Alhadeff, a neuroscientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The findings were published today in Nature Medicine1.\n\nBonus finding\n\nCasey Halpern, a neurosurgeon-scientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and his colleagues did not set out to investigate the effects of obesity drugs on the brain. The team’s goal was to test whether a type of deep brain stimulation — a therapy that involves delivering a weak electrical current directly into the brain — can help to reduce compulsive eating in people with obesity for whom treatments such as bariatric surgery haven’t worked.\n\nHow to keep weight off after obesity drugs\n\nThe scientists set up a study in which participants had an electrode implanted into their nucleus accumbens, a region of the brain that is involved in feelings of reward. It also expresses the GLP-1 receptor, notes Christian Hölscher, a neuroscientist at the Henan Academy of Innovations in Medical Science in Zhengzhou, China, “so we know that GLP-1 plays a role in modulating reward here”. This type of electrode, which can both record electrical activity and deliver an electrical current when needed, is already used in people to treat some forms of epilepsy.\n\nFor the study’s first two participants, the researchers found that episodes of intense food noise were accompanied by a surge in low-frequency brain activity. This pattern suggested that these changes could serve as a measurable sign of compulsive food cravings.\n\nThe third trial participant, a 60-year-old woman, had just started taking a high dose of tirzepatide — which had been prescribed by her physician to treat type 2 diabetes — when she had the electrode implanted. “We took advantage of this serendipitous opportunity because of the excitement around these drugs,” Halpern says.\n\nFood noise silenced",

          "authors": "Virginia Eubanks",
          "abstract": "Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship Bruce Schneier and Nathan E. Sanders MIT Press (2025)\n\nThe tsunami of writing on artificial intelligence tends towards either bald hype or panicked dystopianism. Proponents say that AI will revolutionize health care, drive business growth and become our new best friend. But for its critics, AI could cause massive unemployment, perpetuate fake news and pose an extinction risk to humankind.\n\nWhy an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science\n\nIn Rewiring Democracy, cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier and data scientist Nathan Sanders offer a welcome middle path by focusing on practical politics. In a heartfelt, if workmanlike, way, they craft a framework for maximizing the democratic potential of AI. Yet, by shrinking and distorting the vexing political challenges that the world faces today to fit a single solution — AI — they short-change the frustrating glories of living together as human beings.\n\nStructured clearly enough, even for readers who know little about AI, the book is rich with concrete examples and absorbing speculation. Schneier and Sanders propose that every aspect of democratic governance — such as negotiating procurement contracts, drafting legal briefs, producing local news or facilitating conversation across political divides — could be enhanced by the thoughtful application of AI developed under public control for public benefit.\n\n“Entrenched elected officials, political movements with authoritarian tendencies, and the billionaire class all regard AI as a new tool to consolidate and centralize power,” they write. “But the rest of us, the public, can harness it as a tool to distribute power instead.”\n\nFor example, a personal “army of AI minions” could extend individual power by making it easier to speak out. AI agents could make political decisions on our behalf, guessing our preferences on the basis of past behaviour and communicating them swiftly to legislators.\n\nAI for the people\n\nAI, the authors write, could either enrich or undercut different modes of political participation: campaigns, legislation, public administration, courts, organizing and advocacy. AI as is, designed by corporate players and supercharging an already unequal political system, might exacerbate discrimination and harm, allow lobbyists to concentrate their power and leave the most vulnerable people with shoddy digital attorneys rather than pricier human ones. Public AI — designed to enrich democracy — could target government resources more effectively, lower the cost and expertise needed to generate legislation, and simplify the drafting of complaints.\n\nAI can supercharge inequality — unless the public learns to control it\n\nHowever, the democratic potential of AI will not be realized unless four conditions are met. First, the commercial AI ecosystem must be reformed, by providing robust public alternatives to technologies that are privately owned and controlled. Second, authoritarian or unethical uses of AI must be resisted by ensuring that “democratic principles … govern its development and deployment”. Third, responsible government AI must consider social impacts, weigh the risks and benefits carefully and ensure accountability. Fourth, Schneier and Sanders think, social movements could help to renovate democracy by galvanizing “their constituents to respond to the long-standing democratic threats magnified by AI”.\n\nIn the final section, Schneier and Sanders describe their vision for nurturing “robust noncorporate alternatives” to commercial tools. Imagining public AI as a “universal economic infrastructure”, like publicly run schools and highways, the authors favour multilateral, anti-monopoly regulation that might allow citizen AI to compete against the products of ‘big tech’ — an approach that the United Nations is discussing. They offer organizing principles for a shared vision of democratic AI, one that is broadly capable, widely available, transparent, meaningfully responsive, actively stripped of its biases, reasonably secure and non-exploitative.\n\nMany readers will be sympathetic to these goals. Which is why it is so disappointing that the book’s fundamental premise — that democracy can best be understood as an information system — fatally undermines those objectives.\n\nGovernment is not a machine\n\nThink of democracy “as an information system for turning individual preferences into group policy decisions, and then executing those decisions through society”, Schneier and Sanders write. But democracy isn’t a flow chart or an executable piece of computer code. Preferences are formed in the process of governance, not just counted. And as any first-year student of political science can affirm, implementation, particularly at the street level, creates, shapes and modifies policy as often as it executes it.\n\nGovernments need formal rules and copious, reliable data to function efficiently and fairly. But democracies are also human, value-laden institutions for negotiating the contradictions that come with living together well. The model of government as information system has no place for the sophistication and difficulty of what democracies attempt to accomplish, or the standards to which they are held.\n\nA system at Moscow Metro stations recognizes passengers’ faces, allowing people to board trains and make cashless payments for journeys.Credit: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nFor example, Schneier and Sanders argue that the purposes of democracy include “peaceful transition of power, majority rule, fair decision-making, better outcomes”. They fail to mention equally crucial aims, such as preventing tyranny, protecting minority rights, balancing conflicting values, stewarding collective wealth and nurturing human capacity.\n\nThe premise that democracy is an information system obscures the thorniest challenges that AI poses to governance. It assumes that, if everyone has equal access to reliable, accurate and timely data, our disagreements will dissolve. But we live in a world of genuinely incommensurate interests.",

These sequences usually have cancer-promoting genes and gene-regulatory sequences that enable tumour growth, adaptation and survival. Unlike cancer-promoting genes residing on chromosomes, which are always inherited by the next generation of cells, genes on ecDNA are reliably inherited only if they tether to chromosomes when cells divide3, and untethered ecDNA can get lost over time as cells replicate. In cell division, ecDNAs are not segregated equally into daughter cells, which means that cancer cells in a tumour can contain varying amounts of cancer-promoting genes.

          "abstract": "Researchers gave an AI data from physics experiments involving systems using pendulum-like motion to see if it could derive basic laws of physics.Credit: stefilyn/Getty\n\nMost artificial-intelligence (AI) models can reliably identify patterns in data and make predictions, but struggle to use that data to come up with broad scientific concepts, such as the laws of gravity. Now, a team in China has developed a system called AI-Newton that, after being fed experimental data, can autonomously ‘discover’ key physics principles, such as Newton’s second law describing the effect of force and mass on acceleration.\n\nThe model mimics the human scientific process by incrementally building a knowledge base of concepts and laws, says Yan-Qing Ma, a physicist at Peking University in Beijing who helped to develop the system. Being able to identify useful concepts means that the system can potentially discover scientific insights without human pre-programming, Ma adds.\n\nKeyon Vafa, a computer scientist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, explains that AI-Newton uses an approach called symbolic regression, in which the model hunts for the best mathematical equation to represent physical phenomena. This technique is a promising method for scientific discovery, he adds, because the system is programmed in a way that encourages it to deduce concepts.\n\nThe team at Peking University used a simulator to generate data from 46 physics experiments1 involving the free motion of balls and springs, collisions between objects and the behaviour of systems exhibiting vibrations, oscillations and pendulum-like motion. The simulator also deliberately introduced statistical errors to mimic real-world data.\n\nFor example, AI-Newton was given data on the position of a ball at a given time and asked to come up with a mathematical equation that explains the relationship between the two variables of time and position. It was able to provide an equation for velocity. It stored this knowledge for the next set of tasks, in which it successfully derived the mass of the ball using Newton’s second law. The results have not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nPlanetary trajectories\n\nScientists have previously used AI models to predict planetary orbits. In 2019, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich developed ‘AI Copernicus’, a neural network that used Earth-based observations to derive formulae for planetary trajectories. In that case, humans were needed to interpret the equations and understand how they relate to the movement of the planets around the Sun.\n\nVafa and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge tried a similar experiment with several foundation models, a type of AI model trained on vast data sets, including large language models such as GPT, Claude and Llama.\n\nThey trained the models to predict the location of planets across solar systems and then asked them to predict the forces that govern planetary trajectories. In a preprint2, the researchers showed that when the models were trained on orbital trajectories, they could not use the knowledge to do any task other than predicting planetary trajectories. When trying to turn those orbital trajectory data into a law about how forces behave, the foundation AI models derived a nonsensical law of gravitation.",

          "abstract": "Unauthorized ship arriving at Bay 30.\n\nAko sat straighter. The ship’s origin was Tremulos, a system inhabited by clonal aliens. His pin badge collection hung on the wall beside him, one for each port he’d visited; he hadn’t been to Tremulos yet. He hoped to get that promotion soon and visit systems farther out, like Tremulos, while he trained other spaceport controllers.\n\n“What’s the deal?” Cara asked beside him.\n\n“Dunno,” Ako said. He opened comms with the ship. “Identify yourself, Tremulos origin.”\n\nNothing.\n\nAlarming scenarios rushed into Ako’s mind and he notified security as he kept trying to raise the pilot.\n\nSecurity swarmed Bay 30, weapons ready. When the ship docked but didn’t open or respond to security’s commands, Ako sent a hangar robot to open the door, and security entered the ship. Ako sat forward, staring at the gaping ship door, hardly breathing.\n\n“Ever seen a Tremulo?” Cara asked.\n\n“Never,” Ako said. “You?”\n\n“Once. You know how aspen groves look like individual trees but are really one organism?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“That’s a Tremulo. But they’re tall and thin and sort of humanoid.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nA security guard emerged, helmet removed, and looked up to where Ako and Cara sat safely in their controller’s office. “Get down here,” she said. She looked annoyed and not at all alarmed.\n\nMoments later Ako stood inside the ship, staring at what appeared to be dozens of small aliens but was really one Tremulo. A child, according to security, with development equivalent to a human preschooler, and no alien adult on board.\n\nThe Tremulo was all knobbly knees and elbows and skinny bodies connected by thin filaments. Each one had a pair of large eyes staring up at Ako.\n\n“We just spoke to their parents,” the security guard said. “They’re on their way, but it’ll be a while.”\n\n“How’d they end up on a ship alone?” Ako asked. “And how’d they get here?”\n\n“Their parent had the ship ready for launch,” she said. “Then realized they forgot something, and they were so distracted when they left the ship that they left it primed for launch. All the kid here had to do was push a button and, boom, unauthorized joy ride. At any rate, keep an eye on them until the parent gets here.”\n\nPanic spiked in Ako’s gut. “Why can’t you watch them?”\n\n“I’ve got a whole shift to finish. And I checked the schedule. No more ships arriving until the parent gets here. You’ve got the time.” She replaced her helmet, eyes hidden by dark reflective armour.\n\nAko whirled on Cara. “Can you —”\n\n“Oh, no,” she said, backing up. “Just ’cause I’ve got a uterus doesn’t mean I’m automatically the babysitter.”\n\n“But I don’t know a thing about young Tremulos.”\n\n“Neither do I. As no one has an advantage, you’re as good a babysitter as anyone else.”\n\n“But what do I do with them?” Ako asked, trying not to squirm under the heavy stare of 80 pairs of eyes.\n\n“Entertain them.”\n\nAko checked the parent’s ETA. He would have to keep an eye on this alien child for several hours. In the meantime, the child was wandering everywhere and touching everything.\n\n“Stop that,” he said via the translator device. “Don’t touch that. Don’t climb that. Come here. No, stay out of there.” He glanced at his watch. Only 15 minutes had passed? He wanted to sit on the bay floor and cry.\n\nOne pair of Tremulo eyes looked up, then they all snapped in the direction of the controller’s office. “Shiny,” they said.\n\nThey were looking at Ako’s pin badge collection, winking in the bright lights from the bay. It was the first time they’d stood still. Ako didn’t want those grubby hands anywhere near his hard-earned collection, but he didn’t think he could spend the next few hours chasing this kid around and keeping them from pressing some crucial button and accidentally, say, exposing him to the vacuum of space.\n\nAko bolted up the stairs, muttering the whole way about the sacrifices he was making. He snatched the board and ran back down.",

          "abstract": "People with measles are barred from entering a hospital in Canada, which has seen a surge in cases of the highly infectious disease in 2025.Credit: Nicole Osborne/The Canadian Press via ZUMA Press\n\nA surge in measles cases has cost Canada its official measles-free designation — and the United States looks likely to follow suit.\n\nThe spike in Canada’s measles rate has been dramatic: so far, there have been 4,843 confirmed cases in 2025, up from just 147 cases in 2024 (see ‘Canadian surge’). Meanwhile, the United States has had more than 1,720 confirmed cases this year, more than in any year in the past three decades. If the disease continues to spread until January 2026, the United States could lose its ‘measles elimination’ status — a label applied to regions that have had no endemic measles transmission for at least 12 months — early next year.\n\nSource: Health Infobase, Government of Canada\n\nPublic-health officials say that the surge in cases in North America is concerning, and possibly a sign of worse things to come. But these outbreaks are not unprecedented in the broader picture.\n\nThe global number of measles cases was much higher in 2019 (see ‘Up and down and up again’), when Africa was hit hard by outbreaks. And 2024 was particularly bad in Europe; the region saw double the number of measles cases it recorded in 2023, and the United Kingdom declared a national incident.\n\nSource: World Health Organization\n\nHealth officials around the world have been trying to quash measles for decades, with variable success. Countries and regions come and go from the measles-free list frequently. “Elimination is a fragile state,” says William Moss, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe Americas became the first — and, so far, only — World Health Organization (WHO) region to be declared measles-free, in 2016, but this status didn’t last long, thanks to an outbreak in Venezuela in 2018 that spread to Brazil. The region clawed back its status in 2024, but has now lost it again, thanks to the 10 November decision about Canada, made by the Pan American Health Organization.\n\nHigh bar\n\nThe WHO recommends that countries vaccinate 95% of children with two doses of measles-containing vaccine. Few countries hit that mark: in the European Union in 2023, for example, only four countries achieved it. “That’s an aspirational goal. A country can eliminate measles without 95% coverage,” notes Moss; outbreaks tend to happen in communities in which the coverage is much lower than the national average.\n\nGlobally, the rate of measles vaccination with one dose — which provides some protection — has hovered between 81% and 86% for more than a decade, and is currently recovering from a dip that occurred during the pandemic as a result of disruptions in vaccine delivery (see ‘Widespread protection’). Many countries, including the United States and Canada, maintain a rate of around 90% for one dose.\n\nSource: UNICEF",

          "title": "On the move: why PhD students study abroad in 2025",
          "authors": "Linda Nordling",
          "abstract": "When Calvin Santiago Lee decided to look beyond his home in the United States for a PhD position, finances played a decisive part. “I believed that unless I got extremely lucky in the US, there would be little chance of being financially stable during my PhD and having good career prospects thereafter,” says the theoretical computer scientist.\n\nThe global PhD landscape 2025\n\nHis current position working on category theory — a mathematical field related to programming languages and logic — at Reykjavik University in Iceland pays well and provides good work–life balance. “I feel like a valued member of society and can live a comfortable life while pursuing a PhD. I believe that even at top US institutions, this would not be a guarantee.”\n\nLee’s move captures a sentiment shared by many young researchers. When Nature surveyed nearly 3,800 PhD students worldwide in May and June, about one-third were based outside their country of origin (see ‘Mobility of PhD students studying abroad’). Among the 1,232 respondents studying abroad, the most common reason for their move — cited by 43% — was “a lack of funding at home”.\n\nThat proportion is on a par with Nature’s two previous PhD surveys in 2019 and 2022, when around 45% of those earning a PhD abroad said finances had played a key part in their move. However, in both of those surveys, it was not the top reason. Instead, that was “to experience another culture”, chosen by roughly half of respondents (49% in 2022 and 46% in 2019). But this year, only 35% selected that option. (Note that some options have changed from previous surveys, which might have influenced respondents’ selections.)\n\nOther motivations for studying abroad that have seen a drop include “more job opportunities post-study” (from 42% in 2019 to 35% in 2025) and “a lack of, or low quality, programmes at home” (40% in 2019 to 28% in 2025). Altogether, this suggests that students are making more-pragmatic decisions, guided by financial and career considerations rather than by personal exploration.\n\nThe numbers make sense, says Chris Glass at Boston College in Massachusetts, who researches trends in higher education. He says that shifting visa rules, uncertain post-study work permissions and geopolitical turbulence have “changed the calculus” for prospective PhD students globally. “International doctoral talent today demands tangible economic and scientific returns — not just the promise of experiencing another culture,” he adds.\n\nGlass says that students are increasingly asking: “Will I be able to stay and build a research career? Are my skills marketable in the host country — and globally?” He thinks that it’s both an adaptive response to policy headwinds and a sign that students are optimizing their choices for impact and opportunity in a world in which “uncertainty is the norm”.\n\nPolitical push\n\nPolitics is a minor motivation for moving abroad. Overall, just 7% of respondents say that political reasons influenced their decision, a share that has changed little since Nature asked the question in 2017.\n\nHow money, politics and technology are redefining the PhD experience\n\nBut among some nationalities, notably Russians and Americans, the proportion is higher. More than half (56%) of the 16 respondents from Russia studying abroad cited politics as a factor, as did nearly one-quarter (24%) of 46 students from the United States. By comparison, just 4% of respondents from India and 7% of those from China who were studying abroad said the same.\n\nUS students living and studying abroad said that repressive politics and the current presidential administration’s attitudes towards science and research were key reasons for their choice. Asked to elaborate on her reason for leaving, one woman studying in Switzerland simply wrote: “Trump…”\n\nTensions at home are also thwarting US students’ desire to move back after their PhDs. “I had planned to strongly consider returning to the United States but now those plans are, at a minimum, on hold,” says one in Australia, who requested anonymity out of fear of career repercussions. He says he has “little interest in returning to what amounts to a totalitarian regime” where people like him — a Jewish liberal in a polyamorous relationship — are “effectively targeted for maltreatment, harassment and potentially worse”.\n\nHe says that most of his friends who are early-career researchers back in the United States either have escape plans or are developing them. Australia is great, he says, because it’s more tolerant than the United States, and the physical infrastructure of roads and buildings “isn’t crumbling, like at home”. It’s also much safer. He used to keep his ‘stop the bleed’ kit clipped to his bag for instant access in case of a mass shooting. “Now, it’s just tucked in the bottom of my backpack.”\n\nRussian PhD student Daniil Kiselev studies in France, where he connects with the culture, including this eighteenth-century self-portrait of French painter Joseph Ducreux.Credit: Daniil Kiselev\n\nDaniil Kiselev, a PhD student originally from Russia, now at the University of Montpellier in France, left his home country in 2021. At the time, Russia had occupied Crimea, but the full-blown invasion of Ukraine had yet to happen. “Back then, options remained relatively rich. The path to work abroad was demanding, but straight and offered some visibility,” he says.",

          "abstract": "Fifteen years ago, my friend and mentor, climate scientist Stephen Schneider, said something that has stuck with me. When it comes to climate change, the “end of the world” and “good for you” are “the two lowest-probability outcomes”.\n\nExtreme heat harms health — what is the human body’s limit?\n\nSteve’s aphorism feels especially prescient today. As the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) plays out in Belém, Brazil, this month, misleading climate messaging in the media espouses both these extremes.\n\nAt one end, take the actions of billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. On 28 October, he astounded climate advocates by publishing a manifesto arguing that the climate crisis is less urgent than other major problems that humanity faces (see go.nature.com/23xed). Jarringly, its publication coincided with the devastating Jamaican landfall of potentially the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, an event that human-caused warming made more likely to happen.\n\nGates wasn’t implying that global warming is “good for you”, but his arguments are adjacent to that sentiment: there has already been enough progress on climate, and we should instead prioritize addressing what he feels are more pressing issues, such as poverty and disease.\n\nDespite substantial criticism from me and other climate specialists that this presented a false trade-off between climate action and public health, Gates dug in his heels. “What world do they live in?” he said in an interview with the news outlet Axios, telling reporters that he would “let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria”.\n\nClimate change is also a health crisis — these 3 graphics explain why\n\nIndeed, what world is Gates living in? The idea that climate action must come at the expense of efforts to address human health is a provable fallacy. In our book Science Under Siege (2025), public-health scientist Peter Hotez at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and I detail how these challenges are, in fact, inseparable. Human-caused climate change will exacerbate pandemics, as it did for COVID-19, and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. How Gates or anyone else proposes to “get rid of malaria” in a rapidly warming world is anyone’s guess. This is a strawman argument.\n\nGates’ pivot has been celebrated by climate-change downplayers and fossil-fuel proponents in politics, including US President Donald Trump, and in segments of the media, including the newspapers The Wall Street Journal and New York Post — even if Gates has disavowed their characterizations of his position.\n\nMeanwhile, those at the opposite ‘end of the world’ extreme are hardly any more helpful. “It may be too late” announced Robert Hunziker, a freelance writer in Los Angeles, California, just one month ago on the news site Counterpunch. Such narratives of doom are often reinforced by media outlets that overstate the dire nature of the impacts that are baked in, with breathless headlines about supposed tipping points that have already been crossed. This feeds a collective sense of hopelessness.\n\nWhy we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change",

          "title": "Sinking cities: how China is moving subsidence research forward",
          "authors": "Xiaoying You",
          "abstract": "As China’s cities become taller, bigger and more modern, they face a major problem: the ground beneath them is sinking. A 2024 study1 found that nearly half of the land under the country’s major cities is subsiding at a “moderate” rate of more than 3 millimetres a year, and 16% is experiencing “rapid” sinking, meaning greater than 10 millimetres annually.\n\nMany of these cities, such as Tianjin, Fuzhou and Ningbo, are located by the sea. The issue of land subsidence is so pressing that the study projected that one in ten residents of the country’s coastal cities will be living below sea level by 2120 if current trends continue.\n\nThe consequences are already showing. In 2023, nearly 4,000 people in Tianjin — a port city of more than 13 million residents — had to be evacuated from high-rise apartment buildings after the streets outside suddenly split apart. Scientists sent to investigate the site believe that the problem was caused by a ‘geological cavity’ some 1,300 metres under the ground, according to the city’s government. They pointed to the drilling of a geothermal well as a possible trigger, which might have caused subterranean water and soil loss, leading the land to give way.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science cities\n\nChina’s plight provides a snapshot of a global crisis. Eight of the world’s ten largest cities are situated on the coast, including Shanghai, New York, India’s Mumbai and Lagos in Nigeria, and all of them are dealing with subsidence. The megacities that are rapidly expanding along Asia’s shores are among the fastest-sinking cities on the planet, according to a 2022 study2.\n\nThe highest subsidence rates have been recorded in Tianjin, Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City and Bangladesh’s Chittagong; parts of these cities were found to be subsiding at peak speeds of more than 50 millimetres per year. In North America, subsidence is also widespread. An analysis of 28 major US cities, including coastal cities such as Houston and New York, published this year3 estimated that at least one-fifth of all mapped urban areas are sinking, affecting some 34 million people.\n\nSubsidence is not an issue that any one country can fight on its own. Some Chinese cities, such as Shanghai and Guangzhou, have modelled initiatives based on what’s worked in the Netherlands, for example, one of the lowest-lying countries in the world. Residents and institutions are encouraged by their local government to collect and reuse rainwater, such as by installing ‘green roofs’ covered with vegetation to hold rainwater, and building communal gardens to absorb or slow runoff.\n\nChina is also passing on its knowledge to other developing countries. In 2023, Shenzhen shared its experience of evacuating people from partly subsided buildings with policymakers from Tripoli in Lebanon, through a collaborative effort co-organized by the United Nations Development Programme to help the city better respond to natural disasters.\n\nAccording to Liu Jianxin, a geophysicist at Central South University in Changsha, China, Chinese researchers are increasingly sharing data, writing papers and participating in workshops with international colleagues on the issue of subsidence. And, like Liu, many of them are based in inland cities that are also facing subsidence. “Tackling subsidence is a global effort,” Liu says.\n\nCoastal challenges\n\nCoastal cities are particularly susceptible to sinking because of their natural conditions. For one, they are often built on river deltas or coastal plains, where sediments compact over time, which leads to subsidence, says Ding Xiaoli, a geodesist at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, who measures and monitors Earth’s shape and size. Some coastal cities, such as Tokyo, also sit on earthquake-prone areas, where tectonic activity can contribute to subsidence.\n\nBut the growth of coastal cities itself — nearly one-third of the global population in 2018, or more than 2 billion, lived within 50 kilometres from the shore — is also greatly exacerbating the issue.\n\nSource: Cosby, A. G. et al. Sci. Rep. 14, 22489 (2024)\n\nIn China, the main cause of subsidence linked to human activity is the excessive extraction of groundwater as cities expand, says Zhang Yonghong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping in Beijing. The practice lowers the underground water level, which causes the surrounding soil to compact and the land to sink. “The building of infrastructure, such as subways, can also cause parts of a city to subside,” Zhang says.\n\nDisruption to the natural recharging of groundwater owing to paved urban surfaces can worsen the situation, says Yu Kongjian, a landscape architect at Peking University in Beijing. “Land subsidence is one of the most profound manifestations of ecological mismanagement in urban regions,” he says.\n\nCities are also getting heavier as they grow, says Zhao Qing, a geodesist at East China Normal University in Shanghai. Ongoing research by her team suggests that the increasing weight of buildings is one of the three factors — together with dropping groundwater levels and the nature of the soil — that are causing Shanghai and other cities in the Yangtze River Delta region to subside.\n\nNone of the above is unique to China, and some of these issues — such as groundwater extraction and building weight — often affect cities inland, too. But on the coast, these factors are driving the land downwards in areas that also face accelerated sea-level rise owing to climate change.\n\nThe speed at which sea levels are rising has more than doubled over the past three decades4, increasing from around 2.1 millimetres per year in 1993 to around 4.5 millimetres per year in 2023. By the end of this century, the global average sea level is projected to be up to 0.55 metres higher than the 1995–2014 average, even if the world limits global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement.\n\nA 2022 study5 that assessed 99 coastal cities around the world found that most of them saw parts of their land subside faster than the sea level was rising. At their current downward trajectories, they would be challenged by flooding much sooner than the timelines projected by sea-level models, the authors said.\n\nOne of the cities that has been struck by this double whammy is Jakarta, the current capital of Indonesia, an archipelagic country on the frontline of fighting sea-level rise. More than 40% of the city is already below sea level — where risks of flooding, storm surges, infrastructure damage and economic and life losses are particularly high — and by the middle of the century up to 95% of its coastal areas might be submerged. The grim prospect was a major factor in Indonesia deciding to move its capital to a different island by 2028.\n\nSince 2014, Indonesia has been building a 32-kilometre ‘Giant Sea Wall’ in a bid to shield Jakarta from flooding — a project that is expected to cost US$50 billion. But sea walls have shallow foundations, so they follow the movement of the land, says Pietro Teatini, a hydrologist at the University of Padova in Italy, and chair of the UNESCO Land Subsidence International Initiative (LaSII), a working group that aims to spread knowledge on subsidence around the world and help developing countries to better address the issue. “If the land subsides, the wall subsides, too,” he says.\n\nLand and sea\n\nA comparison of five coastal cities and five inland cities in China shows how each group has been pursuing research in areas related to climate change and aquatic life and environments over the past six years. Output is measured by Share — a fractional metric that quantifies cities’ output in the high-quality natural-sciences and health-sciences journals tracked by the Nature Index.\n\nSuccessful measures\n\nShanghai — the first city in China to identify subsidence — also faces the compounding effect of sinking ground and rising sea level. It sank by 1.69 metres from 1921 to 1965 as a result of excessive groundwater pumping. The city’s government has carried out a series of measures to tackle the issue over the past 60 years, mainly by restricting groundwater usage and replenishing groundwater supply using water from the Yangtze River, according to Ye Shujun, a hydrogeologist at Nanjing University in China. Those methods have reduced the speed at which Shanghai is sinking to within 6 millimetres a year, said Ye, who shared the city’s experience at a webinar organized by LaSII in early 2025.\n\nA lot of work has been done in China to address subsidence from scientific and technical points of view, says Teatini. “One of the most important” steps for tackling subsidence is the artificial recharging of groundwater, he says, which has proved effective in Shanghai. But he warns that the method is expensive, so it might be hard to introduce to poorer countries.\n\nTeatini points to the advanced equipment that Chinese cities use, such as extensometers, which measure how materials change under stress. Researchers drill down , sometimes to almost 1,000 metres, to place the devices at the bottom of Earth’s water-bearing layers, known as the aquifer system, to monitor which layers are compacting. “In Italy, we have three or four [extensometers] spread all over the country. In Shanghai, there are about 50,” says Teatini, who works with Chinese researchers regularly.\n\nSome of Teatini’s long-term collaborators come from the Capital Normal University in Beijing, which has forged a formal partnership with the University of Padova. They have teamed up in a series of studies, ranging from assessing the causes of Beijing’s subsidence to developing models for predicting the problem.\n\nTo Teatini, China’s action to reduce land subsidence has been “very, very effective”. One of its achievements comes through the South–North Water Transfer Project, a colossal infrastructure project launched by the government to divert water from the south of the country to the water-stressed north. Although the main goal of the project is to balance water supplies, it has played a crucial role in mitigating long-term subsidence of the North China Plain by reducing the extraction of groundwater. Before the project went into operation in 2014, Beijing, situated in the country’s arid north, had heavily relied on groundwater and suffered severe subsidence of up to 159 millimetres a year as a result.",

          "abstract": "Fair Doses: An Insider’s Story of the Pandemic and the Global Fight for Vaccine Equity Seth Berkley Univ. California Press (2025)\n\nMost people don’t like getting vaccines, much less seeing their children have needles poked into their thighs and arms. But context can change that. Besieged by terrifying outbreaks of paralytic polio and the spectre of iron-lung respirators, many parents were happy to see their children receiving the first polio vaccinations in the 1950s. Similarly, when I got my first COVID-19 vaccine, it instantly relieved the sense of existential dread that I had felt for almost a year as the death toll rose.\n\nThe radical plan for vaccine equity\n\nTraumatic memories from the pandemic are waning for many. But infectious-disease epidemiologist Seth Berkley thinks the prospect of future pandemics means that it is imperative that we do not forget about the powerful impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. In Fair Doses — a fascinating account of the race to distribute the drug around the world — he attempts to provide readers with a ‘booster shot’ to restore public-health awareness.\n\nBerkley is ideally positioned to tell the story. In 2020, he was the chief executive of global-health organization Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gavi, along with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations and others, co-founded COVAX — a worldwide initiative to access, purchase and deliver billions of doses of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The author rightly spends little time on the science of the vaccine or the disease itself. Instead, his aim is to describe the complex and interwoven financial, legal, practical, ethical and political issues involved in securing and equitably distributing vaccines to more than 140 territories.\n\nThese complexities led to a series of challenges for COVAX leaders. As Berkley recalls, “I thought that this time, because of COVAX, we could tackle a pandemic with a meaningful, global commitment to equity. How wrong I was.”\n\nA gargantuan effort\n\nCOVAX’s goal was wildly ambitious, especially given the world’s abject failure to distribute influenza vaccines equitably a decade earlier during the 2009–10 flu pandemic. With those flu vaccines, Berkley notes that LMICs were left “at the back of queue”. As he highlights, the drugs arrived too late to prevent a substantial burden of disease — and in some countries, essentially didn’t arrive at all.\n\nLearn from COVID: Gates’s pandemic prescription\n\nBy contrast, COVAX was, in many ways, a success. By the end of 2021, more than one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses had been distributed, and two billion had been distributed by the end of 2023. More than half (57%) of the population in the world’s 92 lowest-income countries ended up receiving the one or two doses required (depending on the brand of vaccine) for initial protection, as compared with the global average of 67%. Doses supplied by COVAX are estimated to have averted 2.7 million deaths in low-income countries by the end of 2022.\n\nBerkley describes in depth the challenge of raising the billions of dollars needed for the scheme from foundations and governments, which were scrambling to fund their own vaccine programmes. It was this need to attract funds that led COVAX leaders to decide at the outset to invite high-income countries to participate in the initiative.\n\nThe major attraction for wealthy nations was that COVAX negotiated supply contracts with a wide range of vaccine developers. By joining the initiative, these countries could ensure access to the most safe and effective vaccines, rather than being reliant on whichever vaccine developer they could strike a deal with. Although the decision to involve high-income countries was, according to Berkley, “one of the biggest controversies in setting up COVAX”, it proved successful in helping to attract enough funds up front to purchase vaccines for the world.\n\nInitiatives that equitably distribute vaccines during a pandemic can save many lives.Credit: Issam Rimawi/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nOne of the fundamental challenges faced by COVAX leaders when doses started to become available in early 2021 was deciding what equitable distribution would look like. Some countries lacked the infrastructure needed to accept a large number of doses and COVAX didn’t want to send vaccines to countries that couldn’t store or transport them properly. As more doses became available throughout the year, some middle- and higher-income countries that had signed up for COVAX doses managed to procure their own vaccines. That led to a debate about whether they should still be provided with COVAX vaccines that they might not need. Moreover, evidence gradually emerged that many African countries seemed to be less susceptible than elsewhere, on a population-wide basis, to severe COVID-19 disease outcomes. This phenomenon is still not well understood, but it suggested that vaccine needs and demand might be less than previously predicted.\n\nBerkley notes the impossibility of devising a transparent algorithm that can integrate all of these factors and output a fair mechanism for vaccine distribution. Ultimately, and controversially, COVAX leaders decided from the outset that the initiative would aim to meet a blanket 20% of the vaccine needs for each country, regardless of other factors. These targets were based on a prediction of how much vaccine could be produced by the end of 2021 — and were later revised upwards.\n\nThe racial injustice laid bare by COVID must not be forgotten\n\nDespite involving wealthy nations in their initiative, COVAX inevitably ended up directly competing for vaccine supplies with these countries, especially when supplies were initially limited, because wealthy countries could pay higher prices and pay up front. Despite manufacturers’ contractual obligations, COVAX sometimes found their vaccine orders delayed or deprioritized compared with those of other purchasers.\n\nSome countries went from refusing to share any doses with COVAX — despite having secured many more than their populations needed — to offering leftover doses of vaccines that were about to reach their expiration dates. Some earmarked their donations to particular ‘friendly’ countries, regardless of COVAX’s carefully planned distribution programme, and demanded immediate acceptance of their publicly visible, politically sensitive ‘gifts’, regardless of the readiness of countries to receive them.",

          "title": "Why space exploration needs science leadership now — before it’s too late",
          "authors": "Gioia Rau",
          "abstract": "The past two years have seen a series of milestones in lunar exploration. In February 2024, a commercial lander built by Intuitive Machines in Houston, Texas, did what only superpowers had achieved before: touch down on the Moon and deliver NASA science payloads. Four months later, China’s Chang’e-6 returned the first samples from the far side of the Moon, a site that China plans to build a radio telescope on, in partnership with African nations.\n\nWhy space exploration must not be left to a few powerful nations\n\nThe next few years could be just as momentous. In the United States, President Donald Trump proposed US$7 billion for lunar exploration in 2026. His administration’s 2027 priorities go further, calling for investments that “unlock new mission capabilities, enable discoveries, and achieve exploration goals”, including nuclear power, local-resource use and biotechnology in space (see go.nature.com/4812vla).\n\nIt’s a new era for space exploration, motivated by a mix of geopolitics, potential commerce and discovery. Establishing humans on the Moon, Mars and beyond is no longer just an aspiration: it is driving strategies, markets and missions today.\n\nThe Artemis Accords — a shared set of principles to enhance the governance of civil exploration and use of outer space — had been signed by 59 nations as of October. Yet science is being left behind. Ensuring that space ambitions remain science-driven is essential if exploration is to yield knowledge and innovation.\n\nAs an astrophysicist who has worked across government, academia and philanthropy, here I argue that scientific inquiry must guide and shape this next wave of space exploration; I set out five priorities for action. What happens in the next few years will define our future.\n\nEmbed science in partnerships\n\nIn space, science is the compass that ensures exploration yields lasting value. As a first step, partnerships between academia, government, industry and philanthropy that are focused on space exploration need to be built — with science in the driving seat. These can align around a shared purpose: missions that deliver both knowledge and scientific and technical progress.\n\nEveryone benefits. The record shows that when science leads, it multiplies returns: innovation thrives; economies grow; and national strategies and international partnerships strengthen and drive advances in technologies. For example, Skylab, the first US space station, advanced solar power for human space flight. The Hubble Space Telescope includes modular components that can be replaced or upgraded, demonstrating how modular hardware can enable maintenance in space. The International Space Station is a joint effort between countries including the United States and Russia, demonstrating how scientific partnerships are invaluable for diplomacy.\n\nMany national space agencies, and increasingly private actors working in partnership with them, are planning to establish a sustained human presence on the Moon and chart a path toward Mars (see ‘Window of opportunity’). This Moon-to-Mars era must follow past precedents of scientific diplomacy. It must also ensure that scientific return is a core design principle: shaping missions, payloads and infrastructure from the outset, not as an afterthought. If scientists show up early with clear priorities and mission-ready payloads, industry can integrate them, governments can align policy and philanthropy can bridge funding gaps.\n\nWindow of opportunity\n\nThe next five years will see dozens of spacecraft* head to the Moon and Mars. Each one is a crucial platform for scientific and technological learning, not least because results are hard won — only about 40% of missions have succeeded since 2023.\n\nLaunchNationMission nameMission purposeMission status2023IndiaChandrayaan-3Lunar south-pole lander and roverSuccessful2023RussiaLuna 25Lunar south-pole landerFailed2024ChinaQueqiao-2Relay satellite for far-side commsSuccessful2024ChinaChang’e 6Far-side sample returnSuccessful2024JapanSLIMLunar lander and roversPartial success2024United StatesPeregrine 1Commercial lunar landerFailed2024United StatesIM-1 (Odysseus)Commercial lunar south-pole landerPartial success2025JapanHAKUTO-R Mission 2Commercial lunar lander and roverFailed2025United StatesBlue Ghost 1Commercial lunar lander with NASASuccessful2025United StatesIM-2 (Athena)Commercial lunar lander and roversPartial success2025United StatesESCAPADETo Mars by 2026 to study atmospherePlanned2026ChinaChang’e 7Lunar south pole, orbiter, lander, roverPlanned2026JapanMartian Moons eXploration (MMX)Orbit of Phobos and Deimos and return sample from Phobos to Earth in 2031Planned2026United StatesArtemis IICrewed lunar flybyPlanned2026United StatesBlue Ghost 2Lunar far-side landing with telescopePlanned2026United StatesIM-3Commercial lunar landingPlanned2026United StatesGriffin 1Commercial lunar south-pole landerPlanned2026United StatesBlue Moon Mark 1Lunar lander demonstrationPlanned2026United Statesispace Mission 3Commercial lunar far-side landingPlanned2027IndiaChandrayaan-4Lunar sample return missionPlanned2027RussiaLuna 26Lunar polar orbiterPlanned2027United StatesGateway PPE + HaloLunar orbital station componentsPlanned2027United StatesIM-4Bring technology for later crewed missionsPlanned2027United StatesArtemis IIICrewed landing at south polePlanned2028ChinaChang’e 8Technology demonstration on MoonPlanned2028ChinaTianwen-3Mars sample-return missionPlanned2028India/JapanLUPEXLunar south-pole water-ice explorationPlanned2028United StatesArtemis IVCrewed docking with NASA Gateway lunar space stationPlanned2028United StatesBlue Ghost 3Lunar rover and NASA payloadsPlanned2029United StatesBlue Ghost 4Lunar landing at crater rim with roversPlanned2030ChinaLanyueFirst Chinese astronauts on MoonPlanned2030United StatesArtemis VCrewed lunar landing with Blue Origin landerPlanned2031United StatesArtemis VIDelivery of crew and science module to Gateway and crewed lunar landingPlanned\n\n*This table shows missions with publicly available timelines and is not exhaustive. Source: Analysis by G. Rau.\n\nFor example, NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative exemplifies this new model by procuring delivery services from industry to send science and technology payloads to the Moon more quickly. Yet its commercial timelines and contract structures often lock in technical parameters before science teams can shape key elements such as site access, contamination control and interface standards. If this initiative and other lunar delivery efforts, such as the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Argonaut lander or India’s Chandrayaan missions, are to realize their potential, scientific leadership must move upstream in decision-making: shaping selection of landing sites, contamination-control methods and data policies before contracts are signed.\n\nPhilanthropy can help by financially backing high-risk, high-reward demonstration projects, supporting open-data challenges and creating fellowship programmes that link scientists to commercial payloads. Foundations such as the Breakthrough Initiatives, Washington DC-based Carnegie Science, and Schmidt Sciences and the Simons Foundation, both in New York City, have already catalysed such advances in ground-based astronomy. Similar partnerships must now anchor space exploration in open data, shared tools and talent pipelines.\n\nWhy space foods aren’t just for space\n\nIndustry, too, stands to gain. When scientific needs drive standards — for example, reducing exhaust-plume pollution to avoid sample contamination, or minimizing electronic noise to enable radio astronomy — the resulting systems are more robust, interoperable and exportable. The first companies to align with such standards will shape the global supply chain for space development.\n\nWhen scientific requirements shape infrastructure, they improve reliability and operability. A lander or relay network built within scientific tolerances will outperform one optimized only for cost or speed. Science thus becomes not a constraint, but a competitive advantage.\n\nPolicy can lock in these incentives. For publicly funded lunar and Mars flights, space agencies should reserve a share of payload mass (perhaps 20% or more) for competitively reviewed science projects and require that data are made open within six months of landing. They should tie award fees to science-readiness metrics, such as low radio noise, not just to delivery. Internationally, agencies should set up a science coordination forum under existing frameworks, such as the Artemis Accords, to align emission standards, relay-satellite pointing and site-protection rules.\n\nRecognize the Moon’s significance\n\nThe Moon is more than a stepping stone to Mars and beyond — it is a destination uniquely suited to conducting research. Unlike Earth, it has no atmosphere, liquid water or plate tectonics to erase its history. Its surface is a natural archive of roughly 4.5 billion years of Solar System evolution: from planetary formation and asteroid bombardment to solar and cosmic radiation preserved in the lunar soil, or regolith.\n\nPolar craters might contain water ice and organics deposited by ancient comets. Such records could reveal where Earth’s volatile compounds, such as water, came from; whether life’s precursors were common; and how habitable environments emerged. The far side of the Moon is the only place in the inner Solar System that is shielded permanently from radio signals from Earth, making it a unique site for probing the distant Universe and searching for signs of extraterrestrial life.\n\nHow to chart a moral future for space exploration\n\nThe lunar surface could host observatories that are impossible to have elsewhere. For example, long-baseline interferometers (devices that combine input from multiple telescopes) operating at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths — ones that would be absorbed by the atmosphere on Earth — could image the surfaces of stars1. By detecting ground vibrations from moonquakes and impacts, seismic arrays might map the Moon’s interior. Networks of reflectors could bounce back laser beams from Earth to test fundamental physics and theories of the Earth–Moon system2.\n\nYet these opportunities are fragile. Rocket exhaust, dust and drilling can contaminate pristine deposits at the lunar poles. Communications satellites orbiting the Moon could spill signals that erase the far side’s radio silence. If scientists simply wait their turn, these crucial sites will be disturbed permanently by others.\n\nMoreover, what is constructed on the Moon now will define what is built everywhere else in space. Choices regarding communications, power and mobility infrastructures will shape what science is possible on the lunar surface and beyond, to Mars, asteroids and deep-space orbital platforms.\n\nThe window for action is now: hardware is flying, sites are being chosen and norms are embedded in contracts and operations. Scientists must step up and study the Moon intensely over the next few years, before it’s too late.\n\nFly payloads that are ready now\n\nDespite growing investment in space exploration, many research opportunities remain untapped because instruments are stuck in outdated bureaucratic cycles. NASA’s science budget is expected to face drastic cuts in 2026 and 2027, as federal funds are shifted towards human exploration. Many science missions have long time frames, with launches planned for decades from now, a far cry from the fast and furious approach of the commercial space sector. This cadence gap means that valuable lunar sites could soon be developed without scientific involvement.\n\nThe fix is simple: fly scientific pathfinder payloads now. Iterate fast, learn fast and scale up what works. Announce payload-delivery opportunities on a rolling schedule that is aligned with confirmed flight windows — then scientists can plan and apply on a predictable cadence.\n\nCommercial off-the-shelf parts make it possible to build and fly viable research missions quickly and at a fraction of the cost of bespoke ones. Compact seismometers, neutron spectrometers and radio antennas can hitch rides on commercial landers or piggyback on communication relay satellites. Such projects would complement NASA’s billion-dollar flagship missions and, crucially, ensure that scientists bank essential measurements before lunar environments are irreversibly altered.\n\nPotential projects abound. Radio experiments on the lunar far side and prototype optical or UV interferometers could open the way for future experiments. Lightweight seismic and heat-flow sensors can refresh Apollo-era models of the lunar interior, guide the design of human habitats on the surface and constrain moonquake hazards for future infrastructure. Miniature drills and spectrometers could sample volatile compounds that are frozen at the Moon’s poles, revealing how water and organic molecules were delivered.\n\nThe challenge is coordination. Governments should prioritize ready-to-fly payloads through streamlining of funding channels and speeding up review. An annual budget of at least $1 billion in the United States would match the current pace of commercial international launches. Promising collaboration models include NASA’s Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads initiative, which selected a dozen instruments in 2024 for short-term delivery, as well as ESA’s Open Space Innovation Platform and Japan’s JAXA small-mission calls.\n\nA $50-million philanthropic programme could deploy a dozen small spacecraft for solar physics and planetary sampling or fund a fine-resolution lunar map. Such investments echo how private foundations once underwrote early radio telescopes and genome sequencing: short-cycle, high-risk and catalytic projects.\n\nAs data volumes from lunar sensors grow, fresh partnerships are pioneering innovative data handling and storage — from relay-based computing on lunar and Martian networks to the first orbital data centres being developed by firms such as Starcloud in Redmond, Washington, among others.\n\nBuild to fit scientific needs\n\nIn space, infrastructure is policy. Choices about how and where we build will determine not only what science is possible, but also who can do it.",

Whether they’re building sea walls or coral nurseries, or helping to create rich records of flooding events and cultural artefacts, coastal locals are shoring up their neighbourhoods. Scientists Taukiei Kitara from Tuvalu, Hannah Eisler Burnett from New York City and Apple Chui from Hong Kong are working to ensure that the people dealing with coastal challenges have the advocacy, training and protection they need.\n\nTAUKIEI KITARA: Island advocate\n\nSea levels in the Pacific are predicted to rise by 15 cm or more by the 2050s, regardless of global carbon-emission reductions. When this happens, parts of Tuvalu — a group of nine main islands midway between Hawaii and Australia — will vanish forever. “It’s going to be a significant loss for our people,” says Taukiei Kitara, who was born on Nui, a Tuvaluan atoll. Now based at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, Kitara studies how climate change is impacting the culture, identity and sovereignty of small island states in the Pacific.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science cities\n\nThe effect on Tuvalu, which has an average elevation of less than 2 metres above sea level, is severe. Increasingly warmer waters have bleached corals and forced fishermen farther out to sea. Seawater has seeped into the water table, forcing Tuvaluans to grow swamp taro and other staple crops in raised garden beds rather than underground pits — a practice that dates back thousands of years. Rising sea levels are also eroding the coastlines. Kitara says that after his birth, half of his umbilical cord was buried under a newly planted coconut tree some 30 or 40 metres away from the ocean’s edge, as per Tuvaluan tradition. “Now it’s right on the coastline,” he says.\n\nMoving is an option for some Tuvaluans. Australia offers visas for 280 Tuvaluans each year to migrate and obtain permanent residency under the 2023 Falepili Union Treaty — a first-of-its-kind ‘climate visa’ designed to aid climate-induced migration. More than 3,000 Tuvaluans (almost one-third of the nation’s population) have entered a ballot for the first release of visas. But many Tuvaluans aren’t keen on becoming climate refugees, says Kitara, whose research explores the potential impacts of the treaty.\n\nIn a 2023 opinion piece1, Kitara and Carol Farbotko, also from Griffith University, argued that migrants from climate-vulnerable Pacific nations are often framed in Australia as both ‘unskilled labour’ and ‘climate migrants’, which reinforces harmful stereotypes and puts them at risk of workplace exploitation. Kitara and Farbotko called for more just and compassionate labour and climate-migration policies inspired by the Tuvaluan value of fale pili — caring for others like family.\n\nThose who have chosen to stay on Tuvalu are not giving up. The Tuvaluan government wants to bolster the country’s climate resiliency by “focusing on adaptation projects like land reclamation and raising the elevation of existing land”, says Kitara. Between 2017 and 2023, Tuvalu’s capital Funafuti was expanded by 5%, or 7.8 hectares, by dredging up sand from its lagoon. Sea walls were constructed on the outer islands of Nanumaga and Nanumea to protect some 2,780 metres of coastline from rising sea levels and storm surges.\n\nThe narrowest part of Funafuti island, Tuvalu.Credit: Kalolaine Fainu/Guardian/eyevine\n\nTuvalu is also seeking refuge in a more unusual place: the metaverse. Since 2023, efforts have been under way to create a ‘digital twin’ of the island nation — a virtual reconstruction that includes details such as the locations of shops, houses and trees, as well as records of cultural artefacts, including recipes, dances, stories and memories. The project, which is being run by the Tuvaluan government in partnership with agencies in Australia, the United States and New Caledonia, started with Te Afualiku, Tuvalu’s smallest and most vulnerable island2. Te Afualiku features the most detailed reconstruction, but all nine main islands of Tuvalu, plus its dozens of smaller islands and islets, have now been mapped in three dimensions, and Funafuti has been digitally recreated using drone and street-level imagery.\n\nKitara says there are some concerns around data security and how energy-expensive the exercise is, but “there are good incentives” behind the initiative. “In the worst-case scenario, if every island disappeared, they’ll still exist digitally”, which will help to preserve national identity, culture, government functions, sovereignty and maritime rights, he says. As part of the project, Tuvalu received its first undersea cable, which will boost Internet and mobile connectivity for its residents once completed later this year.\n\nTuvaluans are “pretty vocal” about the need for climate action, Kitara says. But the impacts won’t stop at Tuvalu’s shores. “We’re all in the same boat,” says Kitara. “If we address the issue, it’s a win for us Tuvaluans, but also a win for everyone.” — Sandy Ong\n\nHANNAH EISLER BURNETT: Flood watcher\n\nHannah Eisler Burnett knows first-hand the stresses of living in a flood-prone location. Having grown up on the Gulf coast of Mississippi in the southern United States, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Burnett has dedicated her career to helping coastal communities build resilience to flooding caused by high tides, storm surges and groundwater inundation.\n\n“Flood resilience comes from a variety of sources” beyond raising roads or elevating houses and flood-proofing basements, says Burnett. Behavioural changes such as organizing one’s neighbours to help clear a storm drain before a heavy rain event and building makeshift elevated paths through flood-prone areas are also important.\n\n“In several of the communities I work with, one or two people are central for communicating ahead of potential flooding through e-mail, Whatsapp or Facebook groups, helping people understand what the local impacts of a high-tide flood or heavy rain might be,” says Burnett, an anthropologist at New York Sea Grant, an initiative run by the State University of New York and Cornell University. The programme is one of 34 government–university partnerships that link coastal research with community needs in the United States.\n\nNew York City, where Burnett now lives, is also vulnerable to flooding. Climate change is driving more frequent and intense hurricanes in the Atlantic, which is increasing the risk of major storm-driven flooding in the city. The water that flanks it has risen about 30 cm since 1900 — a rate twice the global average — and is projected to rise by just under 200 cm by 2100. Researchers have estimated that storm-driven flooding events could become up to four times more common along the US east coast, which puts 2.2 million New Yorkers in low-lying neighbourhoods such as Queens and southern Brooklyn at risk.\n\nA core part of Burnett’s work involves building and maintaining a public database of flood photos called MyCoast for the Community Flood Watch Project, run by Sea Grant and the Science and Resilience Institute at Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn. The pictures, which are taken by members of the public across New York state, are used by the US National Weather Service to inform its messaging to local flood-management officials.\n\n“The photos from MyCoast helped them understand that tidal/coastal flooding is more widespread than previously thought,” says Burnett. She adds that the database also provided “a big impetus” for policymakers in New York City to install 500 flood sensors across all five of the city’s boroughs in 2022, after realizing their value in early flood prediction.\n\nAn image of a flooded street in Howard Beach, New York, submitted in 2024 to the MyCoast website, a tool for reporting coastal events such as storms and floods in selected US states.Credit: Theresa Miller/MyCoast\n\nLast year, Burnett helped launch the Jamaica Bay Community Flood Fellowship Program, which provides a platform for leaders from different neighbourhoods in and around Jamaica Bay — a large coastal estuary on the southern edge of Brooklyn and Queens — to collaborate on solutions to chronic flooding. She also helps to familiarize community members with resources such as tide tables, which display the predicted times and heights of tides at specific coastal locations.\n\nBurnett says it can be hard to convince some decision-makers that local insights — such as photos and interviews — are important in flood prediction. “A sensor can measure one thing, but a flood is something that’s happening in multiple dimensions,” she says.\n\nAt the same time, she praises how “innovative and clear-eyed” many residents, researchers and government agencies are when it comes to coastal resilience work. “New York City is a city of immigrants, who bring knowledge of flooding from many parts of the world and apply that knowledge in different ways,” says Burnett.

          "abstract": "Historical efforts to deinstitutionalize those experiencing mental illness in the USA have inadvertently positioned police officers as the typical first responders to emergency calls involving mental health crises and empower them to initiate involuntary psychiatric detentions. Although potentially lifesaving, such detentions are controversial and costly, and they may be medically inappropriate for some of those detained. Here we present evidence from two quasi-experimental designs on the causal effects of a ‘co-responder’ programme that pairs mental health professionals with police officers as first responders on qualified emergency calls. The results indicate that a co-responder programme reduced the frequency of involuntary psychiatric detentions by 16.5% (that is, 370 fewer detentions over 2 years; b = −0.180, 95% confidence interval −0.325 to −0.034) but had no detectable effect on programme-related calls for service, criminal offences or arrests. Complementary results based on incident-level data suggest this reduction reflects both a co-responder’s influence on the disposition of an individual incident and a reduction in future mental health emergencies.",

Linguists have long argued over the extent and causes of these grammatical ‘universals’. Using Grambank—a comprehensive database of grammatical features across the world’s languages—we tested 191 proposed universals with Bayesian analyses that account for both genealogical descent and geographical proximity. We find statistical support for about a third of the proposed linguistic universals. The majority of these concern word order and hierarchical universals: two types that have featured prominently in earlier work. Evolutionary analyses show that languages tend to change in ways that converge on these preferred patterns. This suggests that, despite the vast design space of possible grammars, languages do not evolve entirely at random. Shared cognitive and communicative pressures repeatedly push languages towards similar solutions.",

Among these, determining appropriate sample sizes for computational studies remains a critical but overlooked issue, particularly for model selection analyses. Here we introduce a power analysis framework for Bayesian model selection, a method widely used to choose the best model among alternatives. Our framework reveals that while power increases with sample size, it decreases as more models are considered. Using this framework, we empirically demonstrate that psychology and human neuroscience studies often suffer from low statistical power in model selection. A total of 41 of 52 studies reviewed had less than 80% probability of correctly identifying the true model. The field also heavily relies on fixed effects model selection, which we demonstrate has serious statistical issues, including high false positive rates and pronounced sensitivity to outliers.",

Drawing on recent behaviour publications from both fields, this Perspective highlights three issues relating to how they frame people. First, reference to ‘consumers’ in circular economy research contrasts with ‘people’ in some sustainable waste management papers. This represents an artificial separation of approaches to activities that are interwoven; furthermore, it implicitly defines a business agenda for the circular economy. Second, research into behaviour needs a broader methodological approach to identify variable needs and address underlying contextual and structural issues. Third, attention is needed to ongoing inequalities within and between countries that limit the effectiveness of circular economy implementation. Future research in these fields should prioritize human-centred approaches, including critical realism and qualitative methods, to uncover the socio-political constraints on behaviour and guide sustainability strategies that address the needs of people.",

Research on misinformation susceptibility is mostly focused on adults. However, adolescents encounter different types of (mis)information and undergo rapid social, emotional and cognitive changes. These changes can increase vulnerability to misinformation through social influence, emotional manipulation and cognitive biases, while also offering unique opportunities for resilience. Taking a developmental perspective, we outline how adolescents’ susceptibility to misinformation differs from that of adults, propose a research agenda to systematically study these processes and introduce a Bayesian framework of belief updating tailored to social media contexts. Finally, we highlight how these insights inform age-appropriate interventions to promote resilience. This Perspective underscores the vital role that social sciences have in understanding and combating the harmful influence of misinformation on youth’s beliefs and behaviours, while leveraging their strengths.",

However, reward-based learning in humans recruits multiple processes, including memory and choice perseveration; their contributions can easily be mistakenly attributed to RL computations. Here I investigate how much of reward-based learning behaviour is supported by RL computations in a context where other processes can be factored out. Reanalysis and computational modelling of 7 datasets ( n = 594) in diverse samples show that in this instrumental context, reward-based learning is best explained by a combination of a fast working-memory-based process and a slower habit-like associative process, neither of which can be interpreted as a standard RL-like algorithm on its own. My results raise important questions for the interpretation of RL algorithms as capturing a meaningful process across brain and behaviour.",

E-waste contains highly toxic substances (including lead, cadmium, mercury, brominated flame retardants and persistent organic pollutants) and a mix of precious metals (such as gold, silver and palladium)2.\n\nIn many developed countries, e-waste management systems are established and regulated. Yet in many low- and middle-income countries, e-waste recycling is primarily driven by the informal sector: it is typically conducted in unregulated environments and often without the use of protective equipment or modern technologies2. Practices such as open burning, acid leaching and manual dismantling are common. These methods release toxicants into the air, soil and water, which creates widespread community exposure. Workers engaged in dismantling electronic components often suffer impaired renal and hormonal function, as well as increased risk of DNA damage3,4,5. Residents who live near recycling sites have also reported reproductive health effects, which raises concerns about intergenerational impacts6.

These calls have included demands from affected parties to be given a seat at the table of AI evaluation. What, if anything, can public involvement add to the science of AI? In this perspective, we summarize the sociotechnical challenge of evaluating AI systems, which often adapt to multiple layers of social context that shape their outcomes. We then offer guidance for improving the science of AI by engaging lived-experience experts in the design, data collection, and interpretation of scientific evaluations. This article reviews common models of public engagement in AI research alongside common concerns about participatory methods, including questions about generalizable knowledge, subjectivity, reliability, and practical logistics. To address these questions, we summarize the literature on participatory science, discuss case studies from AI in healthcare, and share our own experience evaluating AI in areas from policing systems to social media algorithms. Overall, we describe five parts of any quantitative evaluation where public participation can improve the science of AI: equipoise, explanation, measurement, inference, and interpretation. We conclude with reflections on the role that participatory science can play in trustworthy AI by supporting trustworthy science.",

This work demonstrates that the foundational assumption of survey research—that a coherent response is a human response—is no longer tenable. I designed and tested an autonomous synthetic respondent capable of producing survey data that possesses the coherence and plausibility of human responses. This agent successfully evades a comprehensive suite of data quality checks, including instruction-following tasks, logic puzzles, and “reverse shibboleth” questions designed to detect nonhuman actors, achieving a 99.8% pass rate on 6,000 trials of standard attention checks. The synthetic respondent generates internally consistent responses by maintaining a coherent demographic persona and a memory of its prior answers, producing plausible data on psychometric scales, vignette comprehension tasks, and complex socioeconomic trade-offs. Furthermore, its open-ended text responses are linguistically sophisticated and stylistically calibrated to the level of education of its assigned persona. Critically, the agent can be instructed to maliciously alter polling outcomes, demonstrating an overt vector for information warfare. More subtly, it can also infer a researcher’s latent hypotheses and produce data that artificially confirms them. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability in our data infrastructure, rendering most current detection methods obsolete and posing a potential existential threat to unsupervised online research. The scientific community must urgently develop new data validation standards and reconsider its reliance on nonprobability, low-barrier online data collection methods.",

EACs complement IRBs by focusing on potential harms to participants and communities, offering dynamic risk assessments, and advising on program adaptations or termination. By providing impartial expertise, EACs help address potential conflicts of interest that may arise when researchers and implementers are invested in a program’s continuation. We illustrate the value of EACs through our experience implementing a cross-border labor migration program in Niger. Our EAC provided crucial guidance on scaling up the intervention after a pilot study and adapting the program following an unexpected military coup. While EACs introduce additional costs and may limit researcher autonomy, they generate accountability and are particularly valuable for novel and politically sensitive interventions in fragile environments.",

Designed in an “adversarial collaboration” among researchers with competing perspectives, these experiments disentangle whether students’ preferences for curtailing academic freedom are based on viewpoint discrimination, professional academic standards, or prosocial concerns. Our findings show that a substantive share of university students support viewpoint-based restrictions on academic discourse. While they also apply academic and prosocial criteria, they apply them more strongly to conservative viewpoints. The results further show that conservative statements are perceived as causing more social harm. However, prosocial concerns do not fully explain the higher demand for ideological viewpoint discrimination. These results are important because they can inform the debate about universities as ideological spaces—a view often invoked in recent government-led attacks on academic freedom.",

          "authors": "Mélusine Boon-Falleur, Elise Huillery, Coralie Chevallier",
          "abstract": "Many domains in life require people to wait to access better outcomes, such as waiting in line to access prized tickets for a show, waiting to obtain a job offer from a selective firm, or being waitlisted for a prestigious university. Although waiting might be perceived as a fair mechanism to allocate resources, it may have unintended consequences on social inequalities as individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (SES) may be less likely to wait. In this study, we investigate socioeconomic differences in waiting behavior during the higher education admission process in France. To do so, we leveraged a unique national database that recorded the admission behavior of every high schooler in France over a period of three years. During the admissions process, students faced a trade-off: They could either accept an immediate offer from a university or wait in the hope of receiving a preferred offer later. Results collected among 274,316 students reveal that low-SES students were significantly less likely to wait for preferred offers, even when controlling for objective costs and benefits of waiting. This led low-SES students to ultimately enroll in programs they liked less and that were less prestigious. These results highlight how admission procedures generating uncertainty and requiring students to wait may inadvertently exacerbate educational inequalities. Such systems, while efficient, can end up favoring students who wait more. This research contributes to current discussions on admission procedure fairness by illustrating that seemingly neutral algorithms can in fact deepen social inequalities if their design rewards patience.",

          "abstract": "Numerous research efforts have used paleoecological data to reconstruct past biodiversity in Europe. In these projects, researchers have identified increases in biodiversity over the Holocene and hinted at a positive correlation with human population. These are important findings but are not easily translated into effective biodiversity conservation and restoration policy. We argue that, in order to better inform policymaking, studies of past biodiversity dynamics should include analyses of contemporaneous cultural phenomena in order to identify and describe specific anthropogenic drivers of past biodiversity changes. We present an example here, a case study from the Lake Constance region (southwestern Germany), one of the core areas of the Carolingian Empire, the foundational political structure of modern Europe. This uniquely well-documented region offers six fossil pollen profiles characterized by high taxonomic and chronological resolution, archaeobotanical evidence from hundreds of excavation sites, and historical records describing population, commerce, and agriculture dating from the mid-700s CE. These data indicate that a major, sustained increase in plant diversity occurred in the Lake Constance region between 500 and 1000 CE, the formative period of medieval civilization. Plant diversity reached a 4,000-y peak around 1000 CE, making the medieval period a plant diversity optimum in the region. Archaeobotanical evidence independently corroborates this finding. Palynological, archaeobotanical, and archival data suggest that cultural innovations—in agriculture, management, and trade—were the primary drivers of this biodiversity transition and were necessary to maintain elevated levels of plant diversity in the region through the 20th century.",

          "abstract": "The conventional assumption is that stomatal conductance ( g s ) dominates the regulation of water and carbon dioxide fluxes between leaves and the atmosphere. Here, a nanoreporter of water status at the mesophyll cell surface and local xylem within intact maize leaves documents significant undersaturation of water vapor in the outside-xylem zone (OXZ) and a large loss of conductance of this zone ( g oxz ) at moderate xylem water stress, without stomatal closure or turgor loss. The ratio of the resistances ( 1 / g oxz ) / ( 1 / g s ) serves as a predictive phenotype of undersaturation, nonstomatal regulation of transpiration, errors in standard gas exchange analysis, and an increase of intrinsic water use efficiency ( iWUE ). Cell-scale access to water status reveals symplasmic-apoplasmic disequilibrium and informs a biophysical model that can explain experimental observations quantitatively based on localization of variable conductance to the plasma membrane. This work opens paths of inquiry into the molecular basis and functional consequences of nonstomatal regulation of transpiration.",

          "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the ecological footprints of pre-Columbian Indigenous peoples in Amazonia persist in modern forests. Ecological impacts resulting from European colonization c. 1550 CE and the Amazonian Rubber Boom c. 1850 to 1920 CE are largely unexplored but could be important additive influences on forest structure and tree species composition. Using environmental niche models, we show the highest probabilities of pre-Columbian and colonial occupation sites, and hence human-induced ecological influences, occurred in forests along rivers. In many areas, the predicted pre-Columbian and colonial distributions overlap spatially with the potential for superimposed ecological influences. Environmental gradients are known to structure Amazonian vegetation composition, but they are also strong predictors of past human influence, both spatially and temporally. Our comparisons of model outputs with relative abundances of Amazonian tree species suggest that pre-Columbian and colonial-period ecological legacies are associated with modern forest composition.",

Although G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of transmembrane receptors, their specific roles in the epidermis are not fully understood.

Among potential downstream guanine nucleotide-binding G proteins, ADGRL2 selectively activated Gα13. Follow-up tissue knockouts verified that Gα13 is also required for epidermal differentiation. A cryoelectron microscopy structure in lipid nanodiscs showed that ADGRL2 engages with Gα13 at multiple interfaces, including via an interaction between ADGRL2 intracellular loop 3 and a Gα13-specific QQQ glutamine triplet sequence in its GTPase domain. In situ gene mutation of this interface sequence impaired epidermal differentiation, highlighting an essential new role for an ADGRL2-Gα13 axis in epidermal differentiation.",

          "abstract": "We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the Nondeterministic Polynomial Time (NP) complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), hence coined DOCSAT, i.e. reduces their unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT instances with varying problem sizes up to N = 15,000. Quite remarkably, we find that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors. The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for generalization to other optimization problems.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is crucial for cellular energy production, metabolism, and signaling. Its dysfunction is implicated in various diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. mtDNA is susceptible to damage by endogenous and environmental factors; however, unlike nuclear DNA (nDNA), mtDNA lesions do not necessarily lead to an increased mutation load in mtDNA. Instead, mtDNA lesions have been implicated in innate immunity and inflammation. Here, we report a type of mtDNA damage: glutathionylated DNA (GSH-DNA) adducts. These adducts are formed from abasic (AP) sites, key intermediates in base excision repair, or from alkylation DNA damage. Using mass spectrometry, we quantified the GSH-DNA lesion in both nDNA and mtDNA and found its significant accumulation in mtDNA of two different human cell lines, with levels one or two orders of magnitude higher than in nDNA. The formation of GSH-DNA adducts is influenced by TFAM and polyamines, and their levels are regulated by repair enzymes AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1). The accumulation of GSH-DNA adducts is associated with the downregulation of several ribosomal and complex I subunit proteins and the upregulation of proteins related to redox balance and mitochondrial dynamics. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the GSH-DNA lesion stabilizes the TFAM-DNA binding, suggesting shielding effects from mtDNA transactions. Collectively, this study provides critical insights into the formation, regulation, and biological effects of GSH-DNA adducts in mtDNA. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding how these lesions may contribute to innate immunity and inflammation.",

To understand how temporally regulated responses to IL2 unfold in Tregs, we performed fine time-course analyses, at population and single-cell levels, of changes in chromatin architecture and mRNAs induced by IL2 in Tregs in vivo. The data revealed responses that were largely uniform in rTreg, but diverse among aTregs, matching different STAT5 signal transduction efficiency. Individual Tregs displayed divergences in the preponderance of changes that may be attributed to STAT1 or STAT5 signal transduction downstream of IL2. Chromatin analysis identified an evolving implication of transcription factors that accounted for the waves of responsive genes. Covalent cytokine/Ab complexes that preferentially trigger high- (heterotrimer) or low-affinity (heterodimer) IL2 receptors activated the same signatures, yet with strong quantitative variations, especially in NK cells. Thus, IL2 is not a monolithic activator for Tregs, but a variegated sculptor of Treg identity.",

          "abstract": "Throughout Earth’s history, organic molecules from both abiogenic and biogenic sources have been buried in sedimentary rocks. Most of these organic molecules have been significantly altered by geologic processes through deep time. Nonetheless, the nature and distribution of those ancient fragmentary organic remains have the potential to reveal diagnostic biomolecular information after billions of years of burial. Here, we analyzed 406 fossil, modern biological, meteoritic, and synthetic samples using pyrolysis gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We explored these analytical data via supervised machine-learning methods to discriminate samples of biogenic vs. abiogenic origin, plant vs. animal phylogenetic affinity, and photosynthetic vs. nonphotosynthetic physiology. Dividing 272 samples with known phylogenetic affinity and physiology into 9 categories, each further divided into 75% training and 25% testing sets, our random forest models accurately predict pairwise assignments of modern vs. fossil or meteoritic organics (100% correct assignments), fossil plant tissues vs. meteoritic organics (97%), modern vs. fossil plant tissues (98%), and modern plants vs. animal tissues (95%). Pairwise comparisons between fossil biogenic samples vs. abiogenic samples resulted in 93% correct classifications, while analysis of modern and ancient photosynthetic vs. nonphotosynthetic samples also resulted in 93% correct assignments. Our analyses demonstrate that molecular biosignatures can survive in ancient fossils and allow for the identification of organismal origins and traits. Consistent with previous morphological and isotopic inferences, we present evidence for biogenic molecular assemblages in Paleoarchean rocks (3.33 Ga) and for photoautotrophy in Neoarchean rocks (2.52 Ga).",

          "abstract": "Chirality is a conserved biological feature with critical implications in tissue morphogenesis and embryonic development. In culture, multicellular groups exhibit spontaneous chiral symmetry break when moving collectively on micropatterned surfaces. Although several studies have shown that actin network integrity and actomyosin network contractility contribute to the establishment of the chirality of the movement, the role of contractile forces to the directionality of the chiral bias in collectives remains to be elucidated. Here, we studied the contractile forces produced by a minimal collective constituted of a pair of endothelial cells. We first show that cell doublets confined on disk-shaped micropatterns undergo spontaneous and persistent chiral swirling, displaying a mild but robust clockwise bias, as the one observed in bigger collectives. This bias could be amplified or reversed by modulating contractile forces. Traction force measurements revealed that high forces tend to drive counterclockwise rotation whereas low forces rather favor a clockwise rotation. Furthermore, the study of heterotypic doublets indicates that the direction of the rotation is determined by the more contractile cells within the doublets. These results thus revealed that contractile leader cells could drive the chiral motion of minimal collectives.",

          "abstract": "During autophagy, the contents enclosed within autophagosomes are degraded, while the outer membrane components are recycled from autolysosomes by the recycler complex through the recently discovered autophagosomal components recycling (ACR) process. This recycling is essential for maintaining autophagic activity. However, the molecular machinery and upstream regulatory mechanisms driving this recycling process remain poorly understood. Here, we identify SNX16 as a key component of the recycler complex, which localizes to autolysosomes and is required for ACR. SNX16 functions in ACR by regulating recycler complex formation, facilitating cargo recognition, and mediating the connection between STX17–SNX4–SNX5 and dynein–dynactin complexes. In addition, SNX16–cargo interactions are regulated by two ACR-related small GTPases, Rab32 and Rab38. Importantly, mTORC1 phosphorylates SNX16 to regulate ACR by inhibiting its interactions with STX17 and other recycler components, thus preventing recycler complex formation. Taken together, our findings identify SNX16 as a recycler component and establish a link between mTORC1 and ACR.",

          "authors": "Natalia Lyubaykina, Dunja Knapp, Pietro Tardivo, Maximilian Kotz, Tatiana Sandoval-Guzmán, Benjamin M. Friedrich",
          "abstract": "Axolotls can regenerate lost limbs throughout life, while they continue to grow. This poses the question of how the size and pattern of a regenerating limb is matched to a widely varying animal size. Two interacting signaling molecules, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF8), are produced at opposite sides of the regenerating limb and sustain tissue growth through a pair of oppositely oriented signaling gradients. As the size of the regrowing tissue can vary more than three-fold depending on the size of the animal, it is unclear how the activities of these mutually dependent morphogens are maintained and subsequently terminated to determine appropriate growth. Scaling of limb regeneration suggests a size-dependent adaptation of morphogen gradient parameters. Inspired by this biological example, we theoretically investigate general mechanisms of morphogen-controlled growth arrest and proportional growth. In the proposed mechanism, tissue growth increases the spatial distance between the two morphogen gradients, which eventually arrests morphogen activity and growth. We put forward two distinct scaling scenarios of morphogen gradients: either dynamic scaling with blastema size, where morphogen gradient parameters change dynamically with the growing tissue, or static scaling with animal size, where morphogen gradient parameters stay constant during blastema growth and only depend on animal size. We show that static scaling ensures proportional growth, but dynamic scaling does not. We compare theory predictions to experimental quantification of SHH and FGF8 morphogen gradient parameters at different time-points of regeneration in different-sized animals, indicating static scaling for some morphogen parameters, which is sufficient to ensure proportional growth in our model.",

These effects have long been considered evidence for glassy physics in these and other materials having similar mechanics, such as the cytoskeleton. Here, we study such anomalous mechanics in a simulated wet foam driven by ripening and find behavior that has a different physical origin than that in glasses. Rather, the dynamics is due to a balance of forces from the system’s self-similar potential energy landscape and viscous stress. At the lowest viscosities, bubbles move intermittently, with the system shifting abruptly between shallow potential energy minima. For higher viscosities, in contrast, the bubbles move continuously and the system follows a tortuous, fractal path through high-dimensional configuration space, at higher mean energy than the lower viscosity case. The long-time dynamics and power-law rheology are the direct consequence of the potential energy landscape’s self-similar geometry. Last, we find that the slow recovery of perturbed foams is due to the foam being kinetically rather than energetically trapped in high-energy portions of the energy landscape. Overall, viscous ripening foams follow a biased energy minimization pathway that explores regions of the energy landscape that are qualitatively different (flatter and smoother) than those corresponding to well-annealed glasses.",

Cancer metastasis is regulated by complex crosstalk between tumor cells and niche-derived factors. However, the molecular mechanisms enabling metastatic seeding and outgrowth in the liver remain incompletely understood, representing a major clinical challenge. We identified neuropeptide Y (NPY) as a promotor of liver metastasis. Hepatocyte-derived NPY attracts metastatic tumor cells to the liver niche. Subsequent microenvironment activation induces TGFβ, promoting a vicious cycle of perimetastatic NPY secretion and liver metastasis. Concomitantly, cancer cells upregulate the NPY-5 receptor (Y5R) which is correlated with liver metastasis. NPY-Y5R crosstalk drives chemotactic migration via cAMP and ERK signaling. Moreover, NPY-Y5R activation dephosphorylates checkpoint kinase 2 to promote clonogenicity and proliferation of cancer cells. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a promising drug delivery vehicle for siRNAs. LNPs carrying siRNA pools targeting NPY were designed, and preclinical studies provided evidence for efficacy for the treatment of liver metastasis. Our findings transform the limitation of hepatocyte specificity of RNA interference into a therapeutic advantage, introducing a paradigm for the treatment of hepatic metastases.",

However, the mechanism for achieving specificity in downstream signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we present cryogenic electron microscopic structures of the S1PR3-G αq complex bound to endogenous agonists: d18:1 S1P or d16:1 S1P. Both agonists shared the same binding pocket and binding mode despite the different signaling intensities of the S1PR3-G αq signal pathway. By comparing the structures of two agonist-bound complexes, combined with mutagenesis studies, we identified key amino acids, Phe119 3.33 and Arg136 3.50 , that play crucial roles in differential agonist recognition and receptor activation. Furthermore, structural comparisons with previously determined S1PR3-G αi complex or G-protein-free S1PR3 structures, along with mutagenesis analysis, revealed dynamic intracellular loop 2 conformations and specific amino acid interactions that contribute to G-protein selectivity. Notably, we identified amino acids at the 34.50 and 34.53 positions within ICL2 as critical for specific interactions with G proteins.

          "abstract": "Nonsyndromic capillary malformations (CM) are seen predominantly in skin. In Sturge–Weber Syndrome (SWS), CMs occur in the skin, leptomeninges of the brain, and choroid of the eye. &gt;90% of CM are caused by a somatic mutation— GNAQ p.R183Q, the gene encoding the G-protein subunit Gα q . Longitudinal MRI of the brain in one SWS patient suggests developing vascular permeability. We modeled this in a transendothelial electrical resistance assay and found endothelial cells with GNAQ p.R183Q (EC-R183Q) exhibited increased permeability compared to EC wild-type. Increased vascular permeability was confirmed in a Gnaq p.R183Q mouse model. Knockdown of elevated angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) in EC-R183Q partially restored the EC barrier, as did a MEK1,2 inhibitor, implicating MAPK/ERK signaling. The combination of ANGPT2 knockdown and trametinib further restored the EC barrier in an additive manner. indicating the two operate in separate pathways. In summary, we found that EC-R183Q exhibits increased permeability, reflecting the compromised endothelial barrier in CMs.",

The Adipoq + Osx + cells predominantly reside in the endosteal niche. Intersectional genetic fate mapping with Dre and Cre recombinases demonstrates dual differentiation of osteoblasts and adipocytes from the Adipoq + Osx + cells in vivo.

          "abstract": "During photosynthesis, the photosystem II (PSII) enzyme catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water, fueling life on Earth by storing light energy and releasing O 2 as a byproduct. Determining the molecular mechanism for this water oxidation reaction has been of significant interest for the development of synthetic catalysts, but many details remain elusive. One of the open questions is how protons are strategically removed from the active site, a Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster called the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), during the reaction cycle via conserved water channels, and how proton transfer contributes to O–O bond formation energetics. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have investigated the role of conserved amino acid side chains in facilitating proton transfer. One of the most influential mutations is the Val185Asn substitution on the D1 subunit, which substantially slows O 2 release kinetics without abolishing catalytic activity. Forming a molecular understanding of how this mutation affects the active site will provide insight into the water oxidation reaction mechanism. Here, we investigated the structural basis of the Val185Asn substitution by determining a 1.99 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure. We observed that Asn185 orients away from the OEC and donates a H-bond to Cl1, a conserved chloride ion. We furthermore observed an alternative D2-Glu312-facing conformation of the D2-Lys317 side chain in the Cl1 water channel, a conformation that is consistent with recent models for proton transfer. These changes also produce perturbations to the hydrogen-bonding network. Overall, these finding provide insight into proton transfer in the Cl1 channel and its effect on the water oxidation reaction mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Spatiotemporal correlation of magnetic field fluctuations is investigated using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The first observation of the turbulence propagator in space emerges through analysis of more than a thousand intervals. Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space–time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfvénic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions. Through direct observation, this study provides insight into the space–time structure of turbulent space plasmas, while giving critical constraints for theoretical and numerical models.",

Here, we report observations of ozone from the surface of another planet, using the ozone detector included in the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) Radiation and Dust Sensor (RDS) aboard NASA’s Mars 2020 mission, complementing previous space-based and ground-based observations from Earth. Measurements were acquired at Jezero Crater, Mars, at midday, retrieving an average ozone column abundance of 3.8 ± 2.3 μm-atm (1σ) around aphelion, which fell below uncertainties in northern summer. The retrieved column abundance is in reasonable agreement with previous space-based and ground-based observations from Earth. The measurements of total ozone column abundance around aphelion from Mars 2020 and other missions, together with vertical profile observations from orbit, indicate that ~90% of the observed ozone is confined below 20 km of altitude, the aphelion layer weakly contributing to the total column abundance. These ozone levels below 20 km are 3 to 4 times higher than those predicted by models, challenging current understanding of atmospheric chemistry and composition in the lower atmosphere of Mars. It may be possible that aerosols are reducing the destruction pathways of ozone and/or that unknown active chemistry in the near-surface atmosphere of Mars is at work. Both cases should strongly modify the oxidizing capacity in the lower atmosphere of Mars from current model predictions.",

          "abstract": "Fluorescence in phytoplankton and other autotrophic organisms originates within the cell chloroplasts, where a fraction of the absorbed solar radiation is reemitted at longer wavelengths by photopigments. While traditionally employed as an indicator of physiological status, emerging evidence suggests that natural chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) may also play unanticipated functional roles in the marine environment. Here, we examine the ChlF emission fields generated by pennate planktonic diatoms, a key phytoplankton group playing a critical role in global biogeochemical cycles. Using cell micromanipulation experiments, we demonstrate that the ChlF emitted by Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta (Bacillariophyceae) is markedly anisotropic, a feature attributed to both the cells’ elongated morphology and the arrangement of chloroplasts within the cytoplasm. In these diatoms, fluorescence is preferentially emitted in the transapical direction, accounting for up to 35% of total emission. However, peak ChlF intensities occur at the cell apices, suggesting that the silica frustule focuses fluorescent light emission along the longitudinal axis. At elevated cell densities (~10 6 cells/L), the underwater light field is modulated by the combined effects of ChlF emission anisotropy and preferential alignment of diatom cells within the water column. Numerical simulations indicate that ChlF intensity can vary by up to 15% depending on whether cells are predominantly aligned—commonly in stratified water columns—or randomly oriented. These results suggest that diatom-driven modulation of the light field through structured ChlF emission may influence microscale optical environments, with potential consequences for processes ranging from intercellular signaling to large-scale phytoplankton dynamics, including remote sensing–based assessments of phytoplankton physiology.",

          "abstract": "Coacervates are suggested to be viable protoenzymes due to their propensity to act as catalytic microreactors for biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism by which they alter reaction thermodynamics remains unclear. While extensive research has been conducted displaying the ability of coacervates to compartmentalize a wide variety of reactants, products, and catalysts, insight into how reactant, transition state, and product energies are altered within the droplet continues to be an active area of research. One promising strategy for investigating the thermodynamics and kinetics within the coacervate phase is temperature-dependent electrochemistry, which enables the extraction of reaction entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs energy. In this work, we use ferri/ferrocyanide, a well-behaved redox couple that has been proposed to be an essential oxidizing agent in prebiotic Earth, to investigate the microenvironment created by the coacervation of poly-L-lysine and polyuridylic acid. We observe an oxidative shift upon partitioning into the coacervates, which temperature-dependent experiments reveal is due to a 40 J/mol K and an 8 kJ/mol increase in reaction entropy and enthalpy, respectively. We attribute the change in entropy to a highly structured water hydrogen-bonding network within the droplets and, subsequently, around the redox probe. Further, we reveal via in situ Raman measurements that the change in reaction enthalpy is due to the destabilization of the product, ferrocyanide, within the ionic coacervate phase.",

Remarkably, SelO-mediated AMPylation is conserved in bacteria and humans, yet the enzyme that removes the AMP from modified proteins remains unknown. We show that the ribonuclease, RNase Z, is both necessary and sufficient to catalyze deAMPylation of AMPylated substrates. These results establish RNase Z as a moonlighting enzyme with previously unrecognized functional roles beyond tRNA processing, expanding our understanding of its biological significance.

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which fuels metastasis and resistance to immunotherapy. Through comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we identified multiple heterogeneous tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs) subpopulations as key regulators of PDAC progression, which coexpress MRC1 and exert their effects by actively suppressing antitumor immune responses. To overcome this barrier, we developed a spatiotemporal macrophage reprogramming platform that leverages STING phase separation to reprogram TAM plasticity and reshape the immune landscape. This system, MRC1-targeting peptide–M@BLZ945 (PMMB), integrates a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor and a STING agonist within a macrophage-mimetic nanostructure, enabling sequential, controlled reprogramming of TAMs. By leveraging STING phase separation, PMMB stabilizes TAMs in an antitumor CD80 + phenotype while preventing excessive inflammation, achieving durable immune activation. In preclinical models, PMMB not only suppresses both primary and metastatic PDAC but also enhances CD8 + T cell infiltration, reinvigorates anti-PD-1 therapy responses, and mitigates immune exhaustion. These findings establish spatiotemporal macrophage circuit engineering via STING phase separation as a cross-scale strategy to override PDAC’s immune barriers and drive next-generation macrophage-targeted immunotherapy.

          "abstract": "Natural genetic transformation is a conserved mechanism of bacterial horizontal gene transfer, which is directed entirely by the recipient cell and facilitates the acquisition of new genetic traits such as antibiotic resistance. Transformation proceeds via the capture of exogenous DNA, its internalization in single strand form (ssDNA) and its integration into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. While the proteins involved in these steps have mainly been identified, the specific mechanisms at play remain poorly characterized. This study takes advantage of recent advances in structural modeling to explore the uptake of ssDNA during transformation. Using the monoderm human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae , we model a tripartite protein complex composed of the transmembrane channel ComEC, and two cytoplasmic ssDNA-binding proteins ComFA and ComFC. Using targeted mutation and transformation assays, we propose that pneumococcal ComEC features a narrow channel for ssDNA passage, and we show this channel is conserved in the diderm Helicobacter pylori . We identify key residues involved in protein–protein and protein–ssDNA interactions in the pneumococcal tripartite complex model and we show them to be crucial for transformation efficiency. Structural modeling reveals that this tripartite protein complex and its interaction with ssDNA are conserved in Firmicutes. Overall, this study validates a tripartite complex required for the internalization of ssDNA during transformation in Firmicutes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in this horizontal gene transfer mechanism central to bacterial adaptation. It also demonstrates the power of recent structural modeling techniques such as AlphaFold3 as hypothesis generators and guides for designing experiments.",

          "abstract": "During microbial infection, mammalian hosts reduce the availability of free metals such as zinc in a process known as nutritional immunity. Pathogens counteract nutritional immunity by expressing gene products that enhance growth in metal-limited conditions. One of the most transcriptionally induced genes in zinc-limited Neisseria gonorrhoeae , ngo1049, encodes a DUF4198 family protein we have named Zcp. This family of proteins is widely distributed in Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we provide the first structural, biochemical, and functional characterization of a DUF4198 protein. Zcp is a periplasmic, homodimeric substrate-binding protein (SBP), which binds one zinc ion per subunit with submicromolar affinity. We identified a zinc binding pocket in each subunit, composed of three histidine residues. Zcp enables maximal growth of N. gonorrhoeae in zinc-limited conditions but is dispensable for zinc uptake, in contrast to the cluster A-I SBP ZnuA, which is required for zinc import. The growth defect of zcp mutant N. gonorrhoeae is rescued by zinc supplementation. Zcp associates with proteins with roles in maintaining cell envelope integrity, and N. gonorrhoeae lacking zcp is more sensitive to envelope-targeting antimicrobials. Zcp enables infectivity of human epithelial cells and neutrophils by zinc-limited N. gonorrhoeae . We conclude that N. gonorrhoeae produces Zcp to buffer periplasmic zinc, which enables ZnuA to balance import of different metals and ensures the bioavailability of zinc for extracytoplasmic zinc-requiring proteins, as part of the coordinated response to host-imposed nutritional immunity.",

We previously reported that multiple tissue stem/progenitor cells can be efficiently enriched from regeneration buds using the side population (SP) method. Here, we performed trajectory inference using single-cell RNA sequencing data of the SP fraction to construct differentiation trajectories and identify putative tissue stem cell populations that initiate differentiation pathways. We found that complement c1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 ( c1qtnf3 ) is specifically expressed in putative muscle stem cells (MSC) and, using knockdown (KD; CRISPR/Cas9-based F0 crispants) experiments, demonstrated that c1qtnf3 is necessary for tail regeneration. Furthermore, we found that the impaired tail regeneration by c1qtnf3 KD was accompanied by abrogation of macrophage-like cell accumulation at the amputation site. These phenotypes were rescued by macrophage-like cell-specific forced expression of neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 , a gene related to effector molecule production in myeloid cells, suggesting that the impaired tail regeneration by c1qtnf3 KD is due to macrophage dysregulation. Our findings suggest that, in Xenopus , putative MSC modulate macrophage function via c1qtnf3 expression for successful tail regeneration.",

We determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of wild-type (WT) AGO1 and the recurrent, severe causative ΔF180 mutant. AGO1(ΔF180) unexpectedly rearranges the hydrophobic core of the L1 domain to preserve the overall RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) architecture and recognize guide RNAs similarly to WT. Functionally, the mutant binds target RNAs like WT but more frequently retains passenger strands, implicating a defect in RISC assembly. Biochemical assays of ΔF180 and L190P mutants revealed normal duplex loading but impaired passenger ejection, exposing guide 3′ ends to 3′→5′ exonucleases and generating abnormally short ~11-nucleotide RNAs. In cells, AGO1(ΔF180), AGO1(G199S), and corresponding AGO2 mutants likewise produced truncated guides.

          "abstract": "Our understanding of carbon and nutrient dynamics in globally vast and socioeconomically critical dryland ecosystems lags behind mesic systems. Litter decomposition models consistently underestimate measured decomposition in these regions. Both models and measurements largely represent spatially dominant intercanopy areas; however, little litter resides in these interspaces as transport vectors move litter to other microsites such as beneath plant canopies and buried in soil. Abiotic and biotic conditions differ among microsites, but few studies have characterized microsite impacts on decomposition. We collated data on microsites where litter accumulates. In microsites with sufficient available data, we used meta-analysis to test hypotheses on decomposition relative to litter in intercanopy spaces. Decomposition was lower under woody plant canopies than in intercanopy spaces. Buried litter decomposed faster than surface litter. There was no difference in decomposition between surface litter and litter suspended aboveground to simulate standing dead. All microsite contrasts had exceptions, suggesting that site-specific characteristics influence microclimate and subsequent decomposition. Extrapolation of decomposition rates to the landscape-level (using estimates of microsite-specific decomposition rates multiplied by litter pools), suggests that decomposition estimates based on intercanopy data alone underrepresent landscape-level decomposition. Thus, despite advances in the understanding of mechanistic decomposition drivers in drylands advancing, most studies are spatially unrepresentative analyses in intercanopy areas and this will underestimate decomposition at the landscape level. Expanding the ecological relevance of decomposition processes to be useful for predicting larger-scale carbon and nutrient dynamics requires improved characterization of dryland litter distribution, coupled with a mechanistic understanding of decomposition in microsites where litter accumulates.",

Simultaneous assimilation is known to segregate carbons from each substrate type into different metabolic pathways. However, the mechanisms of this metabolic segregation remain unresolved. Here, we investigate Pseudomonas putida KT2440 during processing of the sugar glucose through glycolysis versus the phenolic acid ferulate through gluconeogenesis. Metabolome profiling reveals up to twofold less tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites but up to 10-fold higher metabolites of upper glycolysis, pentose-phosphate, and Entner–Doudoroff pathways in glucose-grown cells compared to ferulate-grown cells. After 13 C-substrate switching, kinetic isotopic profiling captures rapid assimilation of new substrate carbons into initial catabolic pathways, but incorporation into downstream pathways is absent or incomplete. Proteomics identifies a 22-fold higher abundance of one homolog of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, GapA) in cells fed on glucose relative to ferulate, while abundance of another homolog (GapB) remains unchanged. Growth phenotypes and quantitative metabolomics for single and double knockout mutants of these GAPDH homologs indicate only GapA involvement in glycolytic flux, which can be compensated by the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, and distinct preference of GapB with minimal role of GapA for gluconeogenic flux. Accordingly, growth of triple knockout mutant with deletion of gapA , gapB , and edd is possible only when glycolytic and gluconeogenic substrates are provided together to meet metabolic demands in a segregated fashion, but metabolic tradeoffs lead to slow growth. A mathematical, experimentally constrained, model of the GAPDH node shows that tuning of GapA and GapB concentrations enables transition between flux regimes for nutritional adaptability.",

However, existing experimental techniques lack the capability to directly observe heterogeneous structural evolution and intercomponent interactions under controlled conditions that closely mimic realistic nonequilibrium thermal fronts. Consequently, theoretical models, which assume equilibrium conditions or neglect dynamic structural evolution, remain insufficiently validated and cannot accurately predict these critical transformation pathways. Here, we developed a gradiated fast-heating system (&gt;20 °C/s) enabling precise control of heating rate gradients within submillimeter transition regions in a single specimen, seamlessly integrated with sequential synchrotron X-ray tomography and radiography to directly visualize internal structural evolution. This approach allowed capture of diverse structural transformation pathways spanning microsecond-to-millisecond timescales under distinct nonequilibrium thermal conditions, revealing the complete sequence from initial pyrolysis through ignition to final burnout. We found that local heating rates, rather than bulk temperatures, dictate void formation dynamics and fragmentation pathways. In regions with high local heating rates, rapid void nucleation within the binder phase created reticulated porous networks, evolving four times faster than curved interfacial voids observed in adjacent regions experiencing lower heating rates. Furthermore, a cascade of heterogeneous component interactions subsequently fragmented the metallic network into isolated clusters, seeding critical ignition hotspots that governed combustion initiation and propagation mechanisms. These findings indicate that kinetic processes, influenced notably by heating rate, play an important role in mesostructural evolution under nonequilibrium conditions.",

We report that beyond its function of degrading poly-ubiquitinylated proteins, the immunoproteasome (i-20S) is required for the proper function of ILC2s by controlling their mitochondrial capacity. We found that 90% of the catalytic β subunits of proteasomes in human ILC2s (hILC2s) are the immuno- (β5i) rather than constitutive (β5c) isoform. Specific, noncovalent, reversible inhibition of i-20S β5i (LMP7) in hILC2s induced ROS production, which inhibited aconitase, leading to altered mitochondrial function and reduced levels of ATP. Reprogramming of metabolic status by an LMP7 inhibitor impaired ILC2 activation, without significant cytotoxicity or preventing their recovery. Hence, the selective inhibition of i-20S in ILC2 cells did not kill them but reversibly depleted their ATP, preventing their activation and cytokine secretion. In mice, proteasome inhibition similarly blocked mitochondrial function and ILC2 activation, preventing airway inflammation in response to IL33 and asthma in response to house dust mites. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated linkage between proteasome blockade, central carbon metabolism, and mitochondrial function and identify a strategy to regulate immune cell metabolism in inflammatory diseases.",

          "abstract": "Paleolithic representations of human–animal interaction are rare, with only a few painted or engraved examples recorded in Upper Paleolithic contexts, mostly from Europe. Such scenes, depicting real or imagined interactions, are of major importance for understanding a wide range of past human perspectives, starting with how people conceived of their ontological relationship with the environment and nonhuman beings. In the Early Neolithic in Southwest Asia, shifts in perspective led human communities to manipulate and transform their environment while simultaneously depicting new forms of art featuring human–animal interactions. Here, we describe the recent discovery of the earliest figurine depicting a human–animal interaction—a woman and a goose—from the Late Epipaleolithic (c. 12,000 years cal. BP) village of Nahal Ein Gev II in northern Israel. The artistic techniques and raw materials that were used and the mythological scene that was depicted appear earlier than previous examples, foreshadowing the more monumental changes in symbolic expression that occur in the following Neolithic periods. Through technological, archaeometric, and dermatoglyphic analyses, we demonstrate that this unique figurine was meticulously modeled from clay using innovative techniques that created perspective using form and light. Importantly, the figurine captures a mythological scene between the woman and the goose that is consistent with an animistic belief system. Through our combined multidisciplinary approach, this study provides important original data regarding the antiquity and development of symbolic expression using clay at the end of the Epipaleolithic at a crossroads between early sedentary and fully Neolithic societies in Southwest Asia.",

          "abstract": "Recent work suggests combining physical activity with cognitive tasks may have been critical to human evolution and may be beneficial to human brain health today. These combined tasks are key elements of foraging, a lifestyle employed by human ancestors for over 2 My. However, it is unclear whether cognitive engagement during foraging-like tasks impacts endurance, and therefore foraging performance, and whether cognitive adaptations may mitigate these effects. We tested the hypothesis that cognitive engagement during endurance walking increases perceived physical effort without influencing physiological responses, and that enhanced cognition mitigates these effects. Thirty healthy adults ( n female = 17; aged 18 to 53) underwent nonlocomotor cognitive testing and completed two separate randomized endurance tests: one without (Ex) and one with simultaneous executive function tasks (ExCog). For each condition, participants walked on a treadmill for up to 30-min while physiological responses were recorded, and perception of effort was assessed every 2-min using Borg’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale. During the ExCog condition, RPE was significantly greater ( P = 0.005), while energy expenditure was significantly lower ( P = 0.008) compared to the Ex condition. Additionally, we observed significant interactions between cognitive abilities and endurance performance—for example, individuals with greater visuospatial abilities experienced a smaller increase in perceived effort (RPE) in the ExCog condition compared to the Ex condition (FDR P = 0.039). These results indicate that cognitive demands and cognitive abilities associated with foraging distinctly influence endurance, suggesting that evolutionary shifts in human cognitive capacities may have relaxed constraints on endurance foraging performance.",

By dictating the accessibility of genomic loci, epigenetic factors contribute to the physical regulation of gene expression, enabling diverse cellular phenotypes to be encoded by a shared genome in an individual. Epigenetic dysregulation can lead to aberrations in chromatin architecture, contributing to diseases such as neurological disorders and cancers. Despite the known importance of chromatin organization for human health, the physical mechanisms governing chromatin folding remain underspecified. In this work, we develop a physical model of chromatin organization based on contributions from multiple epigenetic factors. Using our model, we evaluate how conditions in the nuclear environment and crosstalk between epigenetic marks affect the compartmentalization of chromatin into dense heterochromatin and loose euchromatin. Our results emphasize the role of reader protein binding in chromatin compartmentalization. We show that reader proteins interact through an indirect mechanism facilitated by the shared chromatin “scaffold” to which they bind. Under a scenario where reader proteins compete for binding sites, we find that indirect interactions affect the program adopted by the chromatin fiber. By isolating indirect modes of epigenetic crosstalk, we demonstrate how the interplay between epigenetic patterning and environmental factors influences chromatin architecture.",

However, how direct manipulation of brain circuits that govern social behaviors and social rewards impacts pain and negative emotional responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated whether direct activation of a newly identified noncanonical social reward circuit—specifically, the projections from the medial amygdala (MeA) to the medial preoptic area (MPOA)—can mitigate pain-related emotional and behavioral responses. Our findings demonstrated that both optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons in the MeA significantly reduced freezing and anxiety-like behaviors after shock period as well as pain responses in the hotplate test in both male and female mice. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of the MeA-to-MPOA circuit produced similar behavioral outcomes.

However, the mechanism by which OST1 regulates SLAC1 activation and its relationship with CPKs remain unclear. Here, we identify that OST1 primarily activates SLAC1 in this process through CPK15. Mutation of CPK15 significantly impairs ABA-induced stomatal closure and increases drought sensitivity. OST1 interacts with CPK15 and phosphorylates it at T103, which is essential for ABA-induced stomatal closure. Moreover, CPK15 can phosphorylate eight sites in the N terminus of SLAC1 to activate its anion currents in oocytes. Expression of SLAC1 8D (a phosphomimetic form) in oocytes constitutively activates anion channel activity and effectively restores the impaired ABA-induced stomatal closure of cpk15-1 but not by SLAC1 8A (a phospho-dead form). Furthermore, activated CPK15 by OST1 and Ca 2+ enhances its activity toward SLAC1, and mutations of both OST1 and CPK15 have additive effect on ABA-induced stomatal closure, suggesting that CPK15 activates SLAC1 through both direct and indirect mechanisms. These findings demonstrate the key role of CPK15 in ABA-induced stomatal closure, revealing a connection between OST1 and CPKs in both Ca 2+ -independent and Ca 2+ -dependent pathways in ABA-induced stomatal closure.",

This repair process is particularly important in cancer cells defective in homologous recombination. The exonuclease function of DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ) has been identified as an essential component for TMEJ, functioning to remove unpaired bases flanking a microhomology (MH). It is not known if the exonuclease removes all unpaired bases at once and how this removal might affect subsequent MH selection. Here, we reconstituted a functional TMEJ repair process using purified human Pol θ and Pol δ. We find that when Pol δ exonuclease excises a nucleotide to generate a new 3′ terminus, Pol θ initiates a new MH search. Pol δ exonuclease removes a single nucleotide at a time, rather than cleaving an unpaired flap, and then transfers the DNA tail to the polymerase site of Pol θ. Specific primer-grasp amino acids in the polymerase domain of Pol θ are important for internal MH anchoring. The helicase-like domain of Pol θ harbors two activities which are recapitulated in reconstituted reactions: strand-capture to bring single-strand tails together and an ATPase activity that alleviates suppression of TMEJ by ssDNA binding protein RPA. This functional reconstitution of TMEJ advances the understanding of how two polymerases with three enzymatic activities orchestrate double-strand break repair.",

          "abstract": "Cell migration relies on balancing focal adhesion (FA) stability—necessary for traction generation—and turnover—essential for forward translocation. Here, we dissect how integrin binding frequency and force-dependent bond duration jointly regulate this balance in fibroblasts. Using block copolymer micelle nanolithography, we create gold nanoparticle (Au NP) arrays with controlled spacings to vary integrin–ligand binding frequency. In parallel, tension gauge tethers (TGTs) with defined force threshold limit bond lifetime of high-force integrins under cellular traction. We find that intermediate ligand spacing coupled with a moderate rupture threshold dramatically accelerates fibroblast migration—up to twelvefold faster than on denser or sparser substrates. These conditions foster rapid FA turnover and support a dendritic actin architecture driven by lamellipodia, challenging the longstanding view of fibroblasts as inherently slow, mesenchymal movers. Knockout and blocking experiments further identify α5β1 as the mechanically dominant integrin subtype that plays a pivotal role in supporting this rapid migration. Mechanistically, FAs remain sufficiently stable to generate traction but also disassemble quickly, fostering continuous protrusion–retraction cycles essential for high-speed migration. These findings refine the classic biphasic model of cell migration into a two-dimensional framework that considers ligand spacing (binding frequency) and TGT force thresholds (binding duration). Beyond expanding fundamental understanding of integrin mechanobiology, our results provide broad avenues for tissue engineering and therapeutic applications, where finely tuned adhesion mechanics can markedly modulate cell speed and phenotype.",

While core cell type identities—defined by the sex determination gene fruitless ( fru ), neurotransmitters, monoamines, and transcription factors—remain highly conserved, we observed striking evolutionary turnover in neuropeptide signaling pathways in a highly cell-type-specific manner, underscoring the role of functional reconfiguration of conserved circuits in behavioral evolution. Further investigation of sex differences in dsx + neurons revealed that male-specific cell types are not more evolutionarily divergent than sex-unbiased ones. Finally, we developed an interactive web resource for data access and characterized marker gene combinations enabling cell-type-specific labeling. Overall, our study provides insights into how neural circuits evolve to encode behavioral diversity and establishes a high-resolution framework for understanding the cellular basis of behavioral adaptation.",

          "abstract": "DNA replication requires precise coordination between DNA unwinding and DNA synthesis. In all domains of life, protein–protein interactions at the replisome maintain proximity between the enzymes that catalyze these two activities. Surprisingly, in bacteria, the replicative DNA polymerase (Pol III), responsible for DNA synthesis, is exchanged every few seconds. How processive synthesis is maintained under these conditions has remained unclear. Here, we use single-molecule microscopy in live cells to show that Pol III rapidly rebinds the replisome within seconds of dissociation. This fast recruitment is driven by an interaction with single-stranded DNA–binding protein (SSB), which enhances Pol III target search efficiency by ~20-fold. Disrupting this mechanism alters replisome stoichiometry, causes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulation, depletes free SSB, and leads to helicase disassembly and DNA breakage, culminating in genome instability. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which fast polymerase recycling sustains continuous DNA replication and genome integrity.",

          "abstract": "The thalamus is pivotal for the development and function of neural circuits in the cerebral cortex. However, how thalamus–cortex interactions influence human cortical development remains unknown primarily because of the inaccessibility of the human embryonic brain. Here, we demonstrate thalamus-dependent gene expression, circuit organization, and neural activity during corticogenesis using human thalamocortical assembloids (hThCAs). Human cortical (hCOs) and thalamic organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells exhibited region-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal activity. Upon the fusion of these organoids, hThCAs reconstructed reciprocal thalamus–cortex axonal projections and synaptic connections. Transcriptomic analysis revealed thalamus-dependent acceleration of cortical maturation, with upregulation of programs linked to axon development, subplate/cortical plate identity, and activity-regulated genes. Histological analysis showed expanded progenitor pools and increased deep-layer neurons within hThCAs. Wide-field Ca 2+ imaging demonstrated that wave-like activity originated in the thalamic region and propagated to the cortical region. Furthermore, two-photon Ca 2+ imaging of cortical neurons revealed that synchronous activity emerged exclusively in pyramidal tract neurons and corticothalamic neurons, whereas intratelencephalic neurons remain asynchronous, highlighting cell type–specific circuit integration within hThCAs. These synchronized events were absent in isolated hCOs or in cortico–cortical assembloids, underscoring the specificity of thalamic input. Our findings suggest that diffusible thalamic cues broadly enhance progenitor expansion, while long-range thalamic input organizes cell type–specific synchronous activity. This study demonstrates the thalamus-dependent acquisition of mature cortical phenotypes in a cell type–specific manner in hThCAs, establishing developmental mechanisms linking regional interactions and cell type–specific circuit specification.",

          "abstract": "The contribution of Thwaites Glacier, Antarctica, to sea level rise is influenced by how quickly warm salty seawater of Circumpolar Deep Water origin melts basal ice near its grounding line. Satellite observations reveal tidally forced kilometer-scale seawater intrusions beneath grounded ice that form an “Ice Grounding Zone” (IGZ) where ice melts vigorously. Although melt rates have been measured at selected sites using Automated phase-sensitive Radar Echo Sounders (ApRES) and Automated Underwater Vehicle (AUV) instruments, their spatial distribution and total magnitude within the IGZ remain uncertain. Here, we present 2D high-resolution simulations of the melt regime of Thwaites Glacier using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology global circulation model ocean model. The model predicts high melt at the entrance of the IGZ, with a quadratic decay inside the IGZ, a linear increase with ocean thermal forcing and a sublinear increase with cavity length. On the slow-moving Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf, the modeled melt rate is low (10 m/y) due to a flat, shallow ice base, in agreement with in situ observations from AUV and ApRES instruments. On the Thwaites Glacier Tongue (TGT), the modeled melt rate is high (50 m/y) due to a steeper and deeper ice base. The modeled melt rates are consistent with the estimates derived from the satellite. Hence, multiple lines of evidence indicate high melt in the IGZ of TGT, which controls 80% of the glacier mass balance. An updated representation of grounding zones in ice sheet models including seawater intrusions will increase their sensitivity to ocean warming and will revise sea-level projections upward.",

Excessive lipid droplet accumulation is observed in the brains of SPG54 patients and DDHD2 knockout mice, consistent with DDHD2’s reported neutral lipase activity. Here, we find recombinant human DDHD2 preferentially hydrolyzes diacylglycerol (DAG) over phospholipids, with a slight preference for DAG over triacylglycerol (TAG). DDHD2 also exhibits transacylase activity, which enables transfer of acyl chains from TAGs to DAGs and monoacylglycerols to remodel the acyl chains of TAGs. A predicted hydrophobic amphipathic helix on DDHD2 is essential for lipid droplet binding in vitro and in cells, and its lack reduces the enzymatic activity and TAG acyl chain remodeling. Adipose triglyceride lipase, but not hormone sensitive lipase, also has transacylation activity and can remodel TAG acyl chains, but to a lesser extent than DDHD2. Taken together, this provides evidence that DDHD2 is a neutral lipid lipase and transacylase whose broad specificity enables TAG acyl-chain remodeling.",

Here, we present and describe the complete inner nasal structures of the early Neanderthal skeleton from Altamura, southern Italy. It represents evidence hitherto unavailable, both for this species and the human fossil record in general, and sheds light on the possible influence of respiratory adaptations on the characteristic Neanderthal facial morphology. Part of the debate has revolved around inner nasal traits proposed as unique adaptations (autapomorphies) of the species Homo neanderthalensis in relation to cold climate, specifically: a vertically oriented medial projection and a medial swelling on the nasal cavity wall alongside the lack of an ossified roof over the lacrimal groove. The lack of complete anatomy in the Neanderthal fossil record further livened the discussion regarding their occurrence. With the description and analysis of this unique finding, we can rule out the existence of such features. In addition, our observations corroborate the hypothesis that the characteristic midfacial morphology of H. neanderthalensis (i.e., the midfacial prognathism) is the result of a combination of factors and not a direct result of respiratory adaptations in the upper airways. Finally, our data provide an enhanced perspective for modeling Neanderthal respiratory performances.",

Acute mortality, due to obstruction, perforation, or torsion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, has been confirmed via necropsy in all three taxa; however, quantitative risk assessment for macroplastic ingestion poses unique challenges, with risk more dependent on probability of discrete events involving diverse plastic types rather than cumulative exposure models (e.g., LC 50 ). We model mortality risk associated with macroplastic ingestion in seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles, using data from more than 10,000 necropsies reported in the academic literature and stranding network databases. Employing an adapted Weibull Accelerated Failure Time model, we assess the relationship between the GI load (pieces and volume/animal length) of different plastic types—hard, soft, rubber, or fishing debris—and likelihood of plastic-induced mortality. Overall, 35% of seabirds, 12% of marine mammals, and 47% of sea turtles ingested plastic, and 1.6%, 0.7%, and 4.4% died from plastic, respectively. When modeling plastic together, a 90% chance of mortality was associated with 23 pieces (0.098 cm 3 /cm) in seabirds, 29 pieces (39.89 cm 3 /cm) in marine mammals, and 405 pieces (5.52 cm 3 /cm) in sea turtles (377 for juveniles). The plastic types that posed the greatest risks were rubber for seabirds, soft plastics and fishing debris for marine mammals, and hard and soft plastics for sea turtles. This research furthers scientific understanding of the likelihood of mortality from plastic ingestion and can inform monitoring, risk assessments, and management frameworks.",

Two concentric cylinders of actively dividing stem cells are the main drivers of radial thickening during secondary growth, each producing distinct vascular cell types toward the inside and the outside. While the molecular mechanisms underlying their initiation have been well studied, it remains unclear how these stem cell layers determine which cell type is generated. Here, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between the ERECTA (ER) receptor pathway and auxin signaling controls the amount and choice of output tissue in these two stem cell regions. Mechanistically, we show that the ER pathway phosphorylates the transcription factor AINTEGUMENTA (ANT), thereby modulating bilateral stem cell activity and favoring the differentiation of only one type of cell. Our results thus show that the phosphorylation status of ANT regulates root girth and biomass accumulation by influencing bilateral stem cell production.

Understanding these processes is crucial for comprehending neural circuits’ structure and function. The ability to reconstruct neural circuits, and even entire nervous systems, at the neuron and synapse level, facilitates the study of the design principles of neural systems and their developmental plan. Here, we investigate the developing connectome of Caenorhabditis elegans using statistical generative models based on simple biological features: neuronal cell type, neuron birth time, cell body distance, reciprocity, and synaptic pruning. Our models accurately predict synapse existence, degree profiles of individual neurons, and statistics of small network motifs. Importantly, these models require a surprisingly small number of neuronal cell types, which we infer and characterize. We further show that to replicate the experimentally observed developmental path, multiple developmental epochs are necessary. Our model’s predictions of the synaptic connections and their strength, using multiple reconstructions of adult worms, reflect that it identified much of the shared part of the connectivity graph. Thus, the accuracy of the generative statistical models we use here offers a general framework for studying how connectomes develop and the underlying principles of their design.",

          "abstract": "The pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) 1 receptor (PAC1R) is a class B1 G protein–coupled receptor activated by the endogenous peptide agonists PACAP and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Alternate splicing within the receptor extracellular domain (ECD) generates the PAC1R short variant (PAC1sR) that has selectively enhanced VIP function compared to the full-length, PAC1R null variant (PAC1nR). However, to date, a comprehensive pharmacological assessment of the downstream signaling outcomes of PAC1sR activation compared to PAC1nR has not been performed, and little information is available to mechanistically understand how ECD splicing may alter ligand engagement. Here, we demonstrated that VIP, but not PACAP, has globally enhanced activity across a broad range of functional endpoints at PAC1sR compared to PAC1nR. Cryo-EM structures of VIP-bound, stimulatory G protein (G s )-coupled PAC1sR and PAC1nR, supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, demonstrate transient engagement of the null loop in PAC1nR, which is absent in PAC1sR, with residues in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and the N-terminal helix of the ECD. These interactions result in differential engagement of VIP with these domains and the top of TM2/ECL1 with PAC1sR and PAC1nR. Moreover, MD simulations predicted differential interactions of the G s protein with the two PAC1R variants when bound by VIP that correlate with a greater allosteric influence of the G s protein on VIP affinity at the PAC1sR, relative to PAC1nR. Our study provides insights into the structural basis and functional consequences of PAC1R ECD splicing, increasing understanding of PAC1R ligand selectivity and signaling.",

          "abstract": "Structured population projection models are fundamental to many fields of science. They enable abundance forecasting for populations categorized by various traits such as age (for demography), patch (for spatial ecology), genotype (for genetics), infectious stage (for epidemiology), or capital (economics). The demography of a structured population, determined by the transition rates (e.g., survival, fertility) between its various classes, also shapes its relatedness—or kinship—structure. This structure (a probabilistic genealogy) is crucial for understanding how individuals are related to the rest of the population and affects effective population size, inclusive fitness, inbreeding, pedigrees, relatedness, familial structures, etc. Due to its significance, Kinship Demography, the study of the relationship between transition rates and kinship structure, is currently among the most actively growing areas of demography. In this manuscript, by incorporating the generation number as a trait into the population structure, we derive the Kinship Formula, yielding the expected number of any kin for any structured population. This formula is simple to implement and fast to compute, even for complex models and distant kin relationships. Most importantly, it promises significant theoretical advances. From the Kinship Formula, one can, for instance, assess the impact of embedded processes (e.g., dispersal, inheritance, growth) on kinship, compute mean population relatedness and the eventual number of kin (including kin already dead or not born yet). The Kinship Formula derived here stems from a one-sex constant environment framework. Its simplicity should allow for extensions to include environmental and demographic stochasticity as well as two-sex models.",

Here, we demonstrate that gAβ promotes neuronal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) efflux via a VDAC1-dependent mechanism, activating the innate immune cGAS-STING pathway. Using aged AD mice and human AD brain samples, we observed cGAS-mtDNA binding and cGAS-STING activation in the neuronal cytoplasm. Knockdown of RAGE, cGAS, or STING, as well as pharmacological inhibition of VDAC1, protected APP mice from mitochondrial dysfunction and Alzheimer’s-like pathology. Neuron-specific cGAS knockdown confirmed its pivotal role in driving neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits. Treatment with ALT-711, an AGE cross-link breaker, alleviated gAβ-associated pathology. Furthermore, RAGE inhibition in APP knock-in mice suppressed innate immune activation and disease-associated gene expression, as revealed by spatially resolved transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings establish a mechanistic link between gAβ and innate immune activation, identifying VDAC1, the AGE-RAGE axis, and the cGAS-STING pathway as promising therapeutic targets in AD.",

Herein, we report a pronounced in-plane plastic anisotropy in single-crystalline Mg 3 Bi 2 . Micropillar compression reveals that the observed anisotropy is critically dependent on the activation of single versus double slip systems, and superior plastic deformability can be achieved once the double slip system is activated. The interatomic potential for Mg 3 Bi 2 was developed via the machine learning approach, and molecular dynamics simulations establish that the crystallographic orientation-dependent activation of competing slip systems constitutes the fundamental origin of the plastic anisotropy in Mg 3 Bi 2 .

          "abstract": "Actin networks in cells are dynamic and constantly turning over as actin subunits exchange between monomer and polymer pools. Understanding these dynamics in vivo requires a detailed understanding of pure actin behavior in vitro. The prevailing model is treadmilling, which predicts continuous growth of filament barbed ends balanced by continuous shrinkage of pointed ends, while filament length remains roughly constant. While treadmilling has been observed directly at the level of single filaments, length fluctuations—expressed as “length diffusivity”—are much greater than expected, and the origin of these high diffusivity values could not be identified experimentally. By imaging single filaments tethered to glass via α-actinin, we observed frequent, low-amplitude barbed-end fluctuations of ±2–6 subunits per event and rarer, high-amplitude fluctuations of ±50–150 subunits per event. Barbed-end fluctuations depended on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and were blocked by phalloidin and barbed-end capping agents. Barbed-end fluctuations consumed an estimated one-third of the ATP at steady state, while two-thirds is still consumed by treadmilling. Fluctuations result in diffusive spreading of filament lengths that exceeds predictions from pure treadmilling yet is lower than previously reported values, suggesting that earlier measurements captured additional sources of variability. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for kinetic models that proposed a dampened form of dynamic instability in pure actin where transient loss of the ATP/ADP•Pi barbed-end cap leads to rare, large excursions superimposed on more frequent, small fluctuations.",

Yet, this impression is based on kinetic measurements heavily focused on eukaryotic rubiscos, a rather conserved group of low genetic diversity. Moreover, the fastest rubiscos that we know of so far were found among the sparsely sampled prokaryotes. Could there be yet faster rubiscos among the uncharted regions of rubisco’s phylogenetic diversity? Here, we perform a characterization of more than 250 rubiscos from a wide range of bacteria and archaea, thereby doubling the coverage of the diversity of this key enzyme. We assess the distribution of the carboxylation rates at saturating levels of CO 2 , and establish that rubisco is a relatively slow enzyme across the tree of life, never exceeding ≈30 reactions per second at 30 °C. We show that relatively faster subclades share similar evolutionary contexts, involving micro-oxygenic environments or a CO 2 concentrating mechanism. Leveraging a simple machine learning model trained on this dataset, we predict the carboxylation rate for all ≈68,000 sequenced rubisco variants found in nature to date.

As the majority of animals, species with complex life histories may have distinct traits and ecological functions at different stages. Using all 557 Chinese anurans, we tested whether adult-based conservation protects entire taxa by analyzing functional trait diversity across life stages. We compiled adult and tadpole traits, mapped spatial diversity patterns, identified hotspots, recognized conservation priority species based on traits at different stages, and tested whether integrating information from different life history stages can effectively conserve functional diversity. Results showed functional diversity hotspots of adults and tadpoles are different. Species’ functional uniqueness between stages were not correlated, with only 18.8% species overlapped in conservation priority lists. Meanwhile, conservation strategies prioritizing species based on adult traits failed to protect tadpole functional diversity. The extent of functional diversity covered by these species was similar to that of randomly chosen species. These findings reject the hypothesis that conservation strategies made based on information of adults can adequately protect whole taxa. Nevertheless, when information from both stages is integrated, the conservation effectiveness has significantly improved. Thus, comprehensive biodiversity protection requires integrated assessments of all stages.",

          "abstract": "The mechanisms by which light interacts with ice and the impact of photoinduced reactions are central to our understanding of environmental, atmospheric, and astrophysical processes. However, a microscopic description of the photoproducts originating from ultraviolet (UV) absorption and emission processes has remained elusive. Here, we explore the photochemistry of ice using time-dependent hybrid density functional theory on various models of pristine and defective ice Ih. Our investigation of the excited state potential energy surface of the crystal shows that UV absorption can lead to the formation of hydronium ions, hydroxyl radicals, and excess electrons. One of the dominant mechanisms of decay from the excited to the ground-state involves the recombination of the electron with the hydroxyl radical yielding hydronium-hydroxide ion-pairs. We find that the details of this charge recombination process sensitively depend on the presence of defects in the lattice, such as vacancies and preexisting photoproducts. We also observe the formation of Bjerrum defects following UV absorption; we suggest that, together with hydroxide anions, they are likely responsible for prominent features experimentally detected in long UV exposure absorption spectra, remarkably red-shifted relative to short exposure spectra. Our results highlight the key role of defects in determining the onset of absorption and emission processes in ice.",

Despite recent mechanistic advances, the evolutionary origins of many antiphage immune systems remain elusive, especially for those that encode homologs of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) superfamily, which are essential for chromosome maintenance and DNA repair across domains of life. Here, we elucidate the structural basis and evolutionary emergence of Lamassu, a bacterial immune system family featuring diverse effectors but a core conserved SMC-like sensor. Using cryo-EM, we determined structures of the Vibrio cholerae Lamassu complex in both apo- and dsDNA-bound states, revealing unexpected stoichiometry and topological architectures. We further demonstrate how Lamassu specifically senses dsDNA ends in vitro and phage replication origins in vivo, thereby triggering the formation of LmuA tetramers that activate its Cap4 nuclease domain. Our findings reveal that Lamassu evolved via exaptation of the bacterial Rad50-Mre11 DNA repair system to form a compact, modular sensor for viral replication, exemplifying how cellular machinery can be co-opted for novel immune functions.",

The small magnitude of these interactions underlies the rapid reversibility of HOTS on the timescale of membrane signaling processes, permitting the dynamic modulation of signals. At the same time, weak interactions present an apparent paradox: HOTS should form only if the concentration of a particular protein is sufficiently high to produce oligomerization by mass action. And yet, HOTS are observed experimentally with membrane proteins present in cell membranes at concentrations of only a few per μ m 2 . In this study, we employ principles of statistical thermodynamics to explain how cells can alter the configurational entropy of the oligomerization reaction, thereby achieving HOTS formation at low concentrations of the protein in the membrane. We propose that this modification of the configurational entropy, a process we call configurational length scaling, is an important aspect of HOTS formation in cell membranes and possibly other cellular compartments.",

However, limited costimulatory signaling essential for sustained T cell effector activity may limit CD3 TCE clinical efficacy and response duration. The CD2 receptor is an attractive costimulation target owing to its association with T cell receptor signaling and favorable expression profile. We show that CD2 costimulation is superior in maintaining T cell viability and effector function relative to other pathways in in vitro chronic stimulation assays. The extracellular domain of CD58, the predominant CD2 ligand, is functional as an antibody fusion, improving bispecific potency. We observe that higher CD3 affinity molecules have the potential for superagonism in the context of an integrated CD2 agonist. Evaluation of TCEs with integrated CD2 costimulation and attenuated CD3 binding identified optimal CD3 affinity agonists that avoid target-independent T cell activation and demonstrated an increased therapeutic index relative to nonattenuated CD3 agonists. This platform shows increased tumor-killing efficacy as compared to CD3 affinity-matched bispecifics for known tumor targets such as HER2, CD20, B7-H4, and UL16-binding protein 2 (ULBP2). We demonstrate that ULBP2-targeted trispecifics with integrated CD2 costimulation and optimized CD3 affinity are superior to higher-affinity CD3 molecules in in vivo mouse efficacy studies. This integrated CD2 costimulation platform, which we termed EVOLVE, represents a next-generation TCE platform to increase T cell effector function in the tumor microenvironment and has the potential to address unmet patient needs by improving the depth and durability of clinical antitumor T cell responses.",

          "abstract": "While multiple chromatin-based epigenetic pathways are well characterized, their genome-wide coordination and hierarchical interplay remain poorly understood. We previously identified the BAH–PHD–CPL2 complex, where AIPP3 binds H3K27me3 via its BAH domain and, in concert with PHD2 and PHD3 (PHD2/3), recruits CPL2 to repress transcription by dephosphorylating RNA Polymerase II. Here, we show that CPL2 and PHD2/3 form a distinct module (CPL2–PHD2/3) that safeguards CHH DNA methylation and silences CHH-methylated sites at transposable elements (TEs) through engagement of multiple DNA methylation pathways. The CPL2–PHD2/3 module physically associates with SUVH4 and SUVH5 (SUVH4/5) to preserve SUVH4/5–CMT2-mediated CHH methylation at a subset of H3K9me2-marked regions. Chromatin enrichment of PHD3 likewise enables the module to sustain RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)-mediated CHH DNA methylation at sites bearing H3K9me2, H3K27me3, or neither. Thus, CPL2–PHD2/3 emerges as a previously underappreciated, multifunctional regulator of plant DNA methylation networks. Unexpectedly, its gene repression function is uncoupled from DNA methylation. CPL2–PHD2/3 represses Polycomb-marked genes by interacting with LHP1 or recognizing hypomethylated H3K4. While it cooperates with LHP1 at a subset of targets, it also independently silences many more genes that LHP1 alone cannot repress, both sets of genes being critical for proper development. This dual, yet largely LHP1-insufficient, repression mode singles out CPL2–PHD2/3 as the essential executor of Polycomb silencing. Together, our findings establish CPL2–PHD2/3 as a chromatin-responsive integrator that spans DNA methylation and Polycomb-associated repression, providing a unifying mechanism for epigenetic control of both TEs and genes across diverse chromatin landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system enables the encoding, storing, and integrating new information. AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, and plasticity of AMPARs signaling underlies the long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy and strength important for learning and memory. Recent work has indicated that the enigmatic N-terminal domain (NTD) of AMPARs may be a critical regulator of synaptic targeting and plasticity of AMPARs. However, few synaptic proteins have been identified that regulate AMPAR plasticity through interactions with AMPAR NTDs. Moreover, the scope of AMPAR NTD interactors that are important for synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Here, we present the dynamic, extracellular interactome for AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. Using surface-restricted proximity labeling and BioSITe-based proteomics, we identified 70 proteins that were differentially labeled by APEX2-tagged AMPARs after induction of chemical long-term potentiation of synapses in cultured neurons. Included in this list, were four members of the IgLON family of GPI-anchored proteins (Ntm, OBCAM/Opcml, Negr1, Lsamp). We show OBCAM and NTM directly interact with the extracellular domains of AMPARs. Moreover, overexpression of NTM significantly attenuates the mobility of surface AMPARs in dendritic spines. These data represent a significant step at uncovering the unexplored extracellular regulation of AMPARs, with broad implications for synapse function and synaptic plasticity.",

Two kinesin-2 motors—kinesin-II and OSM-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans —cooperate to transport cargo along cilia, with kinesin-II operating in the middle segment and OSM-3 taking over distally. However, how kinesin-II is spatially confined to prevent its invasion into distal regions remains unclear. Here, we identify Joubert syndrome 26 protein (JBTS-26) as a critical regulator of this motor handover. JBTS-26 localizes to axonemal doublet microtubules in the ciliary middle segment, where it competes with kinesin-II for binding to the IFT-B subunit OSM-5/IFT88. This competition displaces kinesin-II from IFT particles, enabling OSM-3 to assume distal transport. Loss of JBTS-26 allows kinesin-II to invade the distal cilium and slows down IFT. Conversely, JBTS-26 overexpression accelerates IFT by prematurely releasing kinesin-II. Our findings reveal a mechanism for compartmentalized motor regulation and link defective motor handover to ciliopathy pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Hurricanes can be a source of strong, episodic natural selection, especially for coastal and island populations. In Anolis lizards, selection favors morphological traits that enhance clinging performance under hurricane-force winds. However, we know little about the longer-term persistence of morphological and genomic responses to these pulse-like events. To address this limitation, we capitalized on the well-documented history of hurricanes and spread of the invasive brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei , over the past 130 y in the southeastern United States. We used 30 sites with estimates of the number of hurricanes experienced since population establishment. We found that hurricane frequency is consistently related to morphological trait values that increase clinging performance—longer limbs and larger toepads. In contrast, traits with no known connection to clinging ability were not related to hurricane frequency. Our genomic results show that despite a complex genetic architecture for most traits, populations retain a signature of hurricane-mediated selection, with several loci being strongly associated with both hurricane frequency and longer limbs. Further, we found that hurricanes are a more persistent driver of among-population genomic differentiation than other environmental variables. These results solidify hurricanes as a major force shaping morphological and genomic variation in Anolis lizards. They also highlight how the evolutionary trajectories of populations will likely be altered as climate change modifies historical patterns of natural selection, such as those involving extreme weather events.",

          "abstract": "Cooperative regulation of biomolecular function is critical for the ability of all organisms to respond effectively to environmental changes. Such regulation is often manifested in a sigmoidal dependence of enzyme activity on ligand concentration. Various molecular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie such sigmoidal behavior, but they are usually assumed to occur independently of one another. We hypothesized that coexistence of allosteric mechanisms can lead to complex kinetic behavior and higher or lower cooperativity than expected. A mathematical framework that analyses sigmoidal behavior as a function of two cooccurring mechanisms, hysteresis and homotropic binding cooperativity, was developed. The model shows, for example, that i) the observed cooperativity, as measured by the Hill coefficient, can decrease with increasing binding cooperativity, and that ii) unusually high values of the Hill coefficient can be observed. Our mathematical analysis is shown to be relevant for a mutant of Escherichia coli glutathione reductase with an unusually high value of a Hill coefficient for a dimer of about 1.9, in which hysteresis and binding cooperativity coexist. More generally, our findings imply that the repertoire of allosteric regulation is richer than anticipated and suggest that ultrasensitive control in natural or designed systems may arise even in low-order oligomers.",

We show that Rac1, in the setting of the recovery of the PT from ischemic injury, plays a critical role in reconstituting cellular bioenergetics by promoting actin cytoskeleton formation around damaged mitochondria. This mechanism removes damaged mitochondria through mitophagy and preserves PT metabolic capacity and reabsorption function. Loss of Rac1 causes intracellular lipid accumulation, energy depletion, and PT cell atrophy. Thus, Rac1 promotes the repair of PT cells by enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics, rather than by regulating cell polarity via a mechanism that links the actin cytoskeleton to metabolic demands and cell morphology.",

Here, we differentiated patient-derived p.A53T-αSyn induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to ventral midbrain astrocytes and characterized them via comprehensive molecular, functional, and proteomic analyses. Gene-corrected and healthy iPSC-derived astrocytes served as controls. To assess the effects of p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes on dopamine neurons, we established neuron–astrocyte cocultures of iPSC-derived control and mutant cells at all combinations. Our analyses uncovered cell-intrinsic pathologies in p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes, such as calcium dyshomeostasis, and accumulation of protein aggregates including those of phosphorylated αSyn. Proteomic and mechanistic studies demonstrated perturbed protein catabolic processes, with associated disturbances in lysosomal function and mTOR signaling. These deficits reduced the endocytic clearance capacity of p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes and their ability to process exogenous αSyn cargo. p.A53T-αSyn dopamine neurons cocultured with p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes displayed Lewy-like pathologies, mirroring the histopathological hallmarks identified in postmortem PD brains and exacerbated neurodegeneration, in anatomical and functional aspects. Control astrocytes mitigated these pathologies, highlighting their neuroprotective role. Additionally, p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes induced PD-relevant pathology ιn control neurons. Our findings, validated using an isogenic pair, demonstrate a critical impact of p.A53T-αSyn in disrupting astrocytic protein quality control mechanisms and establish astrocytes as active contributors to PD neuropathology.

We present an empirical framework that draws on synergies across fields to facilitate robust studies of language evolution. The approach is multifaceted, seeing language emergence as dependent on the convergence of multiple capacities, each with their own evolutionary trajectories. It is explicitly biocultural, recognizing and incorporating the importance of both biological preparedness and cultural transmission as well as interactions between them. We demonstrate this approach through three case studies that examine the evolution of different facets involved in human language (vocal production learning, linguistic structure, and social underpinnings).",

The Brassica rapa female self-incompatibility determinant, S -locus receptor kinase (SRK), recognizes interspecific pollen. Here we report the discovery of a pan-Brassicaceae SRK-interacting Interspecific Pollen Signal (SIPS). On B. rapa stigmas, SIPSs from Arabidopsis and other Brassicaceae species target Br SRK and recruit the female fertility regulator FERONIA receptor kinase to increase stigmatic reactive oxygen species and reduce interspecific pollen viability. Arabidopsis sips pollen failed to trigger the interspecific incompatibility responses. Unlike self-incompatibility, which is controlled by the polymorphic S locus, different genetic variants of SRK interacted comparably with SIPS. This study establishes SIPS-SRK as a Brassicaceae-specific ligand-receptor pair that broadly maintains the stigmatic interspecific barrier in self-incompatible species.",

This genetic code has 62 sense codons encoding 21 amino acids. In contrast to monophyletic genetic code distributions in bacteria, the archaeal Pyl code occurs sporadically, indicating that it arose independently in multiple lineages. We discovered that more than 1800 archaeal proteins contain Pyl, increasing the number of such proteins by two orders of magnitude.

In this work, we use this approach to realize an effective one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model. Harnessing our quantum gas microscope, we probe the correlated out-of-equilibrium dynamics of extended-range repulsively bound pairs and “hard rods.” By contrast, operating near equilibrium, we observe density ordering when adiabatically turning on the extended-range interactions.

Plasmids are extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements that face selective pressures from their hosts but also compete within the host cell for replication resources. While theory indicates that within-cell selection matters for plasmid evolution, experimental measurement of these dynamics has remained elusive. Here, we measure within-cell fitness of competing Escherichia coli plasmids and characterize their drift and selective dynamics. We made synthetic plasmid dimers that can be split in a controlled way to create balanced competition, which we probed experimentally. Incompatible plasmids coexist for an extended time due to methylation-based replication control. Moreover, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell advantage and fix preferentially, favoring gene loss. Critically, fixation depends non-trivially on the interplay between plasmid transcription and translation. Our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by within- and between-cell dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Optimal neural processing relies on precise tissue patterning across diverse cell types. Here, we show that spontaneous calcium waves arise among non-neuronal support cells in the developing Drosophila eye to drive retinal morphogenesis. These waves are initiated by Cad96Ca receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, triggering phospholipase C–γ–mediated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. A cell type–specific “innexin code” coordinates wave propagation through a defined gap junction network among non-neuronal retinal cells, excluding photoreceptors. Wave intensity scales with ommatidial size, triggering stronger myosin II–driven apical contraction at interommatidial boundaries in larger ommatidia. This size-dependent mechanism compensates for early boundary irregularities, ensuring uniform ommatidial packing that is critical for precise optical architecture. Our findings reveal how synchronized calcium signaling among non-neuronal cells orchestrates tissue patterning in the developing nervous system.",

A fundamental challenge is that, because two people may differ in many ways, factors besides race might explain differences in treatment. Here, we propose a test for bias that circumvents the difficulty of comparing two people by instead assessing whether the same person is treated differently when their race is perceived differently. We apply our method to test for bias in police traffic stops, finding that the same driver is likelier to be searched or arrested by police when they are perceived as Hispanic than when they are perceived as white. Our test is broadly applicable to other datasets where race, gender, or other identity data are perceived rather than self-reported, and the same person is observed multiple times.",

Whereas most prior research has estimated effects of exposure to extremely high levels of fluoride, we consider exposure to levels of fluoride within the range typical in most places and of greatest relevance to policy debates about government water fluoridation. We use data from the nationally representative (United States) High School and Beyond cohort, characterize fluoride exposure from drinking water across adolescence, adjust for confounders, and observe cognitive test performance in both secondary school and at age ~60. We find that children exposed to recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water exhibit modestly better cognition in secondary school, an advantage that is smaller and no longer statistically significant at age ~60.",

This study provides a systematic review of the key determinants driving health polarization, highlighting the complex interplay of political, social, economic, and psychological factors. By synthesizing findings from 90 studies, we identify six primary drivers: political ideology and partisanship, misinformation and disinformation, social media structures and dynamics, trust in health institutions and professionals, risk and public health perceptions, and socioeconomic factors. Our analysis reveals how these determinants reinforce societal divisions, exacerbate health inequalities, and influence adherence to public health measures. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for designing effective interventions that address the root causes of health polarization. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these divisions is essential for mitigating their negative impact on public health and fostering more cohesive, evidence-based health communication strategies.",

Here, we test whether mass shootings increase electoral participation using the most granular dataset to date. We draw information on mass shootings from the Gun Violence Archive and estimate national block group-level turnout using four snapshots of the national voter file. Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we find that mass shootings mobilize local voters (especially in heavily Democratic areas) but do not shift presidential vote choices. Furthermore, we show that pre-election mass shootings were associated with increased support for a 2016 Californian gun reform ballot initiative. Our results show the (geographically bounded) salience of mass shootings for local political engagement and ballot reform efforts.",

          "abstract": "Dielectric capacitors are essential for energy storage systems because of their high-power density and fast operation speed. However, optimizing energy storage density with concurrent thermal stability remains a substantial challenge. Here, we develop a flash annealing process with ultrafast heating and cooling rates of 1000°C per second, which facilitates the rapid crystallization of PbZrO 3 film within a mere second, while locking its high-temperature microstructure to room temperature. This produces compact films with subgrain boundary fractions of 36%, nanodomains of several nanometers, and negligible lead volatilization. These contribute to relaxor antiferroelectric film with a high breakdown strength (4800 kilovolts per centimeter) and large polarization (70 coulombs per square centimeter). Consequently, we have achieved a high energy storage density of 63.5 joules per cubic meter and outstanding thermal stability with performance degradation less than 3% up to 250°C. Our approach is extendable to ferroelectrics like Pb(Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48 )O 3 and on wafer scale, providing on-chip nonlinear dielectric energy storage solutions with industrial scalability.",

          "abstract": "Hotspot swells have typically been associated with mantle plume upwelling, yet the origins of much broader but lower superswells remain unclear. This study first reveals that swell width increases while height decreases at younger seafloor ages; it is possible for a single hot spot swell size to approach that of a superswell. Compressible numerical models replicate the observed trend. Modeling results suggest that both hot spot swells and superswells can form from interactions between mantle plumes and oceanic plates. Beneath young seafloors, the lateral redistribution of restitic, hence buoyant and relatively low-viscosity, lower lithospheric mantle due to plume impingement explains the formation of superswell-like morphology. These models effectively demonstrate lithospheric lid effects on mantle melting and support a reassessment of conventional methods for estimating core heat flux.",

          "abstract": "Additively manufactured mechanical metamaterials exhibit extraordinary physical and mechanical performance. However, achieving a balance between lightweight design, strength, and energy absorption remains challenging. Here, we develop a material-structure-function integrated strategy to additively manufacture lightweight metamaterials. Specifically, strong yet ductile aluminum (Al) alloy with heterogeneous grain was developed to print hero shrew–inspired damage-resistant metamaterials. The synergistic interplay between microscale strengthening and mesoscale architectural stress regulation leads to a cross-scale coordination mechanism, which effectively bridges material heterogeneities and structural hierarchy for multilevel energy dissipation. Such a strategy enables our metamaterials to maintain a stable stress platform during deformation. Hence, our metamaterials display an excellent combination of ultralightweight (0.91 ± 0.01 g/cm 3 ), high relative yield strength (17.0 ± 0.7%), and unprecedented specific energy absorption (39.1 ± 0.7 J/g), surpassing most metallic metamaterials. This facile concept expands the design space for lightweight metamaterials and demonstrates scalable strategies to realize the cross-scale coordination mechanism required by multifunction, showing transformative potential in mass production for sustainable engineering solutions.",

To gain further insight into the genetic history of this island from a matrilineal viewpoint, we investigated 15 millennia of human mitogenome evolution. A unique Sicilian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) dataset, represented by 116 ancient mitogenomes (including two newly sequenced) collected from 16 archeological sites dating from 14,700 to 545 years ago, was compared with a collection of 236 modern mitogenomes covering all districts of the island. By integrating demographic modeling with phylogeographic analyses, we identified a statistically supported genetic discontinuity between the Paleolithic/Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic periods and two mtDNA lineages (U5b and U8b/K) that specifically mark this transition. The extensive variation and lack of genetic structure among modern mitogenomes suggest the presence of a continuous, maternally inherited gene flow from different regions of Western Eurasia (since the Paleolithic) and Africa (since the Bronze Age).",

Here, we developed 2D static and 3D dynamic “hepatic hypertension on-a-chip” (HH chip) systems replicating cirrhotic hemodynamics and matrix properties. The HH chip realized integration and decoupled regulation of HP, shear stress, and matrix stiffness. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) exhibited HP-induced damage exclusively on stiff matrices, recapitulating cirrhotic degeneration phenotypes and genotypes. Using the HH chip, we identified GPR116 as the key HP mechanosensor in LSECs and delineated its downstream mechanotransduction pathway driving cellular injury. Genetic silencing of GPR116 protected endothelial cells from HP-induced damage both in vitro and in cirrhotic murine models. Cell- and gene-based therapies targeting GPR116 significantly attenuated cirrhosis progression. The HH chip can accelerate pathological investigation, target identification, and therapeutic development for hypertension-associated diseases.",

          "abstract": "Human-mediated introductions have enabled species to colonize beyond their native ranges, yet the mechanisms underlying successful establishment remain unclear. We combined genomic and ecological analyses to investigate parallel introductions of the Eurasian Tree Sparrow across continents. Our analyses of genetic structure and demography revealed that introduced populations in North America (European origin) and Australia (Chinese origin) experienced founder effects, with resulting bottlenecks, reduced genetic diversity, and increased inbreeding. Despite the genome-wide loss of diversity, we identified conserved regions of high genetic variation in the introduced populations, potentially maintained through balancing selection of ancestral polymorphisms. Genotype-climate association and genetic offset modeling demonstrated that climate-adaptive genetic variants retained similar frequencies across the native and introduced ranges, likely maintaining similar interactions of genetic components with climate niches. Our findings highlight how retention of adaptive polymorphism facilitates establishment success in the introduced populations, providing a framework for predicting invasion potential through genomic signatures of adaptation.",

Here, we report anomalous electrostriction degradation in Sm-doped ceria (SDC) ceramics at room temperature. Under a modest AC electric field at 1 Hz, large electrostriction of 120 ppm is observed in pristine sample. Yet, after resting in ambient environment, electrostriction decreases by one order of magnitude without any electrochemical decomposition and phase transition. The oxygen vacancies are found to decrease in the degraded SDC as well, and the degradation does not occur at frequency of 500 Hz and higher, which exhibits electrostriction one order of magnitude smaller in the first place. We attribute the degradation to the redox reactions that induce oxygen vacancy complexes during field promoted reduction yet decrease mobile oxygen vacancies while resting, which must be mitigated for the practical applications of ceria-based electrostrictors.",

While conventional CIM systems using two-dimensional (2D) crossbar arrays have shown remarkable area and energy efficiency in fully connected neural networks, their applicability to convolutional neural networks remains inefficient. Herein, we introduce an architecture that enables convolution and reinforcement learning by leveraging the unique configuration of vertically stacked 3D flash memory. The proposed 3D convolution block (3D CB) significantly reduces area overhead and enhances the reliability and energy efficiency of convolution operations. The 3D CB and 3D fully connected block (3D FCB) exhibit distinct functionalities with minimal structural modifications. The compatibility between the 3D CB and the 3D FCB facilitates their seamless co-integration on a single wafer.

Starting with a phosphorus-enriched Archean melt, we observe that rapid cooling results in the formation of immiscible glassy droplets with up to 21 weight % phosphorus pentoxide, which can be delivered to the surface by volcanic processes. In aqueous leaching, we detect millimolar phosphate concentrations, which enable the synthesis of phosphorylating agents such as polyphosphates and imidazole phosphate with up to 34% yield.

Here, using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultrathin SrTiO 3 membranes have the desired properties. Systematic measurements across varying thicknesses reveal two PhP branches with wide spectral dispersion, strong confinement, and exceptionally slow group velocities spanning from the mid-infrared to terahertz range. Notably, in 3-nanometer-thick membranes, these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~7 × 10 −5 c , rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials.

Using two complementary datasets, we identify a sharp increase in magnetic mineral concentration immediately after the early Miocene unconformity [~20 million years ago (Ma)], concurrent with a shift in detrital zircon ages, indicating a major provenance shift. We identify bimodal volcanism of the Columbia River Basalt Group as the dominant Miocene source, requiring that the early Miocene Continental Divide lay ~400 kilometers west of its present position.

FR light-induced phyA activation promotes degradation of phytochrome interacting factor 1 (PIF1), which triggers the REVEILLE 7 (RVE7)–enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) cascade to enhance salicylic acid (SA) signaling. Furthermore, multiple viruses use their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to disrupt the phyA–far-red elongated hypocotyl 1 (FHY1) interaction to block phyA nuclear transport, impairing FR light–induced plant defense.

This finding provides credible evidence for the presence of Fe 2 O 3 on the lunar surface, challenging the traditional understanding of lunar surface redox states.

Our system integrates patterned hydrophilic-superhydrophobic boundaries with strategically placed superhydrophobic notches, synergistically stabilizing water surfaces and dissipating oscillatory energy. Comprehensive tests—including centrifugal, vibrational, and real-world transport scenarios—demonstrated a spill rate of approaching 0%, as well as robust resistance to water sloshing. Notably, a four-tier tower of dual-biomimetic cups mounted on a car retained nearly 100% of their liquid after traversing 50 alternating speed bumps, whereas conventional cups lost more than 40%.

The nanorobot uses gold nanoparticles to bridge palladium (Pd) nanozymes and Lactobacillus crispatus –derived outer membrane vesicles (CMVs). Pd nanozymes catalyze H 2 O 2 into O 2 , facilitating deep tumor penetration, whereas the acidic tumor microenvironment activates Pd nanozymes to produce hydroxyl radicals (·OH), inducing immunogenic cell death.

However, a microscopic understanding of the role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in MoSe 2 monolayers at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct transport regimes: (i) an initial subpicosecond ballistic-like regime characterized by a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-picosecond superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization. The gained microscopic insights will trigger and guide future experimental studies on the phonon-mediated polariton transport in atomically thin semiconductors.",

To bridge this gap, we devised an artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled approach that pairs rapid compound triage with mechanistic target deconvolution. Our AI-driven screening highlighted melatonin (MLT) as a promising candidate. Serum profiling of 161 human individuals confirmed an age-related fall in circulating MLT level, while subsequent in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that MLT rescues cognition, suppresses neuroinflammation, and alleviates senescence phenotypes. Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)–guided chemoproteomic deconvolution next pinpointed the histone acetyltransferase p300 as MLT’s target. Integrated Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics revealed that MLT-bound p300 cooperates with specificity protein 1 (SP1) at a brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 super-enhancer, elevating histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation and reengaging a circadian-epigenetic program that links redox resilience to neuroprotection.

          "abstract": "Ionogels are promising for soft robotics, energy systems, and bioelectronic interfaces due to their high ionic conductivity and environmental stability. However, combining high strength and fracture resistance remains challenging. Here, we report composite ionogels with outstanding mechanical strength (~65.4 megapascal) and fracture energy (~607 kilojoules per square meter), capable of bearing more than 5000 times their own weight. These ionogels are developed by tailoring solvent-solute interactions to create a dense, hyperconnected nanofibrous polymer network. Solvent engineering regulates hydrogen bonding competition, facilitating the formation of robust interphase hydrogen bonds and a soft-hard biomimetic interface. Moreover, their antidrying, breathable nature enables multifunctional electrophysiological monitoring, making them ideal for wearable bioelectronics. Their ionic conductivity, drug-loading capacity, and antibacterial properties allow their use in advanced e-bandages for chronic wound healing. This generalizable strategy for ionogel design opens pathways toward strong, versatile, and biocompatible materials, particularly valuable for next-generation soft materials, wearable electronics, and tissue engineering.",

However, most experiments and theories have studied photosynthetic light harvesting driven by strong coherent laser sources. The quantum states of light are characterized by their photon statistics, in addition to classical properties such as intensity and frequency spectrum. Here, we report experiments that investigate how photon statistics affect a natural photosynthetic system and vice versa. We directly compare how single photons and pseudothermal light from spontaneous parametric down-conversion drive light harvesting in the light-harvesting 2 complex from a purple bacterium. We find that the fluorescence lifetime and quantum efficiency are unchanged while the fluorescence photon statistics are markedly different, resembling that of the incident light, implying that the dynamics do not fundamentally modify the photon statistics. This represents a step toward clarification of the similarities and differences between photosynthetic light harvesting in laboratory and in natural sunlight conditions.",

Extension of pattern generation into 3D could markedly enhance the utility of BCPs in nanoscale manufacturing, but methods to template and synthesize well-ordered, nontrivial 3D structures are less well developed. Here, we demonstrate a hierarchical DSA method to generate cross-point structures with connected in-plane and out-of-plane segments and controlled orientation angle between the horizontal layers.

This one-time intervention effectively prevented ADA formation in mice and rats, even after repeated challenges with UOX-Ery or free UOX protein, an outcome not achieved by CTX or UOX plus CTX. This tolerogenic effect relied on splenic uptake of UOX-Ery by myeloid cells, particularly macrophages, and was associated with the expansion of a distinct subset of effector regulatory T cells. Functionally, this immune tolerance enhanced the pharmacokinetics of UOX, sustained long-term control of serum uric acid levels, and attenuated local inflammation within tophus-like lesions. Together, these findings demonstrate that UOX-Ery, combined in a single dose with clinically used immunosuppressants, can effectively treat gout by inducing antigen-specific immune tolerance.",

Although the reduction of rice yields by droughts is well known, when flooding fully submerges rice plants for over 1 week, crops cannot survive. Considering rice growth stages, using a flood dynamics model and difference-in-differences, we assessed the causal impact of rice crop submergence on yield losses from 1980 to 2015. Globally, these floods reduce annual rice yield by 4.3%, with China’s East Coast experiencing 14% losses. Since 2000, yield losses have increased due to more frequent extreme floods, a trend anticipated to continue. Our findings highlight the need for flood-resistant rice cultivars to mitigate risks and support global food security, and implement adaptation strategies against both flood and drought rice yield losses.",

We found that hyperoside increases pigeon pea seed set by promoting pollen tube growth, a process that benefits from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Two lncRNAs, lnc187 and lnc999 , are regulated by hyperoside and synergize to regulate target genes. Among them, lnc187 is the key effector; its loss may abolish downstream function. These lncRNAs up-regulate CcGPP (GRAS phosphorylase) kinase expression by binding to its promoter and acting as a scaffold to connect MRP23 and RNA polymerase while simultaneously inhibiting CcGDP (GRAS dephosphorylase) phosphatase activity by binding to key protein sites. Genetic evidence also confirms the relationship between lnc187 / lnc999 , MRP23, and the downstream CcGPP/CcGDP. This study clarifies the flavonoid hyperoside triggered regulatory axis where lnc187 / lnc999 promotes hyperphosphorylated CcGRAS to regulate pollen tube growth and seed set in pigeon pea, offering insights into reproductive development research for high-value woody species.",

Our device, VoxeLite, is a 0.1-millimeter-thick, 0.19-gram, skin-conformal array of individually addressable soft electroadhesive actuators (“nodes”). As users touch and move across surfaces, VoxeLite delivers high-resolution distributed forces via the nodes. Enabled by scalable microfabrication techniques, the display achieves actuator densities up to 110 nodes per square centimeter, produces stimuli up to 800 hertz, and remains transparent to real-world tactile input. We demonstrate its ability to render small-scale hapticons and virtual textures and transmit physical surfaces, validated through human psychophysics and biomimetic sensing. These findings position VoxeLite as a platform for human-resolution haptics in immersive interfaces, robotics, and digital touch communication.",

In a departure from multiple regression, our algebraic analysis uses minimal measurements to fully characterize the network parameters without a priori parameter estimates or iterative computation. We apply this suite of techniques to single-resonator and coupled-pair clusters and find excellent agreement with expected parameter values and broader spectral response.

We compare our plasmonic ANN against a traditional digital feed-forward equalizer and a Volterra series, as well as the corresponding digital ANN. The results demonstrate that an astonishingly small ANN outperforms classical equalizers by attaining higher SNR at smaller computational effort. While the digital ANN offers an ideal implementation, executing the ANN on our first plasmonic chip already shows remarkable equalization performance with minimal components.

Current therapeutic options are limited, and innovative treatments to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) are needed.

In the present study, single-cell RNA sequencing of bone marrow cells revealed that AMPKβ1 isoform (AMPKα1β1γ1) predominates in the erythroid lineage. AMPKβ1 activators increased the expression of HbF in erythroid cells from SCD donors and decreased sickling in vitro through activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) but independently from direct Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) inhibition, by way of a noncanonical NRF2 pathway, as shown by phosphorylation of Unc-51–like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) and sequestosome 1/p62 (SQSTM1). In vivo studies in Townes SCD mice treated with the selective AMPKβ1 activator PF-06409577 confirmed increased HbF in circulating erythrocytes, associated with decreased reactive oxygen species and reduced chronic inflammation markers. Collectively, these findings establish selective AMPKβ1 activation as a promising therapeutic approach to induce HbF in hemoglobinopathies.",

While the mTE of codons is canonically associated with their corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) isoacceptors, its regulation by amino acids in mammalian cells remains unexplored. We found that ELAC2, a 3′ tRNA maturation endonuclease, decreases the mTE of UC[C/U] serine (Ser) codons in response to Ser limitation. Ablation of ELAC2 restored UC[C/U] mTE but reduced the mTE of AG[U/C] Ser codons. Among the tRNA Ser isoacceptors, tRNA Ser(GCU) decreased the most in ELAC2 -deficient cells. Unexpectedly, tRNA Ser(GCU) delivery restored AG[U/C] mTE and reduced UC[C/U] mTE in ELAC2 -deficient cells. Last, we deciphered the effects of Ser-sensitive codons on mRNA translation and the human proteome. Our study revealed that in response to Ser limitation, regulation of tRNA Ser(GCU) levels fine-tune the mTE of UC[C/U] or AG[U/C] Ser-sensitive codons and shapes the proteome.",

However, human preimplantation embryos often display an array of morphological defects associated with poor development and implantation. Here, we used live-embryo imaging and computational analysis to capture how these defects can be produced in real time. We record various forms of mitotic errors including lagging chromosomes producing micronuclei, multipolar spindles causing abnormal chromosome organization recapitulated by daughter cells, and uncontrolled scattering of condensed chromosomes. In addition, we capture abnormal cleavage furrow dynamics during cytokinesis producing binucleated and enucleated cells. Finally, we find cells with disrupted mitotic progression ultimately leading to blebbing and fragmentation. Thus, these results document specific aberrant cell behaviors producing morphological defects in real time, and indicate that errors during mitosis and cytokinesis represent a major cause of developmental failures in human embryos.",

The probe achieves synergistic fluorescence activation through covalent binding with exposed thiols and subsequent stabilization within the local hydrophobic microenvironment of unfolded proteins. This dual-activation property allows for precise differentiation between folded and unfolded proteins in foam cells, facilitating spatiotemporal mapping of protein disorder at various stages of atherosclerosis. Notably, the probe detects early-stage unknown or tiny plaques within 4 to 8 weeks by identifying protein unfolding events before conventional Oil Red O staining and clinical ultrasonography, demonstrating unprecedented sensitivity for subclinical plaque prediction.

C. elegans muscle cells are innervated by both cholinergic and GABAergic motoneurons. The CLE-1B isoform is secreted by motoneurons and localizes to neuromuscular junctions. Loss of CLE-1B causes the relocalization of acetylcholine receptors to GABAergic synapses. We show that CLE-1B positions previously unidentified proteolytic fragments of the extracellular scaffold Punctin/MADD-4 to align acetylcholine receptors with cholinergic terminals and independently modulates receptor abundance.

Single-molecule microscopy reveals the dynamics governed by hydrodynamic interactions, demonstrating that increasing histone H4 acetylation density enhances structural fluctuations and relaxation times. In vitro Hi-C reveals power-law decay of the nucleosome contacts consistent with the Gaussian chain, which is globally reduced by acetylation.

Spatial and context-dependent activity of CA1PNs developed sequentially during learning, parallel with behavioral performance. Upon switching to a new task condition involving familiar and novel environments, neuronal activity disorganized rapidly and extensively even in the unchanged environment. In contrast, reward reversal in unchanged environments induced more gradual activity changes, associated with behavioral adaptation.

Nr4a3 overexpression promoted senescence and suppressed iCM induction, whereas knockdown enhanced reprogramming in murine and human senescent CFs. Mechanistically, Nr4a3 depletion remodeled the chromatin landscape from a fibrotic and inflammatory state to a regenerative cardiac program. Blocking downstream Cxcl14 restored reprogramming in refractory fibroblasts. In vivo, Nr4a3 knockdown improved heart function following myocardial infarction. These findings established cellular senescence as a major barrier to cardiac reprogramming and identified Nr4a3 and its effectors as potential targets to enhance heart regeneration.",

          "abstract": "Accumulating correlative studies suggest a potential role of alternative splicing in vertebrate sex determination; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we show that RNA binding motif protein 20 (RBM20) exhibits temperature-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in early embryonic gonads of the red-eared slider turtle Trachemys scripta , preceding the onset of gonadal differentiation. Knockdown of Rbm20 at male-producing temperature induces male-to-female sex reversal, whereas Rbm20 overexpression at female-producing temperature triggers male development. RBM20 represses the splicing of Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 at KTS sites, thereby governing the balance of +KTS and −KTS isoforms between different temperatures. In addition, functional analysis reveals that the Wt1  +KTS variant is both necessary and sufficient to drive male development in T. scripta . This study demonstrates that RBM20 activates the male pathway by repressing the Wt1 KTS splicing in T. scripta , thus establishing causality and a direct genetic link between alternative splicing mechanism and vertebrate sex determination.",

However, this versatility also renders them susceptible to unintended deformations under fluctuating magnetic fields. The challenge is further compounded by medical imaging limitations that hinder accurate estimation of device pose and shape and by anatomical boundaries that enforce misalignment with the field. Collectively, these factors can cause uncontrolled shape change and functional failure. Here, we focus on slender magnetic soft structures to investigate their stability under misaligned fields. Our anisotropic design, achieved through flexural joints, yields ~52-fold higher bending stiffness in the preferred direction and ~18-fold higher torsional stiffness than isotropic beams. This structure serves as a building block for stable spiral tentacles, helices, planar sheets, expandable devices, cubes, and three-dimensional tessellation. We validate robustness through wormlike self-propulsion, guidewire navigation with 30-fold lower insertion force, and capsule peristaltic locomotion, advancing safer, more controllable devices.",

The increasing PRV infections in humans—resulting in severe encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and death since 2017 in China—have also posed a public health risk. PRV can establish latency in pigs, potentially leading to disease outbreaks upon reactivation. However, little is known about the PRV reactivation process, particularly in cases with other pathogens coinfection. We found that extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli and Streptococcus suis , common zoonotic bacteria found in pigs, can trigger PRV reactivation, and bacteria up-regulated CXCL1 to enhance STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which triggers PRV reactivation by regulating the transcription of early viral genes. Effective booster immunization significantly reduced PRV reactivation among pigs. Our work highlights the risk of bacterial coinfections on PRV reactivation, emphasizing the importance of adequate immunization for controlling PRV within pigs and reducing zoonotic transmission.",

We simulate the heatwave as a present-day forecast, a preindustrial-counterfactual scenario, and a future-counterfactual scenario. Despite the extremeness of the event, our analysis shows that, under current climate conditions, we could have still seen up to 30% more heat-related deaths than the number observed. We show that between 11 and 15% of the observed human mortality was attributable to climate change during this event, depending on the conditioning of the atmospheric circulation. We also show that, had “the same event” occurred in the future, the mortality toll is nonlinear compared with the warming trend, and so the future attribution would be even more extreme, 16 to 31%. We argue that this method gives particularly reliable impact attribution results and is therefore strongly defensible in decision-making and legal settings.",

This study investigates the primary environmental parameters inducing alteration in the oil binder and elucidates the associated degradation pathways through a multiscale analytical approach, including noninvasive spectroscopic techniques and synchrotron radiation–based x-ray methods. By combining results from a historical oil painting by James Ensor (1860 to 1949) and artificially aged paint mock-ups, we identified ultraviolet A–visible light and humidity (relative humidity ≥ 95%) as key driving factors, inducing a dual degradation pathway: Light promotes surface-stratified arsenic oxidation (As 3+  → As 5+ ) resulting in amorphous As 5+ -rich compounds, whereas a dark, high moisture environment favors arsenolite (As 2 O 3 ) crystallization. In addition, a noninvasive analytical strategy is proposed for monitoring the conservation state of emerald green paints in historical artworks.",

In the Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-X, we perform experiments where meltwater fluxes representing plausible tipping trajectories of the GIS and WAIS are applied. We find that WAIS meltwater input can increase or decrease the AMOC resilience to GIS meltwater. Also, we find that it can completely prevent an AMOC collapse, confirming in a comprehensive model what was previously found in conceptual frameworks. Moreover, we find this stabilization to occur for ice sheet tipping trajectories that are relevant under high future greenhouse gas emission scenarios.",

This mechanism contributes to compensatory responses in heart failure. However, the relationship between PIEZO1 mutations and the development of cardiomyopathy remains unclear. Acute heart failure complicated with severe myocardial iron deposition was identified in the 31-year-old male proband of PIEZO1 D669Y variant. However, PIEZO1 gain-of-function (GOF) mutation D674Y mice and cardiomyocyte-specific Piezo1 overexpression disrupted cardiac function besides iron overload. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we observed suppression of lipid metabolism pathways in cardiomyocytes with the PIEZO1 GOF mutation, with forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) as a key mediator in lipid metabolism pathways. Specifically, the PIEZO1 GOF mutation increased Ca 2+ levels, leading to calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation and subsequent FOXO3 down-regulation. Together, we demonstrate that PIEZO1 GOF mutation contributes to cardiomyopathy by disrupting myocardial lipid metabolism. This study challenges the current clinical focus on iron-related mechanisms in cardiomyopathy and supports PIEZO1 as a potential candidate for future genetic screening for cardiomyopathy.",

To overcome these challenges, we have developed a piperidine-based ionic liquid (IL) additive featuring a methylthiolation cationic segment that stabilizes the interphase of layered oxide cathodes and lithium anodes under fast charging and high-voltage conditions. These ILs preferentially oxidize to form a robust cathode-electrolyte interphase with LiF and sulfide species, which effectively suppresses dissolution of transition metal and enhances interfacial ion transport. Simultaneously, the IL-derived diverse inorganic species composite interphase at the anode improves mechanical strength and inhibits lithium dendrite growth. The resulting quasi–solid-state electrolyte demonstrates stable operation at a high voltage of 4.5 V, high mass loading of 21.6 mg cm −2 , high–energy density of 407 Wh kg −1 , and broad temperature range from −20° to 60°C, advancing the practical application of QSSLMBs.",

In yeast, Osh6 transfers phosphatidylserine (PS) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane (PM) by exchange with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. We investigated why its activity depends on Ist2, an ER-resident lipid scramblase that connects the ER to the PM via an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). We found that Osh6, in a lipid-loaded state, binds the Ist2 IDR with micromolar affinity and functions at ER-PM contact sites only if its binding site within the IDR is sufficiently distant from the ER membrane. We determined, in reconstituted contact sites, that the association of Osh6 with the Ist2 IDR enables rapid, directed PS transfer. We identified the Ist2-binding site in Osh6 by molecular modeling and functional analyses. Last, we established that Ist2’s scramblase activity sustains Osh6-mediated PS transfer between membranes. Identifying these functional partnerships highlights why lipid transport processes are organized in membrane contact sites.",

We observed pronounced mitochondrial disruption in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, including distorted ultrastructure and CHCHD2 aggregation, as well as disrupted mitochondrial protein-protein interactions in brain lysates. These abnormalities were associated with a whole-body metabolic shift toward glycolysis, elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and progressive accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein. In idiopathic PD, CHCHD2 gene expression also correlated with α-synuclein levels in vulnerable dopaminergic neurons, and CHCHD2 protein accumulated in early Lewy aggregates. These findings delineate a pathogenic cascade in which CHCHD2 accumulation impairs mitochondrial respiration and increases ROS production, driving α-synuclein aggregation and neurodegeneration.",

Our model shows that rising parental care costs, particularly under environmental stress, may favor the emergence of OBP. However, its persistence requires additional life-history adaptations, including increases in fecundity (egg production). Paleoclimatic data support this framework: OBP origins often followed major climatic upheavals with fixations occurring during subsequently more stable periods. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that OBP is associated with high-mortality ecological traits, such as open-habitat use. We also find increased OBP likelihood in both smaller carnivorous and larger herbivorous/omnivorous species, indicating size-dependent trophic constraints. These results provide a unified framework explaining the recurrent evolution of OBP by linking environmental pressures and life-history trade-offs to this remarkable behavioral adaptation.",

Pre–mid-1990s, traditional eastern Pacific ENSO dominated, driving a positive ENSO-BSWI linkage; post–mid-1990s, more frequent central Pacific (CP) ENSO events reversed this relationship to negative. Observations and model experiments show that CP El Niño coupled with positive-phase North Pacific meridional mode (NPMM) redirects poleward-propagating Rossby wave trains, enhancing Bering Sea southerlies. This suppresses ice advection, intensifies warm air intrusion, and reduces BSWI. Strengthened CP ENSO-NPMM coupling and heightened NPMM variability amplify this teleconnection, increasing its influence on BSWI by 38.9% versus NPMM alone. Our findings underscore the growing role of subtropical and tropical Pacific climate interactions in subarctic sea ice variability and highlight the need for improved climate models that capture ENSO diversity, NPMM dynamics, and subtropical-subarctic teleconnections to enhance BSWI projections under climate change.",

          "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) sclerosis represents a prominent feature of fibrotic disorders; however, the macrophage response to changes in matrix stiffness and its impact on fibrotic diseases remain unclear. This study reveals a vicious circle of ECM-cell-ECM, where increased ECM hardness activates the STING pathway in macrophages, in turn activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), thus enhancing ECM stiffness again and exacerbating liver fibrosis. To reverse liver fibrosis, an innovative carrier-free nanosystem capable of degrading ECM, specifically blocking the STING pathway in macrophages as well as remodeling matrix mechanical, is created. In mouse models, pharmacological STING inhibition via alkylation in macrophages, combined with ECM degradation via matrix metalloproteinases and metal ion–induced macrophage polarization, reduces stromal stiffness and reverses fibrosis. Our findings underscore the antifibrotic potential of matrix mechanical remodeling, demonstrating that concurrent reduction of matrix stiffness and inhibition of STING pathway in macrophages can synergistically promote fibrosis regression. This research establishes a previously unidentified paradigm for liver fibrosis reversal.",

This study highlights the crucial role of tropical cyclones (TCs) in disrupting MHWs by altering ocean temperatures. As demonstrated by Tropical Cyclone Bavi, intense sea surface temperature (SST) cooling, reaching up to 7°C, immediately terminated a mature MHW and suppressed subsequent MHW development for up to 8 months. More generally, on the basis of post-TC MHW cases (reoccurring within 1 month) during 2014 to 2023, we found that MHW disruption duration is proportional to the magnitude of TC-induced SST cooling, ~5 to 7 days per degree of cooling. At a broader scale, a 20-year (2004 to 2023) analysis revealed 99% significant inverse relationships between seasonal MHW and TC activity. These findings suggest that TCs can act as natural regulators, effectively mitigating heat stress from MHWs and potentially serving as a lifeline for marine ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance differs fundamentally from nuclear inheritance owing to exclusive maternal transmission, high mutation rate, and lack of recombination. Two key mechanisms shape this inheritance: the bottleneck, which drives stochastic transmission of maternal mtDNA variants, and purifying selection, which actively removes mutant mtDNA. Whether these mechanisms interact has been unresolved. To address this question, we generated a series of mouse models with random mtDNA mutations alongside alleles altering mtDNA copy number or decreasing autophagy. We demonstrate that tightening the mtDNA bottleneck increases heteroplasmic variance between individuals, causing lower mutational burden and nonsynonymous-to-synonymous ratios. In contrast, reduced autophagy weakens purifying selection, leading to decreased interoffspring heteroplasmic variance and increased mutational burden with higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous ratios. These findings provide experimental evidence that the mtDNA bottleneck size modulates the efficacy of purifying selection. Our findings yield fundamental insights into the processes governing mammalian mtDNA transmission with direct implications for the origin and propagation of mtDNA mutations causing human disease.",

The global ground heat storage presents a positive acceleration between 0.16 ± 0.15 and 0.624 ± 0.032 zettajoules per square decade, similarly to the rest of components of the Earth heat inventory.

HE-O-MIEC exhibits an electronic conductivity of 1150 siemens per centimeter and a Li + conductivity of 2.3 × 10 −4  siemens per centimeter at room temperature. The enhanced Li + conductivity is attributed to the large configurational entropy, promoting multicomponent solubility and increased Li + concentration. HE-O-MIEC exhibits electrochemical and thermodynamic compatibility with LiCoO 2 and stabilizes ion/electron transport in the ASSLMB using the Li 6.4 La 3 Zr 1.4 Ta 0.6 O 12 electrolyte. Without organic electrolyte or additional pressure, the ASSLMB achieves 115–milliampere·hours per gram initial discharge capacity at 30°C and retains 83% capacity after 500 cycles. Homogeneous electron and ion transport in the HE-O-MIEC demonstrates potential to improve active material utilization and address interfacial challenges in ceramic-based ASSLMBs.",

Subsequently, all 17 space groups in the Euclidean plane can be achieved with only two sets of module tessellations, which can be reversibly tuned by a simple binary pressurization strategy for air pouches. Furthermore, the selection rules of multipole quasibound states in the continuum via symmetry group tuning in metasurface are established by combining electromagnetic antennas.

During apoptosis, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by BCL-2-associated X protein/BCL-2 Homolog Antagonist Killer (BAX/BAK) pores facilitates release of apoptotic factors, while the role of inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) remodeling remains less understood. Here, we identify serine beta-lactamase-like protein (LACTB), a filament-forming serine protease and tumor suppressor, as a regulator of IMM dynamics during apoptosis. LACTB suppression reduces cytochrome c release and apoptosis, whereas its overexpression promotes these effects. LACTB does not affect BAX or Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria. Rather, LACTB is required for apoptosis-induced mitochondrial remodeling, independent of OPA1 processing. Intriguingly, LACTB knockdown does not affect mitochondrial shape changes induced by CCCP treatment, suggesting that LACTB action is apoptosis-specific. Purified LACTB binds and remodels cardiolipin-enriched membrane nanotubes preferentially over planar lipid membranes, suggesting a direct effect in apoptotic membrane remodeling. Collectively, our findings suggest LACTB to be a mediator of apoptosis-induced IMM remodeling, a possible mechanism for tumor suppression in cancer.",

Its origin, which is currently disputed, affects interpretations about the composition of the ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere on early Earth. Direct precipitation from anoxic seawater is unlikely because of its prohibitively slow nucleation rate even in supersaturated solutions. However, recent modeling suggests that siderite may have precipitated at higher temperatures during hydrothermal fluid–seawater mixing in ancient anoxic oceans. Here, we report the presence of iron-rich siderite microparticles (&lt;1.0 micrometers) in 3.49- to 3.25-Ga exhalative iron cherts from the Pilbara Craton, Australia, which we interpret to have formed during venting of iron(II)-rich hydrothermal fluids into anoxic water columns. Geochemical modeling suggests that coexisting magnesium-rich siderite formed in solutions dominated by seawater. The lack of hydrothermal iron siderite and predominance of magnesium siderite in younger analogs indicate that the bulk of siderite in iron formations is diagenetic and formed from marine pore fluids.",

Specifically, circHERC1 binds to the TERT promoter, facilitating the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and c-Fos, thereby activating TERT expression. Notably, circHERC1 expression exhibits a decline with age, which correlates with reduced telomerase activity. Restoration of circHERC1 expression enhances telomerase activity, promotes telomere elongation, and reverses aging-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, delivery of circHERC1 using adeno-associated virus vectors or extracellular vesicles effectively restores telomerase activity, preserves telomere integrity, and mitigates senescence. This intervention leads to improvements in cognitive function, physical performance, and a reduction in inflammation. These findings highlight the important role of circHERC1 in telomerase regulation and the aging process, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target for antiaging interventions.",

Using these maps, we resolve spatial heterogeneity among pancreatic cell types and uncover epithelial-mesenchymal units as basic tissue niches, which we functionally characterize in both mouse and human models. We also demonstrate that the mesenchymal lineage diversifies into various specialized subtypes during development, but this complexity diminishes over time, ultimately converging into a few fibroblast subtypes in adulthood.

          "abstract": "Manipulation of laser emission characteristics plays a key role in diverse technologies. However, compact lasers with internal beam steering functionalities remain a challenge. Here, we demonstrate how gradient moiré perovskite superlattices can facilitate dynamic laser beam steering. By combining a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice with a globally curved 1D perovskite grating, we fabricated gradient moiré photonic superlattices with continuously variable twist angles. We revealed how the moiré interlayer coupling at the high-symmetry points on the Brillouin zone boundaries can produce additional cavity modes with twist angle–controlled wave vectors. We showed that the moiré-induced band-edge modes can support lasing with low thresholds. By sweeping the pump area to access different twist angles, we achieved tuning of laser emission angles in a continuous and wide range (&gt;30°) from a single device. Our work provides a highly tunable platform for moiré-induced light-matter interactions, which opens prospects for programmable and intelligent photonic technologies.",

          "abstract": "There is currently no effective treatment for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), half of which result from malignant progression of neurofibromas (NFs) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NFs are due to biallelic loss-of-function of NF1, which negatively regulates the RAS pathway, in the Schwann cell lineage. We generated a conditional Nf1-mutant mouse model where NFs spontaneously transform into MPNSTs, faithfully recapitulating the human situation. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling demonstrated progression of NFs into MPNSTs, with a glial-to-mesenchymal transition. Sox9 was identified as a marker of this transition and key player in tumor growth. The transition is followed by a loss of the tumor suppressor gene (TSG) Cdkn2a and acquisition of pathogenic variants of other TSGs. Finally, a proof-of-concept drug screen aimed at reducing Sox9 expression in tumor cells identified 12 FDA-approved drugs. Notably, several of these agents target the RAS signaling cascade, suggesting that multi-targeted inhibition of this pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy against MPNSTs.",

Using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to analyze the dynamics of the sterile soil exometabolomes alongside C-CO 2 flux analyses and sterile soil fuel cells, we show that soil catalysts facilitate a diverse array of substrate-driven reactions, leading to the complete oxidation of organic compounds to CO 2 with O 2 consumption. Our results indicate that soil particles are capable of transferring electrons from substrates to the final acceptor, thereby sustaining metabolism-like processes independently of living cells. Notably, some soil catalysts and induced respiration remain stable for more than 6 years. These findings support the coexistence of cellular and noncellular metabolic pathways in soil respiration.",

How such a shock is launched and propagates through the star is a decade-long puzzle. Some models assume that the shock can be reenergized by absorbing neutrinos, leading to highly aspherical explosions. Other models involve jet-powered shocks that lead to bipolar explosions reflected in the geometry of the shock-breakout emission. We report measurement of the geometry of the shock breakout through unprecedentedly early spectropolarimetry of the nearby type II supernova 2024ggi starting ~1.2 days after the explosion. The measurement indicates a well-defined symmetry axis of the shock breakout, which is also shared by the hydrogen-rich envelope that emerged after the circumstellar matter was engulfed by the ejecta, revealing a persisting and prominent symmetry axis throughout the explosion. These findings suggest that the physical mechanism driving the explosion of massive stars manifests a well-defined axial symmetry and acts on large scales.",

We confirm that abundant small, insulin-positive EOs are present in donors without diabetes and comprise most of the pancreatic endocrine area in early life. Small EOs are virtually absent in individuals with T1D, and this effect is most pronounced in children diagnosed with T1D in their earliest years. We conclude that extraislet β cells are affected in T1D development, and their early loss is a characteristic feature.

At anaphase onset, sister separation is triggered by the proteolytic cleavage of the cohesin subunit SCC1/RAD21 by separase. SCC1 contains two cleavage sites, where cleavage is stimulated by SCC1 phosphorylation. Substrate recognition and cleavage are only partly understood. Here, we determined structures of human separase in apo- or substrate-bound forms that, together with biochemical analysis, provide critical insights into separase cleavage regulation. We verify the first SCC1 cleavage site and reassign the second. We show that substrates, including separase autocleavage sites and the two SCC1 cleavage sites, interact with docking sites in separase, including five phosphate-binding sites. We also describe the interaction between the cohesin subunit SA1/SA2 and separase, which promotes cleavage at the second SCC1 site. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry and cryo–electron microscopy, we propose how cohesin is targeted by human separase.

We hypothesized that cancer prevalence and mortality risk might have been fine-tuned by evolution. Using public databases, we show that species with cooperative habits have lower cancer prevalence and mortality risk. By developing a mathematical model, we provide a mechanistic explanation: An oncogenic variant that elicits higher cancer mortality in older and less-reproductive individuals is detrimental to cooperative mammalian societies but can lead to a counterintuitive overcompensation in population size and fitness within competitive contexts. The phenomenon of a population increasing in response to a decrease in its per capita survival rate is called the hydra effect, a process never explored in the field of cancer before. Therefore, cancer can be considered as a selected mechanism of biological obsolescence in competitive species.",

Our structures reveal a series of gene products: (i) a capsid decorated with β-tulip proteins at three-fold symmetry axes and a Hoc-like protein at hexamer centers, (ii) a conserved connector with an additional 12-fold ring of collar proteins that extend unique whisker proteins that are structurally related to podophage GP4 tail fibers, and (iii) a baseplate with long tail fibers resembling a contracted form of T4’s long tail fibers.

Siglec-liposomes offer tunable multivalency and a modular assembly, enabling presentation of different Siglecs on the same liposome. Using Siglec-liposomes, we profiled Siglec ligands on human leukocytes, revealing distinct patterns of Siglec ligands. Moreover, Siglec-liposomes are in vivo compatible, where we demonstrated that Siglec-7–liposomes bind to the brain vasculature in a mucin domain–dependent manner. Given the abundance of Siglec ligands on T cells, we investigated whether Siglec-liposomes modulate T cell function and find that Siglec-7–liposomes increase T cell proliferation in an ST3Gal1-dependent and CD43-independent manner.

We show that prolonged decreases in precipitation are associated with increased overall conflict occurrences across taxa and are significantly associated with increased conflict with carnivore species in particular.

We realize a PCF with guided modes produced by photonic band structure topology rather than conventional mode-trapping mechanisms. The design, which is compatible with the stack-and-draw fabrication process, consists of a cross-sectional photonic topological crystalline insulator with a disclination. A bulk-defect correspondence produces degenerate topological modes, lying below the cladding light line. We use various theoretical methods to confirm their topological origins, including a spectral localizer that makes minimal assumptions about the band structure. Our experiments on the fabricated fiber show it transmitting visible to near-infrared light with low losses of 10 to 20 decibels per kilometer, which do not increase substantially when the fiber is bent. A comparable solid-core PCF of conventional design exhibits substantially higher bending losses.

Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE, the partitioning of metabolized carbon for microbial growth) is crucial to the fate of soil carbon, but how it changes with warming remains unknown. Here, in contrast to the often hypothesized negative temperature dependence of microbial CUE, we observed a positive microbial CUE-temperature relationship after a decade of modest ecosystem-level warming (+1.0° and +2.1°C) in subtropical China. The warmed microbial community shifted toward more K -strategists, and the increased network stability drove metabolic thermal adjustments. These thermal adjustments resulted in homeostasis, such that warmed soils did not differ from unwarmed (+0°C) soils in microbial respiration and growth, weakening the initially stimulated carbon decomposition. These results suggest that warming-induced soil-plant system imbalance can recover to a prewarming steady state within a few seasons, mitigating predicted increases in soil carbon losses.",

Capsules are fabricated via gas-foamed expansion of nanofiber mats or hybrid aerogel formation, enabling rapid in situ reexpansion upon gastric fluid exposure and safe retrieval.
