Kotz, Levermann and Wenz2, henceforth KLW, statistically analysed economic and climate data, finding significant projected damages until mid-century and a divergence in outcomes between high- and low-emission scenarios thereafter. We find that their analysis underestimates uncertainty owing to large, unaccounted-for spatial correlations on the subnational level, rendering their results statistically insignificant when properly corrected. Thus, their study does not provide the robust empirical evidence needed to inform climate policy.",

          "abstract": "The time interval between about three and two million years ago is a critical period in human evolution—this is when the genera Homo and Paranthropus first appear in the fossil record and a possible ancestor of these genera, Australopithecus afarensis, disappears. In eastern Africa, attempts to test hypotheses about the adaptive contexts that led to these events are limited by a paucity of fossiliferous exposures that capture this interval. Here we describe the age, geologic context and dental morphology of new hominin fossils recovered from the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area, Ethiopia, which includes sediments from this critically underrepresented period. We report the presence of Homo at 2.78 and 2.59 million years ago and Australopithecus at 2.63 million years ago. Although the Australopithecus specimens cannot yet be identified to species level, their morphology differs from A. afarensis and Australopithecus garhi. These specimens suggest that Australopithecus and early Homo co-existed as two non-robust lineages in the Afar Region before 2.5 million years ago, and that the hominin fossil record is more diverse than previously known. Accordingly, there were as many as four hominin lineages living in eastern Africa between 3.0 and 2.5 million years ago: early Homo1, Paranthropus2, A. garhi3, and the newly discovered Ledi-Geraru Australopithecus.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of animal phyla, each with their unique body plan, was a rapid event in the history of animal life, yet its genomic underpinnings are still poorly understood 1 . Here we investigate at the genomic, regulatory and cellular levels, the origin of one of the most distinctive animal phyla, the chaetognaths, whose organismal characteristics have historically complicated their phylogenetic placement 2,3 . We show that these characteristics are reflected at the cell-type level by the expression of genes that originated in the chaetognath lineage, contributing to adaptation to planktonic life at the sensory and structural levels 4 . Similarly to other members of gnathiferans (which also include rotifers and several other microscopic phyla) 5,6 , chaetognaths have undergone accelerated genomic evolution with gene loss and chromosomal fusions 7,8 . Furthermore, they secondarily duplicated thousands of genes 9,10 , without evidence for a whole-genome duplication, yielding, for instance, tandemly expanded Hox genes, as well as many phylum-specific genes. We also detected repeat-rich highly methylated neocentromeres and a simplified DNA methylation toolkit that is involved in mobile element repression rather than transcriptional control. Consistent with fossil evidence 11,12 , our observations suggest that chaetognaths emerged after a phase of morphological simplification through a reinvention of organ systems paralleled by massive genomic reorganization, explaining the uniqueness of their body plan.",

          "abstract": "Large earthquakes induce widespread landslides that fill river channels with sediment1,2, generating long-lasting fluvial hazards and reshaping mountain topography. However, riverine sediment fluxes after earthquakes remain poorly resolved, mostly because of a lack of data on bedload flux3,4. Here we construct a source-to-sink sediment budget following the 2008 Mw7.9 (where Mw is the moment magnitude) Wenchuan earthquake in the eastern Tibetan mountains. We measured sediment accumulation in a man-made reservoir downstream of the earthquake-affected region. Ten years after the earthquake, the Min Jiang River had exported about 9% of the sediment mass from earthquake-triggered landslides, with around 5.7 times increase in the total riverine sediment flux sustained over that time. Bedload flux increased by \\({27.4}_{-15.6}^{+14.6} \\% \\) times compared with pre-earthquake levels, making up \\(6{5}_{-26}^{+12} \\% \\) of the post-earthquake sediment export—a proportion much higher than typical of most mountainous rivers. At the current pace, the river system will remove most Wenchuan landslide debris over centennial timescales. However, future sediment export rates are likely to vary because of changes on hillslopes (for example, revegetation) and in hydrology, sediment characteristics and transport processes. Our findings demonstrate a decadal bedload-dominated sediment pulse driven by earthquake-triggered landslides, suggesting that increased vulnerability to cascading hazards such as aggradation and flooding could persist for decades in populated downstream regions after a large earthquake.",

Their assessment implies that planted rubber may have caused over 4 Mha of deforestation since 1993—a value greater than assumed in setting deforestation policies. Unfortunately, their estimates rely on incorrect methods. Moreover, their definition of ‘deforestation’ is misleading because it includes all tree cover loss, not just natural forests. They include losses from young regrowth, established rubber gardens and other plantations. Our assessment indicates that, since 2001, the actual extent of deforestation associated with planted rubber is approximately one-quarter that reported by Wang et al.1.",

          "abstract": "T cells respond to cytokines through receptor dimers that have been selected over the course of evolution to activate canonical JAK–STAT signalling and gene expression programs1. However, the potential combinatorial diversity of JAK–STAT receptor pairings can be expanded by exploring the untapped biology of alternative non-natural pairings. Here we exploited the common γ chain (γc) receptor as a shared signalling hub on T cells and enforced the expression of both natural and non-natural heterodimeric JAK–STAT receptor pairings using an orthogonal cytokine receptor platform2,3,4 to expand the γc signalling code. We tested receptors from γc cytokines as well as interferon, IL-10 and homodimeric receptor families that do not normally pair with γc or are not naturally expressed on T cells. These receptors simulated their natural counterparts but also induced contextually unique transcriptional programs. This led to distinct T cell fates in tumours, including myeloid-like T cells with phagocytic capacity driven by orthogonal GSCFR (oGCSFR), and type 2 cytotoxic T (TC2) and helper T (TH2) cell differentiation driven by orthogonal IL-4R (o4R). T cells with orthogonal IL-22R (o22R) and oGCSFR, neither of which are natively expressed on T cells, exhibited stem-like and exhaustion-resistant transcriptional and chromatin landscapes, enhancing anti-tumour properties. Non-native receptor pairings and their resultant JAK–STAT signals open a path to diversifying T cell states beyond those induced by natural cytokines.",

          "abstract": "Interactions between melting ice and a warming ocean drive the present-day retreat of tidewater glaciers of Greenland 1–3 , with consequences for both sea level rise 4 and the global climate system 5 . Controlling glacier frontal ablation, these ice–ocean interactions involve chains of small-scale processes that link glacier calving—the detachment of icebergs 6 —and submarine melt to the broader fjord dynamics 7,8 . However, understanding these processes remains limited, in large part due to the challenge of making targeted observations in hazardous environments near calving fronts with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution 9 . Here we show that iceberg calving can act as a submarine melt amplifier through excitation of transient internal waves. Our observations are based on front-proximal submarine fibre sensing of the iceberg calving process chain. In this chain, calving initiates with persistent ice fracturing that coalesces into iceberg detachment, which in turn excites local tsunamis, internal gravity waves and transient currents at the ice front before the icebergs eventually decay into fragments. Our observations show previously unknown pathways in which tidewater glaciers interact with a warming ocean and help close the ice front ablation budget, which current models struggle to do 10 . These insights provide new process-scale understanding pertinent to retreating tidewater glaciers around the globe.",

          "abstract": "The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) class of drugs represents a remarkable advance in the treatment of patients with homologous recombination-deficient tumours, but resistance remains a challenge1,2,3,4,5. Although most research has focused on the downstream consequences of PARPi exposure to tackle resistance, the immediate effect of PARP inhibition on the chromatin environment and its contribution to PARPi toxicity remains elusive. Here we show that PARP inhibition induces histone release from the chromatin. This presents a vulnerability of PARPi-resistant cancer cells, which require histone homeostasis mechanisms to sustain elevated DNA replication rates and survival. Through functional genetic screens, we identified NASP as a key factor in maintaining the stability of evicted histones via its TPR motifs. Loss of NASP renders tumour cells hypersensitive to PARPi treatment in vitro and in vivo, impairs replication fork progression and elevates levels of replication-associated DNA damage. Moreover, NASP acts together with the INO80 complex and the chaperoning activity of PARP1 to ensure efficient histone turnover and prevent the accumulation of lethal DNA damage. Collectively, our work reports on histone eviction as an immediate cellular response to PARPi treatment and provides a promising avenue for targeting histone supply pathways to overcome PARPi resistance.",

Until now, all reported high-performance thermoelectric materials have realized only flexibility, rather than elasticity3,4. Here we present one of the first n-type thermoelectric elastomers by integrating uniform bulk nanophase separation, thermally activated crosslinking and targeted doping into a single material. The thermoelectric elastomers could exhibit exceptional rubber-like recovery of up to 150% strains and high figure of merit values rivalling flexible inorganic materials even under mechanical deformations. Conventional wisdom suggests that incorporating insulating polymers should dilute the active component in organic thermoelectrics, resulting in lower performance. However, we demonstrate that carefully selected elastomers and dopants can promote the formation of uniformly distributed, elastomer-wrapped and heavily n-doped semiconducting polymer nanofibrils, leading to improved electrical conductivity and decreased thermal conductivity. These thermoelectric elastomers have the potential to make elastic thermoelectric generators in wearable applications much more conformable and efficient.",

However, the geologic history of marine DOC remains largely unconstrained 6,7 , limiting our ability to mechanistically reconstruct coupled ecological and biogeochemical evolution. Here we develop and validate a direct proxy for past DOC signatures using co-precipitated organic carbon in iron ooids. We apply this to 26 marine iron ooid-containing formations deposited over the past 1,650 million years to generate a data-based reconstruction of marine DOC signals since the Palaeoproterozoic. Our predicted DOC concentrations were near modern levels in the Palaeoproterozoic, then decreased by 90−99% in the Neoproterozoic before sharply rising in the Cambrian. We interpret these dynamics to reflect three distinct states. The occurrence of mostly small, single-celled organisms combined with severely hypoxic deep oceans, followed by larger, more complex organisms and little change in ocean oxygenation and finally continued organism growth and a transition to fully oxygenated oceans 8,9 . Furthermore, modern DOC is 13 C-enriched relative to the Proterozoic, possibly because of changing autotrophic carbon-isotope fractionation driven by biological innovation. Our findings reflect connections between the carbon cycle, ocean oxygenation and the evolution of complex life.",

          "abstract": "While physical activity is critical to human health, most people do not meet recommended guidelines 1,2 . Built environments that are more walkable have the potential to increase activity across the population 3–8 . However, previous studies on the built environment and physical activity have led to mixed findings, possibly due to methodological limitations such as small cohorts, over-reliance on self-reported measures and cross-sectional designs 5,7,9–11 . Here we address these limitations by leveraging a large US cohort of smartphone users ( N = 2,112,288) to evaluate within-person longitudinal behaviour changes that occurred over 248,266 days of objectively measured physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities. By analysing the results of this natural experiment, which exposed individuals to differing built environments, we find that increases (decreases) in walkability are associated with significant increases (decreases) in physical activity after relocation. For example, moving from a less walkable (25th percentile) city to a more walkable city (75th percentile) increased walking by 1,100 daily steps, on average. These changes hold across different genders, ages and body mass index values, and are sustained over 3 months. The added activity is predominantly composed of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which is linked to an array of associated health benefits 1 . Evidence against residential self-selection confounding is reported. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the importance of the built environment in directly improving health-enhancing physical activity and offer potential guidance for public policy activities in this area.",

          "abstract": "Unravelling how genomes are spatially organized and how their three-dimensional (3D) architecture drives cellular functions remains a major challenge in biology 1,2 . In bacteria, genomic DNA is compacted into a highly ordered, condensed state called nucleoid 3–5 . Despite progress in characterizing bacterial 3D genome architecture over recent decades 6–8 , the fine structure and functional organization of the nucleoid remain elusive due to low-resolution contact maps from methods such as Hi-C 9–11 . Here we developed an enhanced Micro-C chromosome conformation capture, achieving 10-base pair (bp) resolution. This ultra-high-resolution analysis reveals elemental spatial structures in the Escherichia coli nucleoid, including chromosomal hairpins (CHINs) and chromosomal hairpin domains (CHIDs). These structures, organized by histone-like proteins H-NS and StpA, have key roles in repressing horizontally transferred genes. Disruption of H-NS causes drastic reorganization of the 3D genome, decreasing CHINs and CHIDs, whereas removing both H-NS and StpA results in their complete disassembly, increased transcription of horizontally transferred genes and delayed growth. Similar effects are observed with netropsin, which competes with H-NS and StpA for AT-rich DNA binding. Interactions between CHINs further organize the genome into isolated loops, potentially insulating active operons. Our Micro-C analysis reveals that all actively transcribed genes form distinct operon-sized chromosomal interaction domains (OPCIDs) in a transcription-dependent manner. These structures appear as square patterns on Micro-C maps, reflecting continuous contacts throughout transcribed regions. This work unveils the fundamental structural elements of the E. coli nucleoid, highlighting their connection to nucleoid-associated proteins and transcription machinery.",

Proposed structures range from microscale engineered aerosols1, to centimetre-scale thin disks with variations in surface accommodation coefficients2,3, to sandwich structures with nanoscale thickness4,5 that might be extended to metre-scale width6,7. Quantitative understanding of how structural and surface properties determine photophoretic lofting forces is necessary to develop a practical flying device. Here we focus on thermal transpiration as the most promising photophoretic mechanism for lofting large devices8 and present a hybrid analytical–numerical model of the lofting force on a structure that consists of two perforated membranes spaced a small distance apart. We identify optimal structural parameters, including device size, membrane perforation density and distribution of the vertical ligaments that connect the two membranes, each as a function of atmospheric altitude. Targeting these optimal parameters, we fabricate structures with a heterogeneous ligament distribution, which efficiently compromises between structural rigidity and photophoretic performance. We measure how lofting forces generated by these structures depend on pressure using gases with three different molecular weights. We observed photophoretic levitation of a 1-cm-wide structure at an air pressure of 26.7 Pa when illuminated by 750 W m−2, about 55% the intensity of sunlight. Lastly, we describe the preliminary design of a 3-cm-radius device with 10-mg payload capacity at 75-km altitudes and discuss horizontal motion control, overnight settling, and applications in climate sensing, communications and Martian exploration.",

As such, current rates of land degradation pose a major environmental and socioeconomic threat, driving climate change, biodiversity loss and social crises. Preventing and reversing land degradation are key objectives of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and are also fundamental for the other two Rio Conventions: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Here we argue that the targets of these conventions can only be met by ‘bending the curve’ of land degradation and that transforming food systems is fundamental for doing so. We showcase multiple actions for tackling land degradation that also yield climate and biodiversity benefits while fostering sustainable food systems that contribute to avoiding the risk of a global food crisis. We also propose ambitious 2050 targets for the three Rio Conventions related to land and food systems. Finally, we urge collective action to acknowledge the pivotal role of land in achieving the goals of the Rio Conventions and to embed food systems within intergovernmental agreements, enabling decisive progress on the complex and interconnected global crises that we face.",

Here we present allele-specific phylogenetic analysis of copy number alterations (ALPACA), a method to infer SNV and SCNA coevolution by leveraging phylogenetic trees reconstructed from multi-sample bulk tumour sequencing data using SNV frequencies. ALPACA estimates the SCNA evolution of simulated tumours with a higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods 1–4 . ALPACA uncovers loss-of-heterozygosity and amplification events in minor clones that may be missed using standard approaches and reveals the temporal order of somatic alterations. Analysing clone-specific copy numbers in TRACERx421 lung tumours 5,6 , we find evidence of increased chromosomal instability in metastasis-seeding clones and enrichment for losses affecting tumour suppressor genes and amplification affecting CCND1 . Furthermore, we identify increased SCNA rates in both tumours with polyclonal metastatic dissemination and tumours with extrathoracic metastases, and an association between higher clone copy number diversity and reduced disease-free survival in patients with lung cancer.",

          "abstract": "After fertilization, early embryos undergo dissolution of conventional chromatin organization, including topologically associating domains (TADs)1,2. Zygotic genome activation then commences amid unusually slow de novo establishment of three-dimensional chromatin architecture2. How chromatin organization is established and how it interplays with transcription in early mammalian embryos remain elusive. Here we show that CTCF occupies chromatin throughout mouse early development. By contrast, cohesin poorly binds chromatin in one-cell embryos, coinciding with TAD dissolution. Cohesin binding then progressively increases from two- to eight-cell embryos, accompanying TAD establishment. Unexpectedly, strong ‘genic cohesin islands’ (GCIs) emerge across gene bodies of active genes in this period. GCI genes enrich for cell identity and regulatory genes, display broad H3K4me3 at promoters, and exhibit strong binding of transcription factors and the cohesin loader NIPBL at nearby enhancers. We show that transcription is hyperactive in two- to eight-cell embryos and is required for GCI formation. Conversely, induced transcription can also create GCIs. Finally, GCIs can function as insulation boundaries and form contact domains with nearby CTCF sites, enhancing both the transcription levels and stability of GCI genes. These data reveal a hypertranscription state in early embryos that both shapes and is fostered by the three-dimensional genome organization, revealing an intimate interplay between chromatin structure and transcription.",

Nevertheless, the practical applications of LMBs are constrained by current electrolyte designs that inherently rely on dominant solvation structures, preventing transformative progress in performance optimization4,5. Here, we address this limitation through a delocalized electrolyte design that fosters a more disordered solvation microenvironment, thereby mitigating dynamic barriers and stabilizing interphases. The resulting delocalized electrolyte delivers notable energy densities of 604.2 Wh kg−1 in a 5.5-Ah LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (Ni90)||Li pouch cell with a lean electrolyte design (1.0 g Ah−1) and 618.2 Wh kg−1 in a 5.2-Ah Ni90||Li pouch cell with an ultralean electrolyte design (0.9 g Ah−1), maintaining significant cycle stability over 100 and 90 cycles, respectively. In addition, the 70–104 V NCM811||Li battery pack (3,904 Wh) exhibits a high energy density of 480.9 Wh kg−1 and stable cycling over 25 cycles.

Here we demonstrate abrogated ferroptotic cell death propagation in female kidney tubules. 17β-oestradiol establishes an anti-ferroptotic state through non-genomic and genomic mechanisms. These include the potent direct inhibition of ferroptosis by hydroxyoestradiol derivatives, which function as radical trapping antioxidants, are present at high concentrations in kidney tubules and, when exogenously applied, protect male mice from AKI. In cells, the oxidized hydroxyoestradiols are recycled by FSP19,10, but FSP1-deficient female mice were not sensitive to AKI. At the genomic level, female ESR1-deficient kidney tubules partially lose their anti-ferroptotic capacity, similar to ovariectomized mice. While ESR1 promotes the anti-ferroptotic hydropersulfide system, male tubules express pro-ferroptotic proteins of the ether lipid pathway which are suppressed by ESR1 in female tissues until menopause. In summary, we identified non-genomic and genomic mechanisms that collectively explain ferroptosis resistance in female tubules and may function as therapeutic targets for male and postmenopausal female individuals.",

          "abstract": "The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)—the leading pattern of climate variability driving changes over the North Pacific and surrounding continents—is now thought to be generated by processes internal to the climate system1,2. According to this paradigm, the characteristic, irregular oscillations of the PDO arise from a collection of mechanisms involving ocean and atmosphere interactions in the North and tropical Pacific3,4,5. Recent variations in the coupled ocean–atmosphere system, such as the 2015 El Niño, ought to have shifted the PDO into its positive phase6. Yet, the PDO has been locked in a consistent downward trend for more than three decades, remanding nearby regions to a steady set of climate impacts. Here we show that the main multidecadal variations in the PDO index during the twentieth century, including the ongoing, decades-long negative trend, were largely driven by human emissions of aerosols and greenhouse gases rather than internal processes. This anthropogenic influence was previously undetected because the current generation of climate models systematically underestimate the amplitude of forced climate variability. A new attribution technique that statistically corrects for this error suggests that observed PDO impacts—including the ongoing multidecadal drought in the western United States—can be largely attributed to human activity through externally forced changes in the PDO. These results indicate that we need to rethink the attribution and projection of multidecadal changes in regional climate.",

          "abstract": "How seriously should people be taking climate change? United Nations secretary-general António Gutteres considers it an existential threat. Yet, US President Donald Trump has decreed it a hoax. On 29 July, a US Department of Energy (DOE) report by a group of contrarian climate scientists concluded that “CO2-induced warming might be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and excessively aggressive mitigation policies could prove more detrimental than beneficial” (see go.nature.com/4amktth).\n\nWhat does the science say: hoax, lukewarm inconvenience or catastrophe? According to the best-available evidence, none of the above is right.\n\nThere is much in the DOE report to be critical of (see Nature https://doi.org/pz8h; 2025). However, its authors are correct in one respect: the most important uncertainty in our ability to predict how much global temperatures will increase as carbon emissions continue is related to how cloud coverage will change over time.\n\nHow AI is improving climate forecasts\n\nLow-level clouds reflect sunlight back to space, whereas high-level ones trap heat emitted from Earth’s surface. Most climate models predict that, overall, clouds will amplify the effects of humanity’s greenhouse-gas emissions through a decrease in cover by low-level clouds and an increase for high-level ones. If so, global temperatures could rise by 4 °C or more — a catastrophe because of the amount of sea-level rise and the increasing occurrence of deadly heatwaves.\n\nBut the opposite scenario cannot be ruled out fully. Increased low-level cloud cover would reflect extra sunlight and help to offset the warming effect of climate change — a relatively lukewarm outcome.\n\nOne reason for this uncertainty is that, in the models, cloud-forming processes are represented by simplified formulae. Another is related to how cloud formation differs around the globe because of air-temperature and humidity variations linked to wind patterns. Climate models make systematic errors when predicting such patterns. This is unsurprising: climate is a non-linear system in which processes on many scales interact in complex ways. Thus, simulating clouds is a formidable challenge.\n\nSo far, there is no clear evidence from observations that clouds are responding to humanity’s emissions by increasing or decreasing coverage systematically. There are some data that low-level cloud cover was reduced in the Northern Hemisphere and tropics in 2023, contributing to the exceptionally high global temperatures that year1. But researchers don’t yet have enough data to know whether this was a one-off or part of an emerging change in cloud characteristics.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet",

          "abstract": "Amphibious Anthropologies: Living in Wet Environments Edited by Alejandro Camargo, Luisa Cortesi and Franz Krause Univ. Washington Press (2025)\n\nCoastal zones, river basins, marshes and other amphibious environments — where the boundaries between land and water are constantly redrawn —have always been places of shifting wetness. Climate change has deepened this instability, making the borders between wet and dry regions more erratic and unpredictable.\n\nIn Amphibious Anthropologies, nine essays explore these watery, in-between landscapes, offering insights from people who have long lived in the nebulous zones between land and water. These communities have learnt to adapt, to build sustainable futures in places where permanence is an illusion and where the ebb and flow of water is not a threat to be conquered, but a force to live with. The book is a guide for navigating a world in flux — taught by those who have always known that solid ground is not always solid.\n\nWhy farmers are beginning to take their government to court over climate change\n\nTake the people living on the floodplains of northern Bihar, India. Accustomed to frequent flooding, they build circular embankments around their homes. The shapes of these embankments work with the flow of the water, encouraging it to go around them, rather than create sharp barriers that oppose the water. By contrast, the straight embankments introduced during British colonial rule in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries — and later replicated by democratically elected Indian governments — seek to confine and control the river. Such rigid structures often backfired: by presenting an unyielding barrier, they increase water pressure during floods, leading to dangerous breaches and widespread inundation.\n\nThe settings of the book’s essays — the floodplains in central India, the Fogliano wetlands in Italy, Jordan’s Dead Sea coastline, the Soomaa bogs in Estonia, the river valleys in the western United States, France’s alpine wetlands, the Colombian marshes, the tidal plains in the Bahamas and the Salton Sea in California — are wet environments that have been inhabited for centuries. These are places where wetness is an essential condition of life, and where human living is a process of “adaptation and respectful adjustment”.\n\nLand and water\n\nOn the basis of insights from field studies and conversations with local inhabitants, 12 leading specialists in sociology, ecology and anthropology explore how governance, management and infrastructure decisions often fall short when guided by rigid binaries — such as wet and dry, alive and dead, beneficial and nuisance or natural and unnatural. These categories fail to capture the complexity of amphibious environments.\n\nThis is the case with the Salton Sea, California’s largest lake. Formed in the 1900s by flooding from the Colorado River, the lake has since been sustained by agricultural run-off from nearby farms irrigated by the river. But in the past few decades, water-transfer agreements to supply urban California have caused the lake to shrink year by year.\n\nWind blows toxic dust from the exposed lake bed towards the surrounding neighbourhoods, where asthma and other respiratory issues are prevalent at alarming rates. The shores are now strewn with the remains of dead birds and fish. This May, water finally began flowing into ponds in the southern region of the lake, part of the long-delayed Species Conservation Habitat Project, a ten-year effort to restore the habitat and improve its air quality. Although the project was announced in 2017, it stalled for years amid debates between local, state and federal officials over who should manage and restore the Salton Sea — and how.\n\nA spring flood in Soomaa National Park in Estonia.Credit: Focus/Toomas Tuul/UIG/ Getty\n\nHistorically, the lake has dried and filled up again over centuries. For some, this history means that the lake should be allowed to die because it is an artificial system. Others rightly point out the detrimental effects of such a move on the people, fish and migratory birds whose lives are enmeshed with the lake’s ecosystem.\n\n“Over time, different understandings and interpretations of the Salton Sea’s identity — as wet or dry, natural or artificial, dead or alive — have played into the difficult management challenges that the lake faces,” writes political ecologist Alida Cantor in the opening essay of Amphibious Anthropologies. Focusing on what the lake does, not what it is, she says, can help to reframe debates about the lake’s management.",

Nature (2025)\n\nTheory and mathematics said his device would fly. But Ben Schafer was still pleasantly surprised the first time he flipped a switch and watched the centimetre-square device his team had built levitate, if only for a moment before flipping over.\n\nIt was a proof of concept for a design that has been published today in Nature1. One day, it might enable swarms of tiny, unpowered flying saucers and other devices with no moving parts to explore the highest reaches of Earth’s atmosphere ― near the edge of space ―using sunlight alone to remain aloft.\n\n“You don’t really believe it until you see it,” says Schafer, a physicist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nSpin class\n\nTo design their flying saucer, Schafer and his team capitalized on a quirk of physics that was discovered in the late 1800s. The idea was encapsulated in a weathervane-like device encased in a low-pressure chamber that will spin if exposed to light, without the input of any other force. The chamber apparatus, called a Crookes radiometer, is now a classic science-education device.\n\nWhat is new is the design. Schafer and his team used modern nanofabrication techniques to create an ultralight two-layered wafer. The layers, which are made of aluminium oxide, are roughly 1,000 times thinner than a typical human hair and are connected by narrow filaments. The top layer is transparent, allowing sunlight to shine through it, and the bottom layer is coated in chromium, which absorbs sunlight.\n\nScientific ballooning takes off\n\nWhen gas molecules hit the bottom layer, they absorb some of its heat and then bounce off the device with more momentum than gas molecules bouncing off the colder, top layer — an effect that pushes the wafer upwards. The conditions for such reactions can be found in the mesosphere, the layer of the atmosphere some 50–100 kilometres above Earth’s surface.\n\nImportantly, Schafer’s device includes a new feature: the two layers are perforated with holes that allow gas molecules to move from the cold and transparent side to the hot chromium side, creating lift that is similar to that created by a helicopter’s whirring rotor, says Igor Bargatin, an engineer at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who has pioneered work on similar devices.",

Their observations provide a way of calibrating and improving models that help to explain the physics of clouds.",

          "abstract": "Carys leaned against a pock-marked riot barricade overlooking the city’s outdoor market, analysing the crowd. Concrete grit dug into her back. She shifted her weight in response to the discomfort — just as a human might.\n\nShe’d once hoped to build a life among these people, to find a sense of connection with them. But that was before the purge, before biomachine hybrids were outlawed. Now, she simply wanted to survive. And to do that, she had to blend in.\n\nIt should have been easy; her designers had crafted her exterior tissues perfectly. Like most hybrids, she looked the part. It was the behavioural tics that always gave them away. So, Carys watched, assessing and fine-tuning her algorithms.\n\nIn the busy market, people shopped, ate, flirted, argued. She catalogued a pickpocket’s furtive movements, and the timbre of a teenager’s voice as he haggled with an old woman at an electronics kiosk.\n\nCarys recognized the woman, a covert hacktivist named Maria. During the early days of the purge, Maria had shown Carys how to adjust her original parameters, to balance those machine-based algorithms with her innate biological emotions.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nA rush of warmth infused Carys as she caught Maria’s eye. She began to smile, but stifled it before it could blossom. Government surveillance monitored most public spaces, and a pair of armed guards patrolled the market square. It’d be safer — for both of them — to avoid any connection that might lead back to the underground resistance. Their rules were clear: no public contact, no matter the circumstance.\n\nReluctantly, Carys returned her attention to the marketplace, focusing on a young woman sipping coffee at a nearby café table. The chair next to her was empty. Carys tried to picture herself sitting there, sharing conversation, perhaps laughing at a joke.\n\nClouds shifted in the overcast midday sky, allowing the sun to peek through. The woman at the table lifted her face, closing her eyes and smiling. Carys considered the action, then mimicked it. She noted a slight change in the angle of light as it fell across the architecture of her cheek, and the uptick in heat radiation assailing her skin. She found little pleasure in these sensations; such physical stimuli often confounded her.\n\nShe calculated the percentage of other marketgoers displaying a similar reaction, extrapolating the frequency with which she should also perform the behaviour. Her algorithm thrummed with the adjustment and she nodded. She was getting better at this. Maybe someday she would be able to enjoy the company of a companion. Publicly. Fearlessly.\n\nA shout from the market’s centre drew Carys’s attention to where a man in orange dockworker coveralls towered over a blocky food-delivery robot. The man gripped a small food container. Carys squinted, triggering an infrared filter that pinpointed the problem: the food was cold, still in dehydrated form. The lunchbot’s prep mechanism must have malfunctioned.\n\n“We should have scrapped every last one of you!” The red-faced man hurled the container at the little bot. A block of dried noodles crunched against its exterior casing.\n\nCarys’s jaw clenched.\n\nHe brought his leg up and kicked the bot with the flat of his foot, hard enough for the crack of fractured plastic to reverberate through the market. Carys swallowed a gasp at the memory of a similar blow striking her own bioplastic breastbone, before resistance forces had rescued her.\n\nThe lunchbot tried to escape, its wheels screeching uselessly against its crumpled casing. Nearby, people glared. The man prepared to launch another kick.\n\n“Stop!” a voice called out.\n\nCarys’s anxiety level spiked as the old hacktivist, Maria, stepped away from her kiosk and inserted herself between the dockworker and the damaged bot. Carys didn’t bother to analyse Maria’s heart rate or flushed skin; she knew from the quaver in her voice that Maria was frightened. Even so, her words did not falter as she pleaded with the violent man.\n\n“These little things are barely sentient,” she said. “Please, don’t hurt it.”\n\nThe man leaned forward. He sneered and his fist shot out, striking her in the chest.\n\nCarys registered the impact of the blow, the sudden expulsion of Maria’s breath, the split second of airborne nothingness before her fragile body hit the ground. Carys winced at the snap of bone, her eyes stinging at Maria’s cry.\n\n“You sympathizers are no better than the robots,” he growled.\n\nThe guards, who had stopped their patrol to watch, nodded agreement.",

So the team set out to create a more lifelike mock-up, devising a faux uterine lining from a gel rich in collagen and proteins that are crucial for embryonic development.\n\nTo shoot their stop-motion film, researchers placed human embryos donated by a local hospital near the gel. As the embryo attached to the ‘uterus’, the team used a microscope to capture an image about every 20 minutes for 16–24 hours, and then stitched the stills together.\n\nCo-author Amélie Godeau, a biomechanics researcher at IBEC, was shocked to see how quickly the embryo burrowed down into the gel. “My first reflex was to think my experiment had gone wrong and there was some drift in the microscope,” Godeau says. By contrast, the team found that mouse embryos adhere to the surface of the uterus rather than embedding themselves inside.\n\nA human embryo plunges into a synthetic uterine lining tissue by applying force to pull the tissue apart.Credit: Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC)",

          "authors": "Lawrence M. Cathles",
          "abstract": "Credit: Office of Communications, Princeton University\n\nIn 1967, Jason Morgan presented a groundbreaking paper at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in Washington DC. It showed that Earth’s surface consists of about a dozen rigid plates. They are created at mid-ocean ridges, destroyed in subduction zones where they converge, and move past one another along great faults, such the San Andreas Fault in California. Other papers followed, explaining that volcanoes occur where plates subduct, mountains rise where and when continents collide, and earthquakes result from jostling and shearing at plate margins.\n\nWithin a decade, the theory of ‘plate tectonics’ was broadly accepted. Morgan had presented the geological equivalent of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution soon after being appointed as an assistant professor at Princeton University in New Jersey and had transformed geology forever. He has died aged 87.\n\nMorgan was born in Savannah, Georgia. After secondary school, he fell in love with physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. He spent two years in the US Navy as an instructor at the Naval Nuclear Power School in New London, Connecticut, before moving to Princeton to study for a doctorate in the physics of relativity with Robert Dicke. After obtaining his PhD in 1964, he became a postdoc in the geosciences department, where he was promoted to assistant professor in 1966.\n\nHas Earth’s inner core stopped its strange spin?\n\nDicke was interested in the force of gravity and, in particular, whether the ‘gravitational constant’ (G; a fundamental parameter in gravitational theory) was actually constant. If this force weakened, Earth would expand like a balloon. He tasked Morgan with looking for evidence of this in the pattern of earthquakes across Earth, which Morgan was studying to search for geophysical signs of gravitational waves. Harry Hess, the chair of the geosciences department, had mapped the topography of the sea floor and discovered mid-ocean ridges — the great chain of submarine mountains that wraps itself twice around the globe like the seams on a baseball. He had proposed that new crust forms at the ridges and moves away, a mechanism known as sea-floor spreading. In the end, earthquakes supported Hess’s ideas and the concept of plate tectonics much better than they did Dicke’s balloon hypothesis.\n\nMeanwhile Fred Vine, a graduate student at the University of Cambridge, UK, had discovered that the ocean crust is magnetically striped: Earth’s magnetic field changes polarity, the north pole becoming the south pole and vice versa, on timescales from tens of thousands to millions of years. The direction of the magnetic field is frozen into the sea floor when the ridge lavas cool and spread, producing stripes parallel to the ocean ridges — confirming Hess’s idea. Hess hired Vine and gave him a desk in the same office as Morgan. Although the pair did not publish together, decades later Morgan told Quanta Magazine that, of the many people who contributed to the theory of plate tectonics at Princeton, “the person who was most helpful for me was Fred Vine”. Vine and his Cambridge supervisor Drummond Matthews are well recognized for the contribution that their magnetic studies made to the discovery of plate tectonics.",

          "abstract": "Quantum computing qubits are arranged in a grid in this artist’s illustration.Credit: Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly helping scientists to write papers, conduct literature reviews and even design laboratory experiments. Now researchers can add optimizing quantum computing to the list.\n\nA team has used an AI model to calculate the best way to rapidly assemble a grid of atoms that might one day serve as the ‘brain’ of a quantum computer. To show just how quickly the model can re-shuffle the atoms, the team also used the system to create a tiny animation of Schrödinger’s cat. The work was reported last week in Physical Review Letters1.\n\nStudy co-author Jian-Wei Pan, a physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, says the team became interested in using AI to speed up the building these ‘neutral atom arrays’ after one of his former students got a job in an AI laboratory. “AI for science is emerging as a powerful paradigm for addressing complex scientific problems,” he says. One of the big challenges in using arrays of atoms for quantum computing is working out how to rearrange them in an “efficient, fast and scalable manner”, Pan says. AI solved that problem for the team — and did it quickly.\n\nPlaying with atoms\n\nClassical computers carry out operations using binary digits, or bits, encoded as a 1 or 0. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be put into a ‘superposition’, in which the two states — 1 and 0 — exist simultaneously. Calculations involve entangling qubits, which means that their states become linked.\n\nGoogle uncovers how quantum computers can beat today’s best supercomputers\n\nResearchers have been creating qubits with materials such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions and grids of neutral atoms, which are prized for their ability to maintain their quantum states over a relatively long time. To use the atoms as qubits, scientists trap them with laser light and then store quantum information in the energy levels of their electrons.\n\nThe hope is that if you use enough atoms, a quantum computer will one day overcome the errors that often plague these systems — and eventually perform calculations that aren’t feasible for classical computers.\n\nPan and his colleagues trained their AI model by showing it how various distributions of rubidium atoms could be nudged into a range of grid configurations using different patterns of laser light. Depending on the atoms’ starting locations, the model could then quickly work out the correct pattern of light needed to rearrange them into a selection of 2D and 3D shapes.\n\nAn animation created with an AI-guided laser pattern depicts Schrödinger’s cat (version here slowed by a factor of 33).Credit: R. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\nThe researchers used their model to assemble an array of up to 2,024 rubidium atoms in just 60 milliseconds. By contrast, another group assembled about 800 neutral atoms last year2, but without the use of AI, it took an entire second. For the video of Schrödinger’s cat, the AI system directed laser light to move atoms to create the desired patterns. The atoms became visible when they emitted light in response to laser pulses.\n\nScaling up\n\nCreating the right pattern of light, or hologram, that dictates how to arrange neutral atom arrays usually involves a slew of painstaking calculations. “And doing those calculations as you make the arrays bigger and bigger can take up a fair amount of time,” says Mark Saffman, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. That’s why many of his colleagues “were really impressed by this work, as was I”.",

The series often highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nSonia Guimarães’s life is full of firsts. In the 1970s, as a physics student at the Federal University of São Carlos in Brazil, she was the first in her family to attain a university degree. In 1989, she finished her doctorate in electronic materials at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, UK, becoming the first Afro-Brazilian woman to earn a doctoral degree in physics. And in 1993, she became the first Black woman to join the faculty at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology in São José dos Campos, Brazil — a military higher-education institution, where she is still affiliated.\n\nSince early in her career, Guimarães has worked with semiconductors: from using these devices to build solar cells to developing the thinnest internal electrical layers possible so as to miniaturize the devices.\n\nIn 2020, she obtained a patent for the development of a ballistic sensor, which detects infrared radiation produced by airborne plane engines. The technology, she says, is unique in Brazil and was supposed to aid the country’s air force. As a Black woman, Guimarães has faced several hurdles throughout her career and has become one of the most outspoken champions of gender and racial equality in Brazilian science.\n\nI help to build support systems for Latina researchers\n\nGuimarães is an advocate for Black scientists on many fronts. Besides being a member of the Brazilian Association of Black Researchers, she is a founding councillor for the Afro-Brazilian Society for Socio-Cultural Development — a non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting visibility and improving the socioeconomic status of Black people in Brazil — and presides over the Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Commission of the Brazilian Physics Society.\n\nShe also mentors girls in science, working with programmes including Investiga Menina! (Research, Girl!), a project in Goiás state aimed at getting Black girls involved in science; Futuras Cientistas (Future Female Scientists), a nationwide project focused on secondary-school students; and Pesquisa para Elas (Research for Them), a free online programme of science immersion for teenage girls. Last year, Guimarães started working with Sementes Afrodescendentes (AfroDescendant Seeds), a project focused on anti-racist education in schools in São José dos Campos. She tells Nature’s Careers team why anti-racism work leads to better scientific solutions for society.\n\nWhat is your great passion as a scientist?\n\nThe creation of new and fantastic things. When I started, millions of years ago (giggles), semiconductors were the beginning of everything. There were no mobile phones. There was one computer in the entire university, and it was the size of a huge room. So, as a second-year undergraduate in physics, my professor, physicist Jorge Swieca, introduced me and some of my peers to semiconductors. He told us that these materials could conduct electricity, or resist it – and depending on how they’re made, they can conduct currents precisely when and how you want. I remember him saying that semiconductors were going to be the basis of all technological development that would exist in the future. Bingo! I never looked back.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor and why?\n\nProfessor Swieca gave me the idea of what I was going to do when I grew up. But the person who gave me all the encouragement to overcome the hardships I faced was my mother. When I was about ten years old, my father, an upholsterer, died of tuberculosis. My mother was left with four children to feed and no husband’s salary to count on. But she was ingenious.\n\nOnce, a neighbour’s daughter was getting married, and her baker bailed on her a week before the wedding. The neighbour knew my mother had made a cake here and a snack there, and asked for her help with the catering for 100 guests. My mother took it head on: she gathered all my sisters and everyone she knew to make it happen. This is where my mother’s catering business started. It still exists, run by one of my sisters. With money from this business, my mother sent me to university. She paid for my living costs so that I didn’t have to work.\n\nI must have picked up this ‘can do’ attitude from my mother. I can’t drop the ball, otherwise she gets very angry!\n\nWhy is anti-racism work important to science?\n\nThe world needs solutions for everyone, not just for men, and for people with white skin. And we’re running out of time for answers. When science excludes certain groups, we’re faced with uncomfortable, bizarre situations. For example, some oximeters don’t read blood oxygen levels accurately for dark-skinned people — who then can’t know for certain whether they have COVID-19, say, because the equipment was designed for light-skinned people. That’s stupid.\n\nCollection: Changemakers in science\n\nScientific progress stalls if only one type of person is looking for solutions. Many groups need to be involved — not just in physics, but in chemistry, mathematics, medicine, engineering, automobile science and everything else. Women are more likely to die in car accidents, even if the accident isn’t very serious. Why? Because test dummies are mostly based on male body size and shape. Women’s breasts are completely overlooked in car safety design.\n\nWhat is the biggest racial stereotype that you would like to dispel?",

          "abstract": "María del Mar Quiroga took her son to a Latinx carnival performance in Australia to stay connected to her Argentinian cultural roots.Credit: María del Mar Quiroga; used with permission\n\nLeaving home in pursuit of academic and professional opportunities is never an easy decision. For many Latinx people (those with a Latin American background or heritage) in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers, moving abroad can open doors to cutting-edge research, stronger funding, better technologies and career-defining collaborations. But it comes at a cost.\n\nLatinx scientists abroad not only face language barriers and the need to navigate new cultures, but also the potential loss of deeply rooted support systems. Parenting can feel like a daily struggle when extended family support — so central to Latinx cultures — is missing. The warmth of Latinx relationships, often expressed through physical closeness, emotional interdependence and deep conversations, isn’t always welcomed in research cultures: environments in which independence and emotional self-containment are more valued. The absence of a strong sense of community, in which neighbours and friends become family, can leave Latinx researchers feeling unanchored and isolated.\n\nFurthermore, many Latin American countries have historically faced underfunded public-education systems, political instability and limited access to advanced STEM training or research infrastructure. This means that Latinx students often arrive abroad already trying to catch up, entering highly competitive environments in which they feel pressure to constantly prove themselves and represent their communities in structures that don’t always understand or accommodate their background. Latinx people remain under-represented in STEM fields, which can add a layer of emotional and mental strain because of increased pressure to perform and a reduced sense of belonging1.\n\nI help to build support systems for Latina researchers\n\nAll of these challenges are often compounded by experiences of discrimination, isolation and the pressure to disprove harmful stereotypes — conditions that have been linked to poor health outcomes and increased emotional fatigue in Latino populations2. And although their families back home and the global scientific community might celebrate their success, these groups might overlook the mental-health and personal toll it takes to get there.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to four Latin American scientists doing research around the world, to learn not only about their professional and well-being challenges, but also about the strategies that they use to care for themselves. They offer tips and advice that could benefit any researcher who moves from the global south to the global north to train or work.\n\nMARÍA DEL MAR QUIROGA: When parenting abroad, find your helpers\n\nSenior research-data specialist at the Melbourne Data Analytics Platform at the University of Melbourne, Australia.\n\nI studied pure mathematics in Argentina, where the university system is incredibly strong for undergraduate degrees. I really enjoyed my time there, but my options in Argentina were limited to becoming a professor of mathematics, which didn’t appeal to me. So, I decided to pursue a PhD in computational neuroscience at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. I never imagined that I’d then end up in Australia, but I met my partner, who is Australian, during my PhD and years later, I moved to my current position.\n\nMoving overseas is challenging. It’s not an easy decision and no one should take it lightly. Although it offers many career opportunities, such as better salaries and sometimes a higher quality of life, it also comes at a huge cost. You have to give up many things — for example, personal relationships and your culture. However, being exposed to a different culture and way of life makes you appreciate what you have back in your home country. It offers an alternative perspective.\n\nThere are cultural challenges when moving abroad. Latinx people are known for being straightforward, emotional and vocal when things aren’t working well, but in the United States, I had to adapt to a more logic-based approach with less emphasis on emotions. Moving to Australia then brought more challenges, because I didn’t have a robust network or a support system here. This has become trickier since having children. I have a three-year-old boy and another child on the way, and those early months of raising a baby with zero support were really tough. We’ve never had anyone else look after our boy — it’s always been just me and my husband. So, whenever I can, I enjoy going back to Argentina on extended holidays because I have a lot of cousins there who can help, and those are the moments when I can relax instead of constantly chasing my son around.\n\nIt’s also hard to make deep friendships in which I can share personal and emotional issues. For Latinx people, every activity is an opportunity to build community and networks. When I first arrived in Australia, I joined a yoga group to meet people, but my expectations were unrealistic. Over time, I’ve accepted that my closest and most-open relationships will probably be with other Latinx people. I know some people say, ‘I don’t want to go to the other side of the world and make friends only with Argentinians.’ But I’ve found that having those shared codes, that common language and mutual expectations, is crucial for building friendships. Hobbies have been important as well. I enjoy knitting and crocheting because, unlike research, you can see the progress with every minute you invest. You get something tangible and feel a sense of accomplishment.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression during my PhD studies, and what helped me was therapy, medication and talking about it as much as possible with as many people as I could. I’m very open about it, and simply saying it out loud has a therapeutic effect. It helps me to process it better, even if the other person doesn’t say anything. To cope with impostor syndrome, I keep a ‘feel-good’ folder in my e-mail, in which I save kind messages from people who thank me for helping them or who appreciate my work. I revisit these e-mails when I’m feeling a bit useless or like I can’t do anything right. They remind me of the value and impact of my work.\n\nCarolina Lambertini (right), on a road trip with her husband and cat, says finding a mental-health therapist from Brazil who understood her language and culture was key to her well-being. Credit: Carolina Lambertini\nCAROLINA LAMBERTINI: Find a therapist who speaks your language\n\nBiologist and postdoctoral scholar at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania.\n\nI did my undergraduate, master’s, PhD and one postdoc in Brazil. My decision to move to the United States in 2022 was driven by better opportunities — especially in terms of funding and access to more-advanced technologies. My research focuses on infectious diseases affecting amphibians worldwide. It was a hard decision to move, because I love my country and at the time, my husband was still in Brazil. It was also scary at first, especially because of the language barrier. I wasn’t born with the privilege of speaking the most dominant language in research. Even in everyday situations, it was difficult. I remember the first time I went to a doctor’s appointment, I couldn’t express exactly what I was feeling. It was horrible. I also remember being on the subway in New York City with my husband — he moved to the United States in 2024 — when a man started yelling at us to speak English, telling us that we didn’t have a right to be there. It made me feel like I didn’t belong. But it shouldn’t have.\n\nExperiences like that triggered my impostor syndrome. I started to wonder what I was doing here, as if I didn’t deserve it. I even began to question my own abilities and felt as if people didn’t like me.\n\nWhen you leave your country as I did — without my family, friends and husband, not knowing if he would ever be able to join me — everything changes all at once. And my mind just couldn’t take it. It hurt. On top of that, in the beginning, I was putting so much pressure on myself to prove that I deserved to be here, that I forgot to take care of myself. But therapy has boosted my self-esteem and confidence — helping me to recognize my strengths and remember that I belong here. I chose one-to-one talk therapy with a therapist from Brazil, someone who could understand not just my language but also the cultural context that I come from. I know that’s a privilege, but I couldn’t imagine having to translate into English some feelings and words that are so deeply rooted in who I am.\n\nShould I return to my home country after my PhD abroad?\n\nNow, I try to remember that I am qualified to be here, that I speak two languages and that I was selected from a pool of many researchers for this opportunity. I deserve it! Therapy has also helped me to manage my depression, for which I’ve been receiving medical treatment for a year and a half. Now I feel better. Being so far away from my family will never stop hurting, but I’ve learnt how to move through my routines without them.\n\nI also talk to my mum every day — sometimes twice — and we video call for special occasions such as birthdays. That helps with the saudade, a Portuguese word for that deep feeling of missing someone you love. Developing friendships has also helped, although cultural differences have made it difficult to form close connections with people from the United States. But sharing life experiences with people from other countries who can relate has been wonderful.\n\nAn episode of extreme mental fatigue helped data-visualization researcher Mario Romero to find ways to rebalance his working life.Credit: Mario Romero 2022\nMARIO ROMERO: Don’t overwork or you will lose yourself\n\nProfessor of visualization at Linköping University in Norrköping, Sweden, and national technical manager at InfraVis, a Swedish research infrastructure for data analysis and visualization.\n\nI grew up in Ecuador and completed two engineering degrees there. I then pursued a master’s degree in machine learning at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a PhD in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where my wife, who is also from Ecuador, was earning a PhD in biomedical engineering.\n\nIn Ecuador, I didn’t receive a good secondary-school education, and it had a lasting impact on my foundational academic skills. There were regular teachers’ strikes, with classes often suspended for weeks or months. Those disruptions meant that I missed out on building core skills, especially in maths.\n\nBut there are three strategies that have worked for me while I pursued a research career, and I recommend them to anyone who wants to become a scientist, no matter their background. First, learn to be a good communicator and master academic writing in English. Second, make sure that you understand maths deeply — and use a pen and paper for calculations to really grasp each concept. Third, practise public speaking so that you can share your thoughts clearly and confidently in front of others.\n\nI have overworked to the point that I know the exact moment this year that I hit mental fatigue: 17 February at 8 p.m. We were approaching a deadline for a grant application that would fund 70 researchers for four years. That week I had worked for 90 hours — waking up early, working 18-hour days straight, and taking only four-minute breaks every seven hours just to stretch.",

          "authors": "Ida Kubiszewski, Robert Costanza, Elizabeth A. Fulton, Matt A. King, Elizabeth Leane, Natalie Stoeckl",
          "abstract": "Far from being a remote, isolated continent, Antarctica is integral to Earth’s climate and life-support systems. Its vast ice sheet stores more than 90% of the planet’s surface fresh water and influences sea levels, circulation of the atmosphere and how much sunlight the planet reflects. Around Antarctica, the Southern Ocean acts as the lungs of the deep sea, accounting for roughly 40% of the global ocean’s uptake of carbon dioxide emissions generated by human activities, shaping how seawater mixes and distributes nutrients to support marine life around the globe1.\n\nYet, many of these stabilizing features are showing signs of degradation. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is retreating, with widespread thinning of glaciers and ice shelves. Changes there are accelerating, as damage in one area exacerbates melting and stresses in others. And now, parts of the more stable East Antarctic Ice Sheet seem to be thinning, too2. Pooling melt water on its surface would eat away at the ice further3, possibly triggering the break-up of more ice shelves4. Meanwhile, Antarctic waters seem to have entered a new regime, with record-low sea ice, greater salinity and less stratification of upper ocean layers5,6 (see ‘Antarctica under threat’).\n\nSources: Temp.: https://go.nature.com/3JFQNKP; Ice sheet: https://go.nature.com/4JPPG5G; Sea ice: https://go.nature.com/45GDTPW; Salinity: Ref. 5.\n\nRunaway melting in the Antarctic will be grave for the world. Loss of ice could contribute more than 60 centimetres to sea-level rise by the end of this century and will disrupt the Southern Ocean’s freshwater balance, circulation and mixing7 — signs of which are already evident in some areas8. Less general ocean mixing means that less oxygen and fewer nutrients are transferred to the deep ocean, making it harder for marine organisms there to survive and reproduce, as well as lowering the ability of the seas to take up carbon.\n\nBefore this crucial reservoir of ice is lost, transforming the planet forever, it is essential that policymakers and others recognize Antarctica’s extraordinary economic value and seek to protect it. Environmental services, fisheries and tourism in Antarctica contribute more than US$180 billion to the global economy each year9. Yet, governments and businesses continue to undervalue these services, prioritizing political aims and short-term financial objectives (such as maximizing profit or gross domestic product) over sustaining the stability of the planet, which supports people’s lives and underpins all economies.\n\nStrategies are needed to broaden society’s goals beyond financial gains and to account for long-term risks and benefits. Here, we set out what’s at stake and propose economic goals and governance changes to guide policy responses towards long-term planetary stability.\n\nContinent under threat\n\nAs the ice melts and oceans change, ecological stresses are intensifying across the Antarctic. Populations of krill — key prey for penguins, whales and seals — are declining as oceans acidify10, affecting the whole region’s food web. Shrinking sea ice exacerbates these threats11. For example, if seals and penguins find it harder to obtain krill, especially at crucial times such as breeding periods, populations will be more vulnerable to more frequent and extreme disturbances, such as heatwaves or algal blooms.\n\nOn the Antarctic Peninsula and sub-Antarctic islands, warming is driving changes in vegetation and species distributions. For example, fast-spreading grasses are crowding out native vegetation, disrupting nesting habitats for seabirds and altering nutrient cycles. Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases and might awaken dormant microorganisms, with unpredictable consequences12.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nHuman activities compound these pressures. Invasive species, including grasses, insects and microbes, transported by visitors and cargo, are beginning to colonize ice-free areas13. Pollution, too, is on the rise: persistent organic pollutants, hydrocarbons and microplastics have been detected across the region, including in seabirds and marine sediments14. These substances accumulate in food webs and impair reproductive and immune systems in native fauna.\n\nAll of these changes are linked and interact in ways that are often non-linear and self-reinforcing. For example, ice-sheet retreat adds fresh water to the seas, which weakens ocean circulation and accelerates warming and acidification, destabilizing marine ecosystems. Humans can increasingly reach regions that were once isolated, spreading pollution and invasive species and disturbing habitats. These cascading dynamics raise the possibility of ‘runaway’ change, in which the breach of one threshold makes others more likely, eventually overwhelming the capacity for intervention.\n\nLack of oversight\n\nMeanwhile, monitoring systems in the Antarctic remain inadequate. Environmental assessments often focus on linear trends and single variables, underestimating how multiple pressures converge and reinforce each other. This limits scientists’ abilities to detect early warning signs and precludes coordinated preventive actions.\n\nFragile governance is also increasingly a problem. The Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) has maintained peace and scientific cooperation in the region for more than six decades. It includes the 1959 treaty and subsequent agreements on wildlife, marine conservation and environmental protection. However, its consensus-based structure and slow pace of reform are struggling under the pressures of the twenty-first century.\n\nRising numbers of human visitors risk disrupting nesting sites for seabirds.Credit: Ida Kubiszewski\n\nDiplomatic stalemates about issues such as new marine protected areas and the approval of further consultative parties to the treaty are straining the system. Expanding national scientific programmes and rising commercial activities, including fishing and tourism, test the system’s resilience.\n\nShould the ATS lose legitimacy or fail to enforce protections, it could open the door to unregulated exploitation and even geopolitical conflict. Weakening of Antarctic governance could further erode environmental stewardship and fracture international collaboration on climate and biodiversity15.\n\nSolutions for a stable future\n\nPreventing irreversible change in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean requires urgent, system-wide transformation — across governance, science, economics and public engagement — as well as the rapid reduction of global emissions to curb climate change.\n\nAntarctic governance must evolve to be fit for the Anthropocene — the age of significant and lasting human impacts on the planet. The ATS requires stronger enforcement mechanisms, faster institutional responsiveness and more-efficient ratification processes. Reforms could include capping tourist numbers and re-evaluating the ‘use’ principle, which allows any tourism activity that national authorities approve, except those that are explicitly prohibited.\n\nDoes US science have a future in Antarctica?

          "authors": "Traci Watson",
          "abstract": "Preprint servers such as PsyArxiv are contending with suspicious content written by AI systems.Credit: Nature\n\nThe preprint’s title — ‘Self-Experimental Report: Emergence of Generative AI Interfaces in Dream States’ — roused psychologist Olivia Kirtley’s suspicions.\n\nWhen she clicked, her wariness grew. The manuscript, posted in July on PsyArXiv, a site for non-peer-reviewed research in the psychological sciences, was only a few pages long and listed just one author, whose affiliation was not included. And the artificial intelligence (AI) experiment described in the text “was pretty out there”, says Kirtley, at Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium.\n\nSo she flagged that preprint and similar ones to PsyArXiv’s managers, who removed them. The dream-states manuscript used AI in its methods but didn’t clearly declare how AI was used or whether it was used in other elements of the work, which means that it violated the site’s terms of use, says Dermot Lynott, the head of PsyArXiv’s scientific advisory board and a psychologist at Maynooth University in Ireland.\n\nIn response to questions from Nature, a message from the e-mail address of the listed author, Jiazheng Liu, said that AI played a limited part in the preprint’s generation.\n\nThe fight against fake-paper factories that churn out sham science\n\nPsyArXiv is just one of the many preprint servers — and journals — that are grappling with suspicious submissions. Some papers bear the fingerprints of paper mills, which are services that produce scientific papers on demand. Others show evidence of content written by AI systems, such as fake references, which can be a sign of an AI ‘hallucination’.\n\nSuch content poses a conundrum for preprint services. Many are non-profit organizations devoted to making it easier for scientists to publish their work, and screening for low-quality content demands resources and can slow processing of submissions. Such screening also raises questions about which manuscripts to allow. And this influx of dodgy content has its own risks.\n\n“How do you do quality assurance while keeping things relatively light touch so the system doesn’t collapse on itself?” says Katie Corker, liaison from the executive committee of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Sciences to PsyArXiv’s scientific advisory board. “No one wants a world where the individual reader has to figure out whether something is legitimate scholarship.”\n\nAI growth spurt\n\nThe preprint services approached by Nature said that a relatively small proportion of their submissions bear signs of being generated by a large language model (LLM) such as the one that drives OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The operators of the preprint server arXiv, for example, estimate that roughly 2% of their submissions are rejected for being products of AI, paper mills or both.\n\nRichard Sever, head of openRxiv, which operates life-sciences preprint server bioRxiv and biomedical server medRxiv, based in New York City, says that the two combined turn away more than ten manuscripts per day that seem formulaic, and might have been AI-generated. The services receive roughly 7,000 submissions per month.\n\nAI linked to explosion of low-quality biomedical research papers\n\nBut some say that the situation seems to be getting worse. The moderators of arXiv noticed an uptick in AI-written content soon after the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, but “we really started thinking there was a crisis sometime in the last three months”, says Steinn Sigurðsson, scientific director at arXiv and an astrophysicist at Penn State University in University Park.\n\nIn a statement posted on 25 July, the Center for Open Science, a non-profit organization in Washington DC that hosts PsyArXiv, said that it was “seeing a noticeable rise in submitted papers that appear to be generated or heavily assisted by AI tools”. Lynott confirms that there has been a “small rise” on the site and that the server is working to minimize such content.\n\nThe challenges of moderating preprints were shown by the dream-states manuscript flagged by Kirtley: shortly after the preprint was removed, a preprint with a nearly identical title and abstract was posted on the site. An e-mail from the address associated with the author said that “AI’s role was limited to mathematical derivations, symbolic computations, assembling and applying existing mathematical tools, formula verification” and eight more tasks. The e-mail’s writer described themselves as an “independent researcher based in China” with no higher-education degree and whose “only tool is a secondhand smartphone”. The second version of the preprint has also been taken down.\n\nChatbot helpers\n\nA study1 published last week in Nature Human Behaviour estimates that in September 2024, almost two years after the rollout of ChatGPT, LLMs produced 22% of the content in computer-science abstracts posted on arXiv and roughly 10% of the text in biology abstracts posted on bioRxiv (See ‘Rise of the chatbot’). By comparison, an analysis2 of biomedical abstracts published in journals in 2024 found that 14% had LLM-generated text in their abstracts .\n\nSource: Ref 1.\n\nSome of the AI text reported in the study could have been generated by scientists who would otherwise struggle to write a manuscript in English, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University in California and co-author of the Nature Human Behaviour paper.",

First, two rovers mapped the surface around the entrance to the underground cave. A small, cubical probe similar to a ‘cubesat’ — a type of miniaturized satellite shaped like a cube — was then ejected from one of the rovers and dropped down into the cave to produce a detailed 3D map of the entrance.

          "abstract": "“Postdocs are somewhat thriving and suffering at the same time,” says one researcher.Credit: nitpicker/Shutterstock\n\nA survey of the Max Planck Society’s postdoctoral researchers paints a stark picture of work life at the renowned German research institutes.\n\nThe Max Planck Society (MPG) has more than 3,000 postdoctoral researchers across 84 institutes. The survey, conducted by the Max Planck PostdocNet, a network of postdocs across the organization, drew responses from 872 of them, representing 74 institutes. Although most respondents were satisfied with their advisers, research and career-development assistance, rates of depression and anxiety were higher than in a survey done in 2022, amid ongoing concerns about the lack of permanent job prospects.\n\nMore than half of respondents also indicated that they oppose a rule that currently caps the length of postdoctoral work at six years and is under debate to be further reduced to four years. That finding represents the first hard data on postdocs’ attitude towards this proposal, says Nicholas Russell, the Max Planck PostdocNet Survey’s working-group leader and a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany. The rule tends to force postdocs to leave the country, respondents explained, because there aren’t enough full-time positions available. It also discourages international postdocs from working in Germany, and from conducting riskier research projects.\n\nAs neither students nor permanent employees, postdocs often exist in an academic limbo. They conduct the bulk of the research and teaching, yet have little collective power. “The system relies on postdocs,” says Judith Münch, coordinator of the German Postdoc Network, which formed last year to advocate for postdoc interests across organizations.\n\nOne problem, says Münch, is a lack of data. “I would love to give you the number of postdocs currently in Germany, but this number doesn’t exist because we don’t have a unified definition of postdoc,” she says. The survey defined an MPG postdoc as “any person who has been awarded a doctoral degree and is currently undertaking scientific research within the MPG using a time-limited contractual relationship from either internal or external funding”.\n\nNicholas Russell (left) and Judith Münch (right).Credit: L-R: Danijel Monreal-Majic; Johanna Weber.\nInternational postdoc woes\n\nThe survey also revealed that international scholars — who make up 75% of the MPG postdoc cohort — struggle with government bureaucracy, language barriers and targeted bullying. Eight per cent of respondents report being bulled in the past 12 months, and 19% report being treated differently or with contempt or condescension.\n\n“Bullying is a sensitive topic, and a lot of people also don’t feel comfortable reporting it,” says Uma Dakshinamoorthy, a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Göttingen, Germany, who is from India. “International postdocs don’t know their rights or know the [German] law.”\n\nRoughly 25% of international postdocs are certain that they want to remain in Germany after their postdoc. “We find that while MPG is very competent at attracting global talent, MPG and perhaps Germany are less successful at holding onto it,” says Russell.\n\nMental-health concerns increased compared with the 2022 survey. Roughly 28% of respondents report signs of moderate to severe depression, and 25% report signs of moderate to severe anxiety. “We see that international postdocs are more depressed and anxious than Germans are,” says Russell. Yet at least 65% of postdocs were unaware of the emergency mental-health services that MPG offers, and only 5% had ever used them.",

          "title": "Beyond AlphaFold: how AI is decoding the grammar of the genome",
          "authors": "Jeffrey M. Perkel",
          "abstract": "In 1862, Victor Hugo reportedly wrote to his publisher to ask how his newly published novel Les Misérables was selling, with a single character query: “?” The response: “!”\n\nThis story of one of the world’s most concise correspondences is apocryphal. But some genome-focused artificial intelligence (AI) systems can, like the French writer’s publisher, respond meaningfully to equally short prompts.\n\nInstead of the detailed queries required to use the chatbot ChatGPT effectively, Evo, an AI model trained on some 300 billion nucleotide bases, including 80,000 microbial whole-genome sequences, will — prompted with ‘#’ — dream up a new sequence of mobile DNA. It does so on the basis of other such biological systems that the model has been exposed to (see go.nature.com/3jvp922). Given a prompt such as ‘030’, an AI tool called regLM can spit out 200-base sequences that are predicted to exhibit regulatory activity in any of three human cell lines (go.nature.com/4jpttm8).\n\nEvo and regLM are part of a fast-growing suite of tools that aim to internalize, decode, interpret and build on the grammar of the genome — especially the vast portion that does not code for proteins. Think AlphaFold, but for regulatory DNA, which are sequences that control gene expression.\n\nDeepMind’s new AlphaGenome AI tackles the ‘dark matter’ in our DNA\n\nWhen Google DeepMind released AlphaFold in 2020, the company claimed it had solved a decades-old ‘grand challenge’ in biology — predicting a protein’s 3D shape from its sequence alone. But the non-coding fraction of the genome could prove to be an even grander challenge.\n\nA given sequence of amino acids will generally fold into the same shape, whatever the cellular context. That predictability is not true of the genome, in which short, functional sequence motifs — gene promoters and enhancers, transcription start and stop sites and so on — can be scattered across long stretches of seemingly purposeless DNA. These motifs might overlap, interact over long distances, bind to competing protein factors or respond to signals that are only present in specific cells or at certain times in development. They are also tightly wrapped within chromatin, a complex of DNA and protein, which might be more or less accessible to external proteins depending on what the cell is doing.\n\n“How proteins are encoded in the genome, the code of how genes are expressed, when and where, how much — is one of the most fascinating problems in biology,” says Stein Aerts, a computational biologist at the VIB Center for AI & Computational Biology and the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. But with training, AI tools can detect subtle differences between sequences and predict what they do and how they behave, identifying crucial motifs and even estimating the impact of altering them. From there, AI models can attempt to predict the physiological impact of genetic variants and even guide the design of new sequences with specified functions.\n\nThese tools are not perfect, and researchers cannot even agree on how best to assess their performance. But that makes the field exciting. “It’s so clear that it’s a solvable problem,” says Julia Zeitlinger, a developmental and computational biologist at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, who developed an AI model called BPNet and uses it to decode the mechanistic sequence rules of gene regulation, “but it’s not clear how”.\n\nOf puppies and puffins\n\nDeepSEA, one of the first genomic AI tools, was published1 ten years ago this month by computational biologists Jian Zhou and Olga Troyanskaya at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nDeepSEA is a convolutional neural network (CNN) — the same kind of deep-learning architecture used to teach computers to classify images as, say, a cat or a dog. Zhou and Troyanskaya trained a model on epigenetics data, including transcription-factor binding, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, from a public research project called the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). The model learnt to predict the presence of such features in 1,000-base segments of DNA it had never encountered.\n\nDeepSEA’s training enabled it to tease apart the biological consequence and severity of sequence variants associated with human disease. For instance, one breast-cancer-associated sequence variant called rs4784227 seems to strengthen the binding of a DNA-binding protein called FOXA1, whereas a variant associated with the blood condition α-thalassemia creates a possible binding site for GATA1, a transcription factor involved in blood-cell development.\n\nBiggest-ever AI biology model writes DNA on demand\n\nSince then, the field has exploded. David Kelley, a principal investigator at the biotechnology company Calico Life Sciences in South San Francisco, California, has created or co-created multiple AI models, many with canine-inspired names. These include Akita2 (for predicting 3D genome folding), Basset3 and Basenji4 (for regulatory-sequence prediction) and Borzoi5, which predicts gene expression across the length of a gene.\n\nThese models raised a litter of variants: Basset begat Malinois, and Borzoi begat Scooby. Other researchers have built their own (non-canine) models including Puffin, ChromBPNet and more.\n\nNot all are CNNs. Enformer — a model that predicts both gene expression and epigenetic data over long distances — and Borzoi, for instance, “use both convolution blocks and transformer blocks”, says Kelley, whose laboratory developed both models. “The convolution blocks are great for capturing the local sequence patterns, and then the transformer blocks help look around a larger region to consider the local patterns in a broader context before predicting the data.” But whatever the architecture, they come in two basic forms, says Anshul Kundaje, who researches computational genomics at Stanford University in California. Supervised and sequence-to-function models are trained on functional genomic data — gene expression or chromatin accessibility, for instance — and learn to predict the function of DNA sequences they have never encountered. Often working at or near single-nucleotide resolution, these models can identify key motifs, such as functionally important protein-binding sites, and predict the significance of altering them. DeepSEA is one; Kundaje’s ChromBPNet, which predicts regions of chromatin accessibility, another.\n\nThe other class is unsupervised or self-supervised ‘genomic language models’ (gLMs). Like ChatGPT, they are trained on vast quantities of text — in this case, genomic sequence data — and are tasked with either predicting the next base (or ‘token’) in a sequence or filling in missing bases on the basis of surrounding context. These models “are not trying to predict the activity of a sequence, they’re trying to predict the composition of a sequence”, says Avantika Lal, a machine-learning scientist at biotechnology firm Genentech in South San Francisco.\n\nWith machine-learning scientist Gökçen Eraslan and their colleagues at Genentech, Lal co-developed regLM, a language model that they trained by labelling regulatory sequences with succinct markers of activity6 — for instance, ‘04<sequence>’ to indicate strong expression in one cell line and low activity in another. The model is therefore not strictly unsupervised, says Eraslan — he calls it a ‘function-to-sequence’ model. But those same labels can then be used to prompt regLM to create new sequences with predicted behaviours.\n\nEvo 2, announced in February7, was trained on 9.3 trillion DNA base pairs — “a representative snapshot of genomes spanning all observed evolution”, as the resulting bioRxiv preprint paper puts it. It could then identify intron–exon boundaries, predict the impacts of mutations and generate ‘realistic’ gene and genomic sequences, among other things.\n\nModels made simple\n\nGenomic AI models can also be distinguished by the type of regulatory interactions they predict, Kundaje says. Sequence-to-function models mostly identify important DNA motifs (which, because their function depends on their proximity to the regulated gene, are said to act in cis) without regard to the biology that occurs there.\n\nTrans models, by contrast, aim to identify which genes regulate which other genes, for instance, to tease apart networks of gene regulation. (They are called trans because the factors that mediate this regulation act at a distance.) But this, says Kundaje, “is still very fraught and very problematic” because trans models — which are generally trained on data such as RNA expression — must infer causal relationships without data that can reveal causality. There’s no guarantee that two genes are directly linked just because their expression rises and falls in tandem. Even if they are, it’s not necessarily obvious in which direction the relationship works: does A regulate B or vice versa? If these models are then asked to predict the impact of a perturbation — for example, what happens if a given gene is knocked out — the models often fail.\n\nModels can include both cis and trans elements, says Sushmita Roy, a computational biologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, for instance by building regulatory networks on the basis of chromatin accessibility data and weighting those predictions by gene expression. But perhaps the first model to truly bridge the divide, Kundaje says, is Scooby — a single-cell version of Borzoi (go.nature.com/3upffnp). By leveraging both chromatin accessibility and transcriptional data from the same cells, Scooby predicts genome features and cell state simultaneously. “It is one of the first cis–trans models,” he says.\n\n‘ChatGPT for CRISPR’ creates new gene-editing tools\n\nSequence-to-function models can also probe other aspects of gene regulation. In 2024, teams led by Zhou (who is now at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas), Kundaje and Charles Danko, a computational biologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, independently described sequence-to-function models capable of predicting sites of transcription initiation8–10.\n\nZhou used his team’s model, Puffin, to identify the common features and placement of key regulatory elements around sites of transcription initiation, including binding sites for the transcription factors YY1, SP1, CREB and Initiator. Danko’s team trained its AI model on matched genome sequences and transcription initiation data from 58 individuals, creating a suite of models that were, he says, “for the first time aware of how differences between individuals in their genome sequence influence the pattern” of transcription initiation.\n\nCollectively, says Zhou, these studies begin to tease apart the motifs that regulate the positioning and strength of transcription initiation, including that of the transcription factor TFIID. TFIID is an essential protein complex that binds to the promoter element known as a TATA box — despite the fact that most eukaryotic promoters don’t seem to contain a TATA box. “One mechanistic interpretation is that TFIID is binding the best available of the ‘bad options’ when it picks a site” in a TATA-less promoter, Danko explains.\n\nMost genomic models make these predictions from relatively small inputs — anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand bases. But gene regulation can occur over much longer tracts of genome space, and some models are able to make predictions at or near those scales. Borzoi, for instance, accepts 524 kilobases of input DNA, and Evo 2 and Google DeepMind’s newly announced AlphaGenome can work with a megabase.\n\nThese models can transform those sequences into vast collections of estimated data. Given an input sequence of 196,608 bases of human DNA, for instance, Enformer outputs 2,131 predictions of transcription factor binding, 1,860 of histone modifications, 684 of chromatin accessibility and 638 of gene expression, at 128-base resolution (go.nature.com/4mbe42h).\n\nA finite genome\n\nYet despite these models’ extensive ‘receptive fields’, they can still miss things, says Jacob Schreiber, a computational biologist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna, because enhancers might exert effects that are biologically meaningful but invisible to the AI tool. “We have not cracked long-range regulation,” he says.\n\nAnother challenge is that, as vast as it is, the human genome is finite — there are only about 20,000–25,000 genes, for instance, and only a fraction of those are regulated in a cell-type-specific manner. That means that for all those billions of bases, there are relatively few examples of regulatory strategies from which a model can learn.\n\nCarl de Boer is a biomedical engineer at the University of British Columbia in Canada.Credit: Paul Joseph\n\n“There’s just so many different biochemical mechanisms that could happen on DNA that there are probably a very large number of them that only occur once or even zero times in our genome sequence,” says biomedical engineer Carl de Boer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nOne approach to broadening an AI model’s knowledge base is to feed it more than just reference genomes. Some model builders, for instance, train their tools on data from multiple individuals or from across the phylogenetic tree to give the models a sense of genetic diversity.\n\nAnother approach, advanced by de Boer and Jussi Taipale, a systems biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, is to look beyond natural genomes to fully artificial DNAs11.\n\nAs a postdoc at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, de Boer and his colleagues tested some 100 million random sequences, each of which were 80 nucleotides in length — “about a human genome’s worth” — for their ability to drive expression of a fluorescent protein in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)12. (The yeast genome is made up of about 12 million bases, compared with roughly 3 billion in the human genome.) This approach, de Boer says, “is actually much better” for understanding the grammar of the genome than using genomic DNA, “because all of the signals you see in the random DNA are causal”. If you see fluorescence, the sequence is active. The genome, by contrast, is a product of evolution, meaning elements might be positioned owing to selective pressures as well as function.\n\nAccording to de Boer, the yeast exercise yielded two key insights. First, it reinforced that “there are probably widespread biophysical interactions happening in regulatory regions”. Functional motifs were not randomly arranged in active sequences; they were positioned in specific configurations — for instance, to conform to the helical spacing of the DNA double helix.\n\nThe second insight involved the importance of low-affinity transcription-factor–DNA interactions. Even weak interactions, the team found, could exert a large influence on gene regulation, just as relatively weak chemical interactions can hold two proteins together.",

          "title": "Trump’s chief science adviser faces a storm of criticism: what's next?",
          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "The election of US President Donald Trump last year triggered widespread concern in the US scientific community, but some researchers saw a glimmer of hope in the form of Michael Kratsios — the president’s chief science adviser. Scientists who had worked with Kratsios during Trump’s first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, had mostly good things to say when Trump nominated him in December: although Kratsios is not a scientist, he had previously shown support for science and a willingness to listen to and work with the scientific community.\n\nResearchers also took it as a positive sign that Kratsios’ nomination to lead the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) came early, and that he was given the official title ‘assistant to the president’, which theoretically grants him easier access to Trump. Kratsios’ predecessor from the first Trump administration, meteorologist Kelvin Droegemeier, arrived two years into the president’s term and without such a title.\n\nIn the announcement in late December, Trump credited Kratsios’ previous service as the US chief technology officer and his brief role overseeing defence research. Along with the announcement, Trump promised to “unleash scientific breakthroughs, ensure America’s technological dominance, and usher in a Golden Age of American Innovation!”\n\nTrump’s science advisers: how they could influence his second presidency\n\nNow, four months after his Senate confirmation, Kratsios is beginning to make his mark as he pushes the president’s science agenda. Although some scientists and scholars are withholding judgement for now, many feel dismayed. In their view, Kratsios has done nothing publicly to defend science, even as the Trump administration slashes science budgets, terminates research grants and projects, fires government scientists and attacks universities. His public comments have typically reinforced the administration’s arguments that science and academia, like government, have become liberally biased and bureaucratic institutions that need to be downsized and then jolted back to life.\n\nIn particular, Kratsios’ first major initiative — a directive calling on federal agencies to promote ‘gold standard science’ — has attracted widespread criticism for undermining and politicizing science. Most crucially, the guidance expands political power over sensitive science topics and questions of alleged research misconduct. When Kratsios defended the effort in an editorial in the journal Science on 24 June (M. Kratsios Science 389, 7; 2025), one of his predecessors, John Holdren, went so far as to publish a letter in Science accusing Kratsios of deploying Orwellian doublespeak to defend a proposal that will further enable the Trump administration’s attacks on science. “And now the fox in the henhouse overseeing it all is Michael Kratsios?” wrote Holdren, a physicist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who served as science adviser to former US president Barack Obama. “What a charade!”\n\nHoldren is not alone. “We were really hopeful that Kratsios would defend science, but it doesn’t look like he is going to do that,” says Kenneth Evans, a science-policy researcher at Rice University in Houston, Texas. The question now, Evans adds, is whether Kratsios and the Trump administration will present a positive agenda for science. “Tearing everything down doesn’t seem like a way forward.”\n\nKratsios declined multiple interview requests from Nature, and the OSTP declined to comment on the allegations in this article.\n\nPolitical science\n\nKratsios earned a bachelor’s degree in politics at Princeton University in New Jersey in 2008, but quickly moved to finance. In 2010, he went to work for the controversial Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, who runs a venture-capital firm with a focus on technology companies. Thiel is a critic of the modern science and innovation system and a long-time supporter of Trump.\n\nKratsios’ early supporters credit him with pushing new strategic policies on artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing forwards during his first stint in the White House. They also say he kept the OSTP office running until Droegemeier was confirmed in January 2019.\n\nIn May, Michael Kratsios (second from left) joined US President Donald Trump and other members of the administration when Trump signed several executive orders, including one titled Restoring Gold Standard Science.Credit: Molly Riley/Official White House Photo\n\n“For two years, we had no director, and he was really holding down the fort,” says Tobin Smith, senior vice-president for government relations and public policy at the Association of American Universities (AAU) in Washington DC. Smith says the AAU’s interactions with Kratsios were positive during the first administration, but says it’s too early to say what the OSTP might get done under his watch this time around. “The verdict is still out.”\n\nUnlike Droegemeier during Trump’s first administration, Kratsios has not shied away from speaking out — and doing so in highly political terms. In his first policy speech at a conference in Austin, Texas, on 14 April, less than three weeks after his confirmation, Kratsios accused the administration of former president Joe Biden of leading with “a spirit of fear rather than promise” and “promoting social division and redistribution in the name of equity”. He then laid out a bleak assessment of US science, arguing that the US innovation system must be renewed to achieve “the Golden Age of American innovation”.\n\n“As we look forward to America’s 250th birthday celebration next year,” he said, “our progress today pales in comparison to the huge leaps of the 20th century.”\n\nDifferent kind of science adviser\n\nSeveral scientists who have worked directly with Kratsios expressed little doubt that he wants to promote science and technology, whether by reducing bureaucratic paperwork or introducing new funding models to encourage innovative research. He leans into areas such as AI, nuclear power and drones, and he wants to produce tangible change rather than written reports, says one scientist who recently departed the OSTP and requested anonymity to speak freely about their time with Kratsios.\n\n“I do think he cares deeply about the American science and technology enterprise,” says the scientist, “but he’s more of a technologist than a scientist”.\n\nAnd that is precisely the problem, says Michael Lubell, a physicist at the City College of New York in New York City, who has studied the history of US science policy. Science advisers dating back to the Second World War varied by discipline and philosophy and served administrations of different political stances, Lubell says, but they were all scientists or engineers who could represent and speak to the research community. He says Kratsios’ expertise rests with technology.\n\nTrump’s call for ‘gold standard science’ has prompted an outcry: here’s why\n\n“He does not come from the science community, he does not know the science community and he does not understand the intellectual content of the science community,” Lubell says. “He is a mouthpiece for the president.”\n\nSeveral scientists who have worked with Kratsios say he has a knack for picking up scientific terms and ideas, knowing his audience and reading the political terrain. It’s unclear how he will balance competing demands in his current role. As science adviser and head of the OSTP, Kratsios needs to be responsive to the president’s priorities while representing the scientific community’s needs, says Gretchen Goldman, who leads the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and who worked on scientific-integrity policies at the OSTP under Biden. “Those two things are just fundamentally in opposition under this administration, so I don’t see how Kratsios could win.”\n\nKratsios caught many scientists and policy specialists off guard with his first signature initiative: the gold-standard-science policy, which Trump unveiled on 23 May in an executive order that also repealed scientific-integrity policies put in place across the federal government under Biden. Kratsios followed up with guidance laying out nine core tenets, starting with reproducibility and transparency, designed to ensure that science conducted or funded by the government is “beyond reproach”.\n\nAlthough the basic framing sounds reasonable at first, Goldman and others have raised a host of criticisms. One is that a guidance document on the gold-standard-science policy issued by the OSTP contains transparency language that seems to echo a controversial ‘secret science’ rule put in place at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the first Trump administration (see go.nature.com/4fnb9pk). The EPA rule, which was blocked by a federal court and killed by the Biden administration, sought to require that the underlying data for science used in public policy be made publicly available, but critics argued that the policy could eliminate the ability of epidemiologists and other researchers at the agency to rely on certain types of public-health data that cannot be released owing to rules designed to protect individuals’ privacy.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?",

          "title": "Is gravity quantum? Experiments could finally probe one of physics’ biggest questions",
          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "Quantum physics is often described as the most successful scientific framework in history. In its 100 years of existence, it has explained everything from the periodic table of the elements to how stars shine. But there is one fundamental phenomenon it can’t explain: gravity.\n\n“How quantum mechanics and gravity fit together is one of the most important outstanding problems in physics,” says Kathryn Zurek, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena.\n\nGenerations of researchers have tried to create a quantum theory of gravity, and their work has produced sophisticated mathematical constructs, such as string theory. But experimental physicists haven’t found concrete evidence for any of these, and they’re not even sure what such evidence could look like.\n\nNow there is a sense that insights could be around the corner. In the past decade, many researchers have become more optimistic that there are ways to test the true nature of gravity in the laboratory. Scientists have proposed experiments to do this, and are pushing the precision of techniques to make them possible. “There’s been a huge rise in both experimental capability and our theoretical understanding of what we actually learn from such experiments,” says Markus Aspelmeyer, an experimental physicist at the University of Vienna and a pioneer of this work.\n\nThis tabletop balance can measure the gravitational force between very small masses.Credit: Westphal, T., et al., Nature\n\nSome of the proposed tests involve experimental lasers, which could be built in a few years. Others require manipulating matter in such ambitious ways that they might never be achieved. One shocking result could be that gravity is not a quantum phenomenon after all.\n\nStill, many researchers feel that the field is finally on the right track. “You have to search, if you’re going to find anything,” says Lee McCuller, an experimental physicist also at Caltech.\n\nTheories of gravity\n\nThe current accepted theory of gravity is Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. It has revealed that gravity is the way in which each lump of matter influences another by curving the space-time in which they travel — akin to billiard balls deforming the elastic surface of a trampoline and bending each others’ paths as they move on it.\n\nGeneral relativity is a classical — as opposed to a quantum — theory. In quantum physics, a particle is described as a smeared-out cloud of possibilities, and its position only assumes a meaning after it’s measured. But Einstein’s theory sees particles as things that exist at a precise point in space at any given time, and that move along well-defined trajectories.\n\nPhysicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows\n\nResearchers attach a variety of meanings to the idea of gravity being quantum, says Flaminia Giacomini, a physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. Scientists generally agree that any quantum theory of gravity has to involve features such as objects having fuzzy probability distributions, rather than definite locations. Some theories also require space-time to come in discrete chunks (‘quanta’), as opposed to the smooth space-time of Einstein’s theory, but this is by no means synonymous with gravity being quantum, she says.\n\nIn early attempts to create a quantum theory of gravity in the 1960s, theoretical physicists tried to feed general relativity into a mathematical procedure that turns classical equations into quantum ones (and objects with well-defined properties into fuzzy probabilistic clouds). But although this trick had worked well for another fundamental force of nature, electromagnetism, in the case of Einstein’s theory, it gave nonsensical results, such as quantities that blew up to infinity.\n\nEfforts to build quantum theories of gravity from scratch have produced some mathematically consistent results. The most popular attempt is string theory, which posits that elementary particles are really tiny strings vibrating in unseen dimensions of space. In principle, this could solve some paradoxes in the theory of known elementary particles, and it predicts new elementary particles that behave the way physicists expect of quanta of gravity, or ‘gravitons’.\n\nThis does achieve the goal of making gravity a quantum theory. But researchers have looked for experimental signatures of certain versions of string theory, with no success so far. The same has been true of loop quantum gravity, an even more radical approach that replaces the fabric of space-time (not just the elementary particles that live in it) with tiny loops.\n\nSome physicists have become frustrated at the dearth of prospects for testing what they see as fancy constructs, such as string theory. “I think people are getting disenamoured with it,” says Ivette Fuentes, a theoretical physicist at the University of Southampton, UK.\n\nTurning to experiments\n\nInstead of designing new quantum gravity theories, some researchers are hoping to use lab tests to explore basic questions about whether gravity, at its heart, has a classical or a quantum nature.\n\n“We don’t have any experimental evidence of how gravity becomes quantum — or of whether gravity is a quantum phenomenon at all,” says experimental physicist Richard Howl at Royal Holloway, University of London.\n\n“For me, the coolest thing would be a yes-or-no experiment,” says Aspelmeyer.\n\nOne of the big questions that researchers have concerns the quantum phenomenon of ‘superposition’ — in which an object can be in two states simultaneously, such as rotating in opposite directions or moving along two distinct paths at once. In any quantum version of general relativity, a particle’s billiard-ball influence would presumably put space-time itself into a superposition of space being bent along one path and, simultaneously, along another. Theorists wonder what gravitational attraction a second ball should feel: would it fall simultaneously along two trajectories, splitting its path into two? Or, if this quantum superposition does not occur, perhaps it would fall towards some point in between, averaging the two attractions out?\n\nThen again, would the very presence of the second ball force the first ball to ‘choose’ which path it is on, just as a measuring device forces a particle to know its position?\n\nIn the past decade, theorists have realized that it should be possible to experimentally distinguish between these ideas, through the peculiarly quantum phenomenon of entanglement. In quantum mechanics, when two objects interact, they can enter a common, ‘entangled’ state. This means that when a property of the first object is measured and acquires a definite value, the corresponding property of the other object is also set.\n\nTwo places at once: superposed crystal could test whether gravity obeys quantum laws\n\nThe key idea is that if two objects can become entangled through their mutual gravitational attraction in the absence of any other interaction, then gravity must be of a quantum nature.\n\nIt all sounds abstract, but researchers have been concocting a plethora of schemes to put this into practice.\n\nIn one experiment envisaged by Aspelmeyer, a tiny particle in a vacuum is placed into a superposition of states corresponding to different positions. Researchers then look to see whether a second, nearby particle, which feels the gravitational attraction of the first but no other forces, has become entangled with it.\n\nAspelmeyer has been at the forefront of improving techniques to make this possible — although the full experiment can’t be done yet.\n\nOne major challenge is that putting an object in a superposition of locations gets increasingly difficult the larger the object is — after all, such effects are never seen at the macroscopic scales of everyday life.\n\nSo far, researchers have achieved it with molecules made of thousands of atoms1, and have made significant breakthroughs in getting relatively large objects, such as tiny glass spheres levitated by laser beams, to show other aspects of quantum behaviour. An important step has been to slow down particles so much that their motion reveals a quantum nature, Aspelmeyer notes: for instance, they acquire discrete energy levels when trapped in an electromagnetic field. This feat was achieved for the first time in 20202.\n\nThe experiment of Aspelmeyer’s dreams would require two objects not only to behave in a quantum way but also to be massive enough to exert a substantial gravitational pull on each other. Because gravity is such a weak force, that would require masses of at least 22 micrograms, having quintillions of atoms.\n\nAspelmeyer can’t yet measure the tiny gravitational force that would be produced by these objects. In 2021, he reported doing so for much larger particles, with a mass of 90 milligrams3. He attached two such masses at the ends of a tiny stick, which was suspended horizontally with a string attached to its midpoint. He then brought in a third 90-mg mass close to one end, and saw the effect of this gravitational pull by measuring the stick’s rotation.\n\nA challenge with measuring smaller objects and their gravitational fields is that it’s very hard to isolate them from other interactions — which tend to be much stronger than gravity. Such isolation would be necessary in the experiment Aspelmeyer wants to do for researchers to be confident that any effect they see is truly due to gravity alone.\n\nPhysicists measure the gravitational forces of tiny masses in an underground laboratory, the Conrad Observatory in Trafelberg, Austria, to block out external noise.Credit: Aspelmeyer Group/University of Vienna/OEAW\n\nSougato Bose, a theoretical physicist at University College London (UCL), and others have proposed and received some funding for a related experiment4. The idea is to have particles in free fall: the researchers suggest putting a microscopic diamond crystal in a superposition that involves falling along two parallel directions, and doing the same for another, similar crystal. (This is achieved in each crystal by putting into superposition one of its spin states and then applying magnetic fields; the crystals are deflected in ways that depend on where their spins point, because spin — a quantum property of subatomic particles — acts rather like a tiny bar magnet.) Altogether, there would be four paths, all parallel to each other, which would put the two crystals at various distances from each other, and therefore in a superposition of feeling gravitational attractions of different intensities (see ‘Proposed tests for quantum gravity’).\n\nSource: Adapted from Sci. Am. (see go.nature.com/4FW1RJG)\n\nEach crystal would then be recombined into one path, and readouts of their quantum states would reveal whether they had become entangled, an outcome that — so the reasoning goes — could have occurred only through gravity. However, Bose says that each of these steps will be extremely hard to achieve, and it could be many decades before experimental techniques make this feasible to test. (Other teams have made similar proposals.)\n\nOther ways to test gravity\n\nAlthough Bose and others think that the ability to create entanglement is the key to proving that gravity has a quantum nature, others say the reality could be more subtle.\n\n“You’re not really proving that gravity is quantum; you make some model of what you think gravity not being quantum would mean, and then try to rule that out,” says Daniel Carney, a theoretical physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.\n\n‘Levitating’ nanoparticles could push the limits of quantum entanglement\n\nIf gravity can entangle things, he says, then it would certainly not be a classical phenomenon, “but what that means to the full structure of the gravitational field is an open question”.\n\nOther groups have developed concepts for testing the quantumness of gravity without entanglement. One, devised by Howl together with Fuentes and the theorist Roger Penrose at the University of Oxford, UK, would suspend a cloud of cold atoms in a single quantum state called a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). Then the gravitational self-attraction of the cloud would make it evolve in different ways, depending on whether gravity is quantum or classical. In particular, classical gravity would never make the positions of the atoms in the BEC evolve from a bell-curve type of distribution (that is, having a single peak) to one with multiple peaks5. It would be possible to measure whether such a shift occurs by probing the BEC with another one, Howl says.\n\nHere, the experimental challenge is that BECs are typically made up of millions of atoms, but that number would need to grow by a factor of 10 million to have measurable gravitational attraction, says Fuentes — although various quantum-technology tricks could soften that requirement.",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "A team including researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen have published a substantial correction to a 2020 paper reporting evidence for exotic quasiparticles called Majoranas.Credit: Philip Davali/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty\n\nA key study1 claiming to provide evidence of Majorana quasiparticles has received an extensive correction five years after it was published in the journal Science. Two researchers who flagged the paper as problematic say that the correction isn’t sufficient — triggering the latest dispute in a field dogged by controversy.\n\nMicrosoft quantum-computing claim still lacks evidence: physicists are dubious\n\nFor decades, physicists have been compelled by the idea that ultracold electrons in microscopic devices could behave collectively to form quasiparticles resistant to noise — both environmental perturbations and the inherent atomic jostling that plagues all quantum systems. The resilience of these Majoranas could make them ideal candidates for forming qubits, the informational units in quantum computers that are analogous to bits in classical machines. Studies to prove their existence have come up short, although recent bold claims by technology giant Microsoft have drawn considerable scrutiny.\n\nIn September 2018, a team led by Charlie Marcus, a physicist at the University of Copenhagen, who also worked for Microsoft at the time, posted a manuscript to the preprint server arXiv that described a fresh approach to generate Majoranas. The researchers made nanowires of indium arsenide surrounded by a shell of aluminium. Applying a small magnetic field, they then measured electrical signals “consistent” with pairs of Majoranas, one at either end of each wire. A year and a half later, they included theoretical simulations to justify their results, and the study was published in Science1.\n\nTwo physicists — Sergey Frolov, at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, and Vincent Mourik, now at the Research Centre Jülich in Germany — raised questions about the validity of the data, and in July 2021, Science applied an editorial expression of concern to the paper to warn readers of potential problems. Now, Science is lifting that warning, and the authors are issuing a 20-page correction to the paper’s supplementary material. News of the correction was first reported on 31 July by the technology news site The Register.\n\nThe Copenhagen group looked for Majoranas with devices made of indium arsenide wires (green) wrapped with aluminium (blue), as shown in this coloured electron microscope image. Credit: Reprinted with permission from Ref. 1.\n\nThe authors say they are relieved by the outcome. “It’s not really correcting any errors,” says co-author Saulius Vaitiekėnas, a physicist at the University of Copenhagen. “We are summarizing and providing additional information.” Frolov, on the other hand, argues that the data in the paper do not give a full picture of electron behaviour in the team’s devices and calls for retraction. “I do not trust this data,” he says.\n\nJake Yeston, an editor at Science who oversees physical-sciences submissions, says that the journal decided not to retract the paper because there was not a “clear, community-grounded view that it’s obviously wrong”. But, Yeston says, the lack of information in the original paper was a problem, and it has now been fixed. “It shouldn’t be that a reader who wants to know what your protocol was has to go to your lab and talk to you,” he says. “That should be in the paper.”\n\nQuestioning the data\n\nThirteen years ago, Frolov and Mourik were authors on a different study in Science2 that reported evidence for Majoranas. But excitement around the result faded after researchers discovered that other mundane phenomena could mimic the quasiparticles.\n\nWhen the Copenhagen team’s manuscript was posted to arXiv in 2018, Frolov and Mourik were dubious so they requested to see all of the data. E-mails reviewed by Nature show that the Copenhagen group released more data in November 2020. The pair of critics analysed the information provided and concluded that the data were incomplete and contradicted the study’s central claims. An internal inquiry by the university’s physics institute, however, found “no problems with the paper”, and that the Copenhagen team had turned over all of its data. Unsatisfied, editors at Science applied an expression of concern to the paper, and in October 2021, Yeston filed a complaint with the university to request an “independent, transparent investigation by experts”.\n\nEvidence of elusive Majorana particle dies — but computing hope lives on\n\nIn June 2022, the university assembled a panel of independent physicists to undertake the effort: Sophie Guéron, at the University of Paris-Saclay; Allan MacDonald, at the University of Texas at Austin; and Pertti Hakonen, at Aalto University in Finland. They travelled to Copenhagen, conducted interviews and examined data from 60 microscopic devices (the original paper included data from 4). Their year-long investigation3 found no misconduct, but stated that the team’s selection of data led to “conclusions that did not adequately capture the variability of outcomes”. The excluded data, however, did not undermine the paper’s main conclusions, they said.\n\nOne sticking point for Frolov and Mourik continues to be the Copenhagen team’s choice of ‘tunnelling regime’ — the range of low electrical conductivities over which the devices were scanned. The Copenhagen researchers said they saw signs of Majoranas persisting “throughout” their chosen tunnelling regime. But Frolov and Mourik said that the extra data they received showed that the tunnelling regime was much wider, and that the telltale Majorana signs were limited to the smaller tunnelling window.",

          "abstract": "This year’s Northern Hemisphere summer brought back-to-back heatwaves in several countries.Credit: Antonio Denti/Reuters\n\nThe summer of 2025 is already shaping up to be a record-breaker. Two intense heatwaves have swept across Europe, causing hundreds of heat-related deaths, fuelling wildfires and pushing power systems to their limit — and more are on the way.\n\nFrom mid-June to early July, Western Europe experienced its highest average temperatures for this period in decades, and the hottest June on record (see ‘Warmest June ever’). Temperatures soared above 40°C, and up to 46°C in Spain and Portugal, as a result of ‘heat domes’ — caps of high pressure that trap hot air in the atmosphere over an area, causing it to stay hotter for longer.\n\nSource: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts/Copernicus\n\nResearch suggests that heatwaves in the region are becoming much more frequent — London can now expect events such as this every 6 years instead of every 60, according to a report published last month by Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute. “We’ll see more dramatic consequences for populations,” says Roman Hoffmann, a social scientist studying climate-related risks at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria. “And more stress that will affect health, well-being, livelihoods and human security more broadly.”\n\nDeadly conditions\n\nAcross 12 major European cities this year, about 1,500 of 2,300 estimated heat-related deaths — 65% — were driven by the extra heat resulting from fossil-fuel emissions, according to the Grantham Institute’s report (see ‘Lethal heatwaves’). The researchers compared real temperatures during the late-June 2025 heatwave with estimates of what temperatures would have been without human-caused climate change, then used health models to calculate the resulting heat-related deaths. The high temperatures were especially lethal for older adults, with people aged 65 and over making up nearly 90% of those who died.\n\nSource: Grantham Institute report Climate change tripled heat-related deaths in early summer European heatwave\n\nAnother study, which looked at the health effects of hot weather in Austria between 2015 and 20221, found that districts with older populations saw around 50% more deaths on very hot days than areas with younger populations did. The true toll could be even higher, because heat-related deaths are often undercounted, typically being recorded as the result of pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, says Hannah Schuster, a data analyst at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, who led the study. By 2050, many areas in Austria are expected to have twice as many hot days and many more older people — making heat-related deaths likely to rise unless action is taken to protect people from the heat, she adds.\n\nThe cool technologies that could protect cities from dangerous heat\n\nAlthough countries with mild climates have long had systems in place to manage cold weather, they’re much less prepared for the growing challenge of extreme heat, Schuster says. This lack of readiness makes the first heatwave of the year especially dangerous, says Peter Klimek, a medical data scientist at the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna. In his own, unpublished, analysis of ten years of hospital and ambulance data from Austria, he found a 30% spike in diagnoses of circulatory, respiratory and mental-health conditions during heatwaves.\n\nKlimek calls for better heatwave warning systems — particularly in hospitals and care homes — and long-term changes to cities, such as the creation of more cooling green spaces and modification of buildings to better dissipate heat.\n\nThousands displaced\n\nAlthough it’s hard to track how many people are forced to leave their homes owing to extreme heat alone, data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), a non-governmental organization in Geneva, Switzerland, show that thousands of people have been temporarily evacuated or displaced as a result of wildfires that occurred during this year’s heatwaves in Europe.\n\n“This year is already record-breaking when it comes to wildfires,” says Ivana Hajžmanová, the global monitoring manager at the IDMC. Not all wildfires are directly caused by climate change, but increasingly hot and dry conditions help fires to spread faster and burn for longer. In June and July, wildfires swept across southern Europe, disrupting a hospital and airport in Sardinia, and Turkey saw 50,000 evacuations as a result of fires in Izmir, the country’s largest-ever wildfire displacement event. Similarly, the region near Athens recorded 14,000 displacements in early June, IDMC figures show (see ‘Fleeing from fire’).\n\nSource: IDMCSource: IDMC\n\nIn 2024, weather-related disasters such as floods, wildfires and droughts forced about 45 million internal displacements — people leaving their homes within their countries — IDMC data suggest. The Institute for Economics & Peace, a think-tank based in Sydney, Australia, projects that by 2050, 3.4 billion people will live in countries facing severe ecological threats (in 2022, it was 2 billion). The ability to relocate from hotter to cooler locations on a more permanent basis is often limited to those with more resources, education and opportunities, Hoffmann says.\n\nUsing data from 72 countries, Hoffmann and his colleagues found that drought and dry conditions cause more people — especially in rural farming areas — to move long-term within their own countries2. Working-age people mainly leave poorer regions, whereas in wealthier countries, older adults are most likely to move — often for retirement.\n\nReduced productivity",

          "authors": "Vani Pariyadath",
          "abstract": "In March 2025, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) began terminating thousands of research grants. Under the instructions of the administration of US President Donald Trump, projects were targeted for a variety of reasons. Some addressed diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI); others explored COVID-19. A few were axed because they involved international collaboration.\n\nThese directives were not scientifically grounded and remain legally questionable. In a ruling in June, a federal judge described the terminations as “arbitrary and capricious” and ordered a partial reinstatement of grants.\n\nExclusive: NIH to dismiss dozens of grant reviewers to align with Trump priorities\n\nNIH programme staff, including myself, have had to work with grantees to align their research with the administration’s ideological agenda, which often meant removing or changing the project’s goals and terminology. I remember spending an hour on a video call with one investigator, trying to make sense of what these changes meant for his research — and the next hour crying at my desk.\n\nAt the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), where I was the chief of the behavioural and cognitive neuroscience branch, these changes have challenged the core of our research. How can substance-use disorders be studied effectively without accounting for the social contexts in which they develop and persist? I could not, in good conscience, comply with what was being asked of us — nor could I ask my staff to do so. Therefore, I made the difficult decision to resign from my position in June.\n\nDuring my ten years working at the NIH, I’ve seen the agency’s approach to studying addiction evolve to incorporate the social determinants of health. Last September, I presented to the NIDA’s advisory council the promising steps that the institute had taken to better integrate factors such as structural racism and the role of neighbourhood resources while developing interventions for substance-use disorders.\n\nNIH chief stands by funding cuts to ‘politicized science’ at tense hearing\n\nPrevious frameworks, for instance, often pinned high rates of alcohol-use disorder in Indigenous US populations to innate factors, such as genetics. Such purely biogenetic explanations can increase public perceptions that individuals with these conditions are inherently dangerous or beyond help (A. Loughman and N. Haslam Cogn. Res. Princ. Implic. 3, 43; 2018), and fail to offer the nuanced understanding needed to develop effective, real-world interventions.\n\nRecognizing the powerful influence of social and structural factors — such as systemic racism — in shaping health outcomes could lead to more-relevant clinical insights. Indeed, the NIDA’s 2022–26 strategic plan affirmed that: “Understanding the role of racism on substance use and its outcomes is essential to our mission.”\n\nIn line with this commitment, the NIDA Racial Equity Initiative (REI) launched five sets of funding opportunities in 2022 to support rigorous, community-partnered research. The resulting projects were unprecedented. One combined neuroscience methods — including brain imaging and behavioural assessments — with new cultural measurements to study how cultural ideas, conventions and social environments influence a person’s vulnerability to addiction.\n\nYet, by June, all these encouraging projects had been halted. The REI notices of funding opportunity had been withdrawn. A whole body of groundbreaking health-equity-related research is being disappeared.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Gary Doak/eyevine\n\nMargaret Ann Boden, one of the last surviving members of the first generation of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, has died at 88. She was the sort of polymath that many AI scientists long thought essential to the field. Boden was particularly famous for her groundbreaking work on computational models of creativity.\n\nThe abstract of her seminal 1998 paper ‘Creativity and artificial intelligence’ in the field’s then-leading journal, Artificial Intelligence, perfectly encapsulates her ideas: “Creativity is a fundamental feature of human intelligence, and a challenge for AI. AI techniques can be used to create new ideas in three ways: by producing novel combinations of familiar ideas; by exploring the potential of conceptual spaces; and by making transformations that enable the generation of previously impossible ideas. AI will have less difficulty in modelling the generation of new ideas than in automating their evaluation.” (M. A. Boden Artif. Intell. 103, 347–356; 1998).\n\nAI and science: what 1,600 researchers think\n\nThat final sentence — in classic scientific understatement — is now terrifyingly manifest in the AI-generated misinformation plaguing everything from students’ essays to legal opinions. Generative AI models are creative, but not necessarily intelligent. It’s prudent to be wary of anyone who, unlike Boden, doesn’t grasp that creativity is just one part of intelligence.\n\nBoden identified as a cognitive scientist. Since 1980, she was professor of cognitive science at Sussex University, Falmer, UK, and in 1987 co-founded its School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences (COGS), which became the leading European centre for AI in the 1990s.\n\nYet, Boden’s first degree was in medical sciences, which she studied at Newnham College, Cambridge University, UK, and completed in 1958, achieving the highest grade in natural sciences across her cohort — despite having finished the three-year course in two years. Her second degree, in philosophy, came from the same institution one year later, at the then-new Cambridge Language Research Unit. Boden learnt that the unit’s head, Margaret Masterman, was thinking about language and machine translation in a particularly forward-thinking way.\n\nGuide, don’t hide: reprogramming learning in the wake of AI\n\nWords are not just a set of definitions, but more like a metaphor, with context-dependent meaning. One needs a thesaurus, not a dictionary, to translate — the approach now used by large language models. Like the US cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett, eight years her junior, Boden’s earliest philosophy papers were on what philosophers call ‘intentionality’ — how a mind can reference and interact with a world. The common thread between her studies in medicine and her interests in AI was Boden’s concerns about mental illness, free will, creativity and, initially at least, even religion. She wanted to understand how the mind works — entirely.",

          "abstract": "Manipulating microbes involved in the fermentation of cocoa beans could lead to the creation of exciting new flavours of chocolate. Credit: Say-Cheese/iStock via Getty\n\nWhen you bite into a piece of chocolate, you can taste its distinct fruity, nutty and earthy flavours.\n\nNow, scientists have gained fresh insights into how the process of fermenting cocoa beans can affect that flavour profile.\n\nIn a study published today in Nature Microbiology1, researchers found that pH, temperature and microbial species in the fermentation process all influence how the resulting chocolate tastes. They also replicated the flavour attributes of a high-quality chocolate in the laboratory by creating the ideal environment for fermentation.\n\nThe researchers hope that using these techniques will “create novelty and exciting new flavours for consumers in the future”, says study co-author David Gopaulchan, a plant geneticist at the University of Nottingham, UK.\n\n“I think this definitely has promise for people to start to play with and look at in terms of designer chocolates”, says Heather Hallen-Adams, a food scientist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.\n\nFermented flavours\n\nFermentation is a flavour-enhancing step in the production of some foods and drinks. Making wine, cheese or beer involves adding yeast or other microorganisms. To make chocolate, cocoa beans are removed from their pods, put together and left to ferment, after which they are dried and roasted. But unlike production of wine, beer and cheese, cacao fermentation is a natural process that usually takes place without adding specific microbes. As a result, little is known about how different conditions or microbe species might influence the flavour of chocolate.\n\n“Ultimately, what we are trying to do is increase the quality of chocolates,” says Gopaulchan. His team took samples of cocoa beans from a farm in the Santander district of Colombia and measured changes in the pH and temperature during the fermentation process. They suspected that these conditions would affect the chocolate’s flavour, because of how they influenced interactions between bacteria and fungi.\n\nRaw cocoa beans must undergo fermentation before they can be made into chocolate.Credit: Ute Grabowsky/Photothek via Getty\n\nThe researchers then compared cocoa samples from the Santander district with those from farms in the Huila and Antioquia regions of Colombia. They prepared cocoa ‘liquors’ from the fermented beans from the three farms to test their flavour profiles. This process involves drying, roasting and breaking down the beans to produce cocoa nibs, which are ground into a paste.\n\nA panel of trained food tasters sampling the liquors reported that those from Santander and Huila shared flavour attributes, with notes of roasted nuts, ripe berries and coffee. By comparison, cocoa liqour from Antioquia had a simpler, more bitter flavour. The cocoa from all three farms had similar genetic backgrounds, which allowed the researchers to exclude genotype as a factor influencing flavour.\n\nAnalysis of the fermentation conditions from the three farms found that unique microbial communities influenced the flavour profiles of the three cocoa liquors. For example, the fungal genera Torulaspora and Saccharomyces were strongly associated with flavour attributes of finer chocolate.\n\nDesigner chocolate",

          "authors": "Carissa Wong",
          "abstract": "Lurking throughout your body, from your liver to your brain, are zombie-like entities known as senescent cells. They no longer divide or function as they once did, yet they resist death and spew out a noxious brew of biological signals that can slow cognition, increase frailty and weaken the immune system. Worst of all, their numbers increase as you age.\n\nFor more than a decade, researchers have been trying to see whether they can selectively destroy these cells with a variety of drugs. In a pivotal study1 published in 2015, a team at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and at the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida, discovered that a combination of two compounds, called dasatinib and quercetin, killed senescent cells in aged mice. The treatment made the mice less frail, rejuvenated their hearts and boosted their running endurance. The finding opened the door to a new area of medicine called senolytics.\n\nNow, fresh results from animal studies and human clinical trials have added momentum to the field. In mice and monkeys, researchers are using genetic tools to reprogram and kill senescent cells. Others are engineering senolytic immune cells. And about 20 clinical trials are ongoing. Researchers are testing new and repurposed drugs that could have senolytic properties, in the hope of combating age-related conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, lung disease and chronic kidney disease.\n\n“I am convinced that senolytics will have an impact in the clinic,” says Anirvan Ghosh, chief executive of Unity Biotechnology, a company in South San Francisco, California, that is developing senolytics. “I think the question is really what the agent looks like and what the first approved drug is.”\n\nZombie cells\n\nSenescent cells were first described in 1961 by US biologists Leonard Hayflick and Paul Moorhead, who discovered that human cells in a laboratory dish will divide no more than about 50 times before either dying or entering the twilight state of cell senescence2. In the lab, it can take weeks for dividing cells to become senescent. But researchers have yet to uncover how much time this process takes in the body, how long senescent cells last and whether all cell types can become senescent.\n\nHacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how\n\nBeyond hitting the limits of cell division, cell senescence can arise owing to other factors such as physical injury, malnourishment or DNA damage caused by UV light. Researchers initially thought that it evolved to prevent damaged cells from replicating uncontrollably and causing cancer. This might be the case to some extent, but it didn’t make sense that the cells would stick around in the body instead of simply dying, such as through the controlled programme of cell death known as apoptosis.\n\nResearchers eventually discovered that senescent cells were avoiding apoptosis so they could perform a service, belching out a potent mix of inflammatory signals — including the cytokines interleukin-6 and interferon-γ — that prompt the immune system to clear out damaged cells. This helps to make room for damaged tissues to regenerate and repair.\n\nThe process works well until the immune system weakens with age, leading to a build-up of senescent cells that stir up excessive inflammation. Researchers have found that an accumulation of senescent cells and age-related inflammation correlates with many diseases, including osteoporosis, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s disease. For many scientists in the field, this realization prompted a shift away from understanding what the cells are doing to working out how to kill them.\n\nTipping the balance\n\nOne key strategy in senolytics involves designing drugs that stop senescent cells from resisting apoptosis. Usually, the cells survive by producing anti-death proteins. Blocking these with drugs can force the cells to succumb to death.\n\nUnity Biotechnology is at the forefront of this approach, say researchers. In a February study3, Ghosh and his colleagues found that senescent cells were more abundant in the retinas of diabetic mice than in those of healthy mice. It was possible, the team predicted, that senescent cells in the blood vessels of the eye play a part in diabetes-related vision loss.\n\nWhy is exercise good for you? Scientists are finding answers in our cells\n\nThis condition, known as diabetic macular oedema, is caused by high blood sugar and makes those delicate blood vessels leaky, particularly in older individuals. The eye condition is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, estimated to affect 27 million adults. But around half of patients get little benefit from the standard treatment, which uses a cancer drug originally designed to slow down the growth of blood vessels. “There is an unmet need,” Ghosh says.\n\nThe researchers designed a drug, called foselutoclax, which blocks the action of BCL-xL, a key anti-death protein that is abundant in senescent cells. When they injected the drug into the eyes of diabetic mice, it killed senescent cells in the blood vessels supplying the retina, but not healthy cells3. “We see a very selective elimination,” says Ghosh.\n\nThe senolytic drug reduced the leakiness of retinal blood vessels in diabetic mice by around 50%. Moreover, the treated mice performed better in vision tests compared with controls. Next, the team turned to humans. In a phase II trial, researchers administered a single injection of foselutoclax into the eyes of about 30 people. Eleven months later, those treated with the senolytic could read 5.6 more letters, on average, on an optician’s chart compared with participants who had received a placebo treatment.\n\nAfter just a couple of weeks, says Ghosh, one participant called him to say the treatment was making her life much easier. Another saw rapid improvements in their colour vision. The team expects to publish the results later this year, but in the meantime, Unity is running another phase II trial that will compare the senolytic with standard therapy.\n\nUnity’s results are promising, say researchers. “I think within the next five years we may see this treatment for diabetic macular oedema being offered in the clinic,” says Sundeep Khosla, who studies ageing at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nRather than making senolytics from scratch, some scientists are testing drugs that already exist. These include dasatinib, which is approved in the United States as a cancer therapy, and two commercially available, plant-derived chemicals called quercetin and fisetin. The latter two are sold as supplements to dampen inflammation, boost brain health and reduce the risk of age-related disease. These claims are based on rodent studies in which the drugs have been shown to clear senescent cells and reduce inflammation4.\n\nDo cutting-edge CAR-T-cell therapies cause cancer? What the data say\n\nIn a 2019 study5, researchers used dasatinib and quercetin to remove senescent brain cells in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Mice treated with the senolytics had reduced brain inflammation and improved memory compared with animals that were given a placebo. Spurred on by these promising data from mice, Miranda Orr at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and her colleagues last year conducted the first safety trial of the drug combination in people with early stage Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nOrr’s team gave five people dasatinib and quercetin intermittently for three months. The researchers found that the drugs were safe and that dasatinib was present in samples of cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting it could cross into the brain. Quercetin was not detected in brain fluid samples, but Orr says she suspects that it did reach the brain and was rapidly broken down. The team is now conducting a larger trial to track the cognition of people with and without Alzheimer’s disease for nine months after they take a placebo or the drug combination. The results should be released in 2025, says Orr.\n\nKhosla says that fresh data should also emerge this year from the largest human trial of dasatinib and quercetin so far. In this study, which is currently under peer review, his team looked at the effect of senolytics on the bones of healthy women.\n\nImmune killers\n\nWhen it comes to killing cells in the body, the immune system could be of help. And some researchers have latched on to the idea of using genetically engineered immune cells called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. These can target and kill specific cells on the basis of the molecules they display on their surface. CAR-T-cell therapies are currently approved as a treatment for various blood cancers.\n\nEarlier this year, cell biologist Corina Amor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York and her colleagues identified a protein marker, called uPAR, on senescent cells in the livers, fat tissues and pancreases of older mice6. The researchers created CAR T cells that were designed to kill senescent cells bearing the uPAR marker. After the team infused the engineered cells into the blood of old mice, there was a decline in the proportion of liver, pancreas and fat cells that were senescent.\n\nSenescent mouse liver cells express β-galactosidase (white) and uPAR (yellow).Credit: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n\nAmor and her team found that old mice treated with the uPAR CAR T cells had reduced blood-sugar levels — a sign of improved metabolic health — and that the animals ran faster and for longer than did mice treated with non-engineered T cells, or with T cells that target a protein not found in mice. None of the mice treated with the senolytic CAR T cells showed signs that the T cells were toxic.",

          "abstract": "Interest in bringing Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Western Science together to enhance climate and landscape resilience is growing rapidly, particularly for engagement with pyrogenic communities around the world. For these systems, Indigenous Knowledge offers unique insights that reflect millennia of intimate engagement with local landscapes, while Western Science can offer additional understanding of the emergence of climates and ecological conditions that are novel at evolutionary timescales. Here, we weave Indigenous Knowledge together with a multicentury history of fire, landuse, and forest development derived from tree rings to retell a more complete history of human engagement with the places commonly referred to as Wisconsin and Minnesota Points at the head of Lake Superior in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Our aim in this work is to create mutual reciprocal benefits for those involved in this work to disrupt a long history of extractive research and to honor the knowledge shared with us by reducing barriers to the revitalization of traditional cultural and landuse practices. This intensely local study, contextualized by substantial bodies of Indigenous Knowledge and Western Science, illustrates the importance of place-based and community-based research for understanding the role of Indigenous fire stewardship in shaping pine barrens sites and demonstrates how these fine-scale relationships are linked to regional landscape diversity yet may be invisible to other proxy-based studies. These results help (re)center Indigenous Knowledge and traditional fire-use practices in the process of ecocultural fire restoration for the creation of diverse, resilient, and just socioecological systems that continue to transition toward a warmer future.",

          "abstract": "Scientific institutions like funding agencies and journals rely on peer reviewers to select among competing submissions. How does the geographical diversity of reviewers affect which authors are selected? If reviewers typically favor submissions from their own countries, but reviewers from only some countries are well represented in the reviewer pool, this can create a “geographical representation bias” favoring authors from those well-represented countries. Using administrative data on 204,718 submissions to 60 STEM journals from the Institute of Physics Publishing, we find support for representation bias. Reviewers from the same country as the corresponding author are 4.78 percentage points more likely to review positively compared to other reviewers of the same manuscript. Authors from the United States of America, China, and India are 8 to 9 times more likely to be evaluated by same-country reviewers compared to less-represented countries with similar incomes. Furthermore, an instrumental variables analysis of an anonymization policy shock shows that anonymizing submissions does not significantly reduce same-country homophily. Thus, investments in reviewer diversification may be necessary to mitigate the structural advantage of authors from major science-producing countries and avoid blind spots in collective knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Vertebrate locomotion is due to the interplay of neural oscillators and sensory feedback loops in the spinal cord that interact with the body and the environment. Here, we study these circuits with a focus on undulatory locomotion as produced by elongated fish such as eels and lampreys. We address three questions: i) How do proprioception (stretch feedback) and exteroception (pressure on skin) interact with local oscillators to generate stable swimming patterns? ii) Can these feedback loops also contribute to dry ground locomotion? iii) Can they explain the remarkable robustness of eels against spinal cord transections? To address these questions, we developed abstract models of the locomotion circuits based on coupled phase oscillators, local stretch and pressure feedback loops, and simulated muscle models that were tested both in simulation and with a real undulatory robot. We also performed swimming experiments with eels before and after spinal cord transections. We found that stretch and pressure feedback work well together in swimming, as they contribute to rapid pattern generation and can, in principle, both replace direct couplings between oscillators. Interestingly, the swimming controllers could generate good ground locomotion when placed in an arena with pegs. For ground locomotion, the stretch feedback is more beneficial than pressure feedback. Finally, our models could replicate the remarkable ability of eels to keep swimming shortly after a full spinal cord transection. We found that stretch feedback and the ability of oscillators to spontaneously oscillate are likely explanations for keeping the neural oscillators active and coordinated below the transection.",

          "abstract": "Sympatric speciation is considered rare, but oceanic Howea palms, crater lake cichlids, and parasitic indigobirds provide compelling evidence that it occurs. Still, the frequency of sympatric speciation and its relationship to morphological divergence in plants remains poorly understood, especially in plants. Here, we analyze the geographic distributions, traits, and divergence times of palm and conifer sister species (740 species from 108 genera) to determine the dominant geographic mode and role of morphological divergence in plant speciation. We show that allopatric speciation is dominant, and while frequent sympatric speciation cannot be discounted, the most likely scenario is that zero (conifers) or 10% (palms) of speciation events occur in sympatry. Our models show that the incidence of sympatry among sister pairs rises rapidly within the first million years after speciation and then declines, suggesting that species failing to attain sympatry early tend to remain allopatric. Finally, we find no evidence for morphological divergence in allopatric or sympatric palms. Our findings question the link between speciation and morphological divergence and suggest that while plants and animals share similar modes of speciation, plants exhibit a complex spatiotemporal dynamic, challenging the typical vertebrate pattern of steadily increasing sympatry.",

          "abstract": "Polyploidization is an important driver of evolution and diversification in flowering plants. Here, we assess how repeated polyploidization may have shaped diversification of floral morphology in Lithophragma bolanderi (Saxifragaceae). This species comprises multiple cytotypes and varies geographically in its interactions with specialized pollinating moths in the genus Greya (Prodoxidae). Past studies have shown that coevolution with these moths has favored particular suites of floral characters but does not fully explain local and regional floral diversification. We combined phenotypic and genomic data from more than 1,800 individuals from 40 L. bolanderi populations spread across its entire range. Flow-cytometric analyses revealed a geographic mosaic of populations comprising one to four of three dominant (diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid) and three rare (triploid, pentaploid, octoploid) cytotypes. Whole-genome resequencing of a subset of populations suggested that polyploids arose from multiple autopolyploidization events, rather than a single event and/or through hybridization, albeit with some signals consistent with low levels of introgression from the congener Lithophragma glabrum . Quantification of flower traits from plants grown in a common garden showed that cytotype explained more than 15% of the variation in floral morphology, with polyploids showing more variability than diploids. Experimental induction of neopolyploids directly induced phenotypic changes but also indicated that local selection may have favored subsequent convergence in floral morphology among cytotypes in natural populations. Collectively, this comprehensive and integrative approach provides insights into how variability generating processes, such as polyploidization integrates with selection from species interactions to shape local floral diversification.",

          "abstract": "The meninges serve as a critical interface between the peripheral immune system and the central nervous system, playing a crucial role in maintaining parenchymal homeostasis. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyloidosis and tauopathies, are marked by the accumulation of extracellular neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau tangles, respectively, leading to neuronal cell death and cognitive decline. The role of the adaptive immune response in these pathologies remains under debate. Adaptive immune cells can manifest as ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS), which resemble secondary lymphoid organs, and form at sites of inflammation or pathology. While ELSs can support immune responses against infections or tumors, they may also have detrimental effects in certain pathological conditions. To explore whether meningeal ELS are implicated in aging and neurodegeneration, we analyzed the meninges of aged wild-type mice and mouse models of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, tauopathy, and Down syndrome-related neurodegenerative disorders. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of dural ELS varies according to age, brain pathology, and sex. Meningeal myeloid cells may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of ELS during aging. These results demonstrate the potential contribution of meningeal ELS to healthy aging and neurodegenerative conditions, offering directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "A record-breaking melt season affected the Arctic glaciers of Svalbard in summer 2024 by a substantial margin. Across the entire archipelago, glacier melting corresponded to an anomaly of up to four SD and exceeded any previous observation. The pan-Svalbard mass loss in summer 2024 amounts to ~61.7 ± 11.1 Gt and corresponds to 1% of the total ice volume on Svalbard and is comparable to that of the Greenland ice sheet (55 ± 35 Gt), which occupies an area about 50 times larger. Altogether, Svalbard and other glacier regions surrounding the Barents Sea lost 102.1 ± 22.9 Gt of ice in a single year and contributed 0.27 ± 0.06 mm (of which 0.16 mm alone is due to Svalbard) to global sea-level, putting the circum-Barents region among the strongest contributors to global sea-level rise in 2024. Most of the 2024 glacier melt occurred during a 6-wk period of persistent atmospheric circulation pattern causing record-high air temperatures, an event with an extremely low recurrence interval under current climate conditions. However, future climate projections suggest that such temperature levels will become increasingly commonplace by the end of the 21st century, potentially even surpassing those of 2024. Svalbard’s summer of 2024 serves as a forecast for future glacier meltdown in the Arctic, offering a glimpse into conditions 70 y ahead.",

          "abstract": "We argue that the combination of strong repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moiré materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter–Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer route to electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.",

Pilocarpine-induced sweat collection for chloridometry measurement is the gold standard for a CF diagnosis, but this technique is cumbersome and not suitable for remote settings or repeat measurements. We have previously reported the utility of a skin-interfaced microfluidic device (CF Patch) in conjunction with a smartphone image processing platform that enables real-time measurement of sweating rates and sodium chloride loss in laboratory and remote settings. Here, we conducted clinical studies assessing the accuracy of the CF Patch compared to chloridometry when using pilocarpine to induce sweat. We also tested the feasibility and accuracy of exercise-induced sweat chloride measurements in PwCF and healthy volunteers (HV). In the laboratory, using either pilocarpine or exercise to induce sweat, the CF Patch demonstrated strong correlations with sweat chloride measured by pilocarpine-induced chloridometry. In remote settings, exercise-induced sweat chlorides measured using the CF patch were strongly correlated with in-laboratory exercise-induced CF patch sweat chlorides in HV but had a weaker correlation in PwCF. For PwCF on CFTR modulators, there was greater day-to-day variability in sweat chloride compared to HV, which highlights the limitations of assessing CFTR modulator efficacy and pharmacodynamics based on a single in-laboratory chloridometry measurement. Moreover, these findings demonstrate that the CF Patch is suitable as a remote management device capable of measuring serial sweat chloride concentrations and offers the potential of monitoring the efficacy of CF medication regimens but should not replace pilocarpine-based chloridometry for making a CF diagnosis.",

We propose ensemble modeling approaches combining mechanistic, statistical, and machine learning models to forecast dengue cases 1 to 3 mo ahead at the province level across multiple countries. We assess these models’ predictive ability out-of-sample and retrospectively in over 180 locations worldwide, including provinces in Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, plus Iquitos, Peru, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, during at least 2 to 3 y. We also evaluate ensemble approaches in a real-time, prospective dengue forecasting platform during 2022–2023, considering data availability limitations. Our ensemble modeling leads to an improvement to previous efforts that may help decision-making in the context of large uncertainties. This contrasts with the variable performance of individual component models across locations and time. No single model achieves optimal predictions across all scenarios, but while ensemble models may not always perform best in specific locations, they consistently rank among the top 3 performing models both retrospectively and prospectively.",

While the cytotoxic and enterotoxic capabilities of this bacterium have been previously investigated, the strategies it employs to circumvent innate immune detection by the host remain poorly understood. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serves as the major pathogen-associated molecular pattern that triggers host inflammatory responses, and its lipid A structure contributes to the degree of innate immune system activation. We sought to define the structure of the lipid A component of LPS in V. para and probe its role in host innate immunity. Free living V. para synthesizes a predominantly hepta-acylated lipid A structure, while also producing a minor subset of hexa-acylated lipid A. This altered acylated lipid A elicits a weakened TLR4 immune response as compared to Escherichia coli , allowing V. para entry and replication inside host cells. Deletion of the V. para lipid A biosynthesis enzyme lpxM (VP0213) leads to a mutant strain with altered lipid A secondary acylation, enhanced immune response, and impaired replication within epithelial cells. This study provides evidence that the unique LPS structure synthesized by V. para plays a crucial role in evading host innate immunity, facilitating the bacterium’s survival and replication within host cells.",

          "abstract": "Fish population biomass fluctuates through time in ways that may be either gradual or abrupt. While abrupt shifts in fish population productivity have been shown to be common, they are rarely integrated into stock assessment or fishery management, in part because of the difficulty of predicting when abrupt shifts may occur and which stocks are prone to such shifts. In this study, we address the latter challenge by designing a mechanism-agnostic context-specific approach that is based on exploiting the dynamical properties of fish population fluctuations for detecting potential abrupt shifts. We use time series of fish population biomass from three global datasets, first, to classify their shapes into abrupt and nonabrupt (linear, quadratic, or no change) classes, and, second, to predict classified shapes based only on their dynamical footprint (a set of metrics such as variance, autocorrelation, etc, of the time series). We find that populations prone to abrupt shifts can be detected with moderate accuracy in the three datasets in spite of data limitations. In total, we identified 50 populations at risk of future abrupt shifts across 11 different Large Marine Ecosystem regions. Our context-specific approach offers critical insights into population stability and enables the identification of stocks whose dynamical properties suggest that they would benefit from more precautionary management.",

          "abstract": "Migratory locusts ( Locusta migratoria ) emit two key odorants during aggregation: 4-vinylanisole (4VA), which serves as an aggregation pheromone attracting conspecifics to form swarms, and phenylacetonitrile (PAN), which acts as an aposematic signal and a precursor of a defense toxin, deterring conspecifics from cannibalism and protecting against predators. However, how locusts reconcile these two conflicting olfactory signals while aggregating is not yet understood. Our study addresses this by examining the release dynamics of the two signals, their behavioral effects, and the neural mechanisms underlying their perception. 4VA is released earlier and at lower locust densities than PAN, with PAN’s release increasing as aggregation progresses. Although PAN’s emission levels eventually exceed those of 4VA, locusts consistently exhibit a preference for the emitted blend, regardless of variations in proportions and concentrations. Notably, increasing amounts of 4VA added to PAN can counteract PAN’s repellent effects, but this is not the case when PAN is added to 4VA. Mechanistically, we found that antennal neurons responsive to 4VA suppress the activity of neurons responsive to PAN. In the antennal lobe, it is the conduction velocities of projection neurons, rather than other neural properties, that are responsible for the observed behavioral pattern, leading to an overall attractive response. Collectively, our findings imply that insects are capable of harmonizing the effects of two distinct pheromones to optimize both social cohesion and chemical defense.",

Beckwith–Wiedemann spectrum (BWSp) is a prototypic CID resulting from genetic and epigenetic alterations of imprinted genes at chromosome 11p15.5. In up to a quarter of individuals with BWSp, the epigenetic alterations are not confined to 11p15.5 imprinting control regions but also involve other imprinted gene clusters (multilocus imprinting disturbance; MLID). In a consanguineous family with two children diagnosed with BWSp and MLID, the affected individuals were homozygous for a missense variant in UHRF1 , a gene previously implicated in the maintenance of DNA methylation. To investigate whether the UHRF1 c. 2001G&gt;C, p.(Lys667Asn) missense substitution predisposes to abnormal establishment/maintenance of genomic imprinting patterns, a genetically engineered mouse model with a Uhrf1 p.(Lys661Asn) variant was developed. Mice homozygous for the variant born to heterozygous mothers did not display an abnormal phenotype, but homozygotes born to healthy homozygous mothers displayed a range of phenotypes including prenatal lethality. Also, MLID was observed in affected mouse embryos. These findings are consistent with biallelic UHRF1 variants in affected individuals resulting in an autosomal recessively inherited cause of MLID in humans and expand the range of epigenetic disorders associated with UHRF1.",

While the extent of terminal Messinian drawdown and abruptness of reconnection are debated, recent work inferred that an anomalously long-lasting eastern Mediterranean organic-rich “mystery sapropel” layer was deposited due to salinity-stratification and anoxia following catastrophic flooding that refilled the basin. However, independent evidence is required to test this hypothesis. Here, we present extensive proxy data and numerical model results to show that irrespective of the largely hypersaline or oligohaline conditions proposed for the terminal Messinian, the eastern Mediterranean became oxygenated due to the ~1.5-km-high, turbulent and aerated cascade that refilled the basin, which created a salinity-stratified but oxygenated water column that allowed preservation of only the most recalcitrant organic components. Next, oxygen was gradually depleted over a period of up to 12,000 y due to remineralization of sinking organic matter, culminating in a stratified, anoxic basin. It took 33,000 y after flooding (7,000 y longer than suggested previously) for turbulent diffusion to weaken the stratification and allow resumption of convective deep-water renewal, which marked the final return of normal oxygenated marine conditions throughout the Mediterranean.",

The extensive genetic and antigenic diversity within and between IAV phylogenetic groups presents major challenges for developing universal vaccines and broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. Current interventions provide limited protection due to the virus’s high mutation rate and capacity for immune evasion. Recent advancements in viral hemagglutinin (HA)-targeting small-molecule entry inhibitors offer a promising avenue to overcome these limitations. Here, we present structural and functional analyses of two group 2 HA-specific small-molecule inhibitors recently identified by our team. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures revealed that these inhibitors bind a conserved pocket within the HA stalk, likely interfering with the conformational rearrangements necessary for membrane fusion and viral entry. Structure-guided mutagenesis confirmed the critical roles of key interacting residues and uncovered distinct resistance profiles between the two compounds, as well as in comparison to Arbidol, a previously reported HA inhibitor. Notably, our structural analysis highlights intrinsic barriers to achieving cross-group inhibition with current small-molecule designs. To address this, we propose an alternative strategy for broadening antiviral coverage. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into IAV entry inhibition and a foundation for the rational design of next-generation anti-influenza therapeutics.",

However, newer endosymbiotic models have challenged the origin and timing of such genetic integration during organellogenesis. Epithemia diatoms contain diazoplasts, obligate endosymbionts derived from cyanobacteria that are closely phylogenetically related to UCYN-A, a recently described nitrogen-fixing organelle. Diazoplasts function as permanent membrane compartments in Epithemia hosts, but it is unknown if genetic integration has occurred. We report genomic analyses of two Epithemia diatom species, freshwater Epithemia clementina and marine E. pelagica , which are highly divergent but share a common ancestor at the origin of the endosymbiosis &lt;35Mya. We find minimal evidence for genetic integration. Segments of fragmented and rearranged DNA from the diazoplast were detected integrated into the E. clementina nuclear genome, but the transfers that have occurred so far are nonfunctional. No DNA or gene transfers were detected in E. pelagica. In E. clementina , 6 host-encoded proteins of unknown function were identified in the diazoplast proteome, far fewer than detected in recently acquired endosymbiotic organelles. Overall, Epithemia diazoplasts are a valuable counterpoint to existing organelle models, demonstrating that endosymbionts can function as integral compartments—maintained over millions of years of host speciation—absent significant genetic integration. The minimal genetic integration makes diazoplasts valuable blueprints for bioengineering endosymbiotic compartments de novo.",

Insertions and deletions (indels) were commonly observed in both repeat and nonrepeat sequences in wild-type cells. The loss of DNA polymerase β (Polβ), an enzyme involved in gap-filling during base excision repair and Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET)-mediated active DNA demethylation, in neural progenitor cells increased indel frequency by ~ninefold at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides and raised the frequency of structural variants by ~fivefold. These mutations were enriched in neuronal genes, leading to frameshift mutations, amino acid insertions/deletions, and the gain and loss of CpG sites in regulatory regions. Our findings suggest that Polβ preferentially repairs DNA lesions generated at CpG sites by TET-mediated active demethylation, thereby suppressing the mutagenesis that accompanies neuronal gene activation during cortical development.",

Using dense behavioral recordings of mathematicians’ moment-to-moment activity, we find that their blackboard interactions (e.g., writing, gesturing; N = 4 , 653 ) became increasingly unpredictable before an insight, analogous to the critical fluctuations that anticipate transitions in physical and ecological systems. We explore analytically when this early warning signal applies to varied systems with discrete, symbolic dynamics.

Global aboveground biomass is projected to decline by 4 to 16% under a 2 °C increase in climate warming.

Beyond these immediate benefits, removal may also support long-term memory processes. We tested this hypothesis using an associative memory paradigm with directed forgetting instructions and characterized the underlying neural mechanisms. In complementary behavioral (N = 22) and fMRI (N = 17) experiments, participants completed an ABC associative memory task using pictures of objects, faces, and scenes. Each A item was sequentially paired with B and C items. Our key manipulation targeted the B items: following B encoding, participants were instructed either to maintain or suppress B. We hypothesized that suppression would impair AB memory but enhance AC memory, and this is precisely what we found. Suppression cues elicited distributed activations across frontoparietal control regions, as expected. Critically, multivoxel pattern analyses revealed enhanced encoding fidelity for C items in hippocampal subregion CA1 following suppression compared to maintenance. During subsequent associative memory tests cued by A items, reactivation of suppressed B items was significantly reduced relative to C items, reflecting diminished competition from B items during retrieval. Together, these findings demonstrate that suppression of unwanted information in WM benefits the formation of new memories by enhancing their encoding fidelity and biasing subsequent memory retrieval away from the suppressed associations.",

Metagenome sequencing and robust statistical analysis have linked specific strains, including the gut bacterium Campylobacter concisus , to Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, together known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the roles of this and other strains in disease progression remain to be investigated. Herein, we assess the contribution of C. concisus secondary metabolites to inflammation. Through untargeted metabolomics, we identified a diverse array of nineteen indole-containing metabolites produced by C. concisus , including trisindoline, previously isolated from a marine bacterium. Collectively, these metabolites modulate inflammatory responses by significantly inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. The metabolites act through the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor arylhydrocarbon receptor and in vivo intravital imaging revealed a marked increase in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, specifically neutrophils and macrophages, following the administration of trisindoline. Several indole metabolites also exhibited antimicrobial activity against commensal strains that facilitate a proper immune response. Our study provides a possible rationale for the association of C. concisus with IBD and underscores the complex interplay between gut bacteria and host immunity. The identification of indole-derived secondary metabolites as key modulators of inflammation offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

There are considerable variations in the various dimensions of physiological limit among tree taxa; thus, varied environmental drivers and spatial patterns are expected for different tree taxa at treelines. However, such taxonomic variability of treeline is often overlooked in large-scale studies. Here, we assembled, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive dataset of tree species at alpine treelines, drawing from research conducted over the past half-century, encompassing over 2,000 records across 38 mountain regions and 43 countries. Using this extensive global dataset, we examined the spatial patterns and environmental drivers shaping different tree taxa at treelines worldwide. The highest tree richness at treelines was found in mid-latitude mountains of the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting floristic differentiation caused by continental isolation. Moisture and climatic variability, particularly seasonal fluctuations, determine the turnover of tree taxa at treelines. Heat limitations appear to restrict the establishment of all genera, effectively defining treeline positions. Heat conditions at treeline positions tend to be about 35% below the genus- and species- level thermal optima. This thermal threshold can effectively explain the global pattern of uppermost tree elevation. Our findings highlight the synergic effects between heat and moisture in determining the taxonomic variation in treeline formation, offering insights for alpine treeline studies under climate change.",

Here, we assess the river flow connectivity of 217,001 river reaches in mainland China from 1961 to 2020 and the impact of different climate warming trends and water withdrawals for different sectors. We estimate that naturally intermittent rivers represent about 13% of all river reaches, with a large contrast between northern and southern China (12% vs. 1%, respectively). Although river intermittency decreased slightly during this period (i.e., river connectivity lengthened due to increasing precipitation), warming temperatures offset this decrease by reducing surface water persistence, causing the decrease (−476 vs. −233 km/y) to double when removing the long-term temperature trend. Critically, the length of intermittent rivers increased remarkably from 13 to 50% when considering human water withdrawal by agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors, in addition to environmental flow requirements. Our findings highlight the urgent need to maintain sustainable water resources in a warming climate in which unregulated water abstractions increasingly threaten river flow connectivity, particularly in drying regions.",

          "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC), a statistical correlation of pair-wise brain signals from resting-state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI), is a widely used concept for mapping large-scale functional networks in both humans and animals. However, its underlying causal mechanism remains poorly understood, particularly for strong interhemispheric connectivity (e.g., homotopic connections) consistently observed in FC. In this study, we investigated the neural basis of RS FC in mice using fMRI with anatomically defined patterned optogenetic activation and inhibition of excitatory neurons in six cortical regions. Unlike commonly used optogenetic activation, optogenetic silencing suppresses spontaneous neural activity in a localized region, reducing RS synaptic inputs to downstream networked areas. Consequently, fMRI can track spontaneous functional connections without the neural perturbations associated with excitation. While conventional optogenetic activation of excitatory neurons in the targeted cortical areas predominantly elicited their ipsilateral functional responses in both cortical and subcortical regions, optogenetic silencing induced both intra- and interhemispheric cortical responses, which were stronger than cortical-subcortical connections. These effects more closely resembled statistically defined RS FC patterns, providing insight into the underlying mechanisms of intrinsic FC. By modeling synaptic path length-dependent connectivity patterns based on structural connectivity (SC), we found that spontaneous functional connections can be explained by polysynaptic propagation, whereas evoked activity is largely restricted to monosynaptic pathways. These findings highlight the critical role of polysynaptic pathways in shaping spontaneous connectivity, suggesting that RS FC arises from causal interactions of spontaneous ongoing neural activity.",

          "abstract": "Soil carbon (C) dynamics upon permafrost thaw represents a major uncertainty in climate projections. Both soil C loss and formation in permafrost regions are mediated by microorganisms, and the balance of these two processes could be characterized by a synthetic metric termed microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE, defined as the ratio of C used for growth over C uptake). However, how microbial CUE responds to permafrost thaw remains unclear due to the lack of direct experimental evidence. Here, based on an ~27 y permafrost thaw sequence and five additional thermokarst-impacted sites across the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, we investigate the response of microbial CUE to abrupt permafrost thaw using a substrate-independent 18 O tracing approach. Results from the thaw sequence and additional sites at the regional scale consistently reveal that topsoil (0 to 10 cm) microbial CUE increases after permafrost collapse as a consequence of accelerated growth. The elevated microbial growth and CUE are driven by the alterations in microbial communities with larger ratio of fungal to bacterial biomass and more copiotrophs. In addition, the increased soil phosphorus availability could also promote microbial growth and CUE. These results highlight that the higher microbial CUE upon abrupt permafrost thaw would potentially enhance soil C stability by promoting the deposition of microbial-derived C into soil. Earth system models should thus explicitly characterize microbial CUE and its drivers to accurately predict permafrost C-climate feedback.",

          "abstract": "Hypoxia, a condition characterized by insufficient oxygen supply, challenges cellular homeostasis and energy production, triggering adaptive responses to promote survival under these stressful conditions. One key strategy involves enzymatic oxidation of N-terminal cysteine residues coupled with proteolysis through the Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway. Despite hundreds of human proteins possessing N-terminal cysteine, very few have been identified as substrates of this pathway, and its substrate selectivity remains unclear. Moreover, the biological role of this pathway in the cellular response to hypoxia is not well defined. Here, by systematically screening protein stability using an N-terminome library, we reveal a broad set of cysteine-initiating proteins regulated by this pathway. Mutagenesis experiments further revealed the specificity of Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway, showing a preference for hydrophobic and positively charged residues following cysteine. Additionally, we uncovered full-length substrates that are regulated by this pathway during hypoxia, including IP6K1. Loss of IP6K1 impaired glucose uptake, glycolytic ATP production, and overall mitochondrial function. Consequently, IP6K1-deficient cells exhibited disrupted metabolic adaptation under hypoxic conditions and reduced survival under stress. These findings underscore the importance of the Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway in regulating metabolic responses and highlight its potential importance in hypoxia-related disorders.",

          "abstract": "Many studies have shown that sequestration of client proteins into condensates locally increases their concentrations and/or modulates their conformational landscapes to promote aberrant aggregation. Far fewer examples have emerged where the proteinaceous condensed phase environment protects clients from aggregation. Here, we show that a condensate scaffolded by the C-terminal disordered region of Cell Cycle Associated Protein 1 (CAPRIN1) suppresses aggregation of the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) client, both components of stress granules. Although FUS RRM aggregation is mediated through the unfolded ensemble, comparative NMR studies of the FUS RRM outside and within the condensate establish that CAPRIN1 condensates attenuate FUS RRM aggregation despite locally increasing its concentration by twofold and significantly unfolding the domain. Regions of transient intermolecular contacts between unfolded FUS RRM protomers that could drive aggregation have been identified, including the hydrophobic segments spanning I287-I308 and G335-A369. Intermolecular NOE experiments recorded on the FUS RRM:CAPRIN1 condensate indicate that CAPRIN1 interacts with much of the unfolded FUS RRM, with regions of stronger contacts including the RRM sequences 287 IFVQ 290 , 296 VTIES 300 , 322 INLY 325 , and 351 IDWFDG 356 . These interactions collectively outcompete the homotypic contacts between unfolded FUS RRM clients driving aggregation. Our results demonstrate that condensate scaffold molecules can, in some cases, shield client interprotomer interactions, delaying or completely suppressing their aggregation.",

          "abstract": "As the energy center of the cell, mitochondria display enormous metabolic plasticity to meet the cellular demand for plant growth and development, which is tightly linked to their structural and dynamic plasticity. Mitochondrial number and morphology are coordinated through the actions of the mitochondrial division and fusion. Meanwhile, damaged mitochondrial contents are removed to avoid excess toxicity to the plant cells. Mitophagy, a selective degradation pathway of mitochondria through a double-membrane sac named autophagosome (also known as mitophagosome), plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Typically, wholesale mitophagy requires the elongation of a cup-shaped phagophore along the entire mitochondrion, which finally seals and closes as a mitophagosome. How plant mitophagosome formation and mitochondria sequestration are coordinated remains incompletely understood. In this work, we report an unappreciated role of the plant-specific mitochondrial fission regulator ELM1, together with the dynamin-related protein family DRP3 and the autophagic regulator SH3P2, to coordinate mitochondria segregation for piecemeal mitophagy under heat stress conditions. Dysfunction in mitochondrial fission activity impairs heat-induced mitophagy, leading to an accumulation of interconnected megamitochondria which are partially sequestered by the ATG8-positive phagophore. Furthermore, we show that the ELM1-mediated piecemeal mitophagy also engages the plant archetypal selective autophagic receptor NBR1. Using 3D tomography analysis, we illustrate the morphological features and spatial relationship of the megamitochondria and phagophore intermediates in connection with the mitochondrial fission sites. Collectively, our study provides an updated model of mitophagosome formation for piecemeal mitophagy mediated by the plant-unique mitochondrial fission machinery.",

Uncertainty in the future climate arises from three sources—differences in emissions scenarios, structural uncertainty across climate models, and internal climate variability (ICV)—but ICV is rarely considered in climate-VBD studies. Here, we demonstrate that ICV is a key source of uncertainty in climate suitability for VBD transmission, even decades into the future. Because of ICV, suitable climate conditions for transmission may arise in many locations sooner than expected under climate change alone.",

However, emerging evidence suggests that these number–space connections may reflect our evolutionary history and emerge even in the absence of cultural tools. We examined how task-naïve monkeys learn spatial and numerical concepts over time. Monkeys’ learning trajectories revealed successful learning of both numerical and geometric concepts. Discriminability effects showed that abstract quantitative features were stronger predictors of accuracy on both tasks than low-level visual similarity, reflecting abstract processing of both tasks. Cross-lagged analyses revealed that learning in the geometry task significantly predicted future gains in numerosity performance, even after controlling session-level trends, within-task stability, and general performance factors. Together, these findings provide evidence that spatial and numerical learning in primates rely on mutual cognitive processes. Such representations could form the evolutionary foundation for the well-documented “cognitive bridge” between numerical and spatial reasoning in human development.",

A suitable model organism to study the formation and expansion of an ECM during ontogenesis is the multicellular green alga Volvox carteri , which, along with the related volvocine algae, produces a complex, self-organized ECM composed of multiple substructures. These self-assembled structures primarily consist of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, a major component of which is pherophorins. To investigate the geometry of the growing ECM, we fused the yfp gene with the gene for pherophorin II (PhII) in V. carteri . Confocal microscopy reveals PhII:YFP localization at key ECM structures, including the boundaries of compartments surrounding each somatic cell and the outer surface of the organism. Image analysis during the life cycle allows the stochastic geometry of growing compartments to be quantified; their areas and aspect ratios exhibit robust gamma distributions and exhibit a structural transition from a tight polygonal to a looser acircular packing geometry with stable eccentricity over time, evoking parallels and distinctions with the behavior of hydrated foams. These results provide quantitative insight into a general, open question in biology: how do cells collectively produce a complex structure external to themselves in a robust and accurate manner?",

While existing solutions work reasonably well for collimated light sources—lasers and optical fibers—analytical solutions for LEDs remain missing, despite the growing use of LEDs in wearable and implantable bioelectronics. We present a method to solve the diffusion theory and derive analytical solutions for two biomedically relevant configurations: 1) surface-mounted LEDs on semi-infinite media (e.g., wearable devices) and 2) embedded LEDs in infinite media (e.g., implantable devices). Beyond a distance of 4 times the scattering length of the medium to the LED source, our analytical solutions are reasonably accurate, within 6% error for 1) and 3% for 2). This represents significant improvements over existing analytical solutions, characterized by 26% and 15% error, respectively. Using our analytical solutions, we derive tissue optical properties ( μ a and μ s ′ ) from diffuse reflectance results with &lt;7% error, and we determine the irradiance threshold for photostimulation, aligned with experimental optogenetic activation data. Our analytical solutions are readily adaptable to various biomedical applications, offering a rigorous theoretical foundation for next-generation LED-based bioelectronics, to enable more accurate optical diagnostics and therapies in clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "F 1 -ATPase comprises the stator ring consisting of α 3 β 3 subunits and the rotor γ subunit. The γ subunit rotation mechanism has been extensively investigated by biochemical analyses, structural studies, single-molecule measurements, and computational studies. Recent cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of F 1 -ATPase from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus PS3 (TF 1 ) provide us with further possibilities for a better understanding of the γ-rotation mechanisms. Using cryo-EM structures having the γ-rotation angles close to the binding dwell and catalytic dwell states, we investigate the relationships between the γ subunit rotation, conformational changes of the stator α 3 β 3 subunits, and the nucleotide-binding and release. We performed targeted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with external forces on the α 3 β 3 subunits and observed 80° substep rotations of the γ subunit. Then, we optimized the most probable transition pathway through the mean-force string method simulations with 64 images. Finally, using umbrella sampling, we calculated the potential of mean forces along the minimum free energy pathway during the 80° substep rotation. Our MD simulations suggest that 80° substep rotation is divided into the first rotation, resting, and the second rotation. Notably, the first rotation is driven by the distortion of the stator α 3 β 3 subunits, and the second rotation is induced mainly by direct β/γ subunit interactions. This model, which we call the distortion–push mechanism, is consistent with the residue-level experimental analysis on F 1 -ATPase and the atomic structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM.",

          "abstract": "Over 350 million metric tons of plastic waste are generated annually, with most ending up in landfills, dumps, or the environment, posing significant risks. Mechanical recycling remains underutilized, largely due to the high variability in the mechanical properties of recycled plastics (recyclates). This variability undermines performance reliability and hinders the adoption of recyclates in demanding industrial applications. Inspired by natural materials, known for their mechanical robustness despite microstructural stochasticity, we propose a universal, chemistry-agnostic, brick-and-mortar design tailored for recycled polymers. In this design, stiff recycled plastic platelets (bricks) are embedded in a soft virgin polymer matrix (mortar), which accommodates deformation and redistributes stress. To predict the effective modulus, strength, and property variability of such structures, we developed an uncertainty-aware tension-shear-chain model, combining Monte Carlo simulations with literature-based distributions of recyclates’ stiffness and conservative interfacial parameter stochasticity assumptions. We validated our model using nacre-inspired composites fabricated from recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) platelets and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mortar. The experimental results matched model predictions, confirming significant suppression of variability. In a case study on industrial HDPE stretch film, our design reduced modulus variability by up to 93% and maximum permissible strain variability by at least 68% compared to input rHDPE, while matching the modulus of virgin HDPE film. This work introduces a design-enabled variability-suppression strategy for recycled plastics, able to transform highly heterogenous materials into structurally robust products. By supporting virgin-plastic substitution and circular design strategies, our approach can enable the broader adoption of recyclates by several industries.",

          "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) persistently threaten wild waterfowl, domestic poultry, and public health. The East Asian–Australasian Flyway plays a crucial role in HPAIV dynamics due to its large populations of migratory waterfowl and poultry. Over recent decades, this flyway has undergone substantial landscape changes, including both losses and gains of waterfowl habitats. These changes can affect waterfowl distributions, increase contact with poultry, and consequently alter ecological conditions that favor avian influenza virus (AIV) evolution. However, limited research has assessed these likely impacts. Here, we integrated empirical data and an individual-based model to simulate AIV transmission in migratory waterfowl and domestic poultry, including wild-to-poultry spillover and reassortment dynamics in poultry, across landscapes representing the years 2000 and 2015. We used the reassortment incidence as a proxy for ecological and transmission conditions that support viral diversification and the emergence of novel subtypes. Our simulations show that landscape change reshaped the waterfowl distribution, facilitated bird aggregation at improved habitats, increased coinfection, and raised reassortment rate by 1,593%, indicating a substantially higher potential for viral diversification and emergence. Model-generated risk maps show expanded and increased reassortment risk in southeastern China, the Yellow River Basin, and northeastern China. These findings suggest the importance of landscape change as a driver of potential AIV diversification and subtype emergence. This underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate landscape dynamics, host movement, and viral evolution to better assess and mitigate future risk.",

          "abstract": "Type I interferon IFNβ is a key immune response cytokine, and when its expression is dysregulated, it causes disease. The regulation of IFNβ enhancer has been a touchpoint of mammalian gene control research since the discovery of functional synergy between two stimulus-responsive transcription factors (TFs), nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRF). However, subsequent gene knockout studies revealed that in some conditions either NFκB or IRF activation can be dispensable, leaving the precise regulatory logic of IFNβ transcription an open question. Here, we developed a series of quantitative enhancer states models of IFNβ expression control and evaluated them with stimulus–response data from TF knockouts. Of these, our analysis reveals that two modes of TF synergy account for the available data and neither is based on binding cooperativity. The first involves two adjacent IRF dimers, with a sigmoidal binding curve at the distal site rendering it ultrasensitive and restricting it to conditions of high IRF activity upon viral infection. The second is driven by the proximal site, which has high affinity and synergizes with NFκB to enable about half-maximal expression in response to bacterial exposure. Its accessibility is controlled by the competitive repressor p50:p50, which prevents basal IRF from binding, such that NFκB-only stimuli do not induce IFNβ expression and may allow for prior-exposure-dependent tuning. The model explains how the regulatory logic of the IFNβ enhancer ensures invariant IFNβ expression in response to viral exposure, while providing tunable, context-dependent expression in response to bacterial exposure.",

A major conservation priority is to identify the mechanisms and extent of inbreeding depression in small populations. The eastern massasauga ( Sistrurus catenatus ) rattlesnake is listed as Federally Threatened in the United States, having experienced significant habitat fragmentation and concomitant population declines over the past 200 years. Here, we use long-term monitoring of two wild populations of eastern massasaugas in Michigan to estimate the extent of inbreeding in each population, identify mechanisms that generate inbreeding, and test for the impact of inbreeding on fitness. Using targeted genomic data and spatial coordinates of capture locations from over 1000 individuals, we find evidence of inbreeding and link inbreeding to spatial kinship structure within populations, possibly driven by limited dispersal. We reconstruct multigenerational pedigrees for each population to measure reproductive output and use long-term capture–recapture data to estimate individual survival (i.e., the two major components of fitness). We find evidence of inbreeding depression in both fitness metrics. The 5% most inbred individuals are 13.5% less likely to have any surviving offspring and have 11.6% lower annual survival compared to all less inbred individuals. By combining genomics and long-term monitoring data, we are able to link the life history of eastern massasaugas to inbreeding and detect relationships between fitness and inbreeding. These insights provide important conservation context for future management and for understanding how spatial structure can generate inbreeding depression even at fine spatial scales.",

          "abstract": "The KRAS oncogene has been associated with many types of cancer, including pancreatic, lung, and colorectal. For decades, its gene products were thought to be undruggable. However, during the last decade, a large battery of KRAS inhibitors selective against specific mutations (KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D ), panKRAS inhibitors active against all KRAS isoforms, or even panRAS inhibitors, capable of inhibiting the three members of the RAS family, have been developed. In mice, the Kras locus is essential for embryonic development and can sustain adult homeostasis in the absence of Hras and Nras expression. Thus, we considered of interest to interrogate the role of the Kras locus in an experimental system to generate potentially relevant information regarding the use of panKRAS or panRAS inhibitors in the clinic. Here, we report that systemic ablation of Kras expression in adult mice does not induce significant changes in overall survival, body weight, glucose levels, metabolic profile, or heart function. In contrast, flow cytometry and histopathological analyses of organs such as blood, bone marrow, and spleen showed a significant increase of the myeloid lineage leading to myelomonocytic metaplasia. In this context, replacement of the KRAS isoforms by HRAS is sufficient to maintain adult homeostasis, suggesting that the unique properties of the Kras locus are primarily due to its pattern of expression rather than to the activity of its gene products.",

          "abstract": "Urbanization influences regional climates and extreme weather. While previous research has documented urban-induced precipitation for specific cities or storm cases, diurnal urban precipitation anomalies across different landscapes remain poorly understood. Analyzing diurnal and seasonal variations of urban precipitation anomalies across 175 US cities, we found strong urban effects on precipitation especially during summer afternoons. Large, inland cities can receive 10% more summer afternoon rainfall, and the pattern varies with urban heat islands and wind conditions. Coastal cities, under the influence of sea-land breeze, experience three times amplified daily urban precipitation enhancements than inland cities. Urban impacts are also noted for mountain cities, affecting their topography-dominated precipitation patterns. With increasing thresholds of extreme precipitation, most US cities experience more intense rainfall compared to their rural backgrounds. This study enhances our understanding of hitherto poorly documented diurnal aspects of urban rainfall through geographically distributed, landscape-specific rainfall anomalies.",

          "abstract": "Shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) commonly occurs in plants sensing shading and the proximity of neighbors, leading to morphological and physiological changes that are detrimental to plant health and consequently crop yield. Controlling SAS could be beneficial for sustainable agriculture. Here, we performed a phenotype-based chemical screening in Arabidopsis and identified pifithrin-α (PFT-α) as a compound that suppresses shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and gene expression. Through genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches, we demonstrated that PFT-α mimics ethylene by deactivating the ethylene receptor 1 (ETR1). Accumulated ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) influences the expression of phytochrome-interacting factors ( PIF4 and PIF7 ) and subsequently inhibits shade-induced hypocotyl elongation. Our findings not only provide molecular insights into SAS but also suggest that PFT-α, acting as a potent ethylene mimic, plays a crucial role in hormone-regulated plant development and holds potential for modulating SAS in agricultural practices.",

Loss of CDKN2A or P53 following NF1 disruption is a key event in MPNST development. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 somatic tumorigenesis in mice to identify transcriptomic and metabolomic features distinguishing CDKN2A - versus P53 -deleted MPNSTs. Convergent, multiomic analyses revealed that CDKN2A -deleted MPNSTs are especially dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and NADPH metabolism for growth and viability. Disruption of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the PPP rate-limiting enzyme, slowed CDKN2A -deleted MPNST growth and sensitized MPNSTs to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Knockdown of the redox-regulated transcription factor NRF2 slowed MPNST growth and decreased G6PD transcription. Analysis of patient MPNSTs identified a NRF2 gene signature correlating with tumor transformation. Furthermore, G6PD and NRF2 expression in PanCancer TCGA samples correlates with patient survival. This work identifies NRF2-PPP dependency as a targetable vulnerability in these difficult-to-treat MPNSTs, particularly in the NF1/CDKN2A -deleted majority.",

Despite an understanding of contributions of oceanic moisture to terrestrial hydroclimatic extremes, whether surpluses of terrestrial water availability migrate directly and contiguously from the ocean and the influence of climate change on this process remain unclear. Here, we use a coherent feature-tracking method to identify ocean-to-land water availability surpluses (OWASs), characterized by spatiotemporally contiguous migration of excess atmospheric freshwater (precipitation-minus-evapotranspiration) from ocean to land. Over the past several decades, especially in northern mid-high latitudes (NMHL; above 48°N), OWASs have exhibited longer persistence, wider areal extent, and greater intensity than those developed solely over land. These landward migrations are associated with seasonal Atlantic teleconnection and Pacific circulation shift. Under the business-as-usual scenario, these two processes are projected to be enhanced, markedly increasing OWAS characteristics in NMHL driven by thermodynamic atmospheric responses to future warming. Intensified OWASs may not only help alleviate long-term droughts but also have the potential to accentuate pluvial risks.",

Complementarily, a soft gripper with a linear pressure-to-force response was engineered to enable stable and predictable force modulation. The flexible slip sensors were conformally integrated onto the grippers, forming a fully perceptive soft robotic system capable of detecting early-stage slippage and investigating interfacial frictional properties. This integration establishes a closed-loop sensorimotor framework that notably improves the reliability and adaptability of soft robotic grasping across a wide range of real-world applications.",

However, ranges of species in these regions are also distinctly more patchy and elongated than those found in adjacent lowlands. Our global analysis of mainland birds demonstrates that these range shapes augment the spatial variation in species richness. Both the linearity and patchiness of species ranges are most pronounced in aseasonal and topographically complex regions, most notably in the tropical Andes, where these range shapes contribute more to the pattern of species richness than broad-scale variations in range size. Consequently, niche-based processes that govern the spatial configuration of habitats contribute to patterns of species richness in global hotspots over and above the processes that affect species richness through range sizes.",

Here, we establish a framework for the topological classification of driven-dissipative nonlinear systems by defining a graph index for their Floquet semiclassical equations of motion. Our index builds upon the topology of vector flows and encodes the particle-hole nature of excitations around all out-of-equilibrium stationary states. Thus, we uncover the topology of nonlinear resonator’s dynamics under external and parametric forcing. Our framework sheds light on the topology of driven-dissipative phases, including under- to overdamped responses and symmetry-broken phases linked to population inversion.

Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of DAH using the chromosomal-level genome of Menispermum canadense .

Structural modeling, molecular dynamics, and site-directed mutagenesis identify mutations enabling the catalytic switch from FLS to DAH.

          "abstract": "Mechanoimmunology explores how mechanical forces orchestrate immune responses, offering insights into immune cell functions and the mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction. A critical challenge in this field is the absence of reliable platforms that apply precise, consistent mechanical stimuli to individual cells while enabling reproducible immune activation. Here, we present a nanoscale acoustic oscillator for mechanoimmunology applications: NAOMI. NAOMI features micropatterned pillars that support uniform cell monolayer formation with an integrated acoustic transducer that delivers highly controlled 3D nanoscale oscillations (±1-nanometer deviation) for up to 72 hours. Unlike conventional passive platforms relying on static stiffness or surface topography, NAOMI enables dynamic, programmable stimulation with high precision and reproducibility. Validation studies demonstrate that NAOMI notably enhances mechanical stress intensity and cell displacement, driving robust M1 polarization in macrophages. NAOMI provides a practical and versatile platform for studying mechanoimmunology, offering high precision, stability, and tunability. Its capabilities also position it well to support future research and drive innovative discoveries in the field.",

We report the discovery by International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) deep drilling of a 200-meter-thick ash megabed buried in rift basins of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. The &gt;73–cubic kilometer ash deposit originates from the Kos Plateau Tuff caldera-forming eruption, which occurred 161 thousand years ago, &gt;120 kilometers to the east. The ash forms a chemically uniform, graded megabed lacking bioturbation, interpreted as having been emplaced by a stream of eruption-fed turbidity currents. Bioclastic debris within the ash provides evidence of widespread destruction of marine ecosystems. Large volcanic eruptions can remodel the seafloor landscape, deposit thick ash turbidites, and destroy marine biota on island arc–wide scales in short-lived, catastrophic events.",

          "abstract": "Exploring the biodiversity hidden in tropical rainforests canopies represents a major frontier in biodiversity research yet remains challenging. Environmental DNA (eDNA) can revolutionize this field as it did already in various ecosystems. Here, we test the hypothesis that eDNA contained in canopy throughfall could be used to monitor this elusive diversity and detect anthropogenic disturbance. Using custom-made, low-cost rain collectors, we sampled rainwash eDNA in a mature Amazonian forest and a nearby tree plantation. We successfully detected eDNA from tropical woody and epiphyte plants, vertebrates (mammals, birds, and amphibians), and insects (e.g., mosquitoes, ants, and beetles). The taxonomic composition and diversity reflected disturbance, with significantly lower diversity in the plantation. Crucially, rainwash eDNA integrated biodiversity over a 10-day period in passive collectors and provided a local signature. This approach has thus potential for establishing a cost-effective monitoring system for tropical moist forest canopies, applicable in impact assessments and sustainable management.",

ORCA-DL accurately simulates the three-dimensional structure of global ocean dynamics with high physical consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art numerical models in capturing extreme events, including El Niño–Southern Oscillation and upper ocean heat waves. Moreover, ORCA-DL stably emulates ocean dynamics at decadal timescales, demonstrating its potential even for skillful decadal predictions and climate projections.

          "abstract": "Columns are the morphological and functional units containing multiple neurons in the brain. The molecular mechanisms of column formation are largely unknown. Ephrin/Eph signaling mediates a variety of developmental processes. Ephrin acts as a ligand for Eph to regulate forward signaling, whereas Eph acts as a ligand for Ephrin to regulate reverse signaling. However, whether and how the uni- or bidirectional Ephrin/Eph signaling is involved in column formation remains elusive. In this study, we show that Ephrin and Eph regulate the morphology and location of columnar neurons through bidirectional repulsive signaling. Furthermore, Eph ligand triggers cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphorylation of Ephrin under the control of Src kinases and Fasciclin 2 (Fas2), forming the Ephrin/Src/Fas2 complex to promote reverse signaling through a downstream regulator, Rac1. This study provides the detailed analysis of the molecular interactions involved in column formation using the fly brain as a model.",

Their continuous insertion in the plasma membrane is balanced by constitutive and activity-dependent internalization, which is orchestrated by adaptor proteins recognizing semispecific motifs within the receptors’ intracellular regions. Here, we describe a complementary trafficking mechanism for G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that is evolutionary conserved and refined. This mechanism relies on the insertion of their amphipathic helix 8 into the inner leaflet of lipid membranes, orthogonal to the transmembrane helices. These amphipathic helices dictate subcellular localization of the receptors and autonomously drive their endocytosis by cooperative assembly and association with areas of high membrane curvature. The strength of helix 8 membrane insertion propensity quantitatively predicts the rate of constitutive internalization of GPCRs. This discovery advances our understanding of membrane protein trafficking and highlights a principle of receptor-lipid interactions that may have broad implications for cellular signaling and therapeutic targeting.",

Here, we demonstrate that this effect is accompanied by reduction of cerebral edema, attenuated astrocyte dysfunction, and a shift in serum protein composition toward an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective state. DMT restored tight junction integrity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function in vitro and in vivo. DMT suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in brain endothelial cells and peripheral immune cells and reduced microglial activation via the sigma-1 receptor. Our findings prove that DMT mitigates a poststroke effect by stabilizing the BBB and reducing neuroinflammation. Such interactions of DMT with the vascular and immune systems can be leveraged to complement current, insufficient, stroke therapy.",

The cortex-wide patterns of these features were highly reproducible and related to the anatomical hierarchy of cortical areas. We found similar changes in these patterns for individuals with a first episode of psychosis and those at clinical high risk for psychosis. Maps of psychosis-induced changes in dynamics resembled the maps of GABA-A receptor densities and of pharmacological GABA-A or NMDA manipulation effects on cortical dynamics in healthy participants. The level of pattern similarity to GABA-A manipulation effects in individual patients correlated with positive symptoms, while the pattern similarity to NMDA effects correlated with negative symptoms.

The AC-GNS platform delivered exceptional photostability and thermal resilience beyond those of conventional nanoparticles while serving as a high-performance contrast agent for PACT and a photothermal transducer for PTT. Integrating AC-GNS–mediated PTT with noninvasive PACT enabled whole-body nanoparticle tracking, PTT treatment monitoring via thermal imaging, and thermal dose determination, culminating in a 100% survival rate in a murine bladder cancer model without long-term treatment-related toxicity.

Using process-explicit models of likely climate-human- Rangifer interactions and inferences of demographic change from radiocarbon-dated fossils and ancient DNA, we reconstruct and decipher 21,000 years of Rangifer population dynamics. These high-resolution population reconstructions pinpoint ecological characteristics and life-history traits that most likely enabled Rangifer to survive rapid warming events following the Last Glacial Maximum. Projecting these process-driven models into the future reveals that these attributes are unlikely to buffer Rangifer against wide-scale population declines from expected 21st Century climatic warming. Our findings highlight a need to boost investments in the management and conservation of Rangifer , particularly in North America, where projected losses are expected to exceed 80%. This will not only support the survival of the species and the vital services it renders in Arctic ecosystems, but also help sustain the socioeconomic, cultural, and emotional well-being of many Rangifer -dependent communities.",

We use relocated aftershocks, geodetic measurements, and seismic waveform data to distinguish contributions from closely separated fault structures of the 2024 M w 7.5 Noto earthquake. We find that the initial rupture triggered slip on a complex fault of a preceding swarm and led to bilateral slow rupture there. The earthquake ruptured two fault segments with contrasting dip angles along the eastern and western segments. Aftershocks continued to rupture the preexisting swarm faults. A delayed rupture occurred southwest of the hypocenter, implying that substantial resistance caused by a barrier temporally hindered rupture propagation. Additional stress from surrounding slip eventually overcame the strength of the barrier fault section, leading to a compound rupture. The mainshock triggered a small earthquake swarm, in which the relatively larger events were not followed by abundant aftershocks.

We analyzed Inka khipu, KH0631, whose primary cord is composed of human hair. Historically, human hair on a khipu served as a “signature” to indicate the khipu’s creator. Recent advances in elemental analysis–isotope ratio mass spectrometry allowed us to undertake simultaneous carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur measurements from a single KH0631 hair sample, revealing that this individual consumed a diet characteristic of low-ranking commoners.

While present in all mammals, HAR123 has rapidly evolved since humans diverged from chimpanzees. The human and chimpanzee HAR123 orthologs exhibit subtle differences in their neural developmental effects, and the human HAR123 ortholog uniquely regulates many genes involved in neural differentiation. We identified direct targets of the HAR123 enhancer and showed that HIC1 acts downstream of HAR123 to promote human NPC formation. HAR123-knockout mice exhibit a defect in cognitive flexibility and a shift in neural-glia ratio in specific regions of the hippocampus. Our study has implications for neurodevelopmental disorders, which are often accompanied by altered neural-glia ratio and have been linked with HARs.",
