          "abstract": "Widely used in research since the 1800s, SCR (also known as the galvanic skin response or electrodermal activity) measures changes in the electrical conductivity of the skin due to sweat gland activity. SCR has historically been considered a ‘gold standard’ for the objective biological measurement of fear and anxiety. However, myriad emotional, cognitive and physical factors can influence sweating and thereby SCR magnitude, which demonstrates it indexes general arousal. Individuals may exhibit increased SCR when stressed (for example, being deceptive or simply attempting to understand a difficult question) or for reasons unrelated to stress (for example, positive emotions such as happiness or non-emotional processes such as focusing attention4). As such, SCR has inherently poor specificity and discriminant validity as a measure of anxiety5.\n\nSince the 1920s, SCR has been a major component of polygraph testing, which has entrenched it in the criminal legal system4. Currently, polygraph examinations remain controversial owing to concerns about reliability and validity. Although judges have substantial discretion over whether polygraph results can be presented to the jury6, about half of US states still allow polygraph evidence with stipulated agreement by both the defence and prosecution before administering the test. Furthermore, polygraph examinations are also widely accepted as evidence in criminal cases across Europe, in civil cases in China and for all cases in Colombia6. Polygraphs are also used at earlier stages of law enforcement to verify witness statements and to justify further interrogation of suspects6, and at later stages to track progress under court supervision (for example, monitoring of individuals convicted of a sexual offence).",

          "abstract": "Depression represents a significant global public health challenge, and marital status has been recognized as a potential risk factor. However, previous investigations of this association have primarily focused on Western samples with substantial heterogeneity. Our study aimed to examine the association between marital status and depressive symptoms across countries with diverse cultural backgrounds using a large-scale, two-stage, cross-country analysis. We used nationally representative, de-identified individual-level data from seven countries, including the USA, the UK, Mexico, Ireland, Korea, China and Indonesia (106,556 cross-sectional and 20,865 longitudinal participants), representing approximately 541 million adults. The follow-up duration ranged from 4 to 18 years. Our analysis revealed that unmarried individuals had a higher risk of depressive symptoms than their married counterparts across all countries (pooled odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.61–2.14). However, the magnitude of this risk was influenced by country, sex and education level, with greater risk in Western versus Eastern countries (β = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16–0.56; P < 0.001), among males versus females (β = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.003–0.47; P = 0.047) and among those with higher versus lower educational attainment (β2 = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.11–0.56; P = 0.003). Furthermore, alcohol drinking causally mediated increased later depressive symptom risk among widowed, divorced/separated and single Chinese, Korean and Mexican participants (all P < 0.001). Similarly, smoking was as identified as a causal mediator among single individuals in China and Mexico, and the results remained unchanged in the bootstrap resampling validation and the sensitivity analyses. Our cross-country analysis suggests that unmarried individuals may be at greater risk of depression, and any efforts to mitigate this risk should consider the roles of cultural context, sex, educational attainment and substance use.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation is a major focus of intervention efforts. Psychological inoculation—an intervention intended to help people identify manipulation techniques—is being adopted at scale around the globe. Yet the efficacy of this approach for increasing belief accuracy remains unclear, as prior work uses synthetic materials that do not contain claims of truth. To address this issue, we conducted five studies with 7,286 online participants using a set of news headlines based on real-world true/false content in which we systematically varied the presence or absence of emotional manipulation. Although an emotional manipulation inoculation did help participants identify emotional manipulation, there was no improvement in participants’ ability to tell truth from falsehood. However, when the inoculation was paired with an intervention that draws people’s attention to accuracy, the combined intervention did successfully improve truth discernment (by increasing belief in true content). These results provide evidence for synergy between popular misinformation interventions.",

          "abstract": "Movies are a massively popular and influential form of media, but their computational study at scale has largely been off-limits to researchers in the United States due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In this work, we illustrate use of a new regulatory framework to enable computational research on film that permits circumvention of technological protection measures on digital video discs (DVDs). We use this exemption to legally digitize a collection of 2,307 films representing the top 50 movies by U.S. box office over the period 1980 to 2022, along with award nominees. We design a computational pipeline for measuring the representation of gender and race/ethnicity in film, drawing on computer vision models for recognizing actors and human perceptions of gender and race/ethnicity. Doing so allows us to learn substantive facts about representation and diversity in Hollywood over this period, confirming earlier studies that see an increase in diversity over the past decade, while allowing us to use computational methods to uncover a range of ad hoc analytical findings. Our work illustrates the affordances of the data-driven analysis of film at a large scale.",

          "abstract": "While female education has long been recognized as a key driver of fertility decline during the process of demographic transition and most population projection models consider it implicitly or explicitly in their forecasts of overall fertility, there still is need for a method to forecast education-specific fertility trends directly. Here we propose a method for projecting education-specific fertility declines for cohorts of women in Sub-Saharan Africa based on all available demographic and health surveys data for African countries (including 1.03Mio cases). We study at different levels of aggregation (sample clusters, strata, and national) the associations between ideal family size and completed cohort fertility for education groups, on the one hand, and the average level of education in those units, on the other. The consistently very strong empirical associations suggest a plausible narrative by which a higher prevalence of educated women in a spatial unit influences the fertility levels of women in all specific education categories. Empirical associations between education-specific cohort fertility trends at the national level and newly available quality-adjusted human capital data for these cohorts are then operationalized to produce education-specific population projections as they are needed for—among other uses—the shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios that are widely used in the climate change research community. Sensitivity analyses including out-of-sample projections support the validity of the proposed method which is then applied to 37 African countries.",

But how well these factors are managed within and between firms may be a key determinant of a country’s productivity and its GDP. Although social scientists have long studied the role of management practices in shaping business performance, their primary tool has been individual case studies. While useful for theory-building, such qualitative work is hard to scale and quantify. We present a large, scalable dataset measuring structured management practices at the business level across multiple countries. We measure practices related to performance monitoring, target-setting, and human resources. We document a set of key stylized facts, which we label “the international empirics of management”. In all countries, firms with more structured practices tend to also have superior economic performance: they are larger in scale, are more profitable, have higher labor productivity and are more likely to export. This consistency was not obvious ex-ante, and being able to quantify these relationships is valuable. We also document significant variation in practices across and within countries, which is important in explaining differences in the wealth of nations. The positive relationship between firm size and structured management practices is stronger in countries with more open and free markets, suggesting that stronger competition may allow firms with more structured management practices to grow larger, thereby potentially raising aggregate national income.",

We propose that exposure to a stereotype, regardless of whether one agrees with it, can shape how one experiences and learns from interactions with members of the stereotyped group, such that it induces individual-level prejudice—a process involving the interplay of semantic knowledge and instrumental learning. In a series of experiments, participants interacted with players from two groups, described with either positive or negative stereotypes, in a reinforcement learning (RL) task presented as a money-sharing game. Although players’ actual sharing rates were equated between groups, participants formed more positive reward associations with players from positively stereotyped than negatively stereotyped groups. This effect persisted even when stereotypes were described as unreliable and participants were instructed to ignore them. Computational modeling revealed that this preference was due to stereotype effects on priors regarding group members’ behavior as well as the learning rates through which reward associations were updated in response to player feedback. We then show that these stereotype-induced preferences, once formed, spread unwittingly to others who observe these interactions, illustrating a pathway through which stereotypes may be transmitted and propagated between society and individuals. By identifying a mechanism through which stereotype knowledge can bypass explicit beliefs to induce prejudice, via the interplay of semantic and instrumental learning processes, these findings illuminate the impact of stereotype messages on the formation and propagation of individual-level prejudice.",

          "abstract": "As the world’s climate continues to change, human populations are exposed to increasingly severe and extreme weather conditions that can promote migration. Here, we examine how extreme weather influences the likelihood of undocumented migration and return between Mexico and the United States. We used data from 48,313 individuals observed between 1992 and 2018 in 84 Mexican agricultural communities. While controlling for regional and temporal confounding factors, we related individual decisions to migrate to the United States without documents and subsequently return to Mexico with lagged weather deviations from the historical norm during the corn-growing season (May to August). Undocumented migration was most likely from areas experiencing extreme drought, and migrants were less likely to return to their communities of origin when extreme weather persisted. These findings establish the role of weather shocks in undocumented Mexican migration to, and eventual settlement in, the United States. The findings also suggest that extreme weather conditions, which are likely to increase with climate change, promote clandestine mobility across borders and, thus, expose migrants to risks associated with crossing dangerous terrain and relying upon smugglers.",

          "abstract": "The “27 Club” refers to the widespread legend that notable people, particularly musicians, are unusually likely to die at age 27. A 2011 inquiry in The BMJ showed this is not the case, dismissing the 27 Club as a myth. We expand on this discourse by demonstrating that although the existence of the phenomenon cannot be empirically validated, it is real in its consequences. Using Wikipedia data, we show that while age 27 does not hold greater risk of mortality for notable persons, those who died at 27 are as a group exceptionally notable compared to those who died at other young ages. The 27 Club legend originated from a statistically improbable event circa 1970, wherein four superstar musicians died within the span of 2 y all at age 27. This coincidence captured the public imagination such that our fascination with the 27 Club brought itself into being, producing greater interest in those who died at age 27 than would have been otherwise. This demonstrates path dependence in cultural evolution, whereby an effectively random event evolves into a narrative that shapes otherwise unrelated events and thus the way we make and interpret history.",

          "abstract": "The precise control of flowering time is of utmost importance for crop adaptation to varying environmental conditions and consequently determines grain yield and plant fitness. Soybean E2 , the homolog of Arabidopsis GIGANTEA , is a major locus contributing to high-latitude adaptation and is involved in photoperiod sensitivity. However, due to major effects of E2 , additional genetic loci controlling soybean flowering and adaptation have historically been masked and difficult to identify. Here, by eliminating the effect of E2 , we identified a Tof9 locus controlling flowering in which ZEITLUPE 2 ( ZTL2 ) is the causal gene. ZTL2 encodes an F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase with homology to Arabidopsis ZEITLUPE and is shown to play a key role in the soybean photoperiodic flowering pathway. ZTL2 physically interacts with E2 to mediate its degradation. Intriguingly, ZTL2 and FKF1, both belong to the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase family, exhibit opposite roles in regulating soybean flowering. ZTL2 degrades E2, leading to early flowering, while FKF1 stabilizes E2, resulting in delayed flowering. The balance between ZTL2-mediated degradation and FKF1-mediated stabilization enables soybeans to finetune flowering time and maximize grain yield. Field-grown ztl2 mutants are taller, flower late, and have increased yield parameters. ZTL2 and FKF1b bear contrasting artificial-selection patterns to adapt to different latitudes. This antagonistic regulation is crucial for soybean adaptation to diverse ecological settings and allows plants to fine-tune their flowering time in response to photoperiod and latitudinal changes.",

          "abstract": "The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photodamage and photobleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photodamage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling nondestructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photodamage and photobleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for an era of research and clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "Attraction and mating between male and female animals depend on effective communication between conspecifics. However, in mosquitoes, we have only a rudimentary understanding of the sensory cues and receptors critical for the communication that is essential for reproductive behavior. While it is known that male Aedes aegypti use sound to help them identify females, it is not unclear whether sound detection is absolutely required since other cues such as vision may also participate in mating behavior. To determine the effect of eliminating hearing on mating success, we knocked out the Ae. aegypti TRPVa channel, which is a protein expressed in chordotonal neurons in the Johnston’s organ (JO) that respond to sound-induced movements in the antenna. Loss of trpVa eradicated sound-induced responses from the JO, thereby abolishing hearing. Strikingly, mutation of trpVa eliminated mating behavior in males. In contrast, trpVa -null females mated, although this behavior was slightly delayed relative to wild-type females. Males and females produce sounds as they beat their wings at distinct frequencies during flight. Sound mimicking the female wingbeat induced flight, attraction, and copulatory-like behavior in wild-type males without females present, but not in trpVa -null males. Males are known to modulate their wingbeat frequencies before mating in the air, which is a phenomenon referred to as rapid frequency modulation (RFM). We found that RFM was absent in mosquitoes lacking TRPVa. We conclude that the requirement for trpVa and hearing for male reproductive behavior in Aedes is absolute, as mating in the deaf males is eliminated.",

ALKBH8 is a tRNA-modifying enzyme that methylates wobble uridines in a subset of tRNAs to modulate translation.

Pathogenic variants in ALKBH8 have been linked to intellectual disability disorders in the human population, but the role of ALKBH8 in the nervous system is unknown. Through in vivo studies in Drosophila , we show that ALKBH8 controls oxidative stress in the brain to restrain synaptic growth and support learning and memory. ALKBH8 null animals lack wobble uridine methylation and exhibit reduced protein synthesis in the nervous system, including a specific decrease in selenoprotein levels. Either loss of ALKBH8 or independent disruption of selenoprotein synthesis results in ectopic synapse formation. Genetic expression of antioxidant enzymes fully suppresses synaptic overgrowth in ALKBH8 null animals, confirming oxidative stress as the underlying cause of dysregulation. ALKBH8 null animals also exhibit associative memory impairments that are reversed by pharmacological antioxidant treatment. Together, these findings demonstrate the critical role of tRNA wobble uridine modification in redox homeostasis in the developing nervous system and reveal antioxidants as a potential therapy for ALKBH8-associated intellectual disability.",

Methionine oxidation can result in structural damage or be the basis of functional regulation of enzymes. In addition to participating in redox reactions, methionines play an important role as the initiator residue of translated proteins where they are commonly modified at their α-amine group by formylation or acetylation. Here, we investigated how formylation and acetylation of initiator methionines impact their propensity for oxidation and reduction. We show that in vitro, N-terminal methionine residues are particularly prone to chemical oxidation and that their modification by formylation or acetylation greatly enhances their subsequent enzymatic reduction by MsrA and MsrB. Concordantly, in vivo ablation of methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTF) in Escherichia coli increases the prevalence of oxidized methionines within synthesized proteins. We show that oxidation of formylated initiator methionines is detrimental in part because it obstructs their ensuing deformylation by peptide deformylase (PDF) and hydrolysis by methionyl aminopeptidase (MAP). Thus, by facilitating their reduction, formylation mitigates the misprocessing of oxidized initiator methionines.",

Although KMDs have been found in diverse eukaryotes, only a limited number of them have been characterized at the molecular level, and their killing mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify that a gene previously deemed essential for cell survival in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a single-gene KMD. This gene, tdk1 , kills nearly all tdk1Δ progeny in a tdk1+ × tdk1Δ cross. By analyzing polymorphisms of tdk1 among natural strains, we identify a resistant haplotype, HT3. This haplotype lacks killing ability yet confers resistance to killing by the wild-type tdk1 . Proximity labeling experiments reveal an interaction between Tdk1, the protein product of tdk1 , and the epigenetic reader Bdf1. Interestingly, the nonkilling Tdk1-HT3 variant does not interact with Bdf1. Cryoelectron microscopy further elucidated the binding interface between Tdk1 and Bdf1, pinpointing mutations within Tdk1-HT3 that disrupt this interface. During sexual reproduction, Tdk1 forms stable Bdf1-binding nuclear foci in all spores after meiosis. These foci persist in germinated tdk1Δ progeny and impede chromosome segregation during mitosis by generating aberrant chromosomal adhesions. This study identifies a KMD that masquerades as an essential gene and reveals the molecular mechanism by which this KMD hijacks cellular machinery to execute killing. Additionally, we unveil that losing the hijacking ability is an evolutionary path for this single-gene KMD to evolve into a nonkilling resistant haplotype.",

          "abstract": "In sexual reproduction, selfish genetic elements known as killer meiotic drivers (KMDs) bias inheritance by eliminating gametes that do not carry them. The selective killing behavior of most KMDs can be explained by a toxin–antidote model, where a toxin harms all gametes while an antidote provides resistance to the toxin in carriers. This study investigates whether and how the KMD element tdk1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe deploys this strategy. Intriguingly, tdk1 relies on a single protein product, Tdk1, for both killing and resistance. We show that Tdk1 exists in a nontoxic tetrameric form during vegetative growth and meiosis but transforms into a distinct toxic form in spores. This toxic form acquires the ability to interact with the histone reader Bdf1 and assembles into supramolecular foci that disrupt mitosis in noncarriers after spore germination. In contrast, Tdk1 synthesized during germination of carrier spores is nontoxic and acts as an antidote, dismantling the preformed toxic Tdk1 assemblies. Replacement of the N-terminal region of Tdk1 with a tetramer-forming peptide reveals its dual roles in imposing an autoinhibited tetrameric conformation and facilitating the assembly of supramolecular foci when autoinhibition is released. Moreover, we successfully reconstituted a functional KMD element by combining a construct that exclusively expresses Tdk1 during meiosis (“toxin-only”) with another construct that expresses Tdk1 specifically during germination (“antidote-only”). This work uncovers a remarkable example of a single protein employing structural duality to form a toxin–antidote pair, expanding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying toxin–antidote systems.",

          "abstract": "Pastures, on which ruminant livestock graze, occupy one third of the earth’s surface. Removing livestock from pastures can support climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration in regrowing vegetation and recovering soils, particularly in potentially forested areas. However, this would also decrease food and fiber production, generating a tradeoff with pasture productivity and the ruminant meat production pastures support. We evaluate the magnitude and distribution of this tradeoff globally, called the “carbon opportunity intensity” of pastures, at a 5-arcminute resolution. We find that removing beef–producing cattle from high–carbon intensity pastures could sequester 34 (22 to 43) GtC i.e. 125 (80 to 158) GtCO 2 into ecosystems, which is an amount greater than global fossil CO 2 emissions from 2021–2023. This would lead to only a minor loss of 13 (9 to 18)% of the global total beef production on pastures, predominantly within high- and upper-middle-income countries. If areas with low–carbon intensity pastures and less efficient beef production simultaneously intensified their beef production to 47% of OECD levels, this could fully counterbalance the global loss of beef production. The carbon opportunity intensity can inform policy approaches to restore ecosystems while minimizing food losses. Future work should aim to provide higher-resolution estimates for use at local and farm scales, and to incorporate a wider set of environmental indicators of outcomes beyond carbon.",

          "abstract": "Fe–S clusters are essential cofactors involved in many reactions across all domains of life. Their biogenesis in Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria involves two machineries: Isc and Suf. Under conditions where cells operate with the Suf system, such as during oxidative stress or iron limitation, the entry of aminoglycosides is reduced, leading to resistance to these antibiotics. The transition between Isc and Suf machineries is controlled by the transcriptional regulator IscR. Here, we found that two small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), FnrS and OxyS, control iscR expression by base pairing to the 5′-UTR of the iscR mRNA. These sRNAs act in opposite ways and in opposite conditions: FnrS, expressed in anaerobiosis, represses the expression of iscR while OxyS, expressed during oxidative stress, activates it. Using an E. coli strain experiencing protracted oxidative stress, we further demonstrate that iscR expression is rapidly and significantly enhanced in the presence of OxyS. Consequently, we further show that OxyS induces resistance to aminoglycosides during oxidative stress through regulation of Fe–S cluster biogenesis, revealing a major role for this sRNA.",

This study revealed that foliar application of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs; 30 to 80 nm, 0.67 mg/d per plant, 6 d) to rice leaves under heatwave (HW) stress increased the grain yield and nutritional quality. Compared with the HW control, the HWs+ZnO group presented increases in the grain yield, grain protein content, and amino acid content of 22.1%, 11.8%, and 77.5%, respectively. Nanoscale ZnO aggregated on the leaf surface and interacted with leaf surface molecules. Compared with that at ambient temperature, HW treatment increased the dissolution of ZnO NPs on the leaf surface by 25.9% and facilitated their translocation to mesophyll cells. The Zn in the leaves existed as both ionic Zn and particulate ZnO. Compared with the HW control, foliar application of ZnO NPs under HW conditions increased leaf nutrient levels (Zn, Mn, Cu, Fe, and Mg) by 15.8 to 416.9%, the chlorophyll content by 22.2 to 24.8%, Rubisco enzyme activity by 21.2%, and antioxidant activity by 26.7 to 31.2%. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that ZnO NPs reversed HW-induced transcriptomic dysregulation, thereby enhancing leaf photosynthesis by 74.4%. Additionally, ZnO NPs increased the diversity, stability, and enrichment of beneficial microbial taxa and protected the phyllosphere microbial community from HW damage. This work elucidates how NPs interact with the phyllosphere, highlighting the potential of NPs to promote sustainable agriculture, especially under extreme climate events (e.g., HWs).",

Receptor signaling initiating the symbiotic pathway depends on the kinase activity of NFR1, while the signaling mechanism of the catalytically inactive NFR5 pseudokinase is unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure of the signaling-competent Lotus japonicus NFR5 intracellular domain, comprising the juxtamembrane region and pseudokinase domain. The juxtamembrane region is structurally well defined and forms two α-helices, αA and αA′, which contain an exposed hydrophobic motif. We demonstrate that this “juxtamembrane motif” promotes NFR5–NFR5 and NFR1–NFR5 interactions and is essential for symbiotic signaling. Conservation analysis reveals that the juxtamembrane motif is present throughout NFR5-type receptors and is required for symbiosis signaling from barley RLK10, suggesting a conserved and broader function for this motif in plant–microbe symbioses.",

The vast majority of these appear to be sporadic cases associated with small contamination episodes and do not trigger investigations. A “contamination episode” refers to one or more contamination events from a single source over a period of time. We examine clusters of sequenced clinical isolates of Salmonella , Escherichia coli , Campylobacter , and Listeria that differ by only a small number of mutations (SNPs) to identify features of the underlying contamination episodes. These analyses provide additional evidence that the youngest age groups have greater susceptibility to infection by Salmonella , E. coli , and Campylobacter than older age groups. This age bias is weaker for the common Salmonella serovar Enteritidis than Salmonella in general. A large fraction of the contamination episodes causing sickness appear to have a long duration. For example, 50% of the Salmonella cases are in clusters that persist for almost 3 y. For all four pathogen species, the majority of the cases were part of genetic clusters with illnesses in multiple states and likely to be caused by contaminated commercially distributed foods. Salmonella infections in infants under 3 mo are predominantly acquired from the same contaminated food, pet food, or environmental sources as older individuals, rather than infant formula contaminated during production.",

To decode key molecular and cellular processes that occur after ischemia, we performed spatial and single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the male mouse brain during the first week of injury. Cortical gene expression was severely disrupted, defined by inflammation and cell death in the lesion core, and glial scar formation orchestrated by multiple cell types on the periphery. The glial scar was identified as a zone with intense cell–cell communication, with prominent ApoE-Trem2 signaling pathway modulating microglial activation. For each of the three major glial populations, an inflammatory-responsive state, resembling the reactive states observed in neurodegenerative contexts, was observed. The recovered spectrum of ischemia-induced oligodendrocyte states supports the emerging hypothesis that oligodendrocytes actively respond to and modulate the neuroinflammatory stimulus. The findings are further supported by analysis of other spatial transcriptomic datasets from different mouse models of ischemic brain injury. Collectively, we present a landmark transcriptomic dataset accompanied by interactive visualization that provides a comprehensive view of spatiotemporal organization of processes in the postischemic mouse brain.",

          "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell communication process that enables bacteria to coordinate group behaviors. In Vibrio cholerae colonies, a program of spatial-temporal cell death is among the QS-controlled traits. Cell death occurs in two phases, first along the colony rim, and subsequently, at the colony center. Both cell death phases are driven by the type 6 secretion system (T6SS). Here, we show that HapR, the master QS regulator, does not control t6ss gene expression nor T6SS-mediated killing activity. Nonetheless, a Δ hapR strain displays no cell death at the colony rim. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses reveal that HapR activates expression of an operon containing four genes of unknown function, vca0646-0649. Epistasis and overexpression studies show that two of the genes, vca0646 and vca0647 , are required to drive cell death in both a Δ hapR and a Δ hapR Δ t6ss strain. Thus, vca0646 - 0649 are regulated by HapR but act independently of the T6SS machinery to cause cell death, suggesting that a second, parallel pathway to cell death exists in V. cholerae .",

Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the transition barrier vanishes at the transition temperature. The simulations further show that two low-frequency vibrational–librational modes are directly related to the order parameter that describes this phase transition, which is supported by experimental Raman spectroscopy studies.

Defrosting the planet would result in a plume of fresh glacial meltwater with a different chemical composition from underlying hypersaline seawater, generating both vertical and lateral salinity gradients. Here, we test the plumeworld hypothesis using lithium isotope compositions in the Ediacaran Doushantuo cap dolostone that accumulated in the aftermath of the Marinoan snowball Earth along a proximal–distal (nearshore–offshore) transect in South China. Our data show an overall decreasing δ 7 Li trend with distance from the shoreline, consistent with the variable mixing of a meltwater plume with high δ 7 Li (due to incongruent silicate weathering on the continent) and hypersaline seawater with low δ 7 Li (due to synglacial distillation). The evolution of low δ 7 Li of synglacial seawater, as opposed to the modern oceans with high δ 7 Li, was likely driven by weak continental chemical weathering coupled with strong reverse weathering on the seafloor underneath silica-rich oceans. The spatial pattern of δ 7 Li is also consistent with the development and then collapse of the meltwater plume that occurred at the time scale of cap dolostone accumulation. Therefore, the δ 7 Li data are consistent with the plumeworld hypothesis, considerably reduced chemical weathering on the continent during the Marinoan snowball Earth, and enhanced reverse weathering on the seafloor of Precambrian oceans.",

The fate of m 6 A-marked mRNA is uniquely diverse, ranging from degradation to stabilization/translation, which has been suggested to be largely dependent on its interaction with the family of YT521-B homology (YTH) domain-containing proteins. Here, we highlight a series of control levers that impinge on the RNA demethylases. We present evidence to indicate that intermediary metabolism and various posttranslation modifications modulate the activity, stability, and the subcellular localization of FTO and ALKBH5, further dispelling the notion that m 6 A methylation is not a dynamic process.

Investigating developmental differentiation is important for general biological understanding and has increasingly been explored for social phenotypes that diverge in parallel from similar genotypes. Here, we use Monomorium pharaonis ants to investigate the extent to which canalized worker development can be shifted toward gyne (virgin-queen) phenotypes by juvenile hormone (JH) treatment. We show that excess JH can activate gyne-biased development in workers so that wing-buds, ocelli, antennal and genital imaginal discs, flight muscles, and gyne-like fat bodies and brains emerge after pupation. However, ovary development remained unresponsive to JH treatment, indicating that JH-sensitive germline sequestration happens well before somatic differentiation. Our findings reveal important qualitative restrictions in the extent to which JH treatment can redirect larval development and that these constraints are independent of body size. Our findings corroborate that JH is a key hormone for inducing caste differentiation but show that this process can be asymmetric for higher colony-level germline versus somatic caste differentiation in superorganisms as defined a century ago by Wheeler. We quantified gene expression changes in response to JH treatment throughout development and identified a set of JH-sensitive genes responsible for the emergence of gyne-like somatic traits. Our study suggests that the gonadotropic role of JH in ovary maturation has shifted from the individual level in solitary insects to the colony level in an evolutionary-derived and highly polygynous superorganism like the pharaoh ant.",

Unphosphorylated CFTR engages PKA-C at two locations, establishing two “catalytic stations” near to, but not directly involving, the R domain.

Here, we describe in vitro characterization of the secretory function of pancreatic islets, derived from transgenic pigs expressing the GLP-1M3R cassette under the porcine insulin promoter (InsGLP-1M3R), and their usage to treat insulin-dependent diabetes in an immunodeficient mouse model. Our results show that InsGLP-1M3R islets isolated from neonatal and adult pigs secrete up to 15-fold more insulin in response to glucose stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) islets.

Moreover, m 5 C levels in this tRNA are significantly elevated under high reactive oxygen specieis (ROS) conditions in E. coli cells. We identified the known ribosomal RNA methyltransferase rsmF as the enzyme responsible for m 5 C synthesis in tRNA and enzyme transcript levels are responsive to elevated levels of ROS in the cell. We further find that changes in m 5 C levels in this tRNA are not specific to Fenton-like reaction conditions elevating ROS, but heat shock can also induce increased modification of tRNA Tyr-QUA-II.

We found that, in addition to the foramina Magendie and Luschka for CSF flow toward the subarachnoid space and glymphatic system, CSF outflow could also occur along periaxonal spaces (termed “PAS pathway”) from the spinal cord to peripheral organs, such as the liver and pancreas. When interrogating the latter route, we found that serotonin, acting through 5-HT 2B receptors expressed in ependymocytes that line the central canal, triggered Ca 2+ signals to induce polymerization of F-actin, a cytoskeletal protein, to reduce the volume of ependymal cells. This paralleled an increased rate of PAS-mediated CSF redistribution toward peripheral organs. In the liver, CSF was received by hepatic stellate cells. CSF efflux toward peripheral organs through the PAS pathway represents a mechanism dynamically connecting the nervous system with the periphery. Our findings are compatible with the traditional theory of CSF efflux into the glymphatic system to clear metabolic waste from the cerebral parenchyma.

          "abstract": "The relationship between neurons’ input and spiking output is central to brain computation. Studies in vitro and in anesthetized animals suggest that nonlinearities emerge in cells’ input–output (IO; activation) functions as network activity increases, yet how neurons transform inputs in vivo has been unclear. Here, we characterize cortical principal neurons’ activation functions in awake mice using two-photon optogenetics. We deliver fixed inputs at the soma while neurons’ activity varies with sensory stimuli. We find that responses to fixed optogenetic input are nearly unchanged as neurons are excited, reflecting a linear response regime above neurons’ resting point. In contrast, responses are dramatically attenuated by suppression. This attenuation is a powerful means to filter inputs arriving to suppressed cells, privileging other inputs arriving to excited neurons. These results have two major implications. First, somatic neural activation functions in vivo accord with the activation functions used in recent machine learning systems. Second, neurons’ IO functions can filter sensory inputs—not only do sensory stimuli change neurons’ spiking outputs, but these changes also affect responses to input, attenuating responses to some inputs while leaving others unchanged.",

We provide a unifying explanation of the origin of LMR by focusing on a common feature in their phase diagrams—proximity to symmetry-breaking orders. Specifically, we demonstrate via two microscopic models that LMR with a universal slope arises ubiquitously near ordered phases, provided the order parameter either i) has a finite wave-vector, or ii) has nodes on the Fermi surface. We elucidate the distinct physical mechanisms at play in these two scenarios and derive upper and lower bounds on the field range for which LMR is observed. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our picture to strange metal physics at higher temperatures and argue that our theory provides an understanding of recent experimental results on thin film cuprates and moiré materials.",

          "abstract": "High-resolution full waveform seismic tomography of the Earth’s mantle beneath the south and central Atlantic Ocean brings into focus a series of asthenospheric low shear velocity channels, or “fingers” on both sides of the southern and central mid-Atlantic ridge (MAR), elongated in the direction of absolute plate motion with a spacing of ∼ 1,800 to 2,000 km, and associated with bands of shallower residual seafloor depth anomalies that suggest channeled flow over thousands of kilometers. Each of the three most clearly resolved fingers on the African side of the MAR corresponds to a separate group of whole mantle plumes rooted in distinct patches at the core–mantle boundary, feeding hotspots, and volcanic lines with distinct isotopic signatures. Plumes of a given group appear to merge at the top of the lower mantle before separating again, suggesting interaction of deep mantle flow with a more vigorous mesoscale circulation in the upper mantle. The corresponding hotspots are generally offset from the location of the deep mantle plume roots. The distinct isotopic signatures of these hotspot groups are also detected in the mid-ocean ridge basalts at the location where the fingers meet the ridge. Meanwhile, at least some of the variability within each plume group could originate in the upper mantle and extended transition zone where plumes in a given group appear to merge and pond. This study also adds to mounting evidence that the African large low shear velocity province is not a uniform, unbroken pile of dense material rising high above the core–mantle boundary, but rather a collection of mantle plumes rooted in patches of distinct composition.",

Accordingly, the precise timing in the transcriptional activation of these genes may impact upon body length. Unlike other Hox clusters, HoxB lacks posterior genes between Hoxb9 and Hoxb13 , two genes separated by a ca. 70 kb large DNA segment containing a high number of CTCF sites, potentially isolating Hoxb13 from the rest of the cluster and thereby delaying its negative impact on trunk extension. We deleted the spacer DNA to induce a potential heterochronic gain of function of Hoxb13 at physiological concentration and observed a shortening of the tail as well as other abnormal phenotypes. These defects were all rescued by inactivating Hoxb13 in-cis with the deletion. A comparable gain of function was observed in mutant Embryonic Stem (ES) cells grown as pseudoembryos in vitro, which allowed us to examine in detail the importance of both the number and the orientation of CTCF sites in the insulating activity of the DNA spacer. A short cassette containing all the CTCF sites was sufficient to insulate Hoxb13 from the rest of HoxB , and additional modifications of this CTCF cassette showed that two CTCF sites in convergent orientations were already capable of importantly delaying Hoxb13 activation in these conditions. We discuss the relative importance of genomic distance versus number and orientation of CTCF sites in preventing Hoxb13 to be activated too early during trunk extension and hence to modulate tail length.",

          "abstract": "Carboxysomes are protein microcompartments found in cyanobacteria, whose shell encapsulates rubisco at the heart of carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle. Carboxysomes are thought to locally concentrate CO 2 in the shell interior to improve rubisco efficiency through selective metabolite permeability, creating a concentrated catalytic center. However, permeability coefficients have not previously been determined for these gases, or for Calvin-cycle intermediates such as bicarbonate ( HCO 3 − ), 3-phosphoglycerate, or ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Starting from a high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a synthetic β -carboxysome shell, we perform unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics to track metabolite permeability across the shell. The synthetic carboxysome shell structure, lacking the bacterial microcompartment trimer proteins and encapsulation peptides, is found to have similar permeability coefficients for multiple metabolites, and is not selectively permeable to HCO 3 − relative to CO 2 . To resolve how these comparable permeabilities can be reconciled with the clear role of the carboxysome in the CO 2 -concentrating mechanism in cyanobacteria, complementary atomic-resolution Brownian Dynamics simulations estimate the mean first passage time for CO 2 assimilation in a crowded model carboxysome. Despite a relatively high CO 2 permeability of approximately 10 −2 cm/s across the carboxysome shell, the shell proteins reflect enough CO 2 back toward rubisco that 2,650 CO 2 molecules can be fixed by rubisco for every 1 CO 2 molecule that escapes under typical conditions. The permeabilities determined from all-atom molecular simulation are key inputs into flux modeling, and the insight gained into carbon fixation can facilitate the engineering of carboxysomes and other bacterial microcompartments for multiple applications.",

          "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein to recognize and infect host cells by binding to the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 receptor is composed of peptidase domain (PD), collectrin-like domain, transmembrane domain, and short cytoplasmic domain, and may exist as a dimer on cell surface. The RBD binding site is located atop of the ACE2 PD, but the involvement of other domains in virus infection is uncertain. We found that the ACE2 PD alone, whether anchored to cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor or attached to another surface protein, is fully functional as a receptor for spike-mediated cell fusion and virus infection. However, for ACE2 to function as the viral receptor, the RBD binding site must be positioned in close proximity to the cell membrane. Elevating the surface height of ACE2 using long and rigid protein spacers reduces or eliminates cell fusion and virus infection. Moreover, we found that the RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies, nanobodies, and de novo designed miniprotein binders, when present on cell surface, also act as viral receptors, facilitating cell fusion and virus infection. Our data demonstrate that RBD binding and close membrane proximity are essential properties for a receptor to effectively mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, we show that soluble RBD-binders can be engineered to make cells either susceptible or resistant to virus infection, which has significant implications for antiviral therapy and various virus-mediated applications.",

          "abstract": "While hydrogen-rich materials have been demonstrated to exhibit high T c superconductivity at high pressures, there is an ongoing search for ternary, quaternary, and more chemically complex hydrides that achieve such high critical temperatures at much lower pressures. First-principles searches are impeded by the computational complexity of solving the Eliashberg equations for large, complex crystal structures. Here, we adopt a simplified approach using electronic indicators previously established to be correlated with superconductivity in hydrides. This is used to study complex hydride structures, which are predicted to exhibit promisingly high critical temperatures for superconductivity. In particular, we propose three classes of hydrides inspired by the Fm 3 ¯ m RH 3 structures that exhibit strong hydrogen network connectivity, as defined through the electron localization function. The first class [RH 11 X 3 Y] is based on a Pm 3 ¯ m structure showing moderately high T c , where the T c estimate from electronic properties is compared with direct Eliashberg calculations and found to be surprisingly accurate. The second class of structures [(RH 11 ) 2 X 6 YZ] improves on this with promisingly high density of states with dominant hydrogen character at the Fermi energy, typically enhancing T c . The third class [(R 1 H 11 )(R 2 H 11 )X 6 YZ] improves the strong hydrogen network connectivity by introducing anisotropy in the hydrogen network through a specific doping pattern. These design principles and associated model structures provide flexibility to optimize both T c and the structural stability of complex hydrides.",

Despite all these exciting observations, the field appears to have stagnated since then. We argue that this is a consequence of the shortcomings of technologies to model these diseases, limiting our understanding of which transcripts are being oxidized, which RNA-binding proteins are interacting with these RNAs, what their implications are in RNA processing, and as a result, what their potential role is in disease onset and progression. Here, we discuss the limits of previous technologies and propose ways by which advancements in iPSC-derived disease modeling, proteomics, and sequencing technologies can be combined and leveraged to answer new and decades-old questions.",

Thus, tumor cells seize regulatory pathways to rapidly adapt to distinct physiologic conditions to promote cellular survival, including manipulation of mRNA translation. While it is now well established that metastatic tumor cells must up-regulate their antioxidant capacity to effectively spread and that regulation of antioxidant enzymes is imperative to disease progression, relatively few studies have assessed how translation and the hijacking of RNA systems contribute to antioxidant responses of tumors. Here, we review the major stress signaling pathways involved in translational regulation and discuss how these are affected by oxidative stress to promote prosurvival changes that manipulate antioxidant enzyme expression. We describe how tumors elicit these adaptive responses and detail how stress-induced translation can be regulated by kinases, RNA-binding proteins, RNA species, and RNA modification systems. We also highlight opportunities for further studies focused on the role of mRNA translation and RNA systems in the regulation of antioxidant enzyme expression, which may be of particular importance in the context of metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance.",

We recently reported that subinhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim induce vast changes in both the primary and secondary metabolome of B. thailandensis . In the current work, we show that the folate biosynthetic enzyme FolE2 is permissive under standard growth conditions but essential for B. thailandensis in the presence of subinhibitory doses of trimethoprim. Reasoning that FolE2 may serve as an attractive drug target, we screened for and identified ten inhibitors, including dehydrocostus lactone (DHL), parthenolide, and β-lapachone, all of which are innocuous individually but form a chemical-synthetic lethal combination with subinhibitory doses of trimethoprim. We show that DHL is a mechanism-based inhibitor of FolE2 and capture the structure of the covalently inhibited enzyme using X-ray crystallography. In vitro, the combination of subinhibitory trimethoprim and DHL is more potent than Bactrim, the current standard of care against melioidosis. Moreover, unlike Bactrim, this combination does not affect the growth of most commensal and beneficial gut bacteria tested, thereby providing a degree of specificity against B. pseudomallei . Our work provides a path for identifying antimicrobial drug targets and for utilizing binary combinations of molecules that form a toxic cocktail based on metabolic idiosyncrasies of specific pathogens.",

Tree planting is one of the most widely employed nature-based heat mitigation methods worldwide. Therefore, city policy makers require knowledge of how much temperature will be reduced by increasing urban tree canopy (UTC). Cooling efficiency (CE), which was been proposed to quantify the magnitude of temperature reduction associated with a 1% increase in UTC, has been primarily investigated at smaller scales previously. However, such small-scale results cannot be used to develop policy at the whole-city scale. This study developed a method that reveals the scaling relations of CE so as to predict its effects at the city scale. CE was found to follow the form of a power law as spatial scale increased from the small analytical units through intermediate size units up to the extent of a whole city. The power law form appeared consistently across cities with different climate backgrounds during summer daylight hours. Furthermore, the power law form was robust within cities under different summer weather conditions. The power-law scaling approach can thus be used to predict CE at the whole-city scale, providing a useful tool for managers to set UTC goals to mitigate extreme urban heat.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade, several novel functions of the mammalian Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APE1) have been discovered, going far beyond its canonical function as DNA repair enzyme and unveiling its potential roles in cancer development. Indeed, it was shown to be involved in DNA G-quadruplex biology and RNA metabolism, most importantly in the miRNA maturation pathway and the decay of oxidized or abasic miRNAs during oxidative stress conditions. In recent years, several noncanonical pathways of miRNA biogenesis have emerged, with a specific focus on guanosine-rich precursors that can form RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) structures. Here, we show that several miRNA precursors, dysregulated upon APE1 depletion, contain an rG4 motif and that their corresponding target genes are up-regulated after APE1 depletion. We also demonstrate, both by in vitro assays and by using different cancer cell lines, that APE1 can modulate the folding of an rG4 structure contained in pre-miR-92b, with a mechanism strictly dependent on lysine residues present in its N-terminal disordered region. Furthermore, APE1 cellular depletion alters the maturation process of miR-92b, mainly affecting the shuttling between the nucleus and cytosol. Bioinformatic analysis of APE1-regulated rG4-containing miRNAs supports the relevance of our findings in cancer biology. Specifically, these miRNAs exhibit high prognostic significance in lung, cervical, and liver tumors, as suggested by their involvement in several cancer-related pathways.",

Recent work has revealed clear latitudinal patterns in C:N:P, yet the relative importance of ecological, physiological, or biochemical processes in creating these patterns is unclear. We present high-resolution, concurrent measurements of particulate C:N:P, macromolecular composition, environmental conditions, and plankton community composition from a transect spanning a subtropical-subpolar boundary, the North Pacific Transition Zone. We find that the summed contribution of macromolecules to particulate C, N, and P is consistent with, and provides interpretation for, particulate C:N:P patterns. A decline in particulate C:N from the subtropical to subpolar North Pacific largely reflects an increase in the relative contribution of protein compared to carbohydrate and lipid, whereas variation in C:P and N:P correspond to shifts in protein relative to polyphosphate, DNA, and RNA. Possible causes for the corresponding trends in C:N and macromolecular composition include physiological responses and changes in community structure of phytoplankton, which represented approximately 1/3 rd of particulate C across the transect. Comparison with culture experiments and an allocation-based model of phytoplankton macromolecular composition suggest that physiological acclimation to changing nutrient supply is the most likely explanation for the latitudinal trend in C:N, offering both a mechanistic interpretation and biochemical basis for large-scale patterns in C:N:P.",

          "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), the anion channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, is activated by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C). PKA-C activates CFTR both noncatalytically, through binding, and catalytically, through phosphorylation of multiple serines in CFTR’s regulatory (R) domain. Here, we identify key molecular determinants of the CFTR/PKA-C interaction essential for these processes. By comparing CFTR current activation in the presence of ATP or an ATP analog unsuitable for phosphotransfer, as well as pseudosubstrate peptides of various lengths, we identify two distinct specific regions of the PKA-C surface which interact with CFTR to cause noncatalytic and catalytic CFTR stimulation, respectively. Whereas the “substrate site” mediates CFTR phosphorylation, a distinct hydrophobic patch (the “docking site”) is responsible for noncatalytic CFTR activation, achieved by stabilizing the R domain in a “released” conformation permissive to channel gating. Furthermore, by comparing PKA-C variants with different posttranslational modification patterns, we find that direct membrane tethering of the kinase through its N-terminal myristoyl group is an unappreciated fundamental requirement for CFTR activation: PKA-C demyristoylation abolishes noncatalytic, and profoundly slows catalytic, CFTR stimulation. For the F508del CFTR mutant, present in ~90% of CF patients, maximal activation by demyristoylated PKA-C is reduced by ~10-fold compared to that by myristoylated PKA-C. Finally, in bacterial genera that contain common CF pathogens, we identify virulence factors that demyristoylate PKA-C in vitro, raising the possibility that during recurrent bacterial infections in CF patients, PKA-C demyristoylation may contribute to the exacerbation of lung disease.",

          "abstract": "Researchers looking for sustainable materials with optimal mechanical properties may draw inspiration from a baseball tradition. For nearly 100 y, a mysterious mud harvested from an undisclosed river site in New Jersey (USA) has been the agent of choice in the USA’s Major League Baseball for “de-glossing” new baseballs. It is unclear, however, what makes this “Rubbing Mud” work. Here, we perform a multiscale investigation of the rheology and tribology of this mud material under baseball-relevant conditions and identify three mechanisms by which the mud alters the surface properties of the baseball. First, the mud creates a more uniform baseball surface by filling in pores in the leather; this is possible because of its relatively high cohesion (clays and organics) making the material remarkably shear thinning. Second, the residue of cohesive particles coating the baseball effectively doubles contact adhesion. Third, a sparse population of angular sand grains are bonded to the baseball by clay-sized particles, leaving a studded surface that enhances friction. The proportions of cohesive, frictional, and viscous elements in Rubbing Mud conspire to create a soft material with an unusual mix of properties, that could find other applications in the development of sustainable geomaterials. Our improved understanding of the flow and friction of natural muds may also find use in modeling natural hazards such as mudslides and for locomotion in muddy environments.",

          "abstract": "RNA oxidation, predominantly through the accumulation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxo-rG), represents an important biomarker for cellular oxidative stress. Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease that has been shown to preferentially recognize 8-oxo-rG-containing RNA and protect E scherichia coli cells from oxidative stress. However, the impact of 8-oxo-rG on PNPase-mediated RNA degradation has not been studied. Here, we show that the presence of 8-oxo-rG in RNA leads to catalytic stalling of E. coli PNPase through in vitro RNA degradation experiments and electrophoretic analysis. We also link this stalling to the active site of the enzyme through resolution of single-particle cryo-EM structures for PNPase in complex with singly or doubly oxidized RNA oligonucleotides. Following identification of Arg399 as a key residue in recognition of both single and sequential 8-oxo-rG nucleotides, we perform follow-up in vitro analysis to confirm the importance of this residue in 8-oxo-rG-specific PNPase stalling. Finally, we investigate the effects of mutations to active site residues implicated in 8-oxo-rG binding through E. coli cell growth experiments under H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress. Specifically, Arg399 mutations show significant effects on cell growth under oxidative stress. Overall, we demonstrate that 8-oxo-rG-specific stalling of PNPase is relevant to bacterial survival under oxidative stress and speculate that this enzyme might associate with other cellular factors to mediate this stress.",

The primary visual cortex (V1) is thought to extract local borders, and higher visual areas are thought to identify the perceptually relevant borders between objects and the background. To test this conjecture, we used natural images that had been annotated by human observers who marked the perceptually relevant borders. We assessed the effect of perceptual relevance on V1 responses using human neuroimaging, macaque electrophysiology, and computational modeling. We report that perceptually relevant borders elicit stronger responses in the early visual cortex than irrelevant ones, even if simple features, such as contrast and the energy of oriented filters, are matched. Moreover, V1 neurons discriminate perceptually relevant borders surprisingly fast, during the early feedforward-driven activity at a latency of ~50 ms, indicating that they are tuned to the features that characterize them. We also revealed a delayed, contextual effect that enhances the V1 responses that are elicited by perceptually relevant borders at a longer latency. Our results reveal multiple mechanisms that allow V1 neurons to infer the layout of objects in natural images.",

          "abstract": "Northeast China’s Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation preserves spectacular fossils that have proved extraordinarily important in testing evolutionary hypotheses involving the origin of birds and the distribution of feathers among nonavian dinosaurs. These fossils occur either flattened with soft tissue preservation (including feathers and color) in laminated lacustrine strata or as three-dimensional (3D) skeletons in “life-like” postures in more massive deposits. The relationships of these deposits to each other, their absolute ages, and the origin of the extraordinary fossil preservation have been vigorously debated for nearly a half century, with the prevailing view being that preservation was linked to violent volcanic eruptions or lahars, similar to processes that preserved human remains at Pompeii. We present high-precision zircon U-Pb geochronology from cores and outcrops, demonstrating that Yixian Formation accumulation rates are more than an order of magnitude higher than usually estimated. Additionally, we provide zircon provenance and sedimentological data from 3D dinosaur fossils, which imply that their death and burial occurred in collapsed burrows, rather than via a catastrophic volcanogenic mechanism. In the studied area, the three principal fossil-rich intervals of the Yixian occur as a cyclic sequence that correspond to periods of high precipitation. Using Bayesian–Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches, we constrain the total duration of the sequence to less than ~93,000 y and suggest that climatic precession paced the expression of these cyclic sediments. Rather than representing multiple, Pompeii-like catastrophes, the Yixian Formation is instead a brief snapshot of normal life and death in an Early Cretaceous continental community.",

          "abstract": "The role of ventral hippocampus (vHipp) astroglial gliotransmission in depression was studied using chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rodent models. CRS increased Cx43 hemichannel activity and extracellular glutamate levels in the vHipp and blocking astroglial Cx43 hemichannel-dependent gliotransmission during CRS prevented the development of depression and glutamate buildup. Moreover, the acute blockade of Cx43 hemichannels induced antidepressant effects in rats previously subjected to CRS or CUMS. This antidepressant effect was prevented by coinjection of glutamate and D-serine. Furthermore, Cx43 hemichannel blockade decreased postsynaptic NMDAR currents in vHipp slices in a glutamate and D-serine-dependent manner. Notably, chronic microinfusion of glutamate and D-serine, L-serine, or the NMDAR agonist NMDA, into the vHipp induced depressive-like symptoms in nonstressed rats. We also identified a small molecule, cacotheline, which blocks Cx43 hemichannels and its systemic administration induced rapid antidepressant effects, preventing stress-induced increases in astroglial Cx43 hemichannel activity and extracellular glutamate in the vHipp, without sedative or locomotor side effects. In conclusion, chronic stress increases Cx43 hemichannel-dependent release of glutamate and D-/L-serine from astrocytes in the vHipp, overactivating postsynaptic NMDARs and triggering depressive-like symptoms. This study highlights the critical role of astroglial gliotransmitter release in chronic stress-induced depression and suggests it can be used as a target for the prevention and treatment of depression.",

          "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a considerable threat to human health with a significant risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, currently, both the molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic treatment of IBD remain limited. In this report, using both systemic and intestinal epithelium-specific gene knockout mouse models, we demonstrate that FBXO22, a substrate receptor within the SKP1-Cullin 1-F-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, plays an inhibitory role in the Azoxymethane / Dextran Sodium Sulfate–induced colorectal inflammatory responses and CRC. FBXO22 targets the serine 2448-phosphorylated form of mammalian mechanistic target of rapamycin (pS2448-mTOR) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This proteolytic targeting effect is established based on multiple lines of evidence including the results of colon tissue immunoblots, analysis of cultured cells with altered abundance of FBXO22 by depletion or overexpression, comparison of protein decay rate, effects on mTOR substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1, analysis of protein–protein interactions, phosphor–peptide binding and competition, as well as reconstituted and cellular ubiquitination. Finally, we have shown that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA) was able to alleviate the effects of fbxo22 deletion on colorectal inflammatory response and CRC. These RAPA effects are correlated with the ability of RAPA to inhibit pS2448-mTOR, pS6K1, and p4E-BP1. Collectively, our data support a suppressive role for FBXO22 in colorectal inflammation signaling and CRC initiation by targeting pS2448-mTOR for degradation.",

          "abstract": "Cells adapt to environments and tune gene expression by controlling the concentrations of proteins and their kinetics in regulatory networks. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, experiments and theory increasingly attest that these networks can and do consume biochemical energy. How does this dissipation enable cellular behaviors forbidden in equilibrium? This open question demands quantitative models that transcend thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we study the control of simple, ubiquitous gene regulatory networks to explore the consequences of departing equilibrium in transcription. Employing graph theory to model a set of especially common regulatory motifs, we find that dissipation unlocks nonmonotonicity and enhanced sensitivity of gene expression with respect to a transcription factor’s concentration. These features allow a single transcription factor to act as both a repressor and activator at different concentrations or achieve outputs with multiple concentration regimes of locally enhanced sensitivity. We systematically dissect how energetically driving individual transitions within regulatory networks, or pairs of transitions, generates a wide range of more adjustable and sensitive phenotypic responses than in equilibrium. These results generalize to more complex regulatory scenarios, including combinatorial control by multiple transcription factors, which we relate and often find collapse to simple mathematical behaviors. Our findings quantify necessary conditions and detectable consequences of energy expenditure. These richer mathematical behaviors—feasibly accessed using biological energy budgets and rates—may empower cells to accomplish sophisticated regulation with simpler architectures than those required at equilibrium.",

          "abstract": "Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly in the developed world. While the introduction of therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has provided the first opportunity to significantly improve vision in patients with nvAMD, many patients respond inadequately to current anti-VEGF therapies. It was recently demonstrated that expression of a second angiogenic mediator, angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), synergizes with VEGF to promote choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in mice and correlates with reduced response to anti-VEGF therapy in patients with nvAMD. Here, we report that expression of ANGPTL4 in patients with nvAMD increases following treatment with anti-VEGF therapy and that this increase is dependent on accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α in response to inhibition of VEGF/KDR signaling in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We therefore explored HIF-1 inhibition with 32-134D, a recently developed pharmacologic HIF-inhibitor, for the treatment of nvAMD. 32-134D prevented the expression of both VEGF and ANGPTL4 and was at least as effective as aflibercept in treating CNV in mice. Moreover, by preventing the increase in HIF-1α accumulation in the RPE in response to anti-VEGF therapy, combining 32-134D with aflibercept was more effective than either drug alone for the treatment of CNV. Collectively, these results help explain why many patients with nvAMD respond inadequately to anti-VEGF therapy and suggest that the HIF inhibitor 32-134D will be an effective drug—alone or in combination with current anti-VEGF therapies—for the treatment of patients with this blinding disease.",

The rates exhibit a complex dependence on oxygen coverage and step density, which can be quantitatively explained by a density functional and transition-state theory–based kinetic model involving a cooperatively stabilized configuration of at least three oxygen atoms at steps. Here, two oxygen atoms recruit a third oxygen atom to a nearby binding site to produce an active configuration that is far more reactive than isolated oxygen atoms.

          "abstract": "Perovskite solar modules (PSMs) show outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), but long-term operational stability remains problematic. We show that incorporating N,N -dimethylmethyleneiminium chloride into the perovskite precursor solution formed dimethylammonium cation and that previously unobserved methyl tetrahydrotriazinium ([MTTZ] + ) cation effectively improved perovskite film. The in situ formation of [MTTZ] + cation increased the formation energy of iodine vacancies and enhanced the migration energy barrier of iodide and cesium ions, which suppressed nonradiative recombination, thermal decomposition, and phase segregation processes. The optimized PSMs achieved a record (certified) PCE of 23.2% with an aperture area of 27.2 cm 2 , with a stabilized PCE of 23.0%. The encapsulated PSM retained 87.0% of its initial PCE after ~1900 hours of maximum power point tracking at 85°C and 85% relative humidity under 1.0-sun illumination.",

          "abstract": "Bats are known for their ability to use echolocation for obstacle avoidance and orientation. However, the extent to which bats utilize their highly local and directional echolocation for kilometer-scale navigation is unknown. In this study, we translocated wild Kuhl’s pipistrelle bats and tracked their homing abilities while manipulating their visual, magnetic, and olfactory sensing and accurately tracked them using a new reverse GPS system. We show that bats can identify their location after translocation and conduct several-kilometer map-based navigation using solely echolocation. This proposition was further supported by a large-scale echolocation model disclosing how bats use environmental acoustic information to perform acoustic cognitive map–based navigation. We also demonstrate that navigation is improved when using both echolocation and vision.",

          "abstract": "Malformations of the brain are common and vary in severity, from negligible to potentially fatal. Their causes have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report pathogenic variants in the core protein-folding machinery TRiC/CCT in individuals with brain malformations, intellectual disability, and seizures. The chaperonin TRiC is an obligate hetero-oligomer, and we identify variants in seven of its eight subunits, all of which impair function or assembly through different mechanisms. Transcriptome and proteome analyses of patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrate the various consequences of TRiC impairment. The results reveal an unexpected and potentially widespread role for protein folding in the development of the central nervous system and define a disease spectrum of “TRiCopathies.”",

Although fundamental for plant multicellularity, the molecular events leading to bridge stabilization, as opposed to severing, remain unknown. Using electron tomography, we mapped the transition from cell plate fenestrae to plasmodesmata. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) connects daughter cells across fenestrae, and as the cell plate matures, fenestrae contract, causing the plasma membrane (PM) to mold around constricted ER tubes. The ER’s presence prevents fenestrae fusion, forming plasmodesmata, whereas its absence results in closure. The ER-PM protein tethers MCTP3, MCTP4, and MCTP6 further stabilize nascent plasmodesmata during fenestrae contraction. Genetic deletion in Arabidopsis reduces plasmodesmata formation. Our findings reveal how plants undergo incomplete division to promote intercellular communication.",

However, the mechanism underlying their ability to generate a spectrum of vibrant yellows, reds, and greens remains enigmatic. We uncover a unifying chemical basis for a wide range of parrot plumage colors, which result from the selective deposition of red aldehyde- and yellow carboxyl-containing psittacofulvin molecules in developing feathers. Through genetic mapping, biochemical assays, and single-cell genomics, we identified a critical player in this process, the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 , which oxidizes aldehyde psittacofulvins into carboxyl forms in late-differentiating keratinocytes during feather development. The simplicity of the underlying molecular mechanism, in which a single enzyme influences the balance of red and yellow pigments, offers an explanation for the exceptional evolutionary lability of parrot coloration.",

We show that, in the presence of antibiotics, MRSA adopts an alternative mode of cell division and shows an altered peptidoglycan architecture at the division septum. PBP2a can replace the transpeptidase activity of the endogenous and essential PBP2 but not that of PBP1, which is responsible for the distinctive native septal peptidoglycan architecture. Successful division without PBP1 activity requires the alternative division mode and is enabled by several possible chromosomal potentiator ( pot ) mutations. MRSA resensitizing agents differentially interfere with the two codependent mechanisms required for high-level antibiotic resistance, which provides opportunities for new interventions.",

They usually rely on carrier tunneling between two quantum wells or two layers to hybridize with nondipolar excitons to gain oscillator strength. In this work, we uncovered a new type of bright infrared dipolar exciton by stacking 90°-twisted black phosphorus (BP) structures. These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.",

We report that Arabidopsis Decapping 5 (DCP5) functions as a multifunctional cytoplasmic osmosensor that senses and responds to extracellular hyperosmolarity. DCP5 harbors a plant-specific intramolecular crowding sensor (ICS) that undergoes conformational change and drives phase separation in response to osmotically intensified molecular crowding. Upon hyperosmolarity exposure, DCP5 rapidly and reversibly assembles to DCP5-enriched osmotic stress granules (DOSGs), which sequestrate plenty of mRNA and regulatory proteins, and thus adaptively reprograms both the translatome and transcriptome to facilitate plant osmotic stress adaptation. Our findings uncover a cytoplasmic osmosensing mechanism mediated by DCP5 with plant-specific molecular crowding sensitivity and suggest a stress sensory function for hyperosmotically induced stress granules.",

The SRHP demonstrates a cooling of 8.8 kelvin below ambient temperature in 30 seconds and delivers a maximum specific cooling power of 1.52 watts per gram. The temperature lift of the SRHP is 14.2 kelvin. These results underscore the potential of the compact solid-state cooling mechanism to address the increasing need for localized thermal management.",

Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, yet consumption nearly doubled immediately post-rationing. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35% and 20%, respectively, and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years. Protection was evident with in-utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after six months when solid foods likely began. In-utero sugar rationing alone accounted for about one third of the risk reduction.",

          "abstract": "Patterns of wins and lo sses in pairwise contests, such as occur in sports and games, consumer research and paired comparison studies, and human and animal social hierarchies, are commonly analyzed using probabilistic models that allow one to quantify the strength of competitors or predict the outcome of future contests. Here, we generalize this approach to incorporate two additional features: an element of randomness or luck that leads to upset wins, and a “depth of competition” variable that measures the complexity of a game or hierarchy. Fitting the resulting model, we estimate depth and luck in a range of games, sports, and social situations. In general, we find that social competition tends to be “deep,” meaning it has a pronounced hierarchy with many distinct levels, but also that there is often a nonzero chance of an upset victory. Competition in sports and games, by contrast, tends to be shallow, and in most cases, there is little evidence of upset wins.",

There is widespread concern that they do, but little systematic evidence that search engine algorithms, rather than user-expressed preferences, are driving current exposure to and engagement with unreliable information sources. Using two datasets totaling roughly 14 billion search engine result pages (SERPs) from Bing, the second most popular search engine in the U.S., we show that search exposes users to few unreliable information sources. The vast majority of engagement with unreliable information sources from search occurs when users are explicitly searching for information from those sites, despite those searches being an extremely small share of the overall search volume. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for user preference when examining engagement with unreliable sources from web search.",

Here, we report the first atomic structure of mouse α-synuclein fibrils, which was solved in parallel by two independent teams. The structure shows striking similarity to MSA-amplified and PD-associated E46K fibrils.

Furthermore, mouse α-synuclein fibrils exhibit exacerbated pathological spread in neurons and humanized α-synuclein mice.

Current intensified therapeutic protocols coincide with severe side effects, and no salvage therapy is available for primary therapy-resistant or relapsed patients. This highlights the need to identify new therapeutic targets in T-ALL. PSIP1, dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, is a dependency factor in KMT2A -rearranged myeloid leukemia. Nonetheless, loss-of-function mutations suggest a tumor suppressor role for PSIP1 in T-ALL. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of Psip1 accelerates T-ALL initiation in mice which we correlated with reduced H3K27me3 binding. Contrastingly, loss of PSIP1 impaired cell proliferation in several T-ALL cell lines. In cell lines, PSIP1 down-regulation leads to a reduction of COX20, an assembly factor of the cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria, and to a reduction in mitochondrial respiration. This indicates that PSIP1 can exert a dual role in the context of T-ALL, either as a tumor suppressor gene during tumor initiation or as a dependency factor in tumor maintenance.",

Here, we report an important in vivo role for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number during lung adenocarcinoma progression in the mouse. We found that lung tumors induced by KRAS G12D expression have increased mtDNA levels and enhanced mitochondrial respiration. To experimentally assess a possible causative role in tumor progression, we induced lung cancer in transgenic mice with a general increase in mtDNA copy number and found that they developed a larger tumor burden, whereas mtDNA depletion in tumor cells reduced tumor growth. Immune cell populations in the lung and cytokine levels in plasma were not affected by increased mtDNA levels. Analyses of large cancer databases indicate that mtDNA copy number is also important in human lung cancer. Our study thus reports experimental evidence for a tumor-intrinsic causative role for mtDNA in lung cancer progression, which could be exploited for development of future cancer therapies.",

Here, noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) is used to directly image polarons in Fe 2 O 3 at the single quasiparticle limit. A combination of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations shows that the mobility of electron polarons can be markedly increased by Ti doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that a transition from polaronic to metastable free-carrier states can play a key role in migration of electron polarons.

The study suggests that the polymer-based semiconductor film can efficiently drive the non-photosynthetic bacteria to convert CO 2 to acetate. By systematically characterizing the charge transport behavior of the bio-artificial photosynthetic system, the bulk-heterojunction structure and charge transport layers are proven to enhance the system performance markedly. The scalable floating artificial bio-leaf system can produce acetate to gram scale in a week. Notably, the semiconductor film is easy to recycle and maintains stable performance, showing good sustainable production capability of the system. A quasi–solid-state artificial bio-leaf is successfully prepared using agar to simulate the morphology and function of natural leaves. Last, the acetate production converted from CO 2 was used to grow yeast for food production, thus achieving a complete simulation of natural photosynthesis.",

They can be assigned to three positively charged residues of the central substrate-binding site and two asparagine/arginine pairs. In this way, the membrane potential stimulates not only the ATP 4− export step, as a net −0.7 charge is transported, but also the ADP 3− import step, as a net +0.3 charge is transported with the electric field. These positive charge movements also inhibit the import of ATP and export of ADP in the presence of a membrane potential, allowing these nucleotides to be maintained at high concentrations in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix to drive the hydrolysis and synthesis of ATP, respectively. Thus, this is the mechanism by which the membrane potential drives adenine nucleotide exchange with high directional fluxes to fuel the cellular processes.",

To address how erupted steam bursts from underwater volcanoes generate tsunamis, we present the experiments, using pressurized steam injected vertically into a water tank. Results over various eruption conditions identify three eruption regimes, namely, shallow-, intermediate-, and deep-water eruptions, according to the combined effects of water depths, source strengths, and source durations. The transition between shallow and intermediate eruptions is characterized by critical depths maximizing tsunami wave heights, while the transition between intermediate and deep eruptions is characterized by containment depths inhibiting surface disturbances. Water depth and source intensity are the dominant factors controlling maximum wave amplitudes, more so than aspects of jet duration and condensation. These experiments and supporting dimensional analysis improve our understanding of how underwater volcanic eruptions form tsunamis, while also providing a complete dataset for advancing tsunami generation models.",

Iridium-based oxide catalysts are widely studied for electrocatalytic technologies, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but insufficient techniques for quantifying electrochemically accessible iridium active sites impede accurate assessment of intrinsic activity improvements. We develop mercury underpotential deposition and stripping as a reversible electrochemical adsorption process to robustly quantify iridium sites and consistently normalize OER performance of benchmark IrO x electrodes to a single intrinsic activity curve, where other commonly used normalization methods cannot. Through rigorous deconvolution of mercury redox and reproportionation reactions, we extract net monolayer deposition and stripping of mercury on iridium sites throughout testing using a rotating ring disk electrode. This technique is a transformative method to standardize OER performance across a wide range of iridium-based materials and quantify electrochemical iridium active sites.",

          "abstract": "Historically, meteorological drought in the western United States (WUS) has been driven primarily by precipitation deficits. However, our observational analysis shows that, since around 2000, rising surface temperature and the resulting high evaporative demand have contributed more to drought severity (62%) and coverage (66%) over the WUS than precipitation deficit. This increase in evaporative demand during droughts, mostly attributable to anthropogenic warming according to analyses of both observations and climate model simulations, is the main cause of the increased drought severity and coverage. The unprecedented 2020–2022 WUS drought exemplifies this shift in drought drivers, with high evaporative demand accounting for 61% of its severity, compared to 39% from precipitation deficit. Climate model simulations corroborate this shift and project that, under the fossil-fueled development scenario (SSP5-8.5), droughts like the 2020–2022 event will transition from a one-in-more-than-a-thousand-year event in the pre-2022 period to a 1-in-60-year event by the mid-21st century and to a 1-in-6-year event by the late-21st century.",

Here, we show that partial inhibition of non-muscle myosin II (NM II) augmented the traction force exerted by T cells and potentiated T cell cytotoxicity against tumors. By using T cells from mice and patients with cancer, we found that NM II is required for the activity of NKX3-2 in maintaining the expression of ADGRB3, which shapes the filamentous actin (F-actin) organization and ultimately attributes to the reduced traction force of T cells in the tumor microenvironment. In animal models, suppressing the NM II–NKX3-2–ADGRB3 pathway in T cells effectively suppressed tumor growth and improved the efficacy of the checkpoint-specific immunotherapy. Overall, this work provides insights into the biomechanical regulation of T cell cytotoxicity that can be exploited to optimize clinical immunotherapies.",

The incorporation of pyramid-based asymmetrical optical transmission (AOT) array to a transparent silver electrode suppresses the escaping of front sunlight without sacrificing the harvesting of albedo light. Parasitic absorption induced by the excitation of surface plasmons in an AOT electrode is further reduced by doping organic emitter in electron transport layer and capping high dielectric constant film to silver.

To measure the symmetries without perturbing the data, ancillary quantum states are required. Shor error correction uses a separate quantum state for the measurement of each symmetry. Steane error correction maps the perturbations onto a logical ancilla qubit, which is then measured to check several symmetries simultaneously. We experimentally compare Shor and Steane correction of bit flip errors using the Bacon-Shor code implemented in a chain of 23 trapped atomic ions.

We show that a train of voltage spikes dynamically modifies the membrane’s ionic permeability in a process involving competitive bicationic transport. This process is shown to be repeatable after a given resting period. Because of a combination of subnanometer pore size and the atomic thinness of the membrane, this system exhibits energy dissipation of 0.1 to 100 aJ per voltage spike, which is several orders of magnitude lower than 0.1 to 10 fJ per spike in the human synapse.

Two families of cyclopentadienone derivatives were synthesized, featuring the inter-pyridyl main conductance channel and the inter-radical paths that are linear (FCF) or cross conjugated (PCP). Using a scanning tunneling microscope break junction technique, we find that the injection of mono- and diradicals in the PCP system unexpectedly decreases the conductance regarding the closed-shell analog, while that of FCF systems increases. Through-bond and through-space conductance mechanisms are found in the FCF and PCP series, respectively, and jointly modulate the overall charge transmission.

Here, we explore dormancy-inducing 3D engineered matrices, which generate mechanical confinement and induce growth arrest and survival against chemotherapy in cancer cells. We characterized the dormant phenotype of solitary cells by P-ERK low :P-p38 high dormancy signaling ratio, along with Ki67 − expression. As underlying mechanism, we identified stiffness-dependent nuclear localization of the four-and-a-half LIM domain 2 (FHL2) protein, leading to p53-independent high p21 Cip1/Waf1 nuclear expression, validated in murine and human tissue.

          "abstract": "Hybrid integration of solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) into nanophotonic structures opens enticing perspectives for exploiting multiple degrees of freedom of single-photon sources for on-chip quantum photonic applications. However, the state-of-the-art single-photon sources are mostly limited to two-level states or scalar vortex beams. Direct generation of high-dimensional structured single photons remains challenging, being still in its infancy. Here, we propose a general strategy to design highly entangled high-dimensional spin-orbital single-photon sources by taking full advantage of the spatial freedom to design QE-coupled composite (i.e., Moiré/multipart) metasurfaces. We demonstrate the generation of arbitrary vectorial spin-orbital photon emission in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, mapping the generated states on hybrid-order Bloch spheres. We further realize single-photon sources of high-dimensional spin-orbital quantum emission and experimentally verify the entanglement of high-dimensional superposition states with high fidelity. We believe that the results obtained facilitate further progress in integrated solutions for the deployment of next-generation high-capacity quantum information technologies.",

However, how mitochondrial dynamics influences metastatic progression remains poorly understood. Here, we show that breast cancer cells with low metastatic potential exhibit a more fused mitochondrial network compared to highly metastatic cells. To study the impact of mitochondrial dynamics on metastasis, we promoted mitochondrial elongation in metastatic breast cancer cells by individual genetic deletion of three key regulators of mitochondrial fission (Drp1, Fis1, Mff) or by pharmacological intervention with leflunomide. Omics analyses revealed that mitochondrial elongation causes substantial alterations in metabolic pathways and processes related to cell adhesion. In vivo, enhanced mitochondrial elongation by loss of mitochondrial fission mediators or treatment with leflunomide notably reduced metastasis formation. Furthermore, the transcriptomic signature associated with elongated mitochondria correlated with improved clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer. Overall, our findings highlight mitochondrial dynamics as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.",

Correlation and causality between phytoplankton biomass and environmental factors exhibit spatial asymmetry—regions where environmental factors directly drive biomass variations were concentrated in oceanic currents and subtropical circulations. Temperature, light, and mixed layer depth show pronounced influences on global phytoplankton interdecadal variations. Climate forcing over interdecadal timescales directly affects phytoplankton biomass in the equatorial Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Oceans, with more uncertain biomass variability in the equatorial Pacific due to multiple climate events.

Hypothesizing that SASP reprogramming with Ali and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux) will benefit cancer immunotherapy, we create nanoparticulate crystals (Ali-Rux) composed of Ali and Rux with a fully active pharmaceutical ingredient. Immunization with Ali-Rux–orchestrated senescent cells promotes stronger activation of antigen-presenting cells, enhancing antitumor immune surveillance. This approach remodels the TME by increasing CD8 + T cell and NK recruitment and activation while decreasing MDSCs. Combined with PD-L1 blockade, Ali-Rux elicits a durable antitumor immune response, suggesting the TME reshaping approach as a potential cancer immunotherapy.",

We used a heterostructure comprising SrSnO 3 /La:SrSnO 3 /GdScO 3 (110), and applied electrostatic gating, which allow us to effectively separate charge carriers in SrSnO 3 from dopants and achieve phonon-limited transport behavior in strain-stabilized tetragonal SrSnO 3 . This led to a modulation of carrier density from 10 18 to 10 20 cm −3 , with room temperature mobilities ranging from 40 to 140 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . The phonon-limited mobility, calculated from first principles, closely matched experimental results, suggesting that room temperature mobility could be further increased with higher electron density. In addition, the sample exhibited 85% optical transparency at a 300-nm wavelength.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different approach: enhancing the scintillation rate and yield via the Purcell effect, utilizing optical environment engineering to boost spontaneous emission. This enhancement is universally applicable to any scintillating material and dopant when the material’s nanoscale geometry is engineered. We design a thin multilayer nanophotonic scintillator, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced scintillation with 50% enhancement in emission rate and 80% enhancement in light yield. The emission is robust to fabrication disorder, further highlighting its potential for x-ray applications.

PLP demonstrates a 2000-fold increase in circulation half-life compared to peptides, exhibiting an elimination half-life of 152 hours. In vivo efficacy studies in HD transgenic mice (R6/2) confirm the superior bioactivity of PLP compared to free peptide through behavioral and neuropathological analyses.

Here, using a transfer learning framework, we train a model on functional neuroimaging data from the UK Biobank to predict cognitive functioning in three transdiagnostic samples (ns = 101 to 224). We demonstrate prediction performance in all three samples comparable to that reported in larger prediction studies and a boost of up to 116% relative to classical models trained directly in the smaller samples. Critically, the model generalizes across datasets, maintaining performance when trained and tested across independent samples.

Using noncontact laser-based dynamic experiments of tunable elastodynamic properties and numerical demonstrations of spatio-temporal ultrasound wave propagation, we explore the tunable static and elastodynamic property relation.

Compared with common planktonic probiotic formulations, probiotic biofilms forming on a robust GCS exhibit enhanced stress tolerance and better colonization capacity in the mouse vagina. Moreover, DNA nanodevices are decorated on the GCS and dynamically report the microenvironment change of biofilms for timely evaluating bacterium activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, GCS-LBs are used for treating AV in an Escherichia coli –infected mouse model, which shows enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared with conventional antibiotic or lactobacillus monotherapy.

An engineered V1200R mutation empowers CMT2 to restore CHG and CHH methylations in Arabidopsis cmt2cmt3 mutant, testifying a loss-of-function effect for CMT2 during evolution.

Multiple alternating jets, resembling those of Jupiter’s atmosphere, are sustained by these baroclinic eddies. We establish a theoretical model of the stratification and circulation and present scaling laws for the magnitude of the meridional heat transport. These are tested against numerical simulations.

These changes promote osteogenic and angiogenic couplings. The hydrogel simultaneously recruited BMSCs by conjugating the stem cell homing peptide SKPPGTSS. Using a rat distal femoral defect model, it was demonstrated that this hydrogel can effectively increase the formation of bone tissue and new blood vessels and has immune-regulating functions. We envision that this hydrogel may be a minimally invasive yet highly effective strategy for expediting the healing of osteoporotic bone defects.",

Cellular spatial pattern characterization revealed a community where CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and dendritic cells were gathered, suggesting localized T cell activation. KRAS-G12C inhibition led to increased PD-1 expression, proliferation, and cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells, and CXCL9 expression by dendritic cells, indicating an effector response. However, suppressive regulatory T cells (T regs ) were also found in frequent contact with effector T cells within this community. Lung adenocarcinoma clinical samples showed similar communities. Depleting T regs led to enhanced tumor control in combination with anti–PD-1 and KRAS-G12C inhibitor.

To functionally evaluate the impact of mtDNA variants on tumor growth and metastasis, we developed an enhanced cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) generation protocol and established isogenic human melanoma cybrid lines with wild-type mtDNA or pathogenic mtDNA mutations with partial or complete loss of mitochondrial oxidative function. Cybrids with homoplasmic levels of pathogenic mtDNA reliably established tumors despite dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation. However, these mtDNA variants disrupted spontaneous metastasis from primary tumors and reduced the abundance of circulating tumor cells. Migration and invasion of tumor cells were reduced, indicating that entry into circulation is a bottleneck for metastasis amid mtDNA dysfunction. Pathogenic mtDNA did not inhibit organ colonization following intravenous injection. In heteroplasmic cybrid tumors, single-cell analyses revealed selection against pathogenic mtDNA during melanoma growth. Collectively, these findings experimentally demonstrate that functional mtDNA is favored during melanoma growth and supports metastatic entry into the blood.",

LC is leveraged as a real-time display of the polymerization conditions and particle emergence, captured using an in situ long–focal range microscope. Detailed image analysis unravels key LC-guided mechanisms during polymerization. pDVB forms nanospheres due to poor solubilization by nematic LC. The nanospheres partition to the LC-solid interface and further assemble into microgel clusters whose orientation is guided by the LC molecular alignment. On further polymerization, microgel clusters transition to microspheroids that resemble liquid drops. We identify key energetic factors that guide trajectories along the synthesis pathway, providing the fundamental basis of a framework for engineering particle synthesis with shape control.",

But despite the large trial-to-trial variability of neural activity, humans show a remarkable adaptability to conditions with uncertainty during goal-directed behavior. The origin of this cognitive ability, constitutive of general intelligence, remains elusive. Here, we show that moderate levels of computation noise in artificial neural networks promote zero-shot generalization for decision-making under uncertainty. Unlike networks featuring noise-free computations, but like human participants tested on similar decision problems (ranging from probabilistic reasoning to reversal learning), noisy networks exhibit behavioral hallmarks of optimal inference in uncertain conditions entirely unseen during training. Computation noise enables this cognitive ability jointly through “structural” regularization of network weights during training and “functional” regularization by shaping the stochastic dynamics of network activity after training. Together, these findings indicate that human cognition may ride on neural variability to support adaptive decisions under uncertainty without extensive experience or engineered sophistication.",

In the crucial case of isothermal turbulence, the probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density, s , is well measured, but a theoretical understanding of the processes leading to this distribution remains elusive. We investigate these processes using Lagrangian tracer particles to track s and ds dt in direct numerical simulations, and we show that their evolution can be modeled as a stochastic differential process with time-correlated noise. The temporal correlation functions of s and ds dt decay exponentially, as predicted by the model, and the decay timescale is ≈ 1 / 6 the eddy turnover time. The behaviors of the conditional averages of ds dt and d 2 s dt 2 are also well explained by the model, which shows that the density PDF arises from a balance between stochastic compressions/expansions, which tend to broaden the PDF, and the acceleration/deceleration of shocks by density gradients, which tends to narrow it.",

To this end, we conducted insulin clamp studies combining intravenous infusion of a lipid overload with intake of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (mitoquinone). Under lipid overload, selective modulation of mitochondrial redox state by mitoquinone enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, mitoquinone did not affect canonical insulin signaling but augmented insulin-stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation while reducing the mitochondrial oxidative burden under lipid oversupply. Complementary ex vivo studies in human muscle fibers exposed to high intracellular lipid levels revealed that mitoquinone improves features of mitochondrial bioenergetics, including diminished mitochondrial H 2 O 2 emission. These findings provide translational and mechanistic evidence implicating mitochondrial oxidants in the development of lipid-induced muscle insulin resistance in humans.",

How inorganic carbon inputs ultimately generate lake CO 2 outgassing remains a blind spot. We develop and introduce a calcite module in a coupled one-dimensional physical-biogeochemical model that we use to simulate the carbon cycle of the large Lake Geneva over the past 40 years.

Unexpectedly, in the highly adherent state, associated with a hyperstretched morphology with exaggerated focal adhesions and prominent high-strain stress fibers, they exhibited even higher cortical tension compared to control. Notably, misguidance of intracellular forces, frequently accompanied by stress-fiber rupture, culminated in the formation of tension- and contractility-induced macroapertures, which was instantly followed by excessive lamellipodial protrusion at the periphery, providing critical insights into mechanotransduction of mechanically stressed and highly adherent cells.",

This platform revealed unique single-cell immune response mechanisms and sensitivities to standard-of-care immunotherapies. Furthermore, we were able to identify a synergistic combination of anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) together with a Casitas B lineage lymphoma-b inhibitor that overcame anti–PD-1 resistance in selected patient samples. Activation of the interferon-γ–stimulated cytokines predicted combination efficacy, while immunosuppressive cytokines were associated with poor response. Our findings underscore the platform’s potential in tailoring immunotherapies and advancing drug development, offering avenues for personalized cancer treatment.",

          "abstract": "Aberrant Notch, which is a defining feature of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, regulates intercellular communication in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). This includes tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment through Notch-dependent cytokine secretion, contributing to an immunosuppressive TIME. Despite the low response rate of TNBC to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), here, we report that inhibition of Notch-driven cytokine-mediated programs reduces TAMs and induces responsiveness to sequentially delivered ICB. This is characterized by the emergence of GrB + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the primary tumor. A more impressive effect of sequential treatment is observed in the lung where TAM depletion and increased CTLs are accompanied by near-complete abolition of metastases. This is due to (i) therapeutic reduction in Notch-dependent, prometastatic circulating factors released by the primary tumor, and (ii) elevated PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in lung metastases, rendering them profoundly sensitive to ICB. These findings highlight the potential of combination cytokine inhibition and ICB as an immunotherapeutic strategy in TNBC.",

We study how the neurodevelopmental timing of the cooperatively breeding common marmoset maps onto behavioral milestones. To obtain structure-function co-constructions, we combine behavioral, neuroimaging (anatomical and functional), and neural tracing experiments. We find that brain areas critically involved in observing conspecifics interacting (i) develop in clusters, (ii) have prolonged developmental trajectories, (iii) differentiate during the period of negotiations between immatures and multiple caregivers, and (iv) do not share stronger connectivity than with other regions. Overall, developmental timing of social brain areas correlates with social and behavioral milestones in marmosets and, as in humans, extends into adulthood. This rich social input is likely critical for the emergence of their strong socio-cognitive skills. Because humans are cooperative breeders too, these findings have strong implications for the evolution of human social cognition.",

The open-shell even-sized Bi n − clusters are more reactive than the closed-shell odd-sized clusters, except Bi 18 − , which exhibits no observable reactivity toward O 2 . We have investigated the structure and bonding of Bi 18 − to understand its remarkable resistance to oxidation. We find that the most stable structure of Bi 18 − consists of two Bi 8 cages linked by a Bi 2 dimer, where each atom is bonded to three neighboring atoms. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that each Bi uses its three 6 p electrons to form three covalent bonds with its neighbors, resulting in a Bi 18 − cluster without any dangling bonds. We find that the robust Bi 18 framework along with the totally delocalized unpaired electron is responsible for the surprising inertness of Bi 18 − toward O 2 . The Bi 18 framework is similar to that in Hittorf’s phosphorus, suggesting the possibility to create bismuth nanoclusters with interesting structures and properties.",

          "abstract": "Over 200 genetic mutations in copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Among these, two ALS-causing mutants, histidine-46→arginine (H46R) and glycine-85→arginine (G85R), exhibit a decreased capacity to bind metal ions. Here, we report two cryo–electron microscopy structures of amyloid fibrils formed by H46R and G85R. These mutations lead to the formation of amyloid fibrils with unique structures distinct from those of the native fibril. The core of these fibrils features a serpentine arrangement with seven or eight β strands, secured by a hydrophobic cavity and a salt bridge between arginine-85 and aspartic acid–101 in the G85R fibril. We demonstrate that these mutant fibrils are notably more toxic and capable of promoting the aggregation of wild-type SOD1 more effectively, causing mitochondrial impairment and activating ferroptosis in cell cultures, compared to wild-type SOD1 fibrils. Our study provides insights into the structural mechanisms by which SOD1 mutants aggregate and induce cytotoxicity in ALS.",

To date, it features a high brightness of 0.5 mW cm −2 (32 cd m −2 ) and a record-low detection limit of 0.5 kPa in horizontal-sliding mode. Meanwhile, the SVTAS is applicable to convert acoustic waves into TIEL signals in contact-separation mode, showing the highest response to the 44.07 Hz sound, a high signal-to-noise ratio of 8.7 dB −1 , and an ultrafast response time of 0.8 ms. Furthermore, advanced artificial visualized perception systems are constructed with excellent performance in recognizing motion trajectories and human speech with different words/sentences.

Here, we aimed to better elucidate this relationship in healthy volunteers, using transcranial temporal interference electric stimulation (tTIS), a noninvasive technique allowing to selectively neuromodulate deep brain structures. We applied tTIS to the right HC-EC in either continuous or intermittent theta-burst stimulation patterns (cTBS or iTBS), compared to a control condition, during a virtual reality–based spatial navigation task and concomitant functional magnetic resonance imaging. iTBS improved spatial navigation performance, correlated with hippocampal activity modulation, and decreased grid cell–like activity in EC. Collectively, these data provide the evidence that human HC-EC activity can be directly and noninvasively modulated leading to changes of spatial navigation behavior. These findings suggest promising perspectives for patients suffering from cognitive impairment such as following traumatic brain injury or dementia.",

Under ultrasound irradiation, superoxide anions created by the piezocatalytic reaction of BTO NPs could immediately react with nitric oxide (NO) generated from NOBac to produce highly oxidative peroxynitrite ONOO − species in cascade, resulting in robust tumor piezocatalytic therapeutic efficacy, prompting prominent and sustained antitumoral immunoactivation simultaneously.

          "abstract": "Geminal bromofluoroalkenes are an important subclass of versatile organic interhalide, which can serve as useful synthetic precursors to monofluoroalkenes that are valuable amide group isosteres. Nonetheless, despite the vast advancement of olefination methodologies, the broadly applicable stereoselective synthesis remained elusive for geminal bromofluoroalkenes before our work. In particular, the seemingly straightforward Wittig-type approach with interhalogenated phosphorus ylide has been unsuccessful because of the difficulty in the diastereoselective oxaphosphetane formation. Here, we describe a conceptually distinctive strategy, by which the stereoselectivity is gained via the selective decomposition of the oxaphosphetane intermediates. The suitably identified phosphorus(III) reagent and reaction medium enabled efficient kinetic differentiation, which was supported by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and density functional theory calculation. Through our method, the highly diastereoselective synthesis of geminal E -bromofluoroalkenes was accomplished in one step. Furthermore, the generality was demonstrated by accommodating a wide range of readily available carbonyl compounds, including ketones and pharmaceutical substrates.",

Candidate “keystone molecules” are proposed to affect community structure and ecosystem functions, generally originating as defenses of primary producers; the broader effects of animal chemistry remain largely unexplored, however. Here, we characterize five previously unreported polyketides (alderenes A to E) biosynthesized by sea slugs reaching exceptional densities (up to 9000 slugs per square meter) in Northern Hemisphere estuaries. Alderenes comprise only 0.1% of slug wet weight, yet rendered live slugs or dead flesh unpalatable to three co-occurring consumers, making a potential food resource unavailable and redirecting energy flow in critical nursery habitat. Alderenes also displaced infauna from the upper sediment of the mudflat but attracted ovipositing snails. By altering communities, such compounds may have unexpected cascading effects on processes ranging from bioturbation to reproduction of species not obviously connected to the producing organisms, warranting greater attention by ecologists.",

Here, we report that caspase-2–driven apoptosis is elicited in blood cells failing cytokinesis and that extra centrosomes are necessary to trigger this cell death. Activation of caspase-2 depends on the PIDDosome multi-protein complex, and priming of PIDD1 at extra centrosomes is necessary for pathway activation. Accordingly, loss of its centrosomal adapter, ANKRD26, allows for cell survival and unrestricted polyploidization in response to cytokinesis failure. Mechanistically, cell death is initiated upstream of mitochondria via caspase-2–mediated processing of the BCL2 family protein BID, driving BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Remarkably, BID-deficient cells enforce apoptosis by engaging p53-dependent proapoptotic transcriptional responses initiated by caspase-2. Consistently, BID and MDM2 act as shared caspase-2 substrates, with BID being kinetically favored. Our findings document that the centrosome limits its own unscheduled duplication by the induction of PIDDosome-driven mitochondrial apoptosis to avoid potentially pathogenic polyploidization events.",

Dosing with interleukin-15 (IL-15) enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity in hypoxia, but preactivation with feeder cells bearing IL-21 and 4-1BBL was even better. Preactivation resulted in less perturbed metabolism in hypoxia; greater resistance to oxidative stress; and no hypoxia-induced loss of transcription factors (T-bet and Eomes), activating receptors, adhesion molecules (CD2), and cytotoxic proteins (TRAIL and FasL). There remained a deficit in CD122/IL-2Rβ when exposed to hypoxia, which affected IL-15 signaling.

Here, we present a lens system using metasurface folded optics to overcome these pervasive issues. In our design, metasurfaces are arranged horizontally on a glass wafer and direct light along multifolded paths inside the substrate. This approach achieves an ultra-slim lens system with a thickness of 0.7 millimeters and 2× thinner relative to the EFL, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional optical platforms.
