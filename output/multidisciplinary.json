          "abstract": "N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission throughout the brain1. As obligate heterotetramers, their activation requires the binding of both glycine and glutamate2. Although recent structural studies have provided insights into endogenous receptors from select brain regions3, most previous work has relied on recombinant receptors and engineered constructs, which limits our understanding of native NMDARs across the whole brain. Here we identify and resolve ten distinct native NMDAR assemblies from the whole-brain tissue of female C57BL/6 mice using immunoaffinity purification, single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Analyses of the GluN1–GluN2A(S1), GluN1–GluN2A(S2), GluN1–GluN2A(S3), GluN1–GluN2B, GluN1–GluN2A–GluN2B(S1), GluN1–GluN2A–GluN2B(S2), GluN1–GluN2A–GluNX(S1), GluN1–GluN2A–GluNX(S2), GluN1–GluN2B–GluNX and GluN1–GluNX structures reveal that GluN2A is the most prevalent subunit across assemblies. Moreover, the substantial conformational flexibility observed in the GluN2A amino-terminal domain may explain its fast kinetics and dominant role in gating. Dynamic movements of S-ketamine were also captured at the channel vestibule, as was pore dilation in both the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of a native GluN1–GluN2B receptor. The latter observation represents a previously unknown fully open state of NMDAR. Our large collection of heterogeneous NMDAR structures from whole brain reveals previously unrecognized properties of conformational diversity and channel dilation.",

          "abstract": "The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in 229Th at around 148.4 nm (refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6) offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the realization of a nuclear clock7,8. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation of large ensembles of 229Th nuclei in transparent crystals6,9,10,11 and the development of pulsed vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lasers12,13,14, have enabled initial laser spectroscopy of this transition15,16,17. However, the lack of an intense, narrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation8,18. Here we introduce and report a continuous-wave (CW) laser at 148.4 nm, generated by means of four-wave mixing (FWM)19 in cadmium vapour. The source delivers more than 100 nW of power with a projected linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength tunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth over all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm (refs. 12,13,14,20). We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique that places a stringent upper bound on FWM-induced phase noise, thereby supporting the feasibility of sub-hertz VUV linewidths. Our work addresses the central challenge towards a 229Th-based nuclear clock and establishes a widely tunable, ultranarrow-linewidth laser platform for potential applications across quantum information science21,22,23,24, condensed-matter physics25 and high-resolution VUV spectroscopy26.",

          "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) makes use of the principles of quantum mechanics to enable provably secure communication1,2. One substantial challenge persists in building large-scale QKD networks with many clients over long communication distances3. Although quantum relays continue to pose practical difficulties4, existing trusted-node networks5,6,7,8,9, point-to-multipoint networks10,11 and wavelength-multiplexed entanglement networks12,13 encounter issues such as reliance on trusted intermediaries or limited distances. Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) provides a compelling architecture that can overcome those issues while enhancing communication distance14. Although long-distance point-to-point TF-QKD has been achieved15,16,17,18,19,20,21, realizing large-scale networks requires scalable quantum devices. Here we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of an integrated-photonics TF-QKD network with exceptional scalability and reliability. This network includes 20 independent client-side QKD transmitter chips with one server-side optical microcomb chip. The microcomb generates a broad range of ultralow-noise coherent frequency combs with Hz-level linewidths, which serve as seeds and references for all client chips. Each client chip regenerates ultralow-noise light phase-locked to microcombs and prepares quantum keys. We sequentially implement pairwise QKD across 20 client chips through ten wavelength-multiplexed channels, with each surpassing the repeaterless bound at 370 km in spooled fibre, achieving a networking capability (client pairs × communication distance) of 3,700 km. We further demonstrate the wafer-scale reproducibility of both server-side microcomb chips and client-side QKD transmitter chips, together establishing system-level scalability. Combining mass-manufacturability, cost-effectiveness and high scalability of integrated photonics with long-distance quantum communication represents a viable path to large-scale quantum networks.",

          "abstract": "Inhibitory receptors like PD-1 and CTLA-4 contribute to T cell dysfunction in cancer1,2,3. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking the interactions in trans of these receptors with their ligands on cancer cells or in the tumour microenvironment lead to clinical responses in some but not all types of cancer. Signalling lymphocytic activation molecule 6 (SLAMF6, also known as Ly108) is a homotypic receptor preferentially expressed on progenitor or stem-like exhausted T (Tpex) cells, but not on terminally exhausted T (Tex) cells, as demonstrated in mouse models4,5,6,7,8,9. In contrast to Tex cells, Tpex cells retain the capacity for functional restoration after immune checkpoint blockade10,11,12. The role of SLAMF6 in T cells remains ambiguous, as it has both activating and inhibitory effects, complicating its evaluation as a therapeutic target. Here we find that SLAMF6 was triggered in cis by homotypic interactions at the T cell surface. These interactions elicited inhibitory effects that suppressed activation of T cells and limited anti-tumour immunity, independently of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells. mAbs against human SLAMF6 with a robust ability to disrupt the cis interactions strongly augmented T cell activation, reduced the proportions of exhausted T cells and inhibited tumour growth in vivo. Collectively, these findings show that SLAMF6 functions exclusively as a T cell inhibitory receptor, which is triggered by cis homotypic interactions. They also position SLAMF6 as a promising target for therapies aimed at enhancing anti-tumour immunity, regardless of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells.",

          "abstract": "Identifying a catalyst class to optimize the enantioselectivity of a new reaction, either involving a different combination of known substrate types or an entirely unfamiliar class of compounds, is a formidable challenge. Statistical models trained on a reported set of reactions can help predict out-of-sample transformations1–5 but often face two challenges: (1) only sparse data are available i.e., limited information on catalyst–substrate interactions, and (2) simple stereoelectronic parameters may fail to describe mechanistically complex transformations.6,7 Here we report a descriptor generation strategy that accounts for changes in the enantiodetermining step with catalyst or substrate identity, allowing us to model reactions involving distinct ligand and substrate types. As validating case studies, we collected data on enantioselective nickel-catalyzed C(sp3)-couplings8 and trained statistical models with features extracted from the transition states and intermediates proposed to be involved in asymmetric induction. These models allow for the optimization of poorly performing examples reported in a substrate scope and are applicable to unseen ligands and reaction partners. This approach offers the opportunity to streamline catalyst and reaction development, quantitatively transferring knowledge learned on sparse data to novel chemical spaces.",

Fear memory and extinction are underpinned by neural representations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) 1–7 , but the contribution of non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes, to these processes remains unresolved. Here, using in vivo calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging and causal astrocyte manipulations, we find that BLA astrocytes dynamically track fear state and support fear memory retrieval and extinction. By combining astrocyte manipulations with in vivo BLA neuronal Ca 2+ imaging and electrophysiological recordings, we show that astrocyte Ca 2+ signalling enables neuronal encoding of fear memory retrieval and extinction, and readout through a BLA–prefrontal circuit. Our findings reveal a key role for astrocytes in the generation and adaptation of fear-state-related neural representations, revising neurocentric models of critical amygdala-mediated adaptive functions.",

          "abstract": "Mpox, caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV; Orthopoxvirus monkeypox ), is on the rise in West and Central Africa 1–3 . African rodents, especially squirrels, are suspected to be involved in MPXV emergence, but no evidence of a direct transmission to humans or non-human primates has been established 4–9 . Here we describe an outbreak of MPXV in a group of wild sooty mangabeys ( Cercocebus atys ) in Taï National Park (Côte d’Ivoire). The outbreak affected one-third of the group, killing four infants. To track its origin, we analysed rodents and wildlife carcasses from the region. We identified a MPXV-infected fire-footed rope squirrel ( Funisciurus pyrropus ), found dead 3 km from the mangabey territory 12 weeks before the outbreak. MPXV genomes from the squirrel and the mangabey were nearly identical. A video record from 2014 showed a mangabey from this group eating the same squirrel species and diet metabarcoding of faecal samples collected from mangabeys before the outbreak identified two samples containing fire-footed rope squirrel DNA. One of these samples was also the first positive for MPXV. This represents a rare case of direct detection of interspecies transmission. Our findings indicate that rope squirrels were the source of the MPXV outbreak in mangabeys. Because squirrels and non-human primates are hunted, traded and consumed by humans in West and Central Africa 10,11 , exposure to these animals probably represents risk for zoonotic transmission of MPXV.",

          "abstract": "Lymphoedema is a chronic debilitating disease caused by impaired lymphatic drainage and is characterized by tissue swelling, fat expansion, inflammation and fibrosis1,2. However, the exact mechanisms that drive lymphoedema are poorly understood. Although lymphatic vessels are known to transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the systemic circulation3, the importance of impaired lymphatic drainage for cholesterol clearance in humans and its relevance to lymphoedema remain unknown. Here we show that lymphatic drainage insufficiency in human lymphoedema leads to excessive cholesterol accumulation in the lymphoedematous dermal tissue and around lymphatic vessels. Cholesterol deposition resulted in dermal adipose tissue remodelling, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction, progressing to death and dermal fibrosis. Surgical intervention improved lymphatic drainage and reduced cholesterol deposition. Using two mouse models that reproduce features of human lymphoedema, we demonstrated that tissue swelling and dermal adipose tissue remodelling were ameliorated by the cholesterol-depleting agent cyclodextrin. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that cyclodextrin restored lymphatic drainage by promoting the regeneration of lymphatic vessels. This study unravels the role of impaired cholesterol clearance in driving lymphoedema and identifies tissue cholesterol as a promising therapeutic target for this currently incurable disease.",

          "abstract": "Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum computers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum information non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a shared fermionic state whose occupation—either even or odd—defines the fermionic parity that encodes the qubit1. Notably, this parity can only be accessed by a measurement that couples two Majoranas to each other. A promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain1, implemented in quantum dots coupled using superconductors2. Even the minimal two-site chain hosts a pair of Majorana modes, often called ‘poor man’s Majoranas’, which are spatially separated but offer limited protection compared with longer chains3,4,5. Here we introduce a measurement technique that reads out their parity through quantum capacitance. Our method couples two Majoranas and resolves their parity in real time, visible as random telegraph switching with lifetimes exceeding a millisecond. Simultaneous charge sensing confirms that the two parity states are charge neutral and remain indistinguishable to a probe that does not couple the modes. These results establish the essential readout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a long-standing experimental challenge.",

          "abstract": "Orthosteric inhibitors block enzyme active sites and prevent substrates from binding 1 . Enhancing their specificity through substrate dependence seems inherently unlikely, as their mechanism hinges on direct competition rather than selective recognition. Here we show that a molecular glue mechanism unexpectedly imparts substrate-dependent potency to CSN5i-3, an orthosteric inhibitor of the COP9 signalosome (CSN). We first confirm that CSN5i-3 inhibits CSN, which catalyses NEDD8 (N8) deconjugation from the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, by occupying the active site of its catalytic subunit, CSN5, and directly competing with the iso-peptide bond substrate. Notably, the orthosteric inhibitor binds free CSN with only micromolar affinity, yet achieves nanomolar potency in blocking its deneddylase activity. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the enzyme–substrate–inhibitor complex reveal that active site-engaged CSN5i-3 occludes the substrate iso-peptide linkage while simultaneously extending an N8-binding exosite of CSN5, acting as a molecular glue to cement the N8–CSN5 interaction. The cooperativity of this trimolecular CSN5i-3–N8–CSN5 assembly, in turn, sequesters CSN5i-3 at its binding site, conferring high potency to the orthosteric inhibitor despite its low affinity for the free enzyme. Together, our findings highlight the modest affinity requirements of molecule glues for individual target proteins and establish orthosteric molecular glue inhibitors as a new class of substrate-dependent enzyme antagonists.",

Although the tuning of neurons in other areas of this system is unstable—evidenced, for example, by the change in the spatial tuning of hippocampal place cells3 across days4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11—the stability of the neuronal code that underlies the sense of direction remains unclear. Here, by longitudinally tracking the activity of the same HD cells in the post-subiculum of freely moving mice, we show stability and plasticity at two levels. Although the population structure remained highly conserved across environments and over time, subtle shifts in population coherence encoded environment identity. In addition, the HD system established a distinct, environment-specific alignment between its internal representation and external landmarks, which persisted for weeks, even after a single exposure. These findings suggest that the HD system forms long-lasting orientation memories that are anchored to specific environments.",

Striatal dopamine release signals the reward-predictive value of cues1,2, probably contributing to motivation3,4, but it is unclear how dopamine incorporates an animal’s ongoing trajectory for effective behavioural guidance. Here we demonstrate that cue-evoked striatal dopamine release in mice encodes bidirectional trajectory errors reflecting the relationship between the speed and direction of ongoing movement relative to optimal goal trajectories. Trajectory error signals could be computed from locomotion or visual flow, and were independent from simultaneous dopamine increases reflecting learned cue value. Joint trajectory error and cue-value encoding were reproduced by the reward prediction error term in a standard reinforcement learning algorithm with mixed sensorimotor inputs. However, these two signals had distinct state space requirements, suggesting that they could arise from a common reinforcement learning algorithm with distinct neural inputs. Striatum-wide multifibre array measurements resolved overlapping, yet temporally and anatomically separable, representations of trajectory error and cue value, indicating how functionally distinct dopamine signals for motivation and guidance are multiplexed across striatal regions to facilitate goal-directed behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Aluminium comprises over 8% of Earth’s crust and is the most abundant metallic constituent1. Historically, aluminium catalysis has predominantly exploited the inherent Lewis acidity associated with its stable +III oxidation state2. Owing to its uniquely low electronegativity (1.61)—the lowest among p-block elements—and the absence of an inert-pair effect, aluminium presents formidable intrinsic challenges for engaging in catalytic redox transformations. Here we report the redox catalytic capability of a low-valent aluminium species, carbazolylaluminylene3, which carries out a complete Al(I)/Al(III) catalytic cycle encompassing oxidative addition, double insertion, intramolecular isomerization and reductive elimination—fundamental mechanistic steps conventionally exclusive to transition-metal catalysis. Leveraging this Al(I)/Al(III) redox cycle, we achieve highly efficient and regioselective Reppe cyclotrimerization of alkynes4,5, producing diverse benzene derivatives with a turnover number of up to 2,290. Through X-ray crystallographic and quantum chemical analyses, we elucidate how the dynamic nitrogen geometry within the carbazolyl ligand framework precisely modulates the aluminium coordination environment, thereby facilitating the catalytic cycle. This work fundamentally advances the conceptual understanding of main-group redox catalysis. It further sets a compelling precedent for future catalyst design and sustainable synthetic methodologies centred on aluminium redox transformations.",

However, PeLEDs still underperform compared with organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with an EQE of about 40% because of insufficient charge confinement and defect-caused non-radiative recombination on the film surface. Here we report a spontaneously formed 3D/2D vertically oriented perovskite heterojunction by means of a simple one-step spin-coating method, which could effectively confine the charge carriers and shift the radiation zone away from the defect-rich surface region. Notably, the 2D perovskite on top exhibits a wrinkled surface morphology, which offers up to 45.4% light extraction efficiency. The resulting PeLEDs achieved an EQE of 42.9% for the green emission (certified 42.3%). Our work sheds light on the strategies for fabricating high-efficiency PeLEDs in the future.",

          "abstract": "Caribbean reefs have experienced major human-driven changes to their coral and fish communities 1–4 , yet how these changes have affected trophic dynamics remains poorly understood owing to challenges in reconstructing the trophic structure of pre-human-impact reefs. Advances in fossil-bound protein nitrogen isotope ( 15 N/ 14 N) analysis now enable the reconstruction of ancient trophic dynamics 5,6 , as the 15 N to  14 N ratio reflects an animal’s trophic position 7 . Here we apply this method to modern and prehistoric (7,000-year-old) fish otoliths (ear stones) and corals from Caribbean Panama and the Dominican Republic, focusing on fishes occupying low to middle trophic levels. We find that although the trophic level typically declined in high-trophic-level fishes over time, it increased or remained unchanged in low-trophic-level fishes, indicating that modern food chains are 60–70% shorter than on the prehistoric reefs in both Panama and the Dominican Republic. Furthermore, across all trophic groups, we observed a marked reduction in dietary variation, with a 20–70% lower trophic range on the modern reefs compared to the prehistoric reefs. This pattern is best explained by less dietary specialization in modern reefs, consistent with less ecological complexity than in prehistoric reefs. These differences document and quantify the trophic simplification that has occurred on modern Caribbean reefs, a change that may increase their vulnerability to ecosystem collapse.",

          "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the first relativistic quantum field theory, describes light–matter interactions at a fundamental level and is one of the pillars of the Standard Model (SM). Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits 1 , making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius r p , constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of r p from recent measurements 2–7 of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen 8,9 . This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S–6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of r p and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result ν 2S–6P = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of r p = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far.",

          "abstract": "The spin supersolid—a magnetic analogue of the supersolid that simultaneously exhibits solid and superfluid orders—has emerged as a promising sub-Kelvin refrigerant with strong low-energy fluctuations and associated entropic effects1. However, the stringent prerequisites have so far confined its presence to certain magnetic insulators. Here we report the discovery of a metallic spin supersolid in a rare-earth compound EuCo2Al9 (ECA), which is a good metal with excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. The high-spin Eu2+ ions form a three-dimensional lattice with stacked triangular layers, in which the spin-supersolid state is stabilized through a mechanism involving both Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) and dipolar couplings. Neutron diffraction shows microscopic evidence of spin supersolidity, demonstrating the coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane spin orders in this alloy. Our RKKY–dipolar model successfully captures the metallic spin-supersolid Y and V phases in ECA, along with the 1/3 magnetization plateau. The observed nonclassical magnetization behaviours within these phases point to significant quantum fluctuations, probably enhanced by the conduction electrons. The resistivity measurements provide a transport probe for the spin-supersolid transitions, because of scattering of conduction electrons from local moments. Through the adiabatic demagnetization process, ECA achieves ultralow cooling to 106 mK, exhibiting a giant magnetocaloric effect that manifests sharp anomalies in the magnetic Grüneisen ratio. ECA emerges as one of the first metallic spin supersolids, combining low cooling temperature, large magnetic entropy and ultrahigh thermal conductivity for high-performance sub-Kelvin refrigeration.",

          "abstract": "Ancient DNA studies revealed that, in Europe from 6500 to 4000 bce, descendants of western Anatolian farmers mixed with local hunter-gatherers resulting in 70–100% ancestry turnover1, then steppe ancestry spread with the Corded Ware complex 3000–2500 bce2. Here we document an exception in the wetland, riverine and coastal areas of the Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, using genome-wide data from 112 people 8500–1700 bce. A distinctive population with high (approximately 50%) hunter-gatherer ancestry persisted 3,000 years later than in most European regions, reflecting incorporation of female individuals of Early European Farmer ancestry into local communities. In the western Netherlands, the arrival of the Corded Ware complex was also exceptional: lowland individuals from settlements adopting Corded Ware pottery had hardly any steppe ancestry, despite a Y-chromosome characteristic of people associated with the early Corded Ware complex. These distinctive patterns may reflect the specific ecology that they inhabited, which was not amenable to full adoption of the early Neolithic type of farming introduced with Linearbandkeramik3, and resulted in distinct communities where transfer of ideas was accompanied by little gene flow. This changed with the formation of Lower Rhine–Meuse Bell Beaker users by fusion of local people (13–18%) and Corded Ware associated migrants of both sexes. Their subsequent expansion then had a disruptive impact across a much wider part of northwestern Europe, especially in Great Britain where they were the main source of a 90–100% replacement of local Neolithic ancestry.",

A key feature of polyatomic molecules is the presence of parity-doublet states. These structures, which generically arise from the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom afforded by polyatomic molecules, are a powerful feature to pursue diverse quantum science applications7. Linear triatomic molecules contain ℓ-type parity-doublet states in the vibrational bending mode, which are predicted to exhibit robust coherence properties. Here we report optically trapped CaOH molecules prepared in ℓ-type parity-doublet states and realize a bare qubit coherence time of \\({T}_{2}^{* }=0.8(2)\\,{\\rm{s}}\\), which is longer than the 0.36 s lifetime of the bending mode10,11. We suppress differential Stark shifts by cancelling ambient electric fields using molecular spectroscopy and characterize parity-dependent trap shifts, which are found to limit the coherence time. The parity-doublet coherence times achieved in this work are a defining milestone for the use of polyatomic molecules in quantum science.",

          "abstract": "Sleep is viewed typically through a brain-centric lens, with little known about the role of the periphery 1,2 . Here we identify a sleep function for peripheral macrophage-like cells (haemocytes) in the Drosophila circulation, showing that haemocytes track to the brain during sleep and take up lipids accumulated in cortex glia due to wake-associated oxidative damage. Through a screen of phagocytic receptors expressed in haemocytes, we discovered that knockdown of eater —a member of the Nimrod receptor family—reduces sleep. Loss of eater also disrupts haemocyte localization to the brain and lipid uptake, which results in increased brain levels of acetyl-CoA and acetylated proteins, including mitochondrial proteins PGC1α and DRP1. Dysregulation of mitochondria, reflected in high oxidation and reduced NAD + , is accompanied by impaired memory and lifespan. Thus, peripheral blood cells, which we suggest are precursors of mammalian microglia, perform a daily function of sleep to maintain brain function and fitness.",

After initial lesion recognition by XPC in global genome repair or by stalled RNA polymerases in transcription-coupled repair, a lesion and surrounding DNA duplex are unwound by TFIIH, which includes the ATPases XPB and XPD, and additional NER factors XPA, XPF, XPG and RPA, to form a DNA bubble2 comprising around 27 nucleotides. The double strand–single strand (ds-ss) junction-specific endonucleases XPF and XPG cleave DNA on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the lesion, respectively. Here we report the functional steps and atomic structures of the ATPase-driven and lesion-dependent DNA bubble formation and arrangement of the complete NER factors for dual incision. The unwinding of nearly 30 base pairs of DNA depends mainly on the double strand DNA translocase XPB and the duplex dividers XPA and XPF. XPD binds the lesion strand with XPF at the 5′ ds-ss junction. XPF cuts the lesion strand only after XPG binds the 3′ ds-ss junction. The ERCC1 subunit of XPF facilitates DNA strand separation and recruitment of RPA to the non-lesion strand. These findings provide insights on the causes of human diseases and potential targets for enhancing chemotherapeutic efficacy.",

          "authors": "Kyle Higham, Sadao Nagaoka",
          "abstract": "Language barriers and translation costs are persistent obstacles to communication and have particularly pronounced economic impacts in technical domains. Here we provide causal evidence on the effects of language barriers on the speed and extent of knowledge diffusion by exploiting a change in US patent policy that resulted in earlier disclosure of English-language technical knowledge from Japan. Using a targeted sample of 2,770 citations from US-based inventors to Japanese inventions, we find that language barriers accounted for almost half the diffusion lag of Japan-originating knowledge to US-based inventors, relative to Japan-based inventors. This acceleration is significant only for firms with limited ability to translate (small research and development scale, or little involvement in the Japanese market) and is more pronounced for the diffusion of high-quality inventions, suggesting difficulties in quality-targeted translation. Thus, early publication of patent applications provides a substantial public good for cumulative innovation through accelerated access to translated foreign patents.",

          "abstract": "Human experience intertwines continuity, the seamless flow of events, with segmentation, the spontaneous partitioning of experience into discrete units. Despite their cognitive significance, it is unclear whether these processes operate independently or share a common mechanism. Here we explored this question by examining the link between serial dependence (SD)—the tendency to align perceptions with prior decisions—and the impact of event boundaries, prompted by contextual shifts, on memory. Considering a Bayesian perspective that associates SD with predictions, and segmentation with prediction errors, a common mechanism may govern both processes. Across three experiments (N = 816), we tested how contextual changes affect SD and segmentation-related memory effects. The results indicate that both processes are context-sensitive. Contextual boundaries can reduce SD even in the absence of sensory change, and boundaries modulate memory in ways consistent with event segmentation. Yet, across experiments we observed dissociable patterns of boundary effects on SD and memory, which are slightly more consistent with distinct contextual influences on perception and memory than with a single unified predictive system. Boundary effects on SD and memory did not covary across participants, but given the low within-participant reliability of these measures, this absence of correlation cannot be taken as strong evidence for independence. Overall, our findings show that both SD and memory are shaped by context, but clarifying whether they reflect a shared or partly distinct mechanism will require further research.",

          "abstract": "To discern speech or appreciate music, the human auditory system detects how pitch changes over time (pitch motion). Here, using psychophysics, computational modelling, functional neuroimaging and analysis of recorded speech, we ask whether humans can detect pitch motion using computations analogous to those used by the visual system. We adapted stimuli from studies of vision to create novel auditory correlated noise stimuli that elicited robust pitch motion percepts. In psychophysical experiments, we discovered that humans can judge pitch direction from spectrotemporal intensity correlations. Robust sensitivity to negative spectrotemporal correlations is a direct analogue of illusory ‘reverse-phi’ motion in vision, constituting a new auditory illusion. Functional MRI measurements in auditory cortex supported the hypothesis that human auditory processing may employ pitch direction opponency. Linking lab findings to real-world perception, we analysed recordings of English and Mandarin speech and found that pitch direction was signalled by both positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations, suggesting that sensitivity to both types confers ecological benefits. This work reveals how motion detection algorithms sensitive to local correlations are deployed by the central nervous system across disparate modalities (vision and audition) and dimensions (space and frequency).",

Various centres of ruminant domestication and diffusion routes of agropastoralism have been identified. The area between the northern and central Zagros Mountains on the Iranian Plateau is a cradle for goat domestication and eastward spread of agropastoralism. However, the early exploitation of ruminant milk by pastoral communities in the Zagros remains insufficiently studied. Here we show residues of caprine dairy products that were detected from the analysis of lipid residues in pottery vessels and protein residues in human dental calculus. These results, combined with the faunal spectra and radiocarbon analyses directly on the dairy residues, show that sheep and goat dairy products were widely exploited in the Zagros from the seventh millennium BC. This pattern parallels the contemporaneous exploitation of cattle milk in Anatolia. Neolithic communities in both regions reveal similarly complex dynamics of early ruminant milk use, marking the emergence of independent yet synchronous trajectories in the diffusion of agropastoral lifeways.",

Our findings reveal that episodes of reduced NPP around the 70s–100s, 360s–380s, and 470s–560s CE likely contributed to the westward and southward migration of nomadic people from their homelands in northwestern China and Mongolia. Although prolonged multidecadal periods of climate-induced low NPP served as tipping points for agricultural and pastoral subsistence systems, the inherent mobility of nomadic communities not only enabled them to adapt to adverse environmental conditions but also facilitated a widespread dispersal of ethnic groups.",

          "abstract": "The expansion of commodity agriculture into tropical forests leads to major social–ecological impacts. Yet little is known about where and how the capitalized actors driving this expansion interact with smallholders, particularly where smallholders live inside the forest. Two alternative outcomes of their interactions on deforestation are plausible: accelerated deforestation as all actors compete for land (i.e., land rush hypothesis) or, alternatively, slower deforestation as actors hinder each other’s expansion (i.e., competition hypothesis). We test these hypotheses for two global deforestation hotspots: the Dry Chaco and the Chiquitano Forests (together nearly 1 million km 2 ), using a land-systems representation that captures spatially overlapping land-use actors. We integrate satellite-based forest-loss time series with an independent reconstruction of land-system change from 2000 to 2023 in a Bayesian regression framework. This reveals three key findings: First, capitalized agriculture has expanded mainly over areas used by forest-dependent smallholders and Indigenous communities, indicating strongly intensifying land competition. Second, where forest-dwelling smallholders persist, their presence can mitigate deforestation pressure from expanding commodity frontiers. Third, the presence of either forest-dwelling smallholders or conservation areas maintains forest cover, but their combined presence does not amplify the protection effect. Overall, our findings show that interactions between agribusinesses and smallholders are key factors that shape the social–ecological outcomes of frontier expansion in the tropics. Accounting for land-system overlaps in research and policymaking on frontiers can therefore improve efforts to safeguard forests while supporting traditional livelihoods, especially in contested, rapidly changing landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Forecast models are a key decision-support tool for public health authorities in managing epidemics, feeding into early warning systems, scenario evaluations, and an empirical basis for resource allocation. In Brazil, improving dengue forecasting became a priority in response to the unprecedented increase in cases, which surpassed the total of the previous decade and expanded to new regions. The Infodengue-Mosqlimate consortium launched the Infodengue-Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge 2024 (IMDC24), or Dengue Forecast Sprint, bringing together six international teams provided with cases and climate covariates data to generate actionable forecasts for 2024 and 2025 seasons in five diverse Brazilian states, leveraging advanced machine learning and classical statistical models. This paper outlines the structure and findings of the IMDC24. The performance of the models varied between years and locations, and no single model consistently excelled, especially during 2024’s unprecedentedly large season. This performance variability highlighted the need for ensemble approaches. The ensemble models developed are presented as the main results of this collaborative development. As intended, the ensemble models have been adopted by Brazilian public health authorities to help with planning and response to the forecasted 2025 dengue epidemics across the country.",

          "abstract": "Expectations can shape perception and potentially lead to self-fulfilling prophecies such as placebo effects that persist or grow over time. Nonetheless, whether and how unreinforced and unconditioned social cues (i.e., suggestions about future experiences that have not been reinforced with reward or punishment) can create and sustain such effects is unknown. We conducted a set of experiments in which participants (N = 111) experienced stimuli eliciting somatic pain (heat), vicarious pain (videos of others in pain), and cognitive effort (a mental-rotation task), at three intensity levels each. Before each stimulus, participants viewed a social cue that ostensibly indicated ratings from 10 other participants but was in fact randomized to a high or low mean aversiveness level independent of actual stimulus intensity. Across all tasks, participants’ expectations and experience ratings shifted in line with the cues, with high-aversive cues leading to higher perceived aversiveness. Computational modeling and behavioral analysis revealed lower learning rates for prediction errors inconsistent with the trial’s cue value (e.g., better than expected for high-aversive cues) and higher learning rates for prediction errors consistent with the cue value (e.g., worse than expected for high-aversive cues). These findings reveal a confirmation bias in learning: people update more when outcomes align with expectations. Combined with expectation effects on perception, this bias helps sustain social cue effects. Together, these mechanisms show how social information can shape perception and learning, giving rise to self-fulfilling prophecies.",

Drawing from 13,823 publications across Scopus, Web of Science, and a curated library of ESI valuation studies, we identify 171 studies that applied ESI in a decision context and used a valuation method to compare outcomes with and without ESI. The majority of these studies employed decision analysis methods (e.g., Value of Information, Cost–Benefit Analysis), focusing primarily on quantitative instrumental values (e.g., profit, crop yield, lives saved), particularly in agricultural contexts. A smaller set of studies applied preference elicitation methods (e.g., stated preference, surveys, interviews, focus groups) to capture qualitative benefits and relational values including quality of life improvements, empowerment, and procedural justice. Many excluded studies demonstrated scientific value of ESI but did not explicitly translate that into societal value, revealing the need for a more systematic approach to ESI valuation. By promoting a more inclusive, interdisciplinary, and flexible portfolio of valuation methods, we aim to expand our understanding of the societal benefits of ESI to help guide investment in future missions, enhance public support, and ensure that science and policy goals are well aligned.",

          "abstract": "Conservation and environmental management are under increased scrutiny as the embeddedness of oppressive practices has gained wider societal and scholarly attention. As conservation and environmental practitioners and scholars grapple with foundational assumptions and practices of the field, there remains a pressing need to identify persistent problematic legacies and articulate a positive vision for conservation grounded in an ethic of justice. To help advance this conversation, we present a framework of four intersecting dimensions of oppression: 1) the physical or material manifestations of conservation and environmental management; 2) the knowledge practices and assumptions that inform and underpin conservation and environmental visions and decision-making; 3) the modes of governance associated with conservation and environmental practice; and 4) the forms of relational praxis implicitly and explicitly endorsed and/or imposed in conservation and other environmental arenas. We explain the framework through an analysis of the legacy of fortress conservation, then illustrate the framework’s wider application to diagnose ongoing elements of oppression in other environmental arenas (wildland fire, riverine flows). We then review prominent strategies and visions for moving forward for both nature and people to highlight both positive steps being taken and the utility of the framework in ensuring emergent environmental paradigms avoid the pitfalls of the past. Viewing each dimension of oppression as moveable levers to promote antioppressive conservation futures, we conclude with a set of questions to help conservation and environmental management scientists and practitioners identify where oppression might be manifest in their own work, and begin to embody antioppressive practices.",

          "abstract": "First impressions often hinge on visible cues, leading people to infer the trustworthiness of strangers from their appearance and dress. While religiosity is generally associated with greater perceived trustworthiness, little is known about how visible religious markers, such as clothing and grooming styles, shape trust judgments in Muslim-majority societies, where such signals are widespread and easily recognizable. We examine this question using a large-scale vignette experiment embedded in a nationally representative face-to-face survey in Turkey. By experimentally varying profile characteristics, we identify the causal effect of a Muslim headscarf or beard on perceived trustworthiness. Contrary to expectations, individuals displaying these religious badges are generally viewed as less trustworthy than otherwise identical profiles, even by highly religious respondents. Mediation analyses show that these effects arise because religious badges signal multiple attributes, not only religiosity but also political orientation and physical attractiveness—and that these inferred meanings differ by gender: women’s headscarves and men’s beards prompt distinct patterns of inference. These findings show that visible religious markers shape trust judgments through multivalent social inferences rather than perceived piety alone. The results highlight how observers draw on broader social and political associations when interpreting religious markers, providing evidence on how public expressions of religion affect everyday trust judgments.",

          "abstract": "Function diversity, the range of tasks individuals perform, and specialization, the distribution of function abundances, are fundamental to complex adaptive systems. In the absence of overarching principles, these properties have appeared domain-specific. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification and specialization of functions across disparate systems, including bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. We find that the number of functions grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents from 0.35 to 0.57, consistent with Heaps’ law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic scaling. To explain these empirical findings, we generalize the Yule-Simon model by introducing two key parameters: a diversification parameter that characterizes how existing functions inhibit the creation of new ones and a specialization parameter that describes how a function’s attractiveness depends on its abundance. Our model enables cross-system comparisons, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas. The analysis suggests that what drives the creation of new functions depends on the system’s goals and structure: federal agencies tend to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary functions; cities tend to slow the creation of new occupations as existing ones expand; and cells occupy an intermediate position. Once functions are introduced, their growth follows a remarkably universal pattern across all systems.",

An extensive literature in welfare economics addresses the matter. Nevertheless, economists have often simplified policy analysis by assuming that individuals have homogeneous, consequentialist, and self-centered preferences. Individuals may hold heterogeneous private and distributional preferences. To enhance policy analysis, economists should specify social welfare functions that express the richness and variety of actual personal preferences. The possibilities are vast. I focus on preferences for equity. There has been much controversy regarding interpretation of equity, a term that public discourse has used in vague and conflicting ways. Specifying social welfare functions that formally express different interpretations of equity will not eliminate disagreements, but it should clarify concepts and reduce the inconsistencies that afflict verbal communication.",

          "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a key question for researchers and authorities was to understand the psychological motivations that sustained public engagement in protective behavior such as physical distancing and hygienic protection. While feelings of threat were rampant during the pandemic, theories of health psychology have highlighted appraisals related to the ability to cope (e.g., the feeling of being able to adhere cost-effectively to government advice) and argued that coping appraisals are superior predictors of motivations to protect the self against risks. In this study, we conducted a massive population-based comparison of the association between, on the one hand, threat appraisals and coping appraisals and, on the other hand, protection against actual infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. We built a unique Danish data infrastructure that links surveys of ~8% of the adult population (N = 386,633) with the individual results of the 123 million COVID-19 tests performed during 22 mo of the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for a comprehensive range of sociodemographic measures and employing panel data to bolster internal validity, we observe that stronger coping appraisals are consistently associated with lower individual probability of COVID-19 infection risk. We find no consistent evidence of a similar association for threat appraisals. Threat appraisals rather seem to index individual feelings of infection exposure. As appeals to fear also have unintended negative consequences (including anxiety, fatigue, and stigmatization), the findings offer strong support for relying on coping-oriented public health policy and communication in future societal crises in the domain of health and beyond.",

However, the potency, specificity, and structural characteristics of these antibodies remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the antibody responses of naturally infected wild dromedary camels in Tunisia, a MERS-CoV-endemic region. Plasma antibodies from nine camels exhibited variable neutralizing activity, generally increasing with age, and were largely autologous, with minimal cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. From a VHH antibody library derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a single camel (D17), we identified 34 unique sequences with previously unreported germline origins and unusually long complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. Eight representative VHHs, expressed as human Fc fusions, displayed high-affinity binding to the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) and broad neutralization to RBD mutants (IC 50 : 1.05 to 9.55 ng/mL). Crystal structural analysis revealed distinct neutralization mechanisms: VHH-227 fully blocked DPP4 binding, achieving complete neutralization, while VHH-T71, with partial neutralization (~80%), targeted the RBD core subdomain.

          "abstract": "Abdominal ultrasound has emerged as a noninvasive modality with immunomodulatory potential. Although its anti-inflammatory effects have been demonstrated in various disease models, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies suggest that ultrasound promotes anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) signaling in the spleen. However, the upstream events initiating this response have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that abdominal ultrasound activates afferent vagal fibers and suppress systemic inflammation. In a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia, abdominal ultrasound significantly reduced plasma TNF-α levels. This anti-inflammatory effect was attenuated by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDVx) or afferent vagal blockade. Electrophysiological recordings revealed increased cervical vagus nerve activity during ultrasound stimulation, which was eliminated by intraperitoneal lidocaine, confirming activation of abdominal sensory afferents. Furthermore, abdominal ultrasound induced c-Fos expression in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), consistent with central activation via vagal afferent input. These findings provide direct mechanistic evidence that abdominal ultrasound stimulates afferent vagal pathways.",

          "abstract": "Active matter refers to a broad class of nonequilibrium systems where energy is continuously injected at the level of individual “particles.” These systems exhibit emergent collective behaviors that have no direct thermal-equilibrium counterpart. Their scale ranges from micrometer-sized swarms of bacteria to meter-scale human crowds. In recent years, the role of topology and self-propelled topological defects in active systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in polar and nematic active matter. Building on these ideas, we investigate emergent collective dynamics in apolar active granular fluids. Using isotropic granular vibrators as a model experimental system of apolar active Ornstein–Uhlenbeck particles in a dry environment, we uncover a distinctive three-stage time evolution arising from the intricate interplay between activity and inelastic interactions. By analyzing the statistics, spatial correlations, and dynamics of vortex-like topological defects in the displacement vector field, we demonstrate their ability to describe this intrinsic collective motion. Furthermore, associated to these topological defects, we reveal the onset of a turbulent-like inverse energy cascade, where kinetic energy transfers across different length scales over time. As the system evolves, the power scaling of the energy transfer increases with the duration of observation. Our findings show that topological concepts can be extended to the nonequilibrium dynamics of apolar active matter, revealing a direct link between microscopic topological processes and emergent large-scale behaviors in active granular fluids that lack both a well-defined direction of motion and an intrinsic axis of orientation at the particle scale.",

Programming a material’s macroscopic properties via molecular-level structural control is a grand scientific challenge, requiring methods for inverse design that can design a targeted molecule to achieve a given self-assembled structure. One model system that serves as a common proving ground for inverse design algorithms is block copolymers. In these systems, self-consistent field-theory (SCFT) provides a robust thermodynamic model for predicting self-assembly for a given molecular sequence. This work presents a computational algorithm which learns the reverse translation, allowing a target structure to be achieved by varying molecular sequence. The algorithm is based on development of an adjoint solution of the SCFT equations allowing incorporation of automatic differentiation. The power of this algorithm is demonstrated by inverse designing polymer sequences to yield equilibrium structures, resolving the long-standing dilemma of navigating the combinatorial explosion of sequence possibilities offered by complex copolymer designs. The inverse designed sequences show that the algorithm learns to modulate unfavorable block interactions to stabilize these complex morphologies. By learning how to program self-assembly at the molecular-level using only a thermodynamic model, this work opens the door to similar computational inverse design across other soft matter systems.",

          "abstract": "In natural environments, bacteria often encounter low concentrations of nutrient mixtures that are continuously replenished by physical processes such as fluid flow. Studying bacterial physiology under such conditions is experimentally challenging because it is difficult to maintain steady, low nutrient concentrations with rapid renewal. Most studies on nutrient limitation have used approaches such as the chemostat, which rely on long renewal times to sustain low concentrations. We developed a Millifluidic Continuous Culture Device (MCCD), inspired by microfluidics, that enables bacterial cultivation in nutrient mixtures at low micromolar concentrations with rapid renewal driven by fluid flow. Unlike microfluidic systems, the MCCD retains sufficient culture volume to support batch-scale ‘omic analyses. Using the MCCD, we cultured Escherichia coli in a mixture of amino acids and nucleobases at three concentration ranges spanning a fivefold difference in growth rates. Surprisingly, at the lowest concentration range, cells exhibited proteomic signatures of iron limitation despite equal total ferrous iron across conditions. Uptake experiments with labeled iron–histidine and iron–cysteine complexes confirmed that amino acids facilitated ferrous iron acquisition. Under continuous flow, siderophores were washed out, rendering this pathway ineffective and revealing a previously unrecognized mechanism of iron acquisition via soluble ferrous iron–amino acid complexes. These findings highlight the importance of studying bacterial physiology at low nutrient concentrations and also suggest a broader role for other organic substrates capable of complexing iron as potential iron sources in environments with rapid renewal.",

Here, we study a dynamical model of droplet nucleation and growth to demonstrate how phase separation allows cells to discriminate small concentration differences on finite, biologically relevant timescales.

We demonstrate that the fTFs are widely expressed not only in leukemia blasts but also in differentiated myeloid and lymphoid cells, indicating hematopoietic stem cells or multipotent progenitors (HSCs/MPPs) as LSCs that propagate altered cellular differentiation hierarchies, including immune cells. DNA-FISH confirms the presence of fTFs in T lymphoid and erythroid cells, and targeted sequencing of secondary mutations in sublineages of cells corroborates hierarchical and stepwise leukemogenesis. By tracking RUNX1::RUNX1T1 -expressing cells in patients with or without relapse post–frontline chemotherapy, we highlight the necessity of eradicating LSCs to achieve sustained long-term complete remission and restore a functional immune system capable of suppressing residual disease over time. Comparative single-cell transcriptome analyses further reveal that fTFs are associated with AML subtype-specific differentiation defects in both innate and adaptive immune compartments, suggesting an altered landscape of immune cell–cell communication networks that may facilitate the survival and proliferation of leukemic blasts. Through the examination of intercellular communications among various putative fTF + and normal cell populations, we developed a ligand–receptor (L–R)-based risk-scoring model with independent prognostic value. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the cells of origin of LSCs and the implications of fTF expression for the immune landscape of AML.",

Our analysis projects a net decline of 36 to 50% of areas in climate suitability for grazing by 2100, accompanied by inter- and intracontinental shift of grazing suitability. These changes are expected to negatively affect 110 to 140 million pastoralists and 1.4 to 1.6 billion livestock, with particularly severe impacts in Africa. We further show that 51 to 81% of these impacted populations reside in countries with low income, serious hunger, severe gender inequality, and high political fragility.

Here, we have shown on an in vitro heart-on-a-chip platform, primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes can serve as a viable model showing sex chromosome-driven characteristics when presented with identical experimental conditions. With controlled experimental conditions, the self-assembly of isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in morphological differences in the structure of the contractile apparatus. More importantly, the assembly of cardiac cells into confluent monolayers had a sex chromosome-driven divergence in both structure and the corresponding function. This work reports the characterization of the difference between sex-specific neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in in vitro culture.

Yet dissecting this context dependency remains challenging because we lack methods for tracking nutrients such as carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). Here, we developed an approach to quantitatively estimate C and P fluxes in the AM symbiosis from comprehensive network morphology quantification, achieved by robotic imaging and machine learning based on roughly 100 million hyphal shape measurements. We found that rates of C transfer from the plant and P transfer from the fungus were, on average, related proportionally to one another. This ratio was nearly invariant across AM fungal strains despite contrasting growth phenotypes but was strongly affected by plant host genotype. Fungal phenotype distributions were bounded by a Pareto front with a shape favoring specialization in an exploration–exploitation trade-off. This means AM fungi can be fast range expanders or fast resource extractors, but not both. Manipulating the C/P exchange rate by swapping the plant host genotype shifted this Pareto front, indicating that the exchange rate constrains possible AM fungal growth strategies. We show by mathematical modeling how AM fungal growth at fixed exchange rate leads to qualitatively different symbiotic outcomes depending on fungal traits and nutrient availability.",

Despite their clinical and molecular heterogeneity, spanning supratentorial, posterior fossa, and spinal subtypes, treatment remains limited to surgery and radiotherapy, with chemotherapy offering minimal benefit. Here, we performed transcriptomic analysis of 370 human ependymoma samples and identified two distinct molecular subgroups: EPN-E1 and EPN-E2. The EPN-E1 cluster is enriched for supratentorial tumors harboring ZFTA-RELA fusions (ZFTA-RELA fus ), which occur in over 70% of cases and are associated with poor prognosis. To identify targeted therapies for this aggressive subtype, we validated a ZFTA-RELA fus mouse model that recapitulates the human EPN-E1 transcriptome and used it for target discovery. Through Kinome Regularization, a machine learning-driven polypharmacology approach, we identified MERTK as a critical regulator of tumor cell viability. Genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of Mertk reduced cell growth ex vivo, and treatment with a clinical-grade MERTK inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor proliferation in vivo. Both human EPN-E1 tumors and ZFTA-RELA fus mouse tumors exhibited elevated expression of MERTK and its ligand GAS6, and MERTK inhibition led to suppression of pro-survival signaling pathways including MEK/ERK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase/Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase) and PI3K/AKT (Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase/Protein Kinase B). Notably, over 80% of genes upregulated in ZFTA-RELA fus tumors were downregulated following MERTK inhibition, indicating a strong dependency on this pathway for tumor maintenance. These findings define a signaling vulnerability in ZFTA-RELA-driven ependymomas and support the clinical development of MERTK-targeted therapies for patients with the high-risk EPN-E1 subtype.",

Here, we use immunofluorescence, mass spectrometry, and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize the spatial distribution, subunit composition, and structural architecture of native α1-containing GABA A Rs in the rat cerebellum. Confocal microscopy reveals robust colocalization of α1 and γ2 subunits across cerebellar layers, including prominent labeling at glomerular synapses. Biochemical purification and proteomic analysis identify a range of α, β, and γ subunits, along with abundant α6 and δ subunits. Using cryo-EM and automated subunit identification, we resolve eight α1-containing receptor assemblies, including the first structure of α6-containing receptors. We further determine the binding mode of the α6-selective pyrazoloquinolinone modulator PZ-II-029 at the α + /γ – interface, showing ligand-induced expansion of the entire extracellular domain (ECD). Together, our study defines the structure and subunit composition of the α1-containing cerebellar GABA A Rs and elaborates the molecular interactions between native receptors and pyrazoloquinolinone, thereby laying the groundwork for brain region and subunit-specific pharmacology.",

Activation of IPACL CRF neurons increased wakefulness, whereas their inhibition or deletion of NTS reduced wakefulness in novel environments. These neurons are activated in response to exposure to a novel environment and project primarily to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and release NTS, which modulates wakefulness.

Pharmacotherapy is the most widely used treatment for these disorders, and effective improvement requires a reliable animal model of human anxiety. Although communication in rats using ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) has been reported as a biologically valid animal model of human anxiety, an equivalent model in mice has not yet been established. To identify such USVs, we conducted physiological, behavioral, and pharmacological experiments using ddY strain mice. Ultrasonic sine waves within a limited frequency range enhanced anxiety levels in male mice. When female mice were exposed to ethologically stressful situations, they emitted a specific type of USV that was not only quantitatively abundant and qualitatively distinct but also within a frequency range that induced increased anxiety in male mice. Playback of these female USVs induced anxiety-related affective changes in male mice. We believe that these findings represent a step toward demonstrating ultrasonic vocal communication of negative affective states in laboratory mice. This study offers a foundation for developing mouse models using USVs as a tool to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of human anxiety disorders and to develop neuropharmacological therapies.",

          "abstract": "Previous experimental reports of long-range interactions in ionic liquids (ILs) stand in contradiction with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. To provide insights into the literature discrepancies regarding the experimental ranges of electrostatic screening, claimed with orders of magnitude larger, the interactions between pairs of mica and borosilicate surfaces confining ILs are investigated by two complementary advanced Surface Force Apparatuses. Regardless of differences in confinement geometries (crossed-cylinders, sphere-flat), radii of curvature (cm-mm), and measurement techniques (stepwise versus continuous approach), two ever present force regimes are evidenced. At small surface separations, oscillatory forces reflect IL structuration and layering, while outside this gap, the interaction is monotonic repulsive. In both regimes the spatial extent and force magnitude depend critically on motion conditions, as demonstrated by achieving velocities as low as 9 pm/s with equilibration times up to 90 s. At large separations, fast surface displacements generate long-range interactions (over tens of ion size) creating the illusion of anomalous underscreening, whereas increasingly slow ones shrink both magnitude and range of the repulsion with decay-lengths converging ultimately to a screening length consistent with Poisson–Boltzmann theory with finite ion sizes. The transition from apparent long-range to short-range screening unfolds over nearly two orders of magnitude in time, revealing slow relaxation dynamics reminiscent of aging phenomena. These findings definitely resolve a decade-old controversy on force measurements and reveal rich out-of-equilibrium dynamics. The hydrodynamic contribution to the net force is admittedly crucial to be reduced especially when relaxations span decades in time, but approaching thermodynamic equilibrium during measurements proves essential.",

PRC2 catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), which is targeted for chromatin compaction by PRC1. Importantly, PRC2-associated cofactors regulate its distinct activities, as in the case of MTF2 and JARID2 that direct PRC2 to specific chromatin nucleation sites based on preferred DNA-binding motifs. Here, we investigated EPOP whose role in regulating PRC2 was not well-defined. We find that both EPOP and MTF2 stimulate PRC2 histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity in vitro. Unlike MTF2, EPOP is ineffectual in PRC2 chromatin recruitment as evidenced by an EED-rescue system in vivo but promotes H3K27me3 deposition de novo in cooperation with MTF2 and JARID2. Binding assays using reconstituted dinucleosome substrates revealed that similar to MTF2, EPOP promotes PRC2 chromatin-binding activity in a distinct DNA-sequence-dependent manner (GCN-rich and GA-rich, respectively). Thus, EPOP and MTF2 in conjunction with JARID2 foster PRC2-mediated HMT activity at chromatin sites comprising cofactor-preferred DNA-binding sequences during the formation of H3K27me3-chromatin domains.",

          "abstract": "Mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) gene are linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Loss of PTEN causes hyperactivation of both mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Recent studies have shown that this dual hyperactivation is required for the neuropathology observed in PTEN -deficient human stem cell–derived neural cells. However, the molecular effectors that integrate these synergistic signals remain unknown. Here, we identify the actin-regulating ARP2/3 complex as a critical point of convergence downstream of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We show that concurrent hyperactivation of both complexes drives increased filamentous actin and elevated levels of the ARP2/3 complex subunits in PTEN -deficient human neural precursors (NPs) and neurons. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ARP2/3 is sufficient to rescue multiple disease-relevant phenotypes, including NP hyperproliferation, neuronal hypertrophy, and electrical hyperactivity, without affecting the upstream mTORC1 or mTORC2 hyperactivation. Together, these findings reveal the PTEN –mTOR–ARP2/3 signaling axis as a core mechanism of neuropathology and highlight ARP2/3 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for PTEN -related neurodevelopmental disorders.",

          "abstract": "The kinase MAPKAPK2 regulates cell survival, proliferation, and death, and is upregulated in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) where it is associated with tumor growth and progression. However, how it regulates tumor progression in conjunction with other signaling pathways, such as MEK/ERK, remains elusive. Solid tumors are often subjected to metabolic stress, notably glucose deprivation. Here, we demonstrate that MAPKAPK2 protein levels in CRC regulate cell fate decision during stress conditions, such as glucose deprivation and therapeutic treatment. While MAPKAPK2 expression is a limiting factor for CRC growth in vitro, depleting MAPKAPK2 or inhibiting its activity pharmacologically provides a survival advantage to CRC cells under glucose limiting conditions. Subjecting CRC cells to low glucose resulted in an ERK1/2-mediated decline in MAPKAPK2 to promote survival. Additionally, cells with reduced MAPKAPK2 activity were less sensitive to trametinib under glucose limiting conditions. Utilizing transcriptomic profiling, we found that glucose deprivation and MAPKAPK2 depletion activate pathways associated with survival during metabolic stress. This relationship was also observed in CRC patients (TCGA), where tumors with low MAPKAPK2 expression had higher ERK1/2 activation and upregulated stress-induced pathways, leading to poor survival. Finally, MAPKAPK2 modulated growth of CRC organoids, subcutaneous tumors, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and reduced MAPKAPK2 levels decreased efficacy of trametinib, in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this study identifies an interrelationship between MEK/ERK and p38/MAPKAPK2 signaling pathways during glucose deprivation to support cell survival and features MAPKAPK2 loss as a possible mechanism leading to reduced efficacy of trametinib-based anticancer therapy and poor patient outcomes in CRC.",

          "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that shares clinical features with multiple sclerosis (MS) but typically manifests with more severe symptoms. The presence of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies targeting aquaporin-4 (AQP4) channels on astrocytes serves as a highly specific biomarker that distinguishes NMOSD from MS. Unlike MS, NMOSD is characterized by profound astrocytic destruction and exhibits a distinct response to therapies. Notably, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) effective in MS, including natalizumab, interferon-β, and fingolimod, not only fail to benefit NMOSD patients but may also exacerbate disease progression. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying this immunomodulator-induced exacerbation, however, remain not yet fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that natalizumab alleviated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) while exacerbating the autoimmune astrocytopathy in an “EAE-NMOSD” mouse model, a phenomenon associated with a reduction in actively proliferating astrocytes. Through molecular and signaling pathway analyses, we identify that endothelial-derived vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) activates astrocytes via integrin α4 signaling, thereby mitigating astrocytopathy in NMOSD-like mice. Furthermore, astrocyte-specific integrin α4 deficiency exacerbates astrocytopathy, and notably, natalizumab-induced disease exacerbation does not occur in integrin α4-conditional knockout (CKO) mice. Finally, pharmacological activation of astrocytes rescues natalizumab-induced damage and ameliorates demyelination in NMOSD-like mice. Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic gaps regarding the clinical phenomenon underlying natalizumab-induced NMOSD exacerbation and suggest astrocyte-targeted therapeutic strategies as a potential intervention for NMOSD.",

          "abstract": "Cell fates regulated by ERK respond to different thresholds of signaling strength. In mammalian cells, conditions that activate ERK to submaximal levels are sufficient to sustain proliferation, survival, and transformation, while stimuli that activate ERK to very high levels often lead to cell death or cell cycle arrest. But while this “Goldilocks effect” is well known, the mechanisms have never been fully explained. In particular, threshold responses have been shown at the level of transcription and cell state changes, but whether phosphorylation responses upstream of these events also respond to thresholds is unknown. Here, we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to ask if molecular events in the ERK pathway respond to different thresholds of signaling strength, by quantifying changes in phosphorylation of pathway targets against the occupancy of the two activating phosphosites in ERK. The results show that most phosphorylation events track ERK activation faithfully, responding linearly with increasing 2P-ERK occupancy. But some sites respond nonlinearly, reaching maximal phosphorylation when 2P-ERK exceeds lower thresholds (10 to 40%), or increasing substantially after 2P-ERK exceeds higher thresholds (&gt;60%). Low threshold sites are found on transcriptional repressors that facilitate proliferation when inactivated by ERK/ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK) phosphorylation. By contrast, high threshold sites are found on proteins that are recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks and mediate DNA repair. Measurement of phosphorylation occupancies also revealed unexpected differences between cell states not apparent from inhibitor fold-changes. Our findings demonstrate that signaling thresholds exist at the level of the phosphoproteome, providing potential mechanisms for regulating cellular responses to pathway strength.",

Their architecture forms the anatomic basis for brainstem connectomics, subcortical circuit models, and deep brain navigation tools. However, their small size and complex morphology, compared to cerebral WM, makes mapping and segmentation challenging in neuroimaging. As a result, fundamental questions about brainstem modulation of human homeostasis and consciousness remain unanswered. We leverage diffusion MRI tractography to create BrainStem Bundle Tool (BSBT), which automatically segments eight WM bundles in the rostral brainstem. BSBT performs segmentation on a custom probabilistic fiber map using a convolutional neural network architecture tailored to detect small anatomic structures. We demonstrate BSBT’s robustness across diffusion MRI acquisition protocols with in vivo scans of healthy subjects and ex vivo scans of human brain specimens with corresponding histology. BSBT also detected distinct brainstem bundle alterations in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury through tract-based analysis and classification tasks. Finally, we provide proof-of-principle evidence for the prognostic utility of BSBT in a longitudinal analysis of traumatic coma recovery. BSBT creates opportunities for scalable mapping of brainstem WM bundles and investigation of their role in a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.",

          "abstract": "Bergmann glia (BG) are a specialized glial population essential for cerebellar development, yet their developmental timeline and molecular identity in the human cerebellum remain poorly understood. Here, we combined detailed histopathological analysis with spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to generate a developmental atlas of human cerebellar BG. Histology revealed that BG emerge around 11 postconception weeks (PCW), initially serving as a scaffold for Purkinje cells (PCs) migrating into the PC layer of the cerebellar cortex. Following the establishment of a multilayered PC arrangement, BG form a distinct parallel layer separated from the PCs by the lamina dissecans (LD), with both layers merging in the third trimester. This developmental sequence challenges earlier studies that suggested BG appear late in the third trimester. Comparative histology in mice, ferrets, and marmosets indicates that this trilaminar organization, including the LD, is likely unique to humans. Integration of spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomic datasets identified an ASCL1 + PTF1A + ventricular zone progenitor cluster giving rise to BG, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Pseudotime analyses delineated three gliogenic lineages and revealed two temporally and transcriptionally distinct BG populations, emerging at 11–12PCW and 17PCW, suggesting multiphasic BG ontogeny. Together, these multimodal data link cellular lineage, spatial organization, and molecular identity of human cerebellar glia, providing a framework for future studies on the role of BG in cerebellar function and their potential contributions to vulnerability in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Biomolecular sequence combinatorics leads to a large variety of proteins and nucleic acids which can interact to form a diversity of dense liquid (“condensate”) phases. The relationship between sequence design and the diversity of the resultant phases is therefore of interest. Here, we explore this question using the DNA nanostar system which permits the creation of multiphase condensate droplets through sequence engineering of the sticky end bonds that drive particle–particle attraction. We explore the theoretical limits of nanostar phase diversity, then experimentally demonstrate the ability to create nine distinct, nonadhering nanostar phases that do not share components. We further study how different thermal histories affect the morphology and dynamics of such a highly diverse condensate system. We particularly show that a rapid temperature quench leads to the formation of a densely packed 2-D layer of droplets that is transiently stabilized by caging effects enabled by the phase diversity, leading to glassy dynamics such as slow coarsening and dynamic heterogeneity. Generally, our work provides experimental insight into the thermodynamics of phase separation of complex mixtures and demonstrates the rational engineering of complex, long-range, multiphase droplet structures.",

          "abstract": "Evaporation from a multicomponent aqueous mixture not only establishes a hydration gradient but may also lead to composition gradients in the other components. Here, we show that such a gradient induces a strong segregation between two phospholipids that differ only in the saturation of their acyl chains. Using high-resolution confocal Raman microscopy combined with small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, we simultaneously resolve local composition and structure along the evaporation direction. We find that the saturated phospholipid, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), accumulates near the air–liquid interface, while the unsaturated phospholipid, dioleoyl phosphocholine (DOPC), is displaced toward a more hydrated intermediate region, resulting in a complete inversion of their initial proportions. This nonmonotonic lipid gradient reflects the different water swelling capacities of the L β′ and L α lamellar phases favored by DPPC and DOPC, respectively. Despite the system being out of equilibrium, the segregation is quantitatively captured by a description based on local equilibrium chemical potentials and multicomponent diffusion with cross-coupling. Our findings identify hydration gradients as a robust driver of lipid segregation and establish a general framework for predicting transport and organization in evaporating soft-matter systems.",

Here, we propose a magnetic field–enhanced AWE (ME-AWE) strategy that enables in-situ directional enrichment of local active iron ions near the anode, thus breaking the concentration limit and boosting the coverage of dynamic iron active sites without elevating bulk impurity levels. Laboratory-scale three-electrode experiments confirm improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics by the magnetically induced optimization of iron incorporation dynamics and the increase in the coverage of dynamic iron active sites. A multiphysics model coupling magnetic field, fluid flow, mass transport, and electrochemical reaction is developed to spatially interpret the mechanism, revealing that the magnetic modulation enables OER kinetics at 0.3 ppm iron equivalent to those at tenfold higher concentration without a magnetic field. Guided by mechanistic insights, an industry-scale ME-AWE device is designed and implemented, achieving a 24.9% increase in hydrogen output at 1.8 V. Techno-economic analysis demonstrates that the ME-AWE strategy enables a 10.6% reduction in total AWE capital cost for large-scale hydrogen production plants using off-grid wind power. Built with existing industrial infrastructure, this ME-AWE strategy offers a scalable and low-cost solution for improving AWE efficiency and advancing impurity-assisted catalysis in green hydrogen production.",

We investigate the impact of non-Markovian friction and the free-energy landscape on the dynamics of fast-folding proteins in terms of the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the mean first-passage-time (MFPT) of the folding reaction coordinate. We find the friction memory kernel from published molecular dynamics simulations to be well-described by a hierarchical multiexponential function, which gives rise to subdiffusion in the MSD for times shorter than the longest memory time, while for longer times the confining free-energy landscape produces subdiffusion. Thus, for a wide range of times, friction memory effects in fast-folding proteins dominate the scaling behavior of the MSD compared to effects due to the folding free-energy landscape. As a consequence, Markovian models are insufficient to fully capture the folding dynamics, as quantified by the MSD and the MFPT, even when including coordinate-dependent friction. Our results demonstrate the importance of memory effects in protein folding and conformational dynamics and explicitly show that subdiffusion in fast-folding protein dynamics originates mainly from memory effects, not from the free-energy landscape and not from coordinate-dependent friction.",

          "abstract": "Stress is not uniform in the Earth. Therefore, we must use natural experiments to measure the distribution of stresses and related quantities, rather than single values. For instance, dynamic triggering shows that faults are uniformly distributed over their loading cycles in Southern California. The probability that a fault ruptures across a barrier measures the in situ energy distribution. Fault roughness reflects the distribution of strength. These natural experiments produce observable distributions that are surprisingly consistent and suggest some degree of self-organization in the Earth’s crust. Once established, the functional form of the distributions can be used to track changes in response to earthquakes as well as to distinguish fundamentally different fault systems. Transient fault locking before stress release in laboratory experiments can be interpreted as a consequence of self-organization of fault stress. The robust self-organization of multiple variables in earthquake systems suggests that the most consequential mechanical outcome of earthquakes may be the redistribution of stress and the strain energy associated with it. The low friction on a fault during seismic slip as inferred by temperature measurements of the Tohoku earthquake is consistent with dissipation playing a secondary role to this redistribution process. Through stress redistribution and interaction, subduction zone faults tend to synchronize, perhaps due to their geometric simplicity, while the continental system of Southern California cannot synchronize, perhaps due to the complexity of the fault network. Earthquakes organize stress in the crust and produce a suite of well-defined, consistent distributions.",

Sinorhizobium meliloti, whose plant hosts Medicago truncatula and Medicago sativa express ca. 600 NCR peptides during root nodule development, possesses a symbiotically essential BacA Sm protein that imports certain NCR peptides into the cytoplasm. This import permits proteolytic degradation of the NCR peptides, thereby protecting the endocytosed bacteria from their antimicrobial peptide-like lethality, while also allowing certain NCR peptides to undergo their symbiotically critical interactions with cytoplasmic components, for example heme-sequestration in the case of NCR247. Our study employed 54 S. meliloti bacA Sm missense mutants (35 to cysteine and 19 to glycine) that we tested for protein production, ability to establish a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, and their susceptibility to killing by higher levels of the NCR247 and the Bac7(1-35) peptides. We also used the Single Cysteine Accessibility Method to make topological inferences. Our detailed genetic, biochemical, structural, and physiological analyses have revealed that BacA Sm and SbmAhomodimers function as finely tuned transporters, whose structures can be relatively easily disrupted by single amino acid changes. Our finding that several mutations that differentially separate nitrogen-fixation, NCR247 import, and Bac7(1-35) import map to the lining of the peptide-binding cavity suggests a molecular explanation underlying the paradoxical observation that SbmA/BacAs from pathogens can fully replace BacA Sm , whereas BacAs from other rhizobia cannot.",

As fear expression emerged, shifts in neural firing patterns were observed in both regions, with a stronger shift in ventral hippocampal activity, as expected. However, contrary to the prevailing view of the ventral hippocampus as central to anxiety and fear regulation, surprisingly, fear expression-related neuronal responses were more predominant in the dorsal hippocampus. In contrast, ventral hippocampal neuronal activity was more closely linked with the acquisition of conditioned fear. These features were combined in cell assemblies that emerged during fear conditioning, composed of both dorsal fear expression-responsive neurons and ventral fear learning-responsive cells. These multifactorial engrams, distributed along the hippocampal dorsoventral axis, provide a potential substrate for integrating fear acquisition and expression, thereby coordinating associative learning.",

          "abstract": "Current single-cell profiling technologies enable the capture of multiple cellular modalities, providing valuable insights into complex biological systems. While a substantial amount of single-cell multimodal data has been generated and accumulated, most of these datasets are unpaired, characterized by distinct feature spaces and a lack of cell-wise correspondence. The absence of explicit linkages between modalities poses a fundamental challenge for data integration and interpretation. To address this, we introduce SuperMap, a statistical learning method designed for the integrative analyses of unpaired multimodal data. SuperMap directly learns cross-modal mappings from unpaired data to effectively bridge and link different modalities, facilitating a variety of downstream analysis tasks. Comprehensive benchmarking and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of SuperMap in enhancing cell-type identification, improving diagonal integration, enabling regulatory analysis, and revealing epigenomic priming events to specify cell differentiation directions for trajectory inference.",

          "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the prevailing cause of age-associated dementia worldwide. Current standard of care relies on antibody-based immunotherapy. However, antibody-based approaches carry risks for patients, and their effects on cognition are marginal. Increasing evidence suggests that T cells contribute to AD onset and progression. Unlike the cytotoxic effects of CD8 + cells, CD4 + T cells capable of regulating inflammation show promise in reducing pathology and improving cognitive outcomes in mouse models of AD and in aging. Here, we sought to exploit the beneficial properties of CD4 + T cells while circumventing the need for TCR and peptide–MHC antigen discovery, thereby providing a potential universal therapeutic approach. To achieve this, we engineered CD4 + T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting fibrillar forms of aggregated amyloid-β. Our findings demonstrate that optimized CAR-T cells can alter amyloid deposition in the dura and reduce parenchymal pathology in the brain. Furthermore, we observed that CAR-T treatment promotes the expansion and recruitment of endogenous CD4 + T cells into the brain parenchyma and leptomeninges. In summary, we established the feasibility of amyloid plaque–specific CAR-T cells as a potential therapeutic avenue for AD. These findings highlight the potential of CD4 + CAR-T therapy not only to modify amyloid pathology but also to reshape the immune landscape of the CNS, paving the way for future development of cellular immunotherapies for neurodegenerative disease.",

          "abstract": "Animals must balance behavioral goals with the energetic costs of movement. How such trade-offs are implemented algorithmically during natural behavior, and how they adapt to changing energetic constraints, remains poorly understood. Here we show that larval zebrafish adjust their motor strategies during prey hunting to minimize energy expenditure. Using high-speed video tracking and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we quantified the energy costs (in Joules) of different movement types across three developmental stages. While the structure of discrete movement types (“bouts”) remained stable with age, their selection probabilities changed depending on their energetic cost, such that more expensive bouts were always used less frequently. This relationship was conserved across development despite shifts in the relative costs of different bouts. A reinforcement learning model trained to catch prey while minimizing energy use reproduced this relationship, demonstrating that it is an energetically optimal strategy. Furthermore, when fish were reared in a high-viscosity environment that altered energetic costs, they readapted their movement probabilities to preserve the same energy-based control rule, demonstrating active optimization rather than a predetermined developmental program. These findings reveal how goal-directed animals can dynamically regulate movement selection to minimize energetic costs, even under changing environmental and biomechanical conditions. Our results provide a quantitative link between biomechanics, development, behavior, and computational control theory in a freely moving animal.",

          "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) enables animals to learn new tasks without erasing prior knowledge. CL in artificial neural networks (NNs) is challenging due to catastrophic forgetting, where new learning degrades performance on older tasks. While various techniques exist to mitigate forgetting, theoretical insights into when and why CL fails in NNs are lacking. Here, we present a statistical-mechanics theory of CL in deep, wide NNs, which characterizes the network’s input–output mapping as it learns a sequence of tasks. It gives rise to order parameters (OPs) that capture how task relations and network architecture influence forgetting and anterograde interference, as verified by numerical evaluations. For networks with a shared readout for all tasks (single-head CL), the relevant-feature and rule similarity between tasks, respectively measured by two OPs, are sufficient to predict a wide range of CL behaviors on classic benchmark tasks. In addition, the theory predicts that increasing the network depth can effectively reduce interference between tasks, thereby lowering forgetting. For networks with task-specific readouts (multihead CL), the theory identifies a phase transition where CL performance shifts dramatically as tasks become less similar, as measured by another task-similarity OP. While forgetting is relatively mild compared to single-head CL across all tasks, sufficiently low similarity leads to catastrophic anterograde interference, where the network retains old tasks and interpolates new training data perfectly but completely fails to generalize new learning. Our results delineate important factors affecting CL performance and offer theoretical insights into common heuristics for mitigation of forgetting.",

          "abstract": "Turbulence, left unforced, evolves under its own dynamics, invading surrounding quiescent fluid as it decays. A ubiquitous and familiar phenomenon, this fundamental aspect of turbulence has resisted the marriage of principled theory and experiment with no universal law yet capturing its evolution. Conventional flow chamber experiments have been hampered by boundary effects or strong mean flows that obscure the intrinsic dynamics of relaxation to quiescence. To circumvent these limitations, we create a spatially localized blob of turbulence using eight converging vortex generators focused at the center of a water tank, and observe its decay and expansion over decades in time using particle image velocimetry with logarithmic time sampling. The blob initially expands and decays until it reaches the walls of the tank and eventually transitions to a second regime of approximately spatially uniform decay. We interpret the turbulent dynamics as an interplay of nonlinear diffusion with associated steep fronts separating the turbulent and quiescent regions, and nonlinear decay, as described by the Kolmogorov–Barenblatt equation. We find direct evidence for this model within the expansion phase and decay phases of our turbulent blob and use it to account for the detailed behavior we observe. Our work provides a detailed spatially resolved narrative for the behavior of turbulence once the forcing is removed, and demonstrates unexpectedly that the turbulent cascade leaves an indelible footprint far into the decay process.",

Analyses of kidney graft biopsies identified calcium signaling pathways and mTOR as a key regulator of MS-induced NK cell activation. Two experimental models were developed to mimic the pathological condition: in vitro cocultures of human NK cells with allogeneic microvascular endothelial cells and a murine heart transplantation model. These models showed that while calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) alone had a limited impact, combining CNI with mTOR inhibitors (mTORinh) synergistically reduced NK cell activation and endothelial damage. In a pilot clinical study involving 50 renal transplant recipients with MS-associated NK cell–mediated microvascular inflammation, patients who tolerated mTORinh introduced on top of CNI at diagnosis demonstrated reduced MVI lesions and improved graft survival compared to a historical cohort left on CNI and mycophenolate mofetil.

We also identify mutationally intolerant sites on the F trimer surface and core that are critical for proper function, and describe mutations that are candidates for stabilizing F in the prefusion conformation for vaccine design. We quantify how F mutations affect neutralization by six monoclonal antibodies, and show that the magnitude of mutational effects on neutralization varies among antibodies.

Here, we report a universal strategy to dope electrolytes such that the ion transport can be unipolar by incorporating electroactive polymers within hydrogels that interact discriminately with one type of ion via redox and binding mechanisms, leaving the counterions mobile. This transforms the system into an active, selective conductor that directs ion flow with high precision. We demonstrate the generality of this strategy using a wide range of electroactive polymers and ions. Particularly, we use emeraldine base and leucoemeraldine base, derived from polyaniline to create both n-type and p-type conductors with high ion selectivity.

          "abstract": "The transcription factor complex White Collar Complex (WCC) functions both as a photoreceptor and as the circadian positive element. In response to light, WCC acutely activates ~5% of all genes, whereas in the dark it influences expression of about 40% of the transcriptome. Among WCC targets is frq , which is acutely light-activated through the pLRE ( proximal Light-Response Element ) and circadian-regulated through the C-box ( Clock-box ) promoter element that is not responsible for light-driven expression. The FRQ–FRH complex (FFC), which includes CK-1a, represses WCC activity at the C-box by phosphorylating WCC at &gt;95 sites, but FFC has no described role in the light. We validated the expectation that FFC also silences C-box promoters in constant light, thereby confirming two classes of WCC targets: C-box -like genes that are normally repressed in light and pLRE -like genes that remain light-active despite FFC-driven WCC phosphorylation. Derepression of C-box -like promoters in frq -null fungi may explain reported noncircadian phenotypes such as reduced virulence and conidiation. Reanalysis of WCC circadian regulation revealed that, while most WCC is phosphorylated and repressed at dusk, subsequent circadian activation results from transient dephosphorylation of only a small subset of the WCC pool. This small active pool drives frq expression, nucleating the FFC, which rephosphorylates WCC to repress it again, generating a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle that can persist for days without new WCC synthesis. The realization that both FFC and WCC are regulated primarily through phosphorylation rather than protein turnover leaves the circadian oscillator looking much like a “phoscillator,” emphasizing the primacy of posttranslational regulation in timekeeping.",

Understanding how such transformations are encoded in the brain remains incomplete. To tackle this question, we leverage the lateral line of larval zebrafish as a tractable system sensitive to fluid motion and used to steer navigation, feed, and avoid predators. By presenting stimuli of either direction to neuromasts along the body, we mapped hindbrain responses via high-resolution calcium imaging. Our findings challenge the notion that central lateral line processing lacks topographic structure by revealing a simple, yet powerful principle centered on an egocentric spatial framework: the direction and location of local flow motions are encoded in reference to the animal’s center-of-mass. Brainstem neurons that encode flow toward the center-of-mass broadly project to form bilateral connections onto reticulospinal neurons that coordinate forward locomotion while those that encode flow away from the center-of-mass displayed a more selective and unilateral projection profile to command neurons eliciting turns. This simple representation enables the brain to register complex flow patterns and provides a robust basis for behavioral action selection. Our finding represents a shift from purely somatotopic encoding toward an integrative representation of axial position and directionality along the horizontal plane combined, revealing a central principle for encoding spatiodirectional cues. This study advances our understanding of how complex mechanosensory inputs select appropriate motor outputs via simple egocentric neural maps in the hindbrain.",

Yet, the magnitude of stratospheric CH 4 chemical loss remains highly uncertain, with previous estimates largely relying on chemistry-climate models (CCMs). Here, we present an observationally based estimate of stratospheric CH 4 loss ( L STR ), derived from the CH 4 diabatic flux across the isentropic surface fitted to the tropical tropopause, using satellite measurements of CH 4 concentration, temperature, and radiative heating rates for 2007–2010. We obtain an L STR of 49.8 ± 7.8 Tg/y, compared with 38.1 Tg/y estimated from reanalysis, and 25.7 Tg/y (range: 19.6 to 35.9 Tg/y) derived from CCMs, indicating that both reanalysis and CCMs systematically underestimate stratospheric CH 4 loss. We show that discrepancies in global CH 4 diabatic fluxes from the reanalysis and CCMs, when compared with observations, are mainly driven by biases in CH 4 concentrations and further enhanced by errors in temperature and radiative heating. Substituting our observational estimate for the model-based stratospheric loss in the bottom-up global CH 4 budget reduces the reported imbalance for the 2000s from 23 to 3 Tg/y, bringing it into close agreement with the 5 Tg/y (range: −4 to 13 Tg/y) imbalance inferred from top-down estimates. These findings highlight the critical role of observational constraints on L STR in reconciling the global CH 4 budget.

The enzyme achieves this feat by exploiting the redox versatility of the flavin cofactor. Stoichiometric experiments, ultrafast spectroscopy, and computational studies support a mechanism in which photoexcited flavin quinone initiates the reaction via oxidative decarboxylation to generate a benzylic radical. The resulting flavin semiquinone can reduce the alkyl halide to form a second organic radical within the protein active site, which rapidly engages in C(sp 3 )–C(sp 3 ) bond formation. A variant was engineered to control the stereochemical outcome of this radical–radical coupling event, highlighting the ability of the protein to alter the energetic barrier for a mechanistic step that is traditionally understood to be near barrierless. This work demonstrates that the scope for nonnative reaction mechanisms in biocatalysis far exceeds previously established bounds and has potential to solve a variety of reactivity challenges in cross-coupling chemistry.",

          "abstract": "TMEM16A channels conduct Ca 2+ -activated Cl − currents that underlie essential physiological processes including epithelial secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and sensory transduction. Channel activation requires both intracellular Ca 2+ and the signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ), yet the molecular basis of this dual regulation has remained unclear. Using gating molecular-dynamics simulations and structure-guided electrophysiology, we show that PIP 2 and Ca 2+ cooperatively gate TMEM16A through an allosterically coupled electrostatic network centered on the α4 helix. Specific PIP 2 headgroup phosphate interactions are essential for coupling Ca 2+ binding to channel opening, while the PIP 2 acyl chains engage hydrophobic surfaces of the helix to stabilize the open conformation. Disrupting either component of this lipid–protein interface reduces apparent PIP 2 affinity and impairs activation, whereas long-chain PIP 2 fully restores wild-type activity. These interactions act in concert with Ca 2+ -dependent structural rearrangements that widen the conduction pathway and enable Cl − permeation. Our findings establish that both the headgroup phosphates and acyl chains of PIP 2 play indispensable and complementary roles in TMEM16A gating. This mechanism defines a cooperative lipid–ion activation process that provides a general framework for understanding phosphoinositide regulation of ion channels and offers opportunities for structure-based design of TMEM16A modulators.",

          "abstract": "How thousands of microtubules (MTs) and molecular motors self-organize into spindles remains poorly understood. By combining static, nanometer-resolution, large-scale electron tomography reconstructions and dynamic, optical-resolution, polarized light microscopy, we test an active liquid crystal continuum theory of mitotic spindles in human tissue culture cells. At micron length scales, probed by optical microscopy, the continuum theory accurately captures spindle morphology and fluctuation spectra, indicating that local interactions-polymerization, alignment, diffusion, and polar transport-govern the collective behaviors of MTs in human mitotic spindles. Electron tomography data enables tests of the continuum theory at submicron scales, revealing that chromosome-attached kinetochore microtubules (KMTs) show distinctive lateral organization not explained by the coarse-grained theory, while the non-KMTs that make up the bulk of the spindle follow the theory down to ∼300 nm length scales. At length scales below ∼300 nm, fluctuations arising from the intrinsic discreteness of the microtubule ensemble dominate over the collective correlations predicted from the continuum theory. Taken together, these findings show that an active liquid-crystal theory can quantitatively capture the self-organization of human mitotic spindles on long length scales and provides a means to measure the spindle’s material properties, while also pointing to the existence of additional processes contributing to the behaviors of KMTs.",

This study employed cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to investigate rhodopsin structure using a megabody (Mb7) as a negative allosteric modulator. Three distinct cryo-EM structures were solved: ground-state rhodopsin, photoactivated rhodopsin, and apo-rhodopsin, all in complex with Mb7. Photoactivated rhodopsin and apo-rhodopsin, both in complex with Mb7, maintain a conformation remarkably similar to ground-state rhodopsin rather than adopting a Meta-II-like conformation. Structural elements, including the conserved residues of the NPxxY motif and the ionic lock, remain in positions corresponding to inactive rhodopsin. The megabody forms extensive interactions with rhodopsin’s extracellular loop 2, N terminus, and glycans. The findings demonstrate that Mb7 stabilizes photoactivated rhodopsin in a Meta-I-like conformation, preventing progression to the active Meta-II state through specific immobilization of the extracellular domain.

          "abstract": "Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) plays a central role in glycogen metabolism. While the structure and regulation of mammalian GPs have been extensively studied, the corresponding mechanisms in gut bacterial GPs remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate GPs from Escherichia coli ( Ec GP), Segatella copri ( Sc GP), and Dorea longicatena ( Dl GP), which represent three phylogenetic clades of GPs, using enzymatic assays, cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and X-ray crystallography. We find that Sc GP forms a unique pentamer that undergoes adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent assembly into a dimer-of-pentamer, which inhibits activity by restricting substrate access to the catalytic site. Ec GP exists in equilibrium among monomers, dimers, and tetramers, with AMP promoting tetramer dissociation and enhancing catalytic efficiency. In contrast, Dl GP remains predominantly monomeric and is unresponsive to AMP. These findings uncover structural and regulatory diversity among gut bacterial GPs. Notably, the oligomeric states of GPs modulate substrate accessibility and enzyme activation, suggesting a distinct mode of allosteric regulation beyond the canonical T-to-R transition model. Because bacterial GPs contribute to the generation of glucose, their regulation may influence the composition of gut-derived metabolites that affect host glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Our study provides mechanistic insight into the structural and functional diversity of gut bacterial GPs and lays a foundation for future exploration of microbiome-mediated metabolic interactions.",

          "abstract": "Quantum-chaotic systems exhibit several universal properties, ranging from level repulsion in the energy spectrum to wavefunction delocalization. On the other hand, if wavefunctions are localized, the energy levels exhibit no level repulsion and their statistics is Poisson. At the boundary between quantum chaos and localization, however, one observes critical behavior, not complying with any of those characteristics. An outstanding open question is whether there exists yet another type of universality, which is genuine for the critical point. Previous work suggested that there may exist a relation between the global characteristics of the energy spectrum, such as the spectral compressibility χ , and the degree of wavefunction delocalization, expressed via the fractal dimension D 1 of the Shannon–von Neumann entropy in a preferred (e.g., real-space) basis. Here, we study physical systems subject to local and nonlocal hopping, both with and without time-reversal symmetry, with the Anderson models in dimensions three to five being representatives of the first class, and the random banded matrices as representatives of the second class. Our thorough numerical analysis supports the validity of the simple relation χ + D 1 = 1 in all systems under investigation. Hence, we conjecture that it represents a universal property of a broad class of critical models. Moreover, we test and confirm the accuracy of our surmise for a closed-form expression of the spectral compressibility in the one-parameter critical manifold of random banded matrices. Based on these findings, we derive a universal function D 1 ( r ) of the averaged level spacing ratio r , which is valid for a broad class of critical systems.",

          "abstract": "Parasitic castration is a widespread strategy where parasites hijack host reproductive resources, yet the key molecular mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we reported that parasitization by the parasitic wasp Cotesia vestalis triggers apoptosis-mediated castration in the larval testes of its lepidopteran host, Plutella xylotella . Such a phenomenon was mediated by CvBV_22-9 , a testis-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) encoded by Cotesia vestalis bracovirus (CvBV), a domesticated virus endogenized in the wasp. Similarly, a homolog of CvBV_22-9, encoded by the Microplitis manilae bracovirus, is involved in testis castration by inducing apoptosis in parasitized fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda . Mechanistically, CvBV_22-9 binds to a cell cycle checkpoint protein, Rad9A, but does not alter its tyrosine phosphorylation level. Crucially, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of Rad9A causes embryonic lethality and severe testis defects. Validation in Drosophila melanogaster shows that testis-specific expression of CvBV_22-9 or Rad9A knockdown induces apoptosis, while combined targeting synergistically enhances this effect, suggesting a conserved function of both proteins in insects. Our study uncovers a regulatory mechanism where a parasitoid wasp deploys a domesticated viral PTP that functions as a pseudophosphatase to induce Rad9A-mediated apoptosis and disrupt host testis development and spermatogenesis. This mechanism highlights a sophisticated strategy of host exploitation by parasitoid wasps, providing insights for the biocontrol of lepidopteran pests.",

          "abstract": "Hydrogen hydrates (HH) are a unique class of materials composed of hydrogen molecules confined within crystalline water frameworks. Among their multiple phases, the filled ice structures, particularly the cubic C2 phase, exhibit exceptionally strong host–guest interactions due to ultra-short H 2 -H 2 O distances and a 1:1 stoichiometry leading to two interpenetrated identical diamond-like sublattices, one comprised of water molecules, the other of hydrogen molecules. At high pressures, nuclear-quantum effects involving both hydrogen molecules and the water lattice become dominant, giving rise to a dual-lattice quantum system. In this work, we explore the sequence of pressure- and temperature-driven phase transitions in HH, focusing on the interplay between molecular rotation, orientational ordering, lattice symmetry breaking, and hydrogen bond symmetrization. Using a combination of computational modeling based on classical and path-integral molecular dynamics, quantum embedding, and high pressure experiments, including Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction at low temperatures and high pressures, we identify signatures of quantum-induced ordering and structural transformations in the C2 phase. Our findings reveal that orientational ordering in HH occurs at much lower pressures than in solid hydrogen, by inducing structural changes in the water network and enhancing the coupling of water and hydrogen dynamics. This work provides insights into the quantum behavior of hydrogen under extreme mechanochemical confinement and establishes hydrogen-filled ices as a promising platform for the design of hydrogen-rich quantum materials.",

This property is especially valuable when drops are viscous, a case where we expect super-repellency to minimize the friction associated with viscosity. Here, we report that viscous droplets on highly repellent inclines can have two modes of descent, depending on the way they are deposited: either they run at the fast speed expected for pearls or they are 30 to 60 times quicker, which defines a super-fast regime of motion. We show that this effect relies on the tenuousness of the contact with the substrate. Consequently, this contact can be dynamically “erased” by the insertion of a cushion of air, which makes droplets glide at a speed both high and independent of their viscosity. We characterize these lubricating films (thickness and onset of appearance) and finally show that super-fast pearls initiated on a superhydrophobic (SH) surface can maintain their velocity and shape even on a hydrophilic solid.",

Underlying this ability is our understanding of how radiation is produced: Whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates. Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here, we prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple (once one knows what to do), but its reasons are deep: It relies on the fact that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act on them, via the Aharonov–Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here is just the tip of an iceberg–it implies the need to reconsider the basic understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.",

          "abstract": "Hydrophobins are functional amyloids conserved in filamentous fungi. They act as a protective coat in the fibrous form, called rodlet. Rodlets further assemble to form dense films where they are bundled and densely aligned, contributing to the hydrophobicity of the mycelium surface. The mechanism of this dense film formation is completely unknown. Here, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to directly observe the structural dynamics of rodlet bundling and subsequent film formation by hydrophobin RolA from the industrial fungus Aspergillus oryzae at a single-fibril level, and we revealed the film-formation mechanism. Rodlet elongation occurred at both ends and was discontinuous, alternating between periods when rodlets could elongate (growth state) and could not elongate (pause state). This suggests an equilibrium of two distinct structural states at the rodlet ends. We also identified a pathway, termed “surface-catalyzed elongation,” in which elongation is promoted by lateral interactions between bundled rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation decreased the energy barrier of both structural switching between growth and pause states and elongation at rodlet ends, doubling the elongation rate in bundled rodlets. The rodlet surface could be considered as a catalyst for the elongation of neighboring rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation could contribute to rodlet bundling, whereby rodlets tend to form oriented domain structures; our Monte Carlo simulations confirmed this.

          "authors": "Annalisa De Leo, Chang He, Alessandro Stocchino",
          "abstract": "As well known, almost 80% of the total oceanic kinetic energy is contained within the mesoscale eddies, but the cross-scale energy transfers linking eddy generation and dissipation remain an open question. The Earth rotation controls the generation of mesoscale eddies that transfer energy toward larger scales via an inverse cascade, but a transfer to small scale is needed for dissipation: a coexistence of transfers is indeed required. However, the turbulent energy cascade, responsible for oceanic circulation energy balance and nutrient mixing, involves such a large range of scales making extremely challenging the investigation of the full spectrum of processes. This study examines how energy and enstrophy cascade across ocean scales in the inner shelf of the Great Bay Area of the South China Sea using high-resolution numerical simulations. By applying coarse-graining techniques, the results reveal a predominant inverse energy cascade scenario driven by the interplay between background stratification and rotation, particularly in areas affected by the Pearl River’s freshwater influx. Geographical heterogeneity significantly influences these dynamics, with shallow inlets experiencing increased frictional drag and energy dissipation due to complex bathymetry, while open-water areas show heightened submesoscale activity. Seasonal monsoon cycles further modulate these processes, with summer winds amplifying nonlinear energy transfers through increased wind stress and river discharge, in contrast to the tidally dominated, quasi-steady flows observed in winter. Understanding how wind and tide affect ocean mixing can help to develop more accurate climate models and better strategies for protecting coastal ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Myocarditis is a potentially fatal disease that can progress to inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMi), a condition that is a leading cause of noncongenital heart failure in young adults. However, the mechanisms driving the transition from acute myocarditis to DCMi remain poorly understood. Although IL-17A-mediated inflammation is a well-known driver of this progression, the intracellular regulators that sustain and amplify this response remain unclear. Here, we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21, which is upregulated in the hearts of DCMi patients and experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) mice, as a key amplifier of IL-17A-driven inflammation in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), promoting disease progression and fibrosis. TRIM21 deficiency significantly attenuates EAM progression, reducing inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrotic remodeling. Mechanistically, TRIM21 is induced by IL-17A in CFs and promotes K27-linked polyubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of TRAF3, a negative regulator of IL-17A signaling, thereby establishing a self-reinforcing IL-17A-TRIM21–TRAF3 positive feedback loop. Finally, specific knockdown of TRIM21 in CFs via the AAV9-Postn strategy effectively alleviates EAM severity. These findings identify TRIM21 as an intracellular mediator of sustained IL-17A signaling in myocarditis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing progression to DCMi.",

Previous transcriptomic studies of the Drosophila ring gland—which is composed of the corpus allatum (CA), prothoracic gland (PG), and corpora cardiaca (CC)—have treated the ring gland as a single tissue. As a result, these approaches lacked the resolution necessary to dissect JH biosynthesis and its regulation in a cell-type-specific manner. To overcome this limitation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 7,919 cells isolated from the larval ring glands. This analysis resolved distinct transcriptional profiles for the CA, PG, and CC, and enabled the identification of CA-specific transcription factors. Among them, SoxNeuro (SoxN), was found to be essential for JH biosynthesis and functionally important for both metamorphosis and reproduction. We further demonstrate that SoxN physically interacts with Ventral veins lacking (Vvl) to form a transcriptional complex that directly regulates Jhamt , a rate-limiting enzyme in JH biosynthesis, via a defined promoter region. Together, this work presents a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Drosophila ring gland and identifies the SoxN–Vvl complex as a critical regulator of JH biosynthesis, offering insight into the transcriptional control of insect endocrine function.",

          "abstract": "Actuators drive robotic motion, and their energy conversion efficiency is a key performance metric that informs power consumption. Soft electrostatic actuators promise new opportunities for bioinspired and wearable robotics, being driven by electrical signals and producing high-speed, muscle-like motion. Unlike electromagnetic motors, for which efficiency has been systematically studied, efficiency of soft actuators lacks a standardized definition and measurement method, highlighting the need for a unified framework for the evaluation of their efficiency. Here, we propose a comprehensive method to study electrical-to-mechanical energy conversion in soft electrostatic actuators by analyzing closed cycles on planes spanned by work-conjugate variables: voltage–charge and force–position; our experimental setup allows us to prescribe and measure in real-time all work-conjugate variables and thus, to evaluate efficiency as function of load, electric potential, frequency, and actuator materials. We introduce a practical work cycle to evaluate actuators, and, using Peano-HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators as a model system, we reveal that efficiency is highly dependent on applied voltage, force, and actuation frequency; within the tested range of parameters, we measure a maximum efficiency of 63.6%, which is more than three times the previously reported value for HASEL actuators. We further study energy losses inherent in mechanical and electrical cycles. We show the general applicability of our method across different electrostatic actuators by applying it to a pure-shear dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA), demonstrating efficiencies up to 62.9%. This comprehensive method will facilitate the study and development of electrostatic actuators for the next generation of highly efficient soft robots.",

Humans can accumulate evidence from sequences of stimuli to estimate their sensory statistics, predict the timing of upcoming stimuli, but also discover rules governing sequence generation. However, whether these three forms of inference operate independently or synergistically remains untested. Here, we report selective interactions between sensory integration, temporal prediction, and rule discovery in humans. Participants were exposed to rhythmic sequences of 10 stimuli governed or not by a latent rule—a predictable change in stimulus statistics after five stimuli—and then asked to predict the 10th stimulus from incomplete sequences. Individual differences in sensory integration timescale for rule-free sequences predicted efficient rule discovery. Conversely, discovering the latent rule shaped the timescale and format of sensory integration for rule-based sequences. Tampering with the rhythmicity of stimulus presentation impaired rule discovery without affecting sensory integration accuracy. Selective perturbations of recurrent neural networks trained in the same conditions confirmed these specific interactions. Together, these findings provide insights into the flexibility of human inferences based on variable yet predictable sensory input.",

          "abstract": "Energy is required for the expression and maintenance of complex traits. In many habitats, however, free energy available to support biosynthesis is in vanishingly short supply. As a result, many taxa have evolved persistence strategies that support survival in unfavorable environments. Among these is sporulation, an ancient bacterial program governed by a large genetic network that requires energy for both regulation and execution. Yet sporulation is a last resort, initiated when cellular energy is nearly exhausted. To resolve this paradox, we quantified the energetic cost of sporulation in units of ATP by integrating time-resolved genome, transcriptome, and proteome profiles. The full cost of the spore cycle, including both formation and revival, ranks among the most energy-intensive processes in the bacterial cell, requiring almost 10 10 ATP and consuming about 10% of the total energy budget. The majority of this cost arises from translation, membrane synthesis, and protein turnover. Despite its considerable upfront investment, sporulation enables long-term survival and becomes optimal when harsh conditions extend over timescales of months or longer. This trade-off between immediate cost and delayed benefit helps explain when sporulation is maintained or replaced by alternative strategies. By incorporating our estimates into mechanistic models, we show how metabolic constraints shape sporulation efficiency, while genome-wide mutation accumulation data reveal that even modest energetic burdens can become visible to selection, influencing the evolutionary fate of this complex and widespread trait.",

At this critical point in animal development, the larva stops feeding and proceeds to take on the adult form. The neuroendocrine circuits governing commitment to metamorphosis assess the growth and patterning programs, eventually triggering the production of systemic hormones that terminate growth and initiate metamorphosis. Previous studies of these circuits relied on relatively static genetic perturbations and starvation experiments. Here, we take advantage of optogenetic approaches in Drosophila to flexibly perturb a key signaling node within the endocrine gland in otherwise undisturbed larvae. We used this approach to infer parameters in a compact mathematical model and demonstrate that it makes accurate predictions of larval commitment to metamorphosis. Our work paves the way for quantitative studies of other juvenile-to-adult transitions, including mammalian puberty, which relies on strikingly similar mechanisms.",

However, real interactions are generally not time-invariant and are often not pairwise. Recently, progress has been made in modeling higher-order interactions using hypergraphs, where a link may connect more than two individuals. Here, we study cooperation on temporal hypergraphs, capturing the time-varying, higher-order interactions seen in empirical systems. We find that temporal hypergraphs can promote cooperation compared with static networks, and the latter may even underestimate the cooperation-boosting effects of constrained, local interactions. We further show that cooperation can be facilitated by temporal hypergraphs with sparse components and higher-order interactions. Importantly, when the size of group interactions (hyperedges) is comparable to the population size, relatively small hyperedge sizes best facilitate cooperation. Synthetic and empirical hypergraphs alike affirm our findings, illuminating how temporal, higher-order interactions profoundly shape the evolution of cooperation.",

Stable isotopic measurements of extraterrestrial soluble organic matter provide critical insights into the formation pathways and alteration histories of such molecules, which hold significance for understanding the origins of life. We leverage state-of-the-art techniques for picomolar-scale isotopic analyses of amino acids in samples of Bennu and, for comparison, the carbonaceous meteorite Murchison. We report intramolecular δ 13 C values for glycine, which have not previously been measured in extraterrestrial materials; molecular-averaged δ 13 C values for amino acids, aldehydes, and ketones; and δ 15 N values for glycine, β-alanine, and D/L-glutamic acid. Intramolecular carbon isotope patterns of glycine in Bennu contrast with those in Murchison, suggesting distinct formation pathways. We explore several formation mechanisms and hypothesize that the observed glycine in Murchison formed dominantly by a Strecker-like synthesis under aqueous conditions, whereas the glycine currently found in Bennu may have formed mainly by modified radical–radical reactions in primordial ices at the cold, outer reaches of the early Solar System and retained its isotopic values throughout accretion and multiple episodes of aqueous alteration. This hypothesis is supported by the highly 15 N-enriched δ 15 N values in Bennu amino acids (+170 to 277‰). Differences in the δ 15 N values of D- and L-glutamic acid (Δ = 87‰) in Bennu affirm published reports of enantiomeric differences in meteoritic amino acids and challenge the assumption of isotopic uniformity between amino acid chiral pairs.",

          "abstract": "Proper crossover (CO) formation in meiosis serves dual roles in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and generating genetic diversity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CO number and distribution remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have implicated the ubiquitin–proteasome system in CO regulation, but specific regulators and mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ufd2p as a key regulator promoting efficient CO formation through a focused genetic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Deletion of UFD2 significantly reduces CO frequency by enhancing the strength of CO interference. Integrated multiomics analysis indicates that Ufd2p targets Topoisomerase II (Top2p) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation during meiosis. Deletion of UFD2 results in Top2p accumulation, which resolves DNA negative supercoils excessively and enhances CO interference in the nucleus, ultimately reducing CO numbers. We further show that the mammalian homolog of Ufd2p, UBE4B, plays a conserved role in promoting efficient CO formation by regulating TOP2A-dependent DNA negative supercoils dynamics. Notably, expression of mouse or human UBE4B in yeast restores CO formation and meiotic progression in UFD2 deletion cells, demonstrating functional conservation across species. Together, our work identifies Ufd2p as a previously uncharacterized regulator of CO formation and provides important insights into the conserved molecular mechanism, which operates through Top2p-mediated supercoils homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "The potential role of haplodiploid sex determination in promoting the evolution of altruism and eusociality has been the subject of intense debate for over 50 y. Different theoretical models have suggested that haplodiploidy influences relatedness in a way that either does or does not make it easier for altruism to evolve. This debate over the “haplodiploidy hypothesis” can only be resolved with a decisive empirical test that controls for potential phylogenetic bias. Here we critically examine the current state of evidence for an adaptive link between haplodiploidy and eusociality, applying phylogenetically informed methods to ensure that statistical tests reflect independent evolutionary transitions. Using data from 5,678 species, across all major insect orders, we find no evidence that haplodiploidy favors an increased rate of eusocial evolution. We show that this result is robust to: a) different analytical approaches; b) alternative ways of defining both eusociality and haplodiploidy; and c) uncertainty in eusociality assignments. Our analyses suggest that previously reported associations between haplodiploidy and eusociality are likely to have been artifacts, false-positive results primarily driven by a high transition rate to eusociality within the Hymenoptera. This high transition rate could be explained by any factor associated with that group, such as parental care, monogamy, or the possession of a powerful sting.",

While previous works have largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We find that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit small lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid–structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with small lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.",

However, receptor desensitization limits the use of exogenous growth factors as a restorative agent therapeutically. An example of this is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the corneal epithelium. Despite laboratory data indicating that EGFR activity accelerates corneal re-epithelialization in mice and rabbits, the clinical administration of EGF to damaged corneal epithelium has limited impact due to the attenuated signaling that occurs following sustained growth factor administration. We hypothesized that inhibition of receptor desensitization would prolong receptor activity and enhance tissue homeostasis. Having previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, c-Cbl, as a key negative regulator of EGFR signaling in the corneal epithelium, we have developed a class of small molecule inhibitors of EGFR binding to CBL family proteins using virtual screening with experimental validation. Through multiple rounds of structural optimization, we have identified compound 3-120. This compound was designed to compete with phosphotyrosine 1045 of the EGFR for binding to c-Cbl. Compound 3-120 binds to c-Cbl with an ~10-fold higher affinity than phosphoEGFR, reduces EGFR ubiquitylation by 40%, and increases the magnitude of ligand-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation by 30 to 40%. Ultimately, this compound can enhance the restoration of corneal epithelial debridement wounds.

          "abstract": "Alphaviruses establish persistent infections in mosquito vectors despite robust antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) pathways, suggesting that they employ mechanisms to counteract host immunity. We demonstrate that the nsP2 protein of Sindbis virus (SINV), the prototype alphavirus, functions as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Using a SINV mutant (2V) that prevents cleavage at the nsP2–nsP3 junction, we show that proper proteolytic processing to release mature nsP2 is essential for efficient viral replication in mosquitoes with intact RNAi pathways. Replication defects in the 2V mutant were rescued in Dicer-2 ( Dcr-2 ) null mutant mosquitoes or by expressing the mature nsP2 protein. Biochemical assays revealed that recombinant nsP2 directly binds double-stranded RNA and inhibits Dicer-mediated processing into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Furthermore, mosquitoes infected with the 2V mutant exhibited higher ratios of virus-derived siRNAs per viral RNA compared to wild-type infections, confirming that mature nsP2 suppresses the RNAi response. Our findings provide compelling evidence that nsP2 antagonizes RNA silencing in mosquito vectors, representing a critical adaptation that facilitates alphavirus replication.",

          "abstract": "Mosquito-disease vectors, such as Aedes aegypti , use their sense of taste before deciding whether to consume a blood meal, or fly away. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling gustatory decisions in mosquitoes are largely unknown. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel, Painless1 (Pain1), is an intriguing candidate for participating in Ae. aegypti taste since pain1 transcripts are detected in gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). The Drosophila homolog, painless ( pain ) is also expressed in GRNs, where it is required for sensing allyl-isothiocyanate. Here, to identify additional gustatory roles for pain homologs, we first focused on Drosophila pain , which is widely expressed in multiple GRN classes. We demonstrated that pain mutations eliminated gustatory attraction to low fatty acids levels, repulsion to high levels, and fatty acid-induced action potentials. The attraction and repulsion depended on pain expression in different GRN classes. In contrast to Drosophila , when Aedes contacts fatty acids, they induce gustatory rejection only. Aedes pain1 is expressed in taste organs, and is required for gustatory avoidance of fatty acids, and for fatty acid-induced action potentials. Given that Pain homologs are found in insects but not vertebrates, Pain1 represents an intriguing target for developing repellents to diminish biting, and transmission of infectious agents by mosquito disease vectors.",

In this study, we upend the conventional understanding of fungal RiPPs, discovering a subclass that has diversified and lacks a leader sequence, an empirical example of leaderless RiPPs in fungi. We use a combinatorial analysis of NMR and MS/MS with an updated bioinformatic pipeline to pair MSDIN genes to leaderless peptides in Amanita phalloides , a European species spreading in California. Leaderless MSDIN transcripts are expressed several orders of magnitude more than most canonical MSDINs, with significantly higher expression in invasive populations.

          "abstract": "Munc13-1 is a key protein involved in priming synaptic vesicles for rapid release at the presynaptic plasma membrane. It was previously revealed that Munc13-1 cycles between at least two alternate conformations, an upright (open) molecular conformation organized as a trimer and a lateral (closed) conformation organized as a hexagon. Munc13 binds PI(4,5)P 2 , a plasma membrane phospholipid essential for vesicle docking and fusion. We report that Munc13 is recruited to PI(4,5)P 2 domains induced by a Syntaxin-1A juxta-membrane peptide in supported bilayers. Statistical analysis of the copy numbers of Munc13 within the domains suggests that Munc13 exists in clusters of three molecules, i.e., it assembles into trimers. The trimeric clusters disappear with engineered interface mutations disrupting the upright trimers in cryo-EM as well as reconstituted vesicle priming suggesting the trimers observed on bilayers are identical to the upright trimer structures. These upright trimers can also be identified by cryo-electron tomography on vesicles containing PI(4,5)P 2 and Syntaxin-1A. Clusters of 3 or more Munc13 trimers forming on PI(4,5)P 2 domains efficiently capture phosphatidylserine-containing small unilamellar vesicles via their C 2 C domains, as shown by the effect of mutations that disrupt synaptic vesicle binding in synapses. We propose a two-step model for vesicle priming: i) synaptic vesicles are captured by clusters of upright trimers of Munc13 that self-assemble within PI(4,5)P 2 enriched domains; ii) these trimers transition into lateral hexamers when vesicles have bound and the transition would be promoted when the closed conformation of Munc13 is stabilized by diacylglycerol binding, resulting from Ca 2+ -dependent hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P 2 .",

          "abstract": "Solar energy–driven hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) synthesis from atmospheric oxygen and water represents a sustainable and highly promising avenue for the production of this essential chemical. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a molecular platform for the direct conversion of solar energy to H 2 O 2 , however, they are persistently plagued by the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, a phenomenon induced by σ-bond rotation under light irradiation, which typically leads to sluggish conversion kinetics and suboptimal efficiency. We herein present a molecular engineering strategy involving the construction of noncovalent trans rings (Nc-TRs) within COFs. This approach entails the precise introduction of noncovalent interactions between donor and acceptor moieties, thereby constraining the free rotation of σ bonds and substantially suppressing the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the incorporation of Nc-TR within TAPT-DHBD COFs reduces the molecular dihedral angle from 37.33° to 0°, thereby optimizing molecular coplanarity and prolonging the photogenerated charge carrier lifetime by 820% compared to TAPT-TPD COFs devoid of Nc-TRs. Our findings further reveal that TAPT-DHBD COFs exhibit 5.0-fold and 3.6-fold enhancements in H 2 O 2 photocatalytic conversion kinetics and solar-to-chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency, respectively, relative to TAPT-TPD COFs. We further demonstrate that H 2 O 2 solutions generated in the flow-type photocatalytic system under solar irradiation exhibit a record-high antibacterial efficacy of 10 7 cfu s −1 , and achieve a 100% wound healing rate within 7 d, markedly outperforming commercial physiological saline.",

          "abstract": "The Asteraceae (Compositae) is the largest flowering plant family, ubiquitous in most terrestrial communities, and morphologically diverse. A two-step, ancient whole genome triplication (paleohexaploidization) occurred at approximately the same time as the evolutionary innovation and adaptive radiation of the family during the middle Eocene. Despite its importance, the consequences of this triplication have yet to be tracked in context of the Asteraceae genome evolution. To do so, we applied a synteny oriented phylogenomic analysis of 23 Asterales genomes. We identified 16 genomic groups that date back to the common diploid ancestor of all Asteraceae. Each group underwent triplication, resulting in 48 genomic blocks (16 × 3) that collectively represent the ancestral Asteraceae genome, excluding the early-diverging lineages which do not share the second step. We then analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of the 48 genomic blocks across the Asteraceae phylogeny. We found that modern Asteraceae genomes are genetic mosaics of three progenitor genomes, shaped by genomic exchanges, chromosomal rearrangements, and gene fractionation. One hundred fifty-seven genes retained three paleohexaploid-derived syntenic paralogs across most Asteraceae species. Transcription factors and auxin-related genes are significantly overrepresented in these triplets, and expression of the paleohexaploidy paralogs is spatiotemporally differentiated. These genes are involved in the development of floral capitula, a remarkable morphological innovation of the family. The discovery of the 157 triplicated genes can direct further study to understand the evolutionary innovation, and the synteny-phylogenomic framework provides a comparative framework to characterize newly sequenced Asteraceae genomes.",

          "abstract": "Lysine (Lys/K) residues serve as major hubs for post-translational modifications (PTMs) owing to the chemical versatility of their ε-amino groups, giving rise to diverse regulatory functions. Accurate and efficient identification of modified lysine residues therefore requires computational models that can effectively capture both sequence and structural information while minimizing domain-specific feature engineering. In this study, we propose a unified deep learning framework for lysine PTM site identification that integrates sequence representations derived from a protein language model with atom-level three-dimensional structural features. This framework can be consistently applied to multiple lysine PTM types using a shared modeling strategy. As an application, we used the model to predict potential PTM site on human C-type lectin domain family 12 member A (hCLEC12A) and evaluated their functional relevance through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations indicate that the predicted lysine residues influence the stability and binding behavior of the hCLEC12A-antibody 50C1 complex. Overall, this work presents an integrative computational framework for lysine PTM site mining and functional analysis.",

In this Review, we discuss the scale-dependent mechanisms through which forests regulate climate, highlighting their contributions to global mitigation and local adaptation. Locally, forests tend to buffer temperatures, cooling in warm conditions and warming in cold ones. In regions that naturally support dense forest cover, trees contribute to global cooling primarily through carbon uptake, with some offsetting from albedo-related warming. By enhancing rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, and cloud formation, forests also influence the hydrological cycle, lowering flood risks in humid regions but often reducing downstream water availability, especially in drier climates. Collectively, these interacting processes show that the greatest climate benefits occur where forests are native, highlighting their importance for both climate adaptation and mitigation.",

In this study, we found that early damage in zebrafish and rodent demyelination models is characterized by myelin swelling. We show, through live imaging, that myelin swelling does not always lead to myelin loss and that swellings can sometimes resolve, allowing sheaths to remodel. Increased neuronal activity during early demyelination exacerbates myelin damage, whereas reducing neuronal activity mitigates myelin swelling in both zebrafish and mice. In human multiple sclerosis tissue, myelin swelling is also dynamic and is prominent around active lesions.

To restore fisheries resources, the Yangtze River Fishing Ban was implemented in 2021 to cease all basin-wide commercial fishing. We evaluate the effectiveness of this large-scale conservation action by assessing fish communities across mainstem habitats before and after the ban (2018 to 2023). The seven-decadal biodiversity loss was halted with improvements in fish biomass, body condition, species diversity, and initial recovery of threatened species. Eliminating fishing pressure was likely key to this recovery, in addition to actions targeting water quality improvement, hydrological and riparian habitat restoration, and vessel traffic reduction. Ambitious conservation actions can halt biodiversity loss in the Yangtze River, bringing hope for biodiversity recovery in other large rivers.",

          "abstract": "Polyamines are often associated with ribosomes and are thought to stabilize their integrity. In Arabidopsis , the polyamine thermospermine (tSpm) affects xylem cell fate. tSpm induces translation of SUPPRESSOR-OF-ACAULIS51 (SAC51) and SAC51-LIKEs (SACLs), which inhibit heterodimerization of the xylem development proteins LONESOME-HIGHWAY (LHW) and TARGET-OF-MONOPTEROS5. Here, we report a methyltransferase, OVERACHIEVER, that methylates the peptidyl transferase center of the 25 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Residue m 3 U2952 promotes functional tSpm binding to a specific site connecting the P-site transfer RNA (tRNA) with rRNA residues in the peptidyl transferase center. This interaction enhances the translation of SACLs but inhibits that of LHW. Our study uncovers the dependency between a conserved rRNA base methylation and a polyamine in orchestrating cell fate decisions, highlighting a role for the ribosome chemical landscape in translational regulation.",

We report that transcription factor Etv3 is preferentially expressed in mature DCs, including tissue-derived migratory DCs (migDCs), and facilitates their homeostatic maturation and CCR7-dependent migration. Mice with global or DC-specific deletion of Etv3 manifested the expansion of CD25 low regulatory T (T reg ) cells, spontaneous activation of conventional T cells, and multiorgan T cell infiltration. Etv3 deficiency exacerbated TLR7-driven systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)–like disease, supporting the reported genetic association of human ETV3 with SLE. Etv3-deficient migDCs up-regulated multiple costimulatory molecules, including OX40 ligand (OX40L/TNFSF4), whose blockade partially rescued the T reg cell abnormalities. These results identify Etv3 as an essential regulator of the tolerogenic function of DCs and implicate it in the regulation of human autoimmunity.",

          "abstract": "Many plant pathogenic fungi penetrate host surfaces mechanically, using turgor pressure generated by specialized infection cells called appressoria. These appressoria develop semipermeable cell walls and accumulate osmolytes internally to create turgor by osmosis. Although melanin is known to be important for turgor generation, the mechanism underlying wall semipermeability remains unclear. By using reverse genetics, we identified that the enzymes PKS2 and PBG13 are required for forming the semipermeable barrier in fungi causing anthracnose and rice blast diseases. These enzymes synthesize 3,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid polymers that are essential for pathogenicity. These polymers reduce cell wall permeability and generate turgor, independently of melanization. Our findings uncover a mechanism of fungal turgor generation, linking enzyme function to pathogen penetration and disease potential, presenting new targets for disease control.",

We identified a poxvirus effector, myxoma virus M3.1, which elicited an antiviral nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) response. NF-κB was unleashed by an ETI pathway that sensed M3.1 attack of two antiviral complexes: zinc finger antiviral protein and TBK1. NF-κΒ activation occurred because the proteins inhibited by M3.1—N4BP1, ZC3H12A, and TBK1—are negative regulators of NF-κB. Our study established a systematic approach for the discovery of ETI pathways, and the results illustrated how negative regulators of immune responses may function in pathogen sensing.",

Here, we present a concerted desolvation:diffusion layered SEI architecture that provides abundant Li-ion flux for efficient N 2 conversion toward NH 3 production at high current densities. The SEI comprises stacked inorganic layers with low ion-binding affinity and high ion-conductivity functionalities that increase Li-ion flux by two orders of magnitude. This design strategy achieved N 2 electroreduction in a 2 M lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate electrolyte with a Faradaic efficiency of 98% and an energy efficiency of 21% for NH 3 production at 100 milliamperes per square centimeter (mA cm −2 ).

However, progress has been slow because of the complex genetic architecture of resistance. To better understand blight resistance, we compared reference genomes, gene expression responses, and stem metabolite profiles of the resistant Chinese and susceptible American chestnut species. To accelerate resistance breeding, we conducted large-scale phenotyping and genotyping in hybrids of these species. Simulation and inoculation experiments suggest that significant resistance gains are possible through selectively breeding trees with an average of 70 to 85% American chestnut ancestry. The resources developed in this work are foundational for breeding to create diverse restoration populations with sufficient disease resistance and competitive growth.",

Molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage systems, which harness photon energy and release it as heat on demand, provide a direct approach, but have long failed to meet practical benchmarks. Inspired by the architecture of DNA, we report a pyrimidone-based MOST system that stores energy in the strained Dewar photoisomer upon excitation at 300 nm. Designed with sustainability in mind, the system operates solvent-free and remains compatible with aqueous environments while overcoming one of the field’s greatest hurdles: the controlled extraction and transfer of stored heat. When catalyzed by acid, the Dewar isomer releases enough heat to boil water (~0.5 mL). These advances help point the way toward decentralized solar heat storage and off-grid energy solutions.",

Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we uncover ILF3 as an RNA binding protein connecting cytoplasmic mRNA decay and transcription during TA and show that it is required for a range of TA substrates. ILF3 is enriched at adapting genes’ RNAs, and its artificial recruitment through dCas13 promotes gene expression. Using tiling oligonucleotide screens, we identify trigger RNA fragments that activate adapting genes when introduced into cells. Further functional dissection reveals a critical role for homology between trigger and target sequences.

We measured a room-temperature thermal conductivity of ~1100 watts per meter-kelvin, nearly three times that of copper. Synchrotron-based inelastic x-ray scattering revealed a distinctive phonon band structure with a large acoustic-optical gap and phonon bunching, which suppress phonon-phonon scattering.

Besides dietary sources of animal origin, carnitine biosynthesis from trimethyllysine (TML) is essential, particularly for those who consume plant-based diets; however, its molecular regulation and physiological role remain elusive. Here, we identify SLC25A45 as a mitochondrial TML carrier that controls carnitine biosynthesis and fuel switching. SLC25A45 deficiency decreased the carnitine pool and impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, shifting reliance to carbohydrate metabolism. Slc25a45 -deficient mice were cold-intolerant and resistant to lipid mobilization by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), rendering them resistant to adipose tissue loss.

Despite recent advances in Western, industrialized contexts, we know far less about how cooperative behaviors emerge across cultures, how normative environments shape their development, and how these behaviors relate to one another. Here, we examined the development of four cooperative behaviors—fairness, trustworthiness, forgiveness, and honesty—in children ( N  = 413) aged 5 to 13 from five societies: urban United States, rural Uganda, Canada, Peru, and the hunter-horticulturalist Shuar of Ecuador. We also collected normative judgments from peers ( N  = 163) and adults ( N  = 86) of each community. We find substantial variation in cooperative behaviors and norms across populations, but, more generally, that children’s behaviors and norms tend to converge toward community-specific norms in middle childhood. We also identify three cooperative strategies—maximization, generic cooperation, and partner-contingent cooperation—whose prevalence shifts with age and differs across societies. Together, these findings illuminate how cooperative behavior develops within and across cultures.",

This study combines school zone shapefiles with census and Civil Rights Database data to explore whether neighborhood racial change in Black populations predicts changes in Black-white school suspension disparities from 2010 to 2018. We find that racial disparities in suspensions increased, particularly in neighborhoods experiencing substantial shifts in Black populations. These increases were especially pronounced in suburban and rural areas with shifting Black populations and all predominantly White neighborhoods. Although school discipline reforms aimed to reduce racial disparities, they only declined in certain types of neighborhoods, most notably in urban areas. Our findings advance insights into processes of school and neighborhood change, school discipline, and racial stratification, with broad policy implications.",

To address this, we have constructed a standardized database integrating donor/acceptor pairs, nine key fabrication parameters, and device efficiencies, consolidating over a decade of experimental results. Leveraging this resource, we developed a three-tiered machine learning framework using gradient boosting regression trees. The strategy progresses from single-parameter baseline models to stage-combined models that capture intraprocess synergies, culminating in a global nine-parameter optimization model. This final model achieves a Pearson correlation of &gt;0.9 and a success rate of &gt;80% in identifying optimal multiparameter configurations. Validation on 78 external systems, each containing a previously unseen donor or acceptor, demonstrates robust generalization with &gt;75% accuracy in predicting the optimal or secondary condition for individual parameters.

          "abstract": "Biogenic amines are fundamental for physiological homeostasis and behavioral control in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Monoamine neurotransmitters released in target brain regions conjointly regulate adaptive learning and plasticity. However, our understanding of these multianalyte mechanisms remains nascent, in part due to limitations in measurement technology. Here, during associative conditioning in honey bees, we concurrently tracked subsecond fluctuations in octopamine, tyramine, dopamine, and serotonin in the antennal lobe, where plasticity influences odorant representations. By repeatedly pairing an odorant with subsequent sucrose delivery, we observed individual differences in the conditioned response to odor, which occurred after a variable number of pairings (learners) or not at all (non-learners). The distinction between learners and non-learners was reflected in neurotransmitter responses across experimental conditions. The speed of learning, the number of pairings prior to a proboscis extension reflex, could be predicted from monoamine opponent signaling (octopamine-tyramine), from both the first presentation of the odorant alone, prior to any pairing with sucrose, and the first conditioned response to the odorant, coming after a number of sucrose pairings. These results suggest that monoamine signaling phenotypes may relate directly to the now widely reported socially relevant genetic differences in honey bee learning.",

          "abstract": "Anode-free sodium batteries (AFSBs) with near-theoretical energy density hold great promise for next-generation sustainable energy storage systems. However, their practical implementation is impeded by the low operating rate threshold (&lt;1 milliampere per square centimeter) and poor cycling stability, owing to dendritic sodium (Na) growth. Here, a high-rate and durable AFSB is successfully realized via a spatially anion-confined electrolyte strategy. Specifically, positively charged nanoparticles are introduced into the electrolyte to selectively anchor anions, generating localized contact ion pair–dominated solvation to facilitate rapid Na + desolvation at electrode interface and form an anion-derived solid electrolyte interphase. Meanwhile, rapid ion transport in the bulk electrolyte is maintained by the solvent-separated ion pair solvation structure in the nanoparticle periphery. These factors conjointly enable flat and dense Na deposition at high current densities. Consequently, an energy-type Na(Ni 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 )O 2 ||Al full cell exhibits an energy density of 415.6 watt-hour per kilogram cathode+anode even at 1 C (2.1 milliamperes per square centimeter) with 70.2% capacity retention over 400 cycles. A power-type Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ||Al cell achieves a trebled operation current density compared to the state-of-the-art AFSBs, exhibiting an unprecedented 5-C rate (3.8 milliamperes per square centimeter) with 70.0% capacity retention over 1400 cycles. This strategy presents a potentially universal approach for high-rate alkali metal batteries.",

Furthermore, we report that deletion of vapBC36 or vapC36 enhances the susceptibility of M. tuberculosis upon exposure to copper in vitro. Compared to the wild-type strain, Δ BC36 was attenuated for growth in guinea pigs. However, deletion of either vapC36 or vapBC36 did not affect M. tuberculosis growth in mice.

To address these challenges, we introduce a potassium dihydrogen phosphate competitive-binding interlayer that systematically reduces residual solvents at the buried interface through strong chemical interactions. Homogenized buried interface along with facilitated perovskite film quality and charge extraction have been achieved, enabling year-round improvements in photovoltaic performance and reproducibility. The resultant devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.3% (certified at 25.8%) for a 0.07–square centimeter device and 25.17% for a 1.028–square centimeter device.

          "abstract": "Cyclic peptides exhibit advantages in binding protein targets with high affinity and competency in inhibiting protein-protein interactions. Cyclic peptide phage display with more than a billion variants is an invaluable tool in drug discovery. However, achieving efficient peptide cyclization on phages remains a challenge because of the limited availability of reaction sites, which also restrict scaffold diversity. Here, we report an isothiocyanate-derived cross-linker featuring dual reactive groups: a bromide that covalently attaches to cysteine thiols and a thiocyanogen that selectively forms a thiourea bridge with either the N-terminal amino group or ε-amines of lysine, depending on pH. This strategy enables pH-modulated cyclization. At pH 6.5, head–to–side chain cyclization occurs, and at pH 9.5, side chain–to–side chain ligation is performed. Both processes simultaneously generate thiourea scaffolds. To demonstrate the versatility and biocompatibility of this approach, we constructed cyclic peptide libraries using both cyclization methods and successfully selected binders for several targets, including cyclophilin D, murine double minute 2, and Keap1, with dissociation constants ranging from micromolar to nanomolar. Given the broad pharmacological potential of the thiourea moiety, this phage display library opens previously unidentified chemical space with high scaffold diversity and the integration of a proven pharmacophore for the development of cyclic peptide therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "The genetic mechanisms of ~90% of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)–associated variants residing in noncoding DNA remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed a deep learning framework that integrates bulk histone modification data with single-cell open chromatin profiles to evaluate the regulatory potential of noncoding variants. This model identified 1457 silencer and 3084 enhancer AD-associated variants in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, classifying gene loci as silencer-only (SL), enhancer-only (EN), or dual-function (ENSL). EN loci predominantly regulate housekeeping metabolic processes, SL loci (including MS4A6A and HLA-D ) are linked to immune responses (with ~70% substantially up-regulated in AD microglia), while ENSL loci are implicated in neurofibrillary tangle assembly. Our model achieves robust power in assessing the impact of regulatory variants, with ~70% directional concordance with experimental results. It identified rs636317 as a putative causal silencer variant, distinguishing it from a neutral variant located 11 base pairs away. This study advances understanding of the AD-associated regulatory landscape and provides a framework for ascertaining noncoding variants in AD pathogenesis.",

Using reliable genomic data from the fecal samples of 18 gibbons, generated through a systematically established pipeline, and from four museum specimens, our analyses reveal that Hainan gibbons have the smallest effective population size and low genetic diversity but, unexpectedly, low inbreeding and genetic load among threatened primates assessed thus far. This results from a millennial expansion mitigating bottleneck effects and a high local recombination maintaining selection efficiency. Notably, we uncover two cryptic lineages, whose recent crosses led to new family groups with increased heterozygosity.

Using programmable optical ring vortices (Laguerre-Gaussian beams), we assemble and rotate colloidal clusters with certain particle numbers, whose induced hydrodynamic flows apply switchable in-plane and out-of-plane torques on target particles. Torque control is achieved via two mechanisms: (i) reversing the handedness of circular polarization to break rotational symmetry and (ii) displacing optical ring vortices and modulating cluster rotation speed. These complementary controls provide robust, high-resolution torques tuned in arbitrary directions. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate full three-dimensional orientation control of a single cell. This framework greatly expands the capabilities of optohydrodynamic systems by explicitly incorporating light-driven interparticle interactions and establishes a foundation for advanced applications in biophysics, microrobotics, and biomedical engineering.",

          "abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) causes thrombotic microangiopathy, yet the red blood cell (RBC)–centered mechanism has remained unclear. We identify the RTX-family hemolysin EhxA as the driver of RBC-mediated thrombogenesis. Deletion of ehxA abolishes Ca 2+ influx, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, progression from discocyte to echinocyte to spherocyte, thrombin generation, RBC-endothelium adhesion, and RBC aggregation. Genetic complementation restores these readouts to wild type, and purified EhxA in bacteria-free assays recapitulates them while localizing to intact RBC membranes. By contrast, Δ stx2 mutants do not elicit these RBC phenotypes, distinguishing this pathway from Shiga toxin–dependent effects. Multiple regression quantifies the link between PS exposure, morphology, and procoagulant outputs. In rats, infection with wild type increased RBC remodeling and venous thrombosis, whereas infection with Δ ehxA did not. Together, the data define an EhxA-Ca 2+ -PS pathway that drives RBC structural remodeling and procoagulant activation during EHEC infection and nominate RTX toxins as targets for preventing toxin-induced coagulopathies.",

Here, we go beyond prior meta-analyses or species-level studies by providing a global, population-level empirical analysis of threat interactions by examining 3129 vertebrate population time series worldwide with documented exposure to single and multiple threats. Populations affected solely by habitat loss or exploitation do not exhibit the steepest declines; instead, disease, invasive species, pollution, and climate change are associated with faster declines. Interactive threats contribute more to population declines than temporal or spatial variation.

Unlike VZV-specific CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells exhibited profound age-sensitive changes including memory subset shifts, reduced T cell receptor diversity, and loss of stem-like features. Vaccination of older adults with the adjuvanted vaccine did not restore CD8 + defects but selectively enhanced T helper 17 (T H 17) CD4 + T cells and prevented their conversion into regulatory T cells, likely through lipid metabolic regulation. Thus, durable vaccine efficacy with aging relies on antigen-specific T H 17 cells that compensate for CD8 + T cell defects.",

The predominant hypothesis is that macroevolutionary dynamics and climatic niche conservatism explain today’s elevational patterns of biodiversity, but the alternative energy efficiency hypothesis emphasizes modern ecological interactions related to energy budgets. We test these competing hypotheses by examining seasonal elevational ranges for 10,998 bird populations in 34 mountain regions. Multiple lines of evidence support the energy efficiency hypothesis, including that many mountain birds do not seasonally track their thermal niche with high fidelity while simulation models based on optimal energy balancing under current environmental conditions yield predictions that tightly match empirical data. Our results reveal that altitudinal migration, which is widespread yet considerably understudied, is a behavioral mechanism fulfilling the same ecological function as long-distance latitudinal migration. Overall, this work provides a better understanding and predictive capacity for mountain birds under global change.",

Here, we find gas vortex effects in butterfly wings that can prolong molecular residence time and apply this bioinspired mechanism to gas sensor design to resolve this trade-off. We establish a universal design rule: Periodic microcavities with diameter-to-height ratios of 1 to 1.33 generate centralized vortices that prolong molecular residence time by 85% and optimize mass transfer efficiency, as validated through computational fluid dynamics, fluorescence tracking, and Sherwood number analysis. This geometric principle enables metal oxide (ZnO, In 2 O 3 , Co 3 O 4 , and WO 3 ) sensors to achieve ultralow detection limits (0.8 to 30 parts per billion) while maintaining long-period stability. A four-channel microsensor array leveraging vortex-enhanced microstructures enables real-time profiling of human breath biomarkers.

Targeting allosteric sites can increase specificity, reduce toxicity, and allow fine-tuning of activity; however, most allosteric sites in enzymes are unmapped. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental allosteric map of the Src protein kinase. We quantify the effects of more than 50,000 single and double amino acid substitutions on activity and abundance and use thermodynamic modeling to disentangle changes in fold stability and catalysis. The comprehensive energy landscape reveals that allostery across the kinase domain is extensive, directionally biased, and modulated by its regulatory domains. Inhibitory—but not activating—allosteric mutations show a strong distance-dependent decay away from the active site. Using the map, we identify multiple potentially druggable allosteric sites not previously reported in Src or other kinases.

These effects are durable and last beyond the predicted life span of differentiated myeloid cells such as macrophages. The present study investigated MBV-directed epigenetic modification in myeloid precursors as a potential explanation for their prolonged immunomodulatory effects. Flow cytometry and ATAC sequencing studies show that MBV are internalized by myeloid cell progenitors in the bone marrow and in macrophages after terminal differentiation. This internalization is coincident with epigenetic changes that are associated with modulation of macrophage responses to inflammatory stimuli. Furthermore, MBV treatment differentially alters chromatin accessibility as a function of cell differentiation state (i.e., myeloid progenitor versus macrophage). The present study shows the epigenetic effects of MBV on myeloid cells, representing a potential avenue to exploit the therapeutic potential of biologic scaffold materials.",

Traditionally, they were thought to depend primarily on the evolutionarily “newer” direct corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway. However, recent studies suggest that the “older” indirect corticospinal pathways, mediated by spinal premotor interneurons (PreM-INs), also contribute, highlighting the need to clarify their functional differences. Here, we recorded neuronal activity from PreM-INs and CM cells in macaques during a precision grip task to compare their roles in generating hand muscle activity. Our results show that PreM-INs exert stronger facilitation across a broader set of muscles, promoting synergistic coactivation, whereas CM cells provide more selective facilitation, enabling control of relatively individual muscles. Decomposition analysis further revealed that these systems correspond to different control modes—synergy-based and individual-based control—balancing stability and flexibility. These findings redefine our understanding of primate dexterous hand control as emerging from the cooperative integration of evolutionarily distinct premotoneuronal systems.",

Our analyses reveal variable, highly elevated hydroxyl radical concentrations in the first 2 hours, resulting in evident fire-to-fire variability in VOCs oxidation and in ozone and PAN production. About 40 to 70% of the variability is explained by chemical aging. Ozone production in the plumes is usually VOC-limited for the first 2 hours and then nitrogen oxide limited downwind. Box model results for hydroxyl radical, ozone, and most VOCs, using the full, explicit Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) mechanism, suggest no major gaps in the current best knowledge of gas-phase chemistry. However, the MCM sometimes overestimates PAN due to underestimated nitrogen oxide sinks. GEOS-Chem, a widely used chemical transport model with a reduced mechanism, generally underperforms because of incomplete VOC representation.

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first committed step in this pathway and has long been viewed as a cytoplasmic enzyme. Here, we reveal that PAL responds to elevated flavonoid levels in Arabidopsis by undergoing phosphorylation and relocating to the nucleus. Nuclear sequestration of PAL reduces its cytoplasmic abundance and enzymatic activity, resulting in rapid suppression of phenylpropanoid metabolic flux. In parallel, nuclear-localized PAL interacts with the transcription factor TT8, disrupting MBW complex formation and down-regulating flavonoid biosynthetic genes. This dual mechanism enables PAL to act as a metabolic feedback regulator that dynamically adjusts flavonoid production in response to internal metabolic states. Our findings redefine PAL as both a biosynthetic enzyme and a responsive integrator of cellular metabolic status, establishing a previously unknown paradigm for feedback control in plant specialized metabolism.",

Tail amputation, however, induced expansion of MuSC potential yielding clonal contribution to muscle, connective tissue including cartilage, pericytes, and fibroblasts. This expanded potential was not observed during limb regeneration, and cross-transplantation showed that these differences in potential are likely intrinsically determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiling revealed that tail MuSCs revert to an embryonic mesoderm–like state. Through genetic manipulation involving the overexpression of constitutively active transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptors or Smad7 (antagonist of TGF-β signaling) in MuSCs, we demonstrated that the levels of TGF-β signal determine the fate outcome of MuSCs to connective tissue lineage or muscle, respectively.

          "abstract": "Seismic hazard estimates rely on interevent time distributions between earthquakes of a given magnitude. In the Himalaya, recurrence intervals are usually modeled as cyclic or quasiperiodic, whereas globally, they range from periodic and clustered to random. Statistical analyses of a 6000-year lake-sediment seismic record, calibrated against regional instrumental data, worldwide paleoseismic records, and synthetic seismic catalogs, demonstrate that time intervals between large earthquakes ( M  ≥ 6.5, based on shaking intensity thresholds calibrated locally) robustly follow a Poisson distribution. Second-order fluctuations indicate event clustering. These observations contradict periodic or quasiperiodic recurrence models. Comparisons with paleoseismic data from other tectonic settings and realistic synthetic catalogs confirm the robustness and broad applicability of these findings. Thus, major earthquakes appear as stochastic as smaller ones, challenging recurrence models derived from limited datasets and substantially increasing seismic hazard estimates.",

          "abstract": "Vertebrate vision relies on two photoreceptor types: cones for bright light and rods for dim light. The current dogma is that vertebrates develop cone-dominated retinas first, adding rods later. Here we show that larval deep-sea fishes have “hybrid” photoreceptors, expressing cone-specific genes in rod-like cells. Through development, they either retain these rod-like cones (in Maurolicus mucronatus ) or transition to true rods expressing rod-specific genes and transcription factors (in Vinciguerria mabahiss and Benthosema pterotum ). Unlike most marine fish larvae, which inhabit brightly lit waters, deep-sea fish larvae experience deeper and dimmer environments. By combining rod-like morphology with cone-like molecular machinery, hybrid photoreceptors likely maximize visual performance under such conditions. Consistently, spectral maxima predictions and environmental light estimations suggest tuning to the prevailing light environment throughout life. Our findings provide molecular, morphological, and functional evidence for the evolution of an alternative developmental trajectory for vertebrate vision.",

          "abstract": "Synthetic gene circuits often behave unpredictably in batch cultures, where shifting physiological states are rarely accounted for in conventional models. Here, we find that degradation-tagged protein reporters could exhibit transient oscillatory expression, which standard single-scale models do not capture. We resolve this discrepancy by developing Gene Expression Across Growth Stages (GEAGS), a dual-scale modeling framework that explicitly couples intracellular gene expression to logistic population growth. Using a chemical reaction network model with growth phase–dependent rate-modifying functions, GEAGS accurately reproduces the observed transient oscillations and identifies amino acid recycling and growth-phase transition as key drivers. We reduce the model to an effective form for practical use and demonstrate its adaptability by applying it to layered feedback circuits, resolving long-standing mismatches between model predictions and measured dynamics. These results establish GEAGS as a generalizable platform for predicting emergent behaviors in synthetic gene circuits and underscore the importance of multiscale modeling for robust circuit design in dynamic environments.",

Central to programming these shape transformations is the spatial alignment of microscale liquid crystal mesogens. Existing 4D printing methods for LCEs are constrained by the alignment of mesogens within 2D planes, thereby limiting the range of achievable deformation. This work presents a robotic direct-ink-writing conformal 4D printing technology that enables deposition of LCEs onto complex, nonplanar 3D substrates. An algorithm is developed to generate printing paths, point normals, and control codes to guide the motion of a six-axis robotic arm. Conformal printing is demonstrated on various surfaces with different printing paths, and the resulting shape-changing behaviors are studied to highlight the unlocked design space. Integration with 3D scanning further allows printing onto substrates with unknown geometries, such as egg surfaces, which enables applications in on-demand protective coatings and structural repair.",

We circumvent these problems by making use of the critical behaviors in the Jaynes-Cummings model, to which the signal field is coupled. The information is encoded in the qubit’s excitation number, which displays a divergent changing rate at the critical point, and is extremely robust against decoherence and nonadiabatic effects. We demonstrate such a metrological protocol in a superconducting circuit, where an Xmon qubit, interacting with a resonator, is used as a probe for estimating the amplitude of a microwave field.

We find that 19% of peptides act as strong degrons, 30% as intermediate, and 51% as non-degrons. We identify both known and previously unidentified degradation signals and show that most depend on the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the proteasome. Structural mapping shows that many degrons are buried and likely become active upon protein unfolding. Training of a machine learning model allowed us to describe the degron properties and predict the cellular abundance of missense variants that operate by forming degrons in exposed and disordered protein regions, thus providing a mechanism of pathogenicity for germline coding variants at such positions.",

Here, we report a scalable strategy to fabricate continuous-wave, electrically pumped WGM blue microlasers based on III-nitride semiconductors with low threshold current densities and high slope efficiencies across diverse diameters from 10 to 160 micrometers. This high performance was achieved through effective vertical optical confinement by the waveguide structures and minimal sidewall scattering from atomically smooth surfaces. We further converted the laser cavity from a microdisk to a microring, which suppresses high-order WGMs and allows for single-mode operation with a high Q factor of 17,066.

Deep learning processes multilayer thermal patterns to extract both parameters in real time. Validation through benchtop testing, finite element analysis, and on-body trials demonstrates accurate measurements across relevant flow rates and vessel depths.

To investigate this, whole EOC spheroids were observed using a multiphoton microscope, and their invasion ability was assessed. Mesothelial cells were identified as notable components of ascites through morphological assessment, immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Almost all EOC cells were spheroids, with 60% containing mesothelial cells. EOC cells quickly generate aggregated spheroids with mesothelial cells, and these aggregated cancer-mesothelial spheroids (ACMSs) invade collagen or mesothelial layers. Mesothelial cells forming ACMSs initiated the invasion. RNA sequencing analysis revealed marked RNA expression changes in mesothelial cells, whereas the changes in EOC cells were minor. Transforming growth factor–β1–stimulated mesothelial cells showed increased invadopodium formation along with fascin-1 up-regulation.

The neuronal membrane–associated periodic skeleton (MPS), an actin spectrin–based cytoskeletal lattice, is known to restrict clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in axons, but its broader role in other neuronal compartments and endocytic pathways remains unclear. Here, we show that all four major endocytic pathways—CME, caveolin-, flotillin-, and fast endophilin–mediated endocytosis—are spatially gated by the MPS and occur exclusively within MPS-free “clearing” zones throughout all neuronal compartments. Disrupting the MPS broadly enhances both basal and ligand-induced endocytosis. We also identify a previously unknown feedback loop in which ligand-triggered endocytosis activates extracellular signal–regulated kinase signaling, promoting protease-mediated spectrin cleavage and MPS disruption, which in turn facilitates further endocytosis. Furthermore, the MPS limits amyloid precursor protein endocytosis, thereby suppressing Aβ42 production and linking MPS integrity to neurodegeneration.

          "abstract": "Entangled quantum states are essential ingredients for many quantum technologies, but they must be validated before they are used. As a full characterization is prohibitively resource intensive, recent work has focused on developing methods to efficiently extract a few parameters of interest, in a so-called verification framework. Most existing approaches are based on preparing an ensemble of nominally identical and independently distributed (IID) quantum states and then measuring each copy of the ensemble. However, this leaves no states left for the intended quantum tasks and the IID assumptions do not always hold experimentally. To overcome these challenges, we experimentally implement quantum state certification (QSC), which measures only a subset of the ensemble, certifying the fidelity of multiple copies of the remaining states. We use active optical switches to randomly sample from sources of two-photon Bell states and three-photon GHZ (Greenberger-Horn-Zeilinger) states, reporting statistically sound fidelities in real time without destroying the entire ensemble. In addition, our QSC protocol removes the assumption that the states are identically distributed (but still assumes independent copies); can achieve close N −1 scaling, in the number of states measured N ; and can be implemented in a device-independent manner. Together, these benefits make our QSC protocol suitable for benchmarking large-scale quantum computing devices and deployed quantum communication setups relying on entanglement in both standard and adversarial situations.",

In-depth proteomics, state-of-the-art imaging, and ultrasensitive DA probes uncovered that decreased vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) protein and function impaired vesicular DA uptake, resulting in reduced vesicle availability and abnormal vesicle morphology.

Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of opioid receptors (ORs) offer a promising approach to enhance opioid efficacy while reducing risks of overdose. In this study, we unveil the selective mechanism of PAM modulation of the OR family through structure elucidation of the δ-opioid receptor and μ-opioid receptor (μOR) bound to orthosteric agonists and PAMs BMS986187 (BMS187) and BMS986122 (BMS122). In addition, we uncovered an unexpected but conserved allosteric site across the transmembrane helices TM2 to TM4 of ORs, occupied by BMS187 but not BMS122. Leveraging these structural insights, we designed 9-(5-(4-chlorophenyl)furan-2-yl)-3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-3,4,5,6,7,9-hexahydro-1 H -xanthene-1,8(2 H )-dione (MPAM-15), whose αβ cooperativity factor is 33-fold higher than BMS122 and threefold higher than BMS187, indicating markedly stronger positive allosterism. Animal studies demonstrate that MPAM-15 shows excellent brain penetration and enhances morphine-induced antinociception without exacerbating respiratory depression or constipation. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that MPAM-15 promotes and stabilizes the conformational equilibrium of μOR toward the canonical active state, providing a mechanistic basis for its enhanced allosteric potency. These discoveries substantially advance our understanding of OR allosteric mechanism and pave the way for the structure-based development of allosteric opioid analgesics.",

          "abstract": "Thrombotic disorders remain among the leading causes of global mortality, yet current thrombolytic therapies are limited by poor targeting specificity and inadequate microenvironmental modulation, resulting in suboptimal efficacy and serious side effects. Here, we developed a hydrogen-generating nanothrombolytic agent that enables enzymatic clot dissolution in combination with intelligent microenvironment reprogramming. Specifically, we assembled urokinase, a clinical thrombolytic drug, with hydrogenated silicene (SiH) nanosheet and fibrinogen, a substrate of coagulation reaction, to promote thrombolysis. Functionally, SiH nanosheet plays multiple roles in the nanothrombolytics: blocking the functional sites of urokinase to durably inhibit its activity in circulation to prevent systemic bleeding, followed by urokinase reactivation in response to SiH nanosheet self-degradation and prothrombotic microenvironment regulation through the in situ hydrogen generation, which mitigates the oxidative stress of vascular endothelial cells and inhibits their release of procoagulant factors. This microenvironment-adaptive thrombolysis strategy offers a promising paradigm for the precise management of thrombotic emergencies.",

Staphylococcus aureus is a multihost pathogen responsible for a global burden of human disease and a leading cause of intramammary infection in dairy cattle. Here, we demonstrate that following historical human-to-bovine host switch events, S. aureus has undergone adaptive metabolic remodeling in response to distinct nutrient availability in the dairy niche. In particular, we found that bovine S. aureus has evolved the capacity for protease-mediated degradation of casein, a protein abundant in bovine milk, to access nutrients for proliferation. This phenotype has evolved convergently in different S. aureus lineages via mutations in distinct gene loci driving overexpression of the protease aureolysin. Together, we have dissected a key host-adaptive trait, which facilitates the enzymatic release of nutrients from a substrate specific to the new host milieu. These findings highlight the remarkable evolutionary plasticity of a major bacterial pathogen underpinning its multihost species tropism.",

However, the spatial distribution of Aβ within the human brain remains unclear as the vascular network’s complexity and scale hinder visualization by conventional thin-slice analysis. To address this, we performed three-dimensional (3D) volumetric imaging of the cerebrovascular network and Aβ deposition in autopsied brains with CAA using advanced tissue clearing and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, labeling for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and Aβ. We found prominent Aβ deposition and SMA loss in leptomeningeal and superficial cortical segments, which were anatomically contiguous with deeper Aβ-positive segments, indicating a surface-to-deep progression pattern of Aβ extension. The perivascular plaque density was significantly lower around Aβ-positive vessels. This technology may provide further insights into CAA pathology and is recommended for research on the 3D pathology of neurological disorders.",

This study reveals a reciprocal regulatory relationship between TOPPs and ethylene insensitive 2 (EIN2)–mediated ethylene signaling. We identified that ethylene can induce TOPPs ’ expression, and topp1/4/5 mutants exhibited partial ethylene insensitivity with reduced EIN3 protein. Mechanistically, TOPPs function upstream of EIN2 and interact with its carboxyl-terminal domain (CEND) to dephosphorylate the S655 residue. This site-specific dephosphorylation promotes EIN2 stability and EIN2 CEND nuclear accumulation, thereby activating ethylene responses. Notably, EIN2 S655A -YFP/ein2-5 plants displayed constitutive ethylene responses and improved salt tolerance. Further investigation showed that EIN3/EIN3 like 1 (EIL1) activates TOPPs ’ expression by binding to their promoters, amplifying ethylene signaling accordingly. Together, our finding establishes TOPPs as key regulators in ethylene signaling and reveal a dephosphorylation switch mechanism governing EIN2 function, providing critical insight into how EIN2 posttranslational modifications mediate plant stress adaptation.",

Our meta-analysis differentiates scenarios that project biodiversity loss and that halt or reverse the trend based on their quantitative outcomes and explores their key characteristics such as scenario assumptions, drivers of loss, biodiversity indicators and models used. We found that bending-the-curve studies are scarce, and mostly do no account for climate change, which risks suggesting that the trend can be bent too easily. Our findings indicate that bending is only achievable with integrated efforts across different sectors, such as nature conservation, sustainable food production, diet change, and reduced food waste. To better support policymaking, scenarios should be based on model intercomparisons and use standardize indicators to allow comparisons across studies, account for additional drivers of loss to represent the real threats to biodiversity, and include more ambitious cross-sectoral actions to effectively bend the curve.",

Although chemical gradients are known to drive diffusiophoretic migration of colloids, these nonequilibrium forces have largely been ignored in porous media flows. Under typical subsurface conditions, flow velocities within preferential pathways exceed phoretic velocities by orders of magnitude, suggesting that diffusiophoresis would be limited to stagnant pockets. Here, using microfluidic experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling, we show that even moderate solute gradients, typical of natural mixing, can markedly alter colloid transport. We uncover a previously overlooked effect: cross-streamline phoretic migration within preferential flow pathways, which changes macroscopic dispersion by orders of magnitude and suppresses the impact of geometric disorder on transport. Our findings challenge classical models of colloid transport, highlighting the broad implications of solute gradients for technological, biomedical, and environmental applications.",

Here, we fabricate a unique 3D photonic antiferromagnetic topological insulator with net zero magnetization that can simultaneously support different-dimensional hinge states and unpaired surface Dirac cones on neighboring facets. Owing to the chiral anomaly present in a finite-size sample, the gapless surface Dirac cone, neighbored by facets with surface Dirac masses of opposite signs, is further converted, exhibiting 2D planar one-way propagation. In conjunction with 1D hinge states, we experimentally observe a closed chiral loop for nonreciprocal hinge–surface transport across dimensions in topological photonics, similar to that theoretically proposed in 3D quantum anomalous Hall materials. Our findings enrich the chiral boundary features of 3D magnetic topological insulators and offer a topological strategy for exploring ideal cross-dimensional devices.",

Here, we investigated how circHomer1 , a brain-enriched circular RNA derived from the Homer1 gene, affects hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Our results demonstrate that circHomer1 plays a vital role in mediating the dendritic targeting of messenger RNAs that encode postsynaptic proteins by acting as a molecular bridge between the motor protein Kinesin 1 and core components of neuronal ribonucleoprotein granules, including Fused in Sarcoma and Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, at dendrites. This interaction influences synaptic function, the structural morphology of dendritic spines, and hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory.

Environmental stressors significantly elevate EV release, indicating that planarians dynamically regulate vesicle production. Functionally, planarian EVs mediate intercellular communication by transferring regulatory signals: We find that they shuttle small RNAs that effect systemic RNA interference (RNAi) throughout the organism. Notably, gene knockdown experiments reveal a crucial role for AGO-3, a member of the Argonaute family of proteins, in modulating the association of small interfering RNAs with EVs, linking the intracellular RNAi machinery to EV-based signaling.

Under magnetic field stimulation, DC@CFO/BFO localizes to ribosomes and enhances protein synthesis by modulating electrostatic interactions at the ribosomal exit tunnel. This ribosome-targeted modulation promotes type II immune response via IL-4 induction and TAF9B-dependent transcriptional programming, thereby enhancing T helper 2 (T H 2) cell proliferation. In murine models of colitis and arthritis, both systemic administration of DC@CFO/BFO and adoptive transfer of magnetoelectricity-responsive T H 2 cells attenuated inflammation and restored immune homeostasis. In contrast, these effects were abrogated in Taf9b -deficient T cells, underscoring the essential role of TAF9B in mediating this response.

Glycolysis and glucose transport inhibition show that these pathways support OEC cytokine release, highlighting the partial control of antifungal epithelial immunity by cellular metabolism. However, glucose supplementation disrupts OEC responses both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the fungus benefits from these metabolic shifts and that increased aerobic glycolysis in OECs is detrimental. Genome-scale metabolic modeling predicted a shutdown of the TCA cycle and a previously unidentified role for glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1) in response to C. albicans , which was subsequently shown to be important for OEC survival during infection.

The cell biological basis underlying hybrid incompatibility remains largely unknown, especially in mammals. Here, we found that female hybrids between Mus musculus domesticus and Mus spicilegus mice are sterile due to the failure of homologous-chromosome separation in oocyte meiosis, producing aneuploid eggs. This nondisjunction phenotype was driven by the mislocalization of the cohesin protector, SGO2, along the chromosome arms instead of its typical centromeric enrichment, resulting in cohesin overprotection. The upstream kinase, BUB1, showed a higher activity in hybrid oocytes, explaining SGO2 mistargeting. Higher BUB1 activity was not observed in mitosis, consistent with viable hybrid mice. Cohesion defects were also evident in hybrid mice from another genus, Peromyscus , wherein cohesin protection is weakened. Defective cohesion in oocytes is a leading cause of reduced fertility.

The leaked DOM proved to be diatom-derived and changed the amount and composition of DOM in the surrounding seawater substantially. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, high protein-like fluorescence, and low carbon:nitrogen ratios classified the leaked DOM as labile. The bioavailability of leaked DOM was demonstrated by its rapid utilization by a pelagic microbial community, leaving mainly recalcitrant DOM behind.

          "abstract": "The Ustilaginoidea virens effector SCRE2 has been previously identified to be an essential virulence factor. To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying SCRE2 virulence function, we identify that SCRE2 interacts with Oryza sativa S-like ribonuclease family member OsRNS4. As a catalytically inactive RNase, OsRNS4 positively regulates rice immunity, depending on its RNA binding ability. OsRNS4 is unconventionally secreted through tetraspanin-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs). OsRNS4 binds to certain groups of rice miRNAs, whereas SCRE2 prevents the binding of OsRNS4 to miRNAs. Especially, OsRNS4-bound miR528-5p in rice is detected in false smut balls and silences the gene UvSfk1 essential for U. virens virulence. Thus, OsRNS4 might act as a carrier to transport miRNAs from rice into fungi, which target the virulence genes in U. virens and thereby contributes to rice resistance against fungal pathogens. As an unidentified counter-defense mechanism, SCRE2 suppresses cross-kingdom RNA interference to promote infection through inhibiting OsRNS4 binding to miRNAs.",

Here, we leverage 2519 modern human genomes and four high-coverage archaic hominin genomes to systematically characterize nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs). We uncover 483 polymorphic NUMTs across globally diverse human populations and 10 in archaic genomes. By combining overlap with Neanderthal-derived and Denisovan-derived haplotypes, phylogenetic analyses, insertion time estimates, and haplotype colocalization, we identify five NUMTs introduced into modern humans via archaic hominin introgression. Functional analyses reveal that introgressed NUMTs can modulate gene expression, including allele-specific up-regulation of the immune-related gene RASGRP3 , and reshape three-dimensional chromatin structure at loci such as SCD5 and HNRNPD . These findings highlight an underappreciated mechanism by which archaic mitochondrial fragments shape nuclear genome function and evolution. Our study reframes NUMTs not as passive genomic fossils but as dynamic elements influencing modern human diversity and adaptation.",

Using RNA-seq, we identified CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5 as up-regulated chemokines, suggesting their potential as host restriction factors. TAK-779, a CXCR3/CCR5/CCR2 antagonist, enhanced GII.3 HuNoV replication and viral spread in a dose- and time-dependent manner, enabling successful passaging of GII.3 HuNoV in two different HIE lines and generation of viral stocks. Sequencing passaged virus revealed one consensus change in the major capsid protein and several dynamic adaptations, suggesting emergence of variants. TAK-779 also enhanced replication of GI.1 and GII.17 strains, but not GII.4, suggesting strain-specific host interactions. This breakthrough in passaging provides insight into HuNoV-host interactions, establishes a scalable in vitro system for virus propagation, and opens avenues for structural, biochemical, and therapeutic studies.",

While basally dividing progenitors are implicated in neocortical growth, their developmental origins and relevance beyond the cortex remain unclear. We show here that double inactivation of spindle orientation regulators GPSM2 and SAPCD2 in mice completely reorients progenitor divisions in both the neocortex and retina. This shift increases basal progenitors over sixfold in the neocortex and induces their ectopic emergence in the retina, resulting in extra cell layers and ~30% tissue enlargement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the induced basal progenitors in the cortex resemble human outer radial glia, and both cortical and retinal progenitors show altered Hippo signaling. Last, macaque and human retinas display twice as many reoriented divisions as the mouse and naturally contain basal progenitors. These findings show that division orientation is critical for regulating neural progenitor output and scaling tissue growth.",

To address such limitation, we propose a line scanning–based photoacoustic computed mesoscopic (PACMes) approach for noninvasive, high-resolution, and longitudinal visualization of cerebral vasculature inside the intact mouse brain. This technique uses converging near-infrared (NIR) lines scanned at multiple angles for tight optical excitation; a low-frequency, full-ring ultrasound transducer array for high-sensitivity detection; and a compound reconstruction algorithm integrating filtered back-projection and optical localization of photoacoustic signals to recover the image. We perform long-term (&gt;5 months), noninvasive imaging of the entire cortex of mice through the intact scalp and skull with a field of view of 13 millimeters and a spatial resolution of 33 micrometers.

          "abstract": "Aquatic animals such as octopuses use soft suction cups to solve the persistent challenge of wet attachment on rough surfaces. Detachment has long been described as smooth drainage governed by a Reynolds-type pressure gradient. Combining spatiotemporal pressure mapping with confocal imaging of the fluid layer between a suction cup-substrate interface, we reveal a two-stage, nonequilibrium pathway for pressure equalization that challenges this conventional view. Suction-induced elastic deformation dynamically remodels the interfacial fluid, producing a self-coupled pressure channel system. Stage I is governed by an outward-moving invasion-percolation suction front with diffusion-like scaling. When internal suction falls below a critical value, the network opens globally, and stage II follows classical Poiseuille drainage. This mechanism defines a self-modifying percolation in which the flow remodels its own pathways, which advances our understanding of biological suction and viscous adhesion and suggests design principles for long-lived wet adhesives and hydrogel microfluidics.",

At short times, the mean squared displacement becomes ballistic, scaling as t 2 . This effect was predicted by Einstein in 1907 and recently observed experimentally. We report that this picture is only true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of t 5 / 2 . This result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a nonzero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on nonzero initial velocities.

We investigate how volcanic eruptions may have occasionally triggered abrupt climate change during the last glacial period. Our results show that very large equatorial eruptions can induce large changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation via atmospheric and ocean circulation changes and air-sea buoyancy fluxes, potentially pushing the climate system between persistent warm and cold states lasting millennia. A simplified perspective of the dynamics shows how unforced natural climate variability may exert a stabilizing influence decades after an eruption, especially as the system nears a tipping point.",

Herein, we disclose that nanocollisions caused by endogenous bioparticles, such as extracellular vesicles, can induce localized membrane deformations. This spatially confined mechanical input activates Piezo1 at collision sites and promotes myosin IIA phosphorylation–mediated F-actin stabilization, enhancing DC intrinsic motility. Subsequent diffusion of Ca 2+ up-regulates chemotaxis machinery, improving their capacity of tumor microenvironment patrolling and lymph node homing for antitumor immunity. This finding reveals a previously unidentified mechanoimmunological mechanism of immune surveillance. To accelerate the translation of this mechanism into clinical therapeutics, we developed an ultrasound-responsive nanocollision generator using gas-liquid-solid triphase conversion.

In this ecological study, we used a doubly robust method, incorporating flexible generalized propensity score estimation that captured potential nonlinearity and interactions among confounders and relaxed the distribution form assumption for exposure, to estimate the effects of annual exposure to wildfire smoke PM 2.5 on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the contiguous United States from 2006 to 2020. We found that wildfire smoke PM 2.5 was associated with increased mortality rate for all studied outcomes, except for deaths from transport accidents or falls, which served as negative outcome controls. Wildfire smoke PM 2.5 was responsible for ~24,100 all-cause deaths per year in the contiguous United States. The exposure-response curve for all-cause mortality increased monotonically, with no evidence of a “safe” threshold. Among the six cause-specific outcomes, mortality from neurological disease showed the greatest increase per 0.1 μg/m 3 increase in smoke PM 2.5 exposure.

By subsecond live imaging of locally injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across time and space: a millisecond, long-range, membrane depolarization gradient, followed by second-persistent intracellular calcium responses. In the subsequent hour, voltage sensing phosphatase senses the injury-driven membrane potential change and autonomously translates the electric signal intracellularly, promoting tissue-wide cell proliferation. Connecting these dynamics with an electrodiffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fin’s interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading.

Leveraging a microtask design to measure daily fluctuations in cognitive function, goal setting and goal progress, mood, sleep, and motivation over a 12-week intensive longitudinal study of university students ( N  = 184, time points = 9248), we show that within-person upswings in domain-general cognitive processing precision precede and predict same-day self-reported goal setting and achievement across both academic and nonacademic domains, even controlling for other factors. A one-standard-deviation change in cognitive precision had an effect statistically equivalent to ~40 min of work, with similar or larger predictive effects compared to fluctuations in mood/motivation and no moderation by trait-level self-control or conscientiousness.

Here, we identify a dual-functional ensemble within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that modulates both anxiety-like behaviors and insomnia through distinct neural circuits. Specifically, a subset of BNST neurons exhibits enhanced activity in response to anxiety-related cues and during wakefulness. Activation of these ensemble neurons exacerbates anxiety-like behaviors and reduces non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in chronic restraint stress (CRS) mice. Conversely, inactivation of these neurons alleviates anxiety-like behaviors and promotes NREM sleep. In addition, anxiolytic-hypnotic medication attenuates BNST stress ensemble hyperactivity, mitigating both phenotypes. Furthermore, BNST stress ensembles project divergently to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the preoptic area (POA): DRN-projecting neurons selectively modulated anxiety, whereas POA-projecting neurons specifically regulated sleep-wake states. These findings suggest that hyperactive BNST stress ensembles are responsible for inducing anxiety-like behaviors and disrupting sleep in CRS mice and achieve the modality specificity through their divergent downstream targets.",

          "abstract": "Optical manipulation of spin-flip on a picosecond to femtosecond timescale has long been pursued to innovate next-generation electronic devices. However, understanding the ultrafast spin-electron-lattice coupled dynamics remains challenging, especially when the system is driven far from equilibrium. Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast light-induced spin-flip within 300 fs in Fe 3 GeTe 2 , a prototypical two-dimensional itinerant ferromagnet. Notably, by varying the laser fluence, we identify three distinct regimes that emerge assisted by a photoinduced single linear phonon mode, namely demagnetization, spin-flip, and spin-melting. We resolve the dominant role of displacively excited A 1g phonons, while nonequilibrium electron occupation is essential to break the degeneracy of the spin up and down states and lower the spin-flip energy barrier. Accompanying the spin-flip, we also observe a sign change of the Berry curvature, implying involvement of nontrivial band topology. Our results provide a general guidance for optical manipulation of spin orders, holding promises for advancing future spintronics and information technology.",

          "abstract": "The radiometric ages of the returned samples are the cornerstone of lunar cratering chronology models. However, all the previous samples were from the lunar nearside and the radiometric ages of those samples that can be associated with particular surfaces are &lt;4.0 billion years. On 25 June 2024, Chang’e-6 successfully returned 1.935-kilogram samples from the lunar farside. The samples included local basalts with an age of 2807 ± 3 million years and the norites with an age of 4247 ± 5 million years likely corresponding to the age of the South Pole–Aitken basin. With these radiometric ages, we refined the lunar chronology function (CF) and verified that it is still consistent with a combination of an exponential decrease and a linear rate. We further derived the impacting rate and found it supports a smooth decay instead of abrupt changes of the impactor flux at early times. The refined lunar CF can be used to obtain more reliable ages for unsampled lunar areas and provide critical constraint for the lunar early impact history.",
