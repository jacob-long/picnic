          "abstract": "The fabrication of scalable all-perovskite tandem solar cells is considered an attractive route to commercialize perovskite photovoltaic modules1. However, The certified efficiency of 1-cm2 scale all-perovskite tandem solar cells lags behind their small-area (~0.1 cm2) counterparts2,3. This performance deficit originates from inhomogeneity in wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at a large scale. The inhomogeneity is known to be introduced at the bottom interface and within the perovskite bulk itself4,5. Here we uncover another crucial source for the inhomogeneity – the top interface formed during the deposition of the electron transport layer (ETL, C60). Meanwhile, the poor ETL interface is also a significant limitation of device performance. We address this issue by introducing a mixture of 4-fluorophenethylamine (F-PEA) and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA) to create a tailored two-dimensional perovskite layer (TTDL), in which F-PEA forms a two-dimensional perovskite at the surface reducing contact losses and inhomogeneity, CF3-PA enhances charge extraction and transport. As a result, we demonstrate a high open-circuit voltage of 1.35 V and an efficiency of 20.5% in 1.77-eV WBG PSCs at a square centimeter scale. By stacking with a narrow-bandgap perovskite sub-cell, we report 1.05 cm2 all-perovskite tandem cells delivering 28.5% (certified 28.2%) efficiency, the highest among all reported so far. Our work showcases the importance of treating the top perovskite/ETL contact for upscaling perovskite solar cells.",

          "abstract": "Obtaining micron-thick perovskite films of high quality is key to realizing efficient and stable positive (p)-intrinsic (i)-negative (n) perovskite solar cells1,2, but it remains a critical challenge. Here, we report an effective method for producing high-quality, micron-thick formamidinium-based perovskite films by forming coherent grain boundaries, where high-Miller-index-oriented grains grow on the low-Miller-index-oriented grains in a stabilized atmosphere. The resulting micron-thick perovskite films, with enhanced grain boundaries and grains, showed stable material properties and outstanding optoelectronic performances. The small-area solar cells achieved efficiencies of 26.1%. The 1-square-centimeter devices and 5 cm × 5 cm minimodules delivered efficiencies of 24.3% and 21.4%, respectively. The devices processed in a stabilized atmosphere presented a high reproducibility across all four seasons. The encapsulated devices exhibited superior long-term stability under both light and thermal stressors in ambient air.",

          "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4b was detected in the United States in 2021. These HPAI viruses caused mortality events in poultry, wild birds, and wild mammals. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses.1 Over 200 positive herds were identified in 14 U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk.2,3 The diagnostic investigation revealed viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium. A single transmission event, likely from birds, was followed by limited local transmission and onward horizontal transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13.4 We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. Heifers were inoculated by aerosol respiratory route and cows by intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, pathogenesis, transmission, and intervention strategies.",

          "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have undergone a rapid development in the last decade. However, there is still a lack of systematic studies to investigate whether the empirical rules of working lifetime assessment used in silicon solar cells can be applied to pero-SCs. It is commonly believed that pero-SCs show enhanced stability under day/night cycling due to the reported self-healing effect in the dark.1,2 While we discovered that the degradation of highly efficient FAPbI3 pero-SCs is in fact much faster under natural day/night cycling mode, questioning the widely accepted approach to estimate the operational lifetime of pero-SCs based on continuous mode testing. We reveal the key factor to be the lattice strain caused by thermal expansion/shrinking of the perovskite during the operation, an effect that gradually relaxes under the continuous-illumination mode but cycles synchronously under the cycling mode.3,4 The periodic lattice strain under the cycling mode results in deep trap accumulation and chemical degradation during operation, decreasing the ion migration potential and hence the device lifetime.5 We introduce phenylselenenyl chloride (Ph-Se-Cl) to regulate the perovskite lattice strain during day/night cycling, which achieved the certified efficiency of 26.3% and a 10-time improved T80 lifetime under the cycling mode after the modification.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, perovskite has been widely adopted in series-connected monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs) to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction solar cells. Perovskite/organic TSCs, comprising a wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cell (pero-SC) as the front cell and a narrow-bandgap organic solar cell (OSC) as the rear cell, have recently drawn attention owing to the good stability and potential high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1,2,3,4. However, WBG pero-SCs usually exhibit higher voltage losses than regular pero-SCs, which limits the performance of TSCs5,6. One of the major obstacles comes from interfacial recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface, and it is important to develop effective surface passivation strategies to pursue higher PCE of perovskite/organic TSCs7. Here we exploit a new surface passivator cyclohexane 1,4-diammonium diiodide (CyDAI2), which naturally contains two isomeric structures with ammonium groups on the same or opposite sides of the hexane ring (denoted as cis-CyDAI2 and trans-CyDAI2, respectively), and the two isomers demonstrate completely different surface interaction behaviors. The cis-CyDAI2 passivation treatment reduces the Quasi–Fermi level splitting (QFLS)–open circuit voltage (Voc) mismatch of the WBG pero-SCs with a bandgap of 1.88 eV and enhanced its Voc to 1.36 V. Combining the cis-CyDAI2 treated perovskite and the organic active layer with a narrow-bandgap of 1.24 eV, the constructed monolithic perovskite/organic TSC demonstrates a PCE of 26.4% (certified as 25.7%).",

          "abstract": "As incarceration rates rise globally, the need to reduce re-offending grows increasingly urgent. We investigate whether positive group bonds can improve behaviours among incarcerated people via a unique soccer-based prison intervention, the Twinning Project. We analyse effects of participation compared to a control group (study 1, n = 676, n = 1,874 control cases) and longitudinal patterns of social cohesion underlying these effects (study 2, n = 388) in the United Kingdom. We also explore desistance from crime after release (study 3, n = 249) in the United Kingdom and the United States. As law-abiding behaviour also requires a supportive receiving community, we assessed factors influencing willingness to employ formerly incarcerated people in online samples in the United Kingdom and the United States (studies 4–9, n = 1,797). Results indicate that social bonding relates to both improved behaviour within prison and increased willingness of receiving communities to support re-integration efforts. Harnessing the power of group identities both within prison and receiving communities can help to address the global incarceration crisis.",

Despite enormous efforts devoted to understanding AI’s economic impacts, we lack a systematic understanding of the benefits to scientific research associated with the use of AI. Here we develop a measurement framework to estimate the direct use of AI and associated benefits in science. We find that the use and benefits of AI appear widespread throughout the sciences, growing especially rapidly since 2015. However, there is a substantial gap between AI education and its application in research, highlighting a misalignment between AI expertise supply and demand. Our analysis also reveals demographic disparities, with disciplines with higher proportions of women or Black scientists reaping fewer benefits from AI, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in science. These findings have implications for the equity and sustainability of the research enterprise, especially as the integration of AI with science continues to deepen.",

          "abstract": "Human infants are born with their eyes open and an otherwise limited motor repertoire; thus, studies measuring infant looking are commonly used to investigate the developmental origins of perception and cognition. However, scholars have long expressed concerns about the reliability and interpretation of looking behaviours. We evaluated these concerns using a pre-registered (https://osf.io/jghc3), systematic meta-analysis of 76 published and unpublished studies of infants’ early physical and psychological reasoning (total n = 1,899; 3- to 12-month-old infants; database search and call for unpublished studies conducted July to August 2022). We studied two effects in the same datasets: looking towards expected versus unexpected events (violation of expectation (VOE)) and looking towards visually familiar versus visually novel events (perceptual novelty (PN)). Most studies implemented methods to minimize the risk of bias (for example, ensuring that experimenters were naive to the conditions and reporting inter-rater reliability). There was mixed evidence about publication bias for the VOE effect. Most centrally to our research aims, we found that these two effects varied systematically—with roughly equal effect sizes (VOE, standardized mean difference 0.290 and 95% confidence interval (0.208, 0.372); PN, standardized mean difference 0.239 and 95% confidence interval (0.109, 0.369))—but independently, based on different predictors. Age predicted infants’ looking responses to unexpected events, but not visually novel events. Habituation predicted infants’ looking responses to visually novel events, but not unexpected events. From these findings, we suggest that conceptual and perceptual novelty independently influence infants’ looking behaviour.",

Here we show that children fact-check claims more and are better able to catch misinformation when they have been exposed to detectable inaccuracies. In two experiments (N = 122), 4–7-year-old children exposed to falsity (as opposed to all true information) sampled more evidence before verifying a test claim in a novel domain. Children’s evidentiary standards were graded: fact-checking increased with higher proportions of false statements heard during exposure. A simulation suggests that children’s behaviour is adaptive, because increased fact-checking in more dubious environments supports the discovery of potential misinformation. Importantly, children were least diligent at fact-checking a new claim when all prior information was true, suggesting that sanitizing children’s informational environments may inadvertently dampen their natural scepticism. Instead, these findings support the counterintuitive possibility that exposing children to some nonsense may scaffold vigilance towards more subtle misinformation in the future.",

Here we conducted an umbrella review encompassing 194 observational meta-analyses, 10 Mendelian randomization studies and 748 interventional meta-analyses to appraise the published evidence on the associations between maternal adiposity and perinatal and offspring outcomes. Evidence grading suggested that 17 (8.8%) observational meta-analyses were supported by convincing evidence for 12 outcomes: maternal adiposity was associated with an increased risk of caesarean delivery following labour induction, infant mortality, Apgar score <7 at 1 min, antenatal depression, offspring overweight and obesity, early timing of puberty onset in daughters, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, congenital heart disease and spina bifida (OR/RR ranging from 1.14 to 2.31), as well as increased offspring body fat percent and fat mass (SMD 0.31 and 0.35, respectively). Among these outcomes, interventional meta-analyses supported that maternal weight loss interventions significantly reduced the risk of antenatal depression but not low Apgar scores; these interventions also could not reduce offspring fat mass or body fat percent. Evidence from Mendelian randomization studies supported a causal relationship between maternal adiposity and gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, birth size and offspring adiposity. Our findings highlight that while observational meta-analyses reveal associations between maternal adiposity and various adverse perinatal and offspring outcomes, convincing, unbiased evidence or support from Mendelian randomization studies is limited. Maternal pre-conceptional and prenatal weight loss interventions can reduce some, but not all, of these adverse effects.",

          "abstract": "A sniff in humans typically lasts one to three seconds and is commonly considered to produce a long-exposure shot of the chemical environment that sets the temporal limit of olfactory perception. To break this limit, we devised a sniff-triggered apparatus that controls odorant deliveries within a sniff with a precision of 18 milliseconds. Using this apparatus, we show through rigorous psychophysical testing of 229 participants (649 sessions) that two odorants presented in one order and its reverse become perceptually discriminable when the stimulus onset asynchrony is merely 60 milliseconds (Cohen’s d = 0.48; 95% confidence interval, (55, 59); 120-millisecond difference). Discrimination performance improves with the length of stimulus onset asynchrony and is independent of explicit knowledge of the temporal order of odorants or the relative amount of odorant molecules accumulated in a sniff. Our findings demonstrate that human olfactory perception is sensitive to chemical dynamics within a single sniff and provide behavioural evidence for a temporal code of odour identity.",

          "abstract": "Based on current research, it is evident that the way people see themselves is shaped by their conversation partners. Historically, this literature focuses on how one individual’s expectations can shape another person’s self-views. Given the reciprocal nature of conversation, we wondered whether conversation partners’ self-views may mutually evolve. Using four-person round-robin conversation networks, we found that participants tended to have more similar self-views post-conversation than pre-conversation, an effect we term “inter-self alignment.” Further, the more two partners’ self-views aligned, the more they enjoyed their conversation and were inclined to interact again. This effect depended on both conversation partners becoming aligned. These findings suggest that the way we see ourselves is coauthored in the act of dialogue and that as shared self-views develop, the desire to continue the conversation increases.",

          "abstract": "Obesity is a major public health crisis in the United States (US) affecting 42% of the population, exacerbating a spectrum of other diseases and contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality overall. Recent advances in pharmaceutical interventions, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide) and dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., tirzepatide), have shown remarkable efficacy in weight-loss. However, limited access to these medications due to high costs and insurance coverage issues restricts their utility in mitigating the obesity epidemic. We quantify the annual mortality burden directly attributable to limited access to these medications in the US. By integrating hazard ratios of mortality across body mass index categories with current obesity prevalence data, combined with healthcare access, willingness to take the medication, and observed adherence to and efficacy of the medications, we estimate the impact of making these medications accessible to all those eligible. Specifically, we project that with expanded access, over 42,000 deaths could be averted annually, including more than 11,000 deaths among people with type 2 diabetes. These findings underscore the urgent need to address barriers to access and highlight the transformative public health impact that could be achieved by expanding access to these novel treatments.",

          "abstract": "We propose that experiencing a lack of personal control will increase people’s preferences for self-similar others and that this effect would be explained by a greater need for structure. Our hypotheses received support across 11 longitudinal, experimental, and archival studies composed of data from 60 countries (5 preregistered studies, N = 90,216). In an analysis of cross-country archival data, we found that respondents who indicated a lower sense of personal control were less likely to prefer to live with neighbors who had a different religion, race, or spoke a different language (Study 1). Study 2 found that participants who perceived lower (vs. higher) personal control indicated greater liking for coworkers who they perceived to be more self-similar across a wide range of characteristics (e.g., gender, personality). Studies 3a and 3b, two live-interaction experiments conducted in the United States and China, provided additional causal evidence for control-motivated similarity attraction. A causal experimental chain (Studies 4a to 4c) and a manipulation-of-mediation-as-a-moderator study (Study 5) provided evidence for the mediating effects of the need for structure. Study 6, a longitudinal study with Chinese employees, found that workers who reported perceiving a lower (vs. higher) sense of personal control preferred more self-similar coworkers, and this effect was mediated by a greater desire for structure. Finally, exploring downstream consequences, Studies 7a and 7b found that control-motivated similarity attraction was associated with a greater preference for homogenous (vs. diverse) groups. These findings highlight how the fundamental motive for personal control shapes the structure of social life.",

          "abstract": "Maximizing the welfare of society requires distributing goods between groups of people with different preferences. Such decisions are difficult because different moral principles impose irreconcilable solutions. For example, utilitarian efficiency (maximize overall outcome across individuals) may need trade-off against Rawlsian fairness norms (maximize the outcome for the worst-off individual). We identify a brain mechanism enabling decision-makers to solve such trade-offs between efficiency and fairness using separate neuroimaging and sham-controlled brain stimulation experiments. As activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) increases, people are more likely to implement the Rawlsian fairness criterion rather than efficiency or inequality concerns. Strikingly, reducing TPJ excitability with brain stimulation reduces the concern for fairness in fairness-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, the reduced fairness concerns statistically relate to stimulation-induced reductions in perspective-taking skills as measured in a separate task. Together, our findings not only reveal the neural underpinning of efficiency-fairness trade-offs but also recast the role of TPJ in social decision-making by showing that its perspective-taking function serves to promote fairness for the worst-off rather than efficiency or equality.",

However, current preservation methodologies (e.g., cryopreservation, chemical reagent fixation, and bioplasticization) exhibit limitations in simultaneously achieving these critical combined goals. To address this gap, inspired by natural fossilization, here we propose “deep silicification,” a room temperature technology that eliminates fixation requirements and overcomes the cold chain problem. By harnessing the synergy between ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide, deep silicification significantly enhances silica penetration and accumulation within bioorganisms, thereby reinforcing structural integrity. This versatile and cost-effective approach demonstrates remarkable efficacy in preserving organismal morphology across various scales. Accelerated aging experiments underscore a 4,723-fold enhancement in genomic information storage over millennia, with whole-genome sequencing confirming nearly 100% fidelity. With its simplicity and reliability, “deep silicification” represents a paradigm shift in biological sample storage.",

          "abstract": "Elevated lipid synthesis is one of the best-characterized metabolic alterations in cancer and crucial for membrane expansion. As a key rate-limiting enzyme in de novo fatty acid synthesis, ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is frequently up-regulated in tumors and regulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Despite emerging evidence showing O -GlcNAcylation on ACLY, its biological function still remains unknown. Here, we observed a significant upregulation of ACLY O -GlcNAcylation in various types of human tumor cells and tissues and identified S979 as a major O -GlcNAcylation site. Importantly, S979 O -GlcNAcylation is required for substrate CoA binding and crucial for ACLY enzymatic activity. Moreover, it is sensitive to glucose fluctuation and decisive for fatty acid synthesis as well as tumor cell proliferation. In response to EGF stimulation, both S979 O -GlcNAcylation and previously characterized S455 phosphorylation played indispensable role in the regulation of ACLY activity and cell proliferation; however, they functioned independently from each other. In vivo, streptozocin treatment- and EGFR overexpression-induced growth of xenograft tumors was mitigated once S979 was mutated. Collectively, this work helps comprehend how cells interrogate the nutrient enrichment for proliferation and suggests that although mammalian cell proliferation is controlled by mitogen signaling, the ancient nutrition-sensing mechanism is conserved and still efficacious in the cells of multicellular organisms.",

          "abstract": "Many human pathogens, including malaria, dengue, influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and cytomegalovirus, coexist as multiple genetically distinct strains. Understanding how these multistrain pathogens evolve is of critical importance for forecasting epidemics and predicting the consequences of vaccination. One factor believed to play an important role is naturally acquired immunity. Consequently, a large body of research has sought to predict how acquired immunity molds the genomics of pathogen populations (i.e., what shapes pathogen strain structure). The diversity of existing models has resulted in conflicting evolutionary predictions and has sparked an ongoing debate about which predictions are most broadly applicable. Here, we adopt a multilocus population genetics perspective that unifies the predictions of existing models. We identify three key factors that determine the role of naturally acquired immunity in the evolution of pathogen strain structure: i) the strength and specificity of immune protections, ii) the dynamic immunological landscape, and iii) the number of loci coding for the antigens of the pathogen. Isolating and discussing these three factors clarifies the relationship among previous models of multistrain dynamics, and establishes a solid theoretical foundation for the study of the evolutionary epidemiology of multistrain pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Lepidopterans commonly feed on plant material, being the most significant insect herbivores in nature. Despite plant resistance to herbivory, such as producing toxic secondary metabolites, herbivores have developed mechanisms encoded in their genomes to tolerate or detoxify plant defensive compounds. Recent studies also highlight the role of gut microbiota in mediating detoxification in herbivores; however, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of gut symbionts is rare in Lepidoptera. Here, we show that the growth of various lepidopteran species was inhibited by a mulberry-derived secondary metabolite, 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ); as expected, the specialist silkworm Bombyx mori grew well, but interestingly, gut microbiota of early-instar silkworms was affected by the DNJ level, and several bacterial species responded positively to enriched DNJ. Among these, a bacterial strain isolated from the silkworm gut ( Pseudomonas fulva ZJU1) can degrade and utilize DNJ as the sole energy source, and after inoculation into nonspecialists (e.g., beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua ), P. fulva ZJU1 increased host resistance to DNJ and significantly promoted growth. We used genomic and transcriptomic analyses to identify genes potentially involved in DNJ degradation, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis verified the function of ilvB , a key binding protein, in metabolizing DNJ. Furthermore, the ilvB deletion mutant, exhibiting normal bacterial growth, could no longer enhance nonspecialist performance, supporting a role in DNJ degradation in vivo. Therefore, our study demonstrated causality between the gut microbiome and detoxification of plant chemical defense in Lepidoptera, facilitating a mechanistic understanding of host–microbe relationships across this complex, abundant insect group.",

Here, we used a deterministic compartmental model to infer the effectiveness of the third-dose MMR vaccine in preventing mumps cases by analyzing the mumps outbreak that occurred at the University of Iowa between August 24, 2015, and May 13, 2016. The modeling approach further allowed us to evaluate the population-level impact of vaccination by different timing in relation to the start of the outbreak and varied coverage levels, and to account for potential sources of bias in estimating vaccine effectiveness. We found large uncertainty in vaccine effectiveness estimates; however, our models showed that early introduction of a third dose of MMR vaccine during a mumps outbreak can be effective in preventing transmission.

          "abstract": "Shear bands frequently appear in lattice architectures subjected to compression, leading to an unstable stress–strain curve and global deformation. This deformation mechanism reduces their energy absorption and loading-bearing capacity and causes the architectures to prioritize mechanical protection of external components at the expense of the entire structure. Here, we leverage the design freedom offered by additive manufacturing and the geometrical relation of dual-phase nanolamellar crystals to fabricate heterogeneous lamellar lattice architectures consisting of body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cells in alternating lamella. The lamellar lattice demonstrates more than 10 and 9 times higher specific energy absorption and energy absorption efficiency, respectively, compared to the BCC lattice. The drastic improvement arises as the nucleation of shear bands is inhibited by the discrete energy threshold for plastic buckling of adjacent heterogeneous lattice lamella during loading. Despite its lower density than the FCC lattice, the lamellar lattice exhibits significant enhancement in plateau stress and crushing force efficiency, attributed to the strengthening effect induced by simultaneous deformation of unit cells in the BCC lattice lamella and the resulting cushion shielding effect. The design improves the global mechanical properties, making lamellar lattices compare favorably against numerous materials proposed for mechanical protection. Additionally, it provides opportunities to program the local mechanical response, achieving programmable internal protection alongside overall external protection. This work provides a different route to design lattice architecture by combining internal and external dual mechanical protection, enabling a generation of multiple mechanical protectors in aerospace, automotive, and transportation fields.",

We determine potential Fe-based pathways for abiotic organic synthesis from CO 2 and H 2 using multimodal and molecular nano-geochemical tools. Quantum mechanical modeling is further employed to constrain the catalytical activity of Fe oxyhydroxides, revealing that the catalytic cycle of hydrogen may play a key role in carbon–carbon bond formation. This approach offers the possibility of interpreting physicochemical organic formation and condensation mechanisms at an atomic scale.

Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapeutics for any alphavirus infection. CHIKV nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2), which contains a cysteine protease domain, is essential for viral replication, making it an attractive target for a drug discovery campaign. Here, we optimized a CHIKV nsP2 protease (nsP2pro) biochemical assay for the screening of a 6,120-compound cysteine-directed covalent fragment library. Using a 50% inhibition threshold, we identified 153 hits (2.5% hit rate). In dose–response follow-up, RA-0002034, a covalent fragment that contains a vinyl sulfone warhead, inhibited CHIKV nsP2pro with an IC 50 of 58 ± 17 nM, and further analysis with time-dependent inhibition studies yielded a k inact /K I of 6.4 × 10 3 M −1 s −1 . LC-MS/MS analysis determined that RA-0002034 covalently modified the catalytic cysteine in a site-specific manner. Additionally, RA-0002034 showed no significant off-target reactivity in proteomic experiments or against a panel of cysteine proteases. In addition to the potent biochemical inhibition of CHIKV nsP2pro activity and exceptional selectivity, RA-0002034 was tested in cellular models of alphavirus infection and effectively inhibited viral replication of both CHIKV and related alphaviruses. This study highlights the identification and characterization of the chemical probe RA-0002034 as a promising hit compound from covalent fragment-based screening for development toward a CHIKV or pan-alphavirus therapeutic.",

In addition, reallocating carbon to branch turnover in model simulations reduced stem wood biomass, a long-lasting carbon storage, by 7 to 17%. This prevailing neglect of branch turnover suggests widespread biases in carbon flux estimates across global datasets and model simulations. Branch litterfall, sometimes used as a proxy for branch turnover, ignores carbon lost from attached dead branches, underestimating branch C turnover by 38% in a pine forest. Modifications to field measurement protocols and existing models are needed to allow a more realistic partitioning of wood production and forest carbon storage.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial function relies on the coordinated expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, exhibiting remarkable resilience despite high mitochondrial mutation rates. The nuclear compensation mechanism suggests deleterious mitochondrial alleles drive compensatory nuclear mutations to preserve mito-nuclear compatibility. However, prevalence and factors conditioning this phenomenon remain debated due to its conflicting evidence. Here, we investigate how mito-nuclear incompatibilities impact substitutions in a model for species radiation. Mating success depends on genetic compatibility (nuclear DNA) and spatial proximity. Populations evolve from partially compatible mito-nuclear states, simulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression. Mutations do not confer advantages nor disadvantages, but individual fecundity declines with increasing incompatibilities, selecting for mito-nuclear coordination. We find that selection for mito-nuclear compatibility affects each genome differently based on their initial state. In compatible gene pairs, selection reduces substitutions in both genomes, while in incompatible nuclear genes, it consistently promotes compensation, facilitated by more mismatches. Interestingly, high mitochondrial mutation rates can reduce nuclear compensation by increasing mtDNA rectification, while substitutions in initially compatible nuclear gene are boosted. Finally, the presence of incompatibilities accelerates species radiation, but equilibrium richness is not directly correlated to substitution rates, revealing the complex dynamics triggered by mitochondrial introgression and mito-nuclear coevolution. Our study provides a perspective on nuclear compensation and the role of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in speciation by exploring extreme scenarios and identifying trends that empirical data alone cannot reveal. We emphasize the challenges in detecting these dynamics and propose analyzing specific genomic signatures could shed light on this evolutionary process.",

Herein, we report the creation of seven topological isoforms (i.e., linear, cyclic, knot, lasso, pseudorotaxane, and catenane) from a single protein fold precursor by rewiring the connectivity of secondary structure elements of the SpyTag-SpyCatcher complex and mutating the reactive residue on SpyTag to abolish the isopeptide bonding. These topological isoforms can be directly expressed in cells. Their topologies were confirmed by combined techniques of proteolytic digestion, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and topological transformation. To study the effects of topology on their structures and properties, their biophysical properties were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HSQC-NMR), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were further performed to reveal the atomic details of structural changes upon unfolding. Both experimental and simulation results suggest that they share a similar, well-folded hydrophobic core but exhibit distinct folding/unfolding dynamic behaviors. These results shed light onto the folding landscape of topological isoforms derived from the same protein fold. As a model system, this work improves our understanding of protein structure and dynamics beyond linear chains and suggests that protein folds are highly amenable to topological variation.",

Traditional soft adhesives are designed by maintaining a balance between their cohesive strength and compliance. However, rough surfaces can significantly affect the adhesion strength of PSAs. Lowering the stiffness of the adhesive by reducing the cross-linking density or using additives can improve contact on rough surfaces. But this also decreases the cohesive strength and affects the overall performance of the adhesive. Additive-free LCE-based adhesives are shown to overcome these challenges due to their unique properties. Soft elasticity of LCE and low cross-link density contribute to their high compliance, while moderate cross-linking provides finite strength. The effect of contact time and substrate roughness on the adhesive performance is evaluated using probe-tack, indentation, lap shear, and static loading experiments. The unique combination of properties offered by LCE can lead to the development of roughness-tolerant adhesives, thereby broadening the application scope of PSAs.",

To identify correctors of severe protein misfolding and trafficking obstruction manifested by the pathogenic L444P-variant of GCase, we developed a suite of quantitative, high-throughput, cell-based assays. First, we labeled GCase with a small proluminescent HiBiT peptide reporter tag, enabling quantitation of protein stabilization in cells while faithfully maintaining target biology. TALEN-based gene editing allowed for stable integration of a single HiBiT- GBA1 transgene into an intragenic safe-harbor locus in GBA1 -knockout H4 (neuroglioma) cells. This GD cell model was amenable to lead discovery via titration-based quantitative high-throughput screening and lead optimization via structure–activity relationships. A primary screen of 10,779 compounds from the NCATS bioactive collections identified 140 stabilizers of HiBiT-GCase-L444P, including both pharmacological chaperones (ambroxol and noninhibitory chaperone NCGC326) and proteostasis regulators (panobinostat, trans-ISRIB, and pladienolide B). Two complementary high-content imaging-based assays were deployed to triage hits: The fluorescence-quenched substrate LysoFix-GBA captured functional lysosomal GCase activity, while an immunofluorescence assay featuring antibody hGCase-1/23 directly visualized GCase lysosomal translocation. NCGC326 was active in both secondary assays and completely reversed pathological glucosylsphingosine accumulation. Finally, we tested the concept of combination therapy by demonstrating synergistic actions of NCGC326 with proteostasis regulators in enhancing GCase-L444P levels. Looking forward, these physiologically relevant assays can facilitate the identification, pharmacological validation, and medicinal chemistry optimization of small molecules targeting GCase, ultimately leading to a viable therapeutic for GD and PD.",

          "abstract": "Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutation is associated with malignant tumor transformation and drug resistance. However, the development of clinically effective targeted therapies for KRAS-mutant cancer has proven to be a formidable challenge. Here, we report that tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) functions as a target of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), contributing to regorafenib therapy resistance. Mechanistically, TRIM21 directly interacts with and ubiquitinates v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc) at lysine 148 (K148) via K63-linkage, enabling c-Myc to be targeted to the autophagy machinery for degradation, ultimately resulting in the downregulation of enolase 2 expression and inhibition of glycolysis. However, mutant KRAS (KRAS/MT)-driven mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling leads to the phosphorylation of TRIM21 (p-TRIM21) at Threonine 396 (T396) by ERK2, disrupting the interaction between TRIM21 and c-Myc and thereby preventing c-Myc from targeting autophagy for degradation. This enhances glycolysis and contributes to regorafenib resistance. Clinically, high p-TRIM21 (T396) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Targeting TRIM21 to disrupt KRAS/MT-driven phosphorylation using the antidepressant vilazodone shows potential for enhancing the efficacy of regorafenib in treating KRAS-mutant CRC in preclinical models. These findings are instrumental for KRAS-mutant CRC treatment aiming at activating TRIM21-mediated selective autophagic degradation of c-Myc.",

          "abstract": "The cotranslational misfolding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel (CFTR) plays a central role in the molecular basis of CF. The misfolding of the most common CF variant (ΔF508) remodels both the translational regulation and quality control of CFTR. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the misassembly of the nascent polypeptide may directly influence the activity of the translation machinery. In this work, we identify a structural motif within the CFTR transcript that stimulates efficient −1 ribosomal frameshifting and triggers the premature termination of translation. Though this motif does not appear to impact the interactome of wild-type CFTR, silent mutations that disrupt this RNA structure alter the association of nascent ΔF508 CFTR with numerous translation and quality control proteins. Moreover, disrupting this RNA structure enhances the functional gating of the ΔF508 CFTR channel at the plasma membrane and its pharmacological rescue by the CFTR modulators contained in the CF drug Trikafta. The effects of the RNA structure on ΔF508 CFTR appear to be attenuated in the absence of the ER membrane protein complex, which was previously found to modulate ribosome collisions during “preemptive quality control” of a misfolded CFTR homolog. Together, our results reveal that ribosomal frameshifting selectively modulates the assembly, function, and pharmacological rescue of a misfolded CFTR variant. These findings suggest that interactions between the nascent chain, quality control machinery, and ribosome may dynamically modulate ribosomal frameshifting in order to tune the processivity of translation in response to cotranslational misfolding.",

While individual structural elements and the morphogens that stabilize them have been described, a quantitative understanding of the dynamic large-scale network topology remains elusive. We develop a physical model of the ER as an active liquid network, governed by a balance of tension-driven shrinking and new tubule growth. This minimalist model gives rise to steady-state network structures with density and rearrangement timescales predicted from the junction mobility and tubule spawning rate. Several parameter-independent geometric features of the liquid network model are shown to be representative of ER architecture in live mammalian cells. The liquid network model connects the timescales of distinct dynamic features such as ring closure and new tubule growth in the ER. Furthermore, it demonstrates how the steady-state network morphology on a cellular scale arises from the balance of microscopic dynamic rearrangements.",

          "abstract": "Hibernation is a widespread and highly efficient mechanism to save energy in mammals. However, one major challenge of hibernation is maintaining blood circulation at low body temperatures, which strongly depends on the viscoelastic properties of red blood cells (RBCs). Here, we examined at physiologically relevant timescales the thermomechanical properties of hundreds of thousands of individual RBCs from the hibernating common noctule bat ( Nyctalus noctula ), the nonhibernating Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ), and humans ( Homo sapiens ). We exposed RBCs to temperatures encountered during normothermia and hibernation and found a significant increase in elasticity and viscosity with decreasing temperatures. Our data demonstrate that temperature adjustment of RBCs is mainly driven by membrane properties and not the cytosol while viscous dissipation in the membrane of both bat species exceeds the one in humans by a factor of 15. Finally, our results show that RBCs from both bat species reveal a transition to a more viscous-like state when temperature decreases. This process on a minute timescale has an effect size that is comparable with fluctuations in RBC viscoelasticity over the course of the year, implying that environmental factors, such as diets, have a lower impact on the capability of RBCs to respond to different temperatures than general physical properties of the cell membrane. In summary, our findings suggest membrane viscoelasticity as a promising target for identifying mechanisms that could be manipulated to ensure blood circulation at low body temperatures in humans, which may be one first step toward safe synthetic torpor in medicine and space flight.",

          "abstract": "Free radical generation plays a key role in many biological processes including cell communication, maturation, and aging. In addition, free radical generation is usually elevated in cells under stress as is the case for many different pathological conditions. In liver tissue, cells produce radicals when exposed to toxic substances but also, for instance, in cancer, alcoholic liver disease and liver cirrhosis. However, free radicals are small, short-lived, and occur in low abundance making them challenging to detect and especially to time resolve, leading to a lack of nanoscale information. Recently, our group has demonstrated that diamond-based quantum sensing offers a solution to measure free radical generation in single living cells. The method is based on defects in diamonds, the so-called nitrogen-vacancy centers, which change their optical properties based on their magnetic surrounding. As a result, this technique reveals magnetic resonance signals by optical means offering high sensitivity. However, compared to cells, there are several challenges that we resolved here: Tissues are more fragile, have a higher background fluorescence, have less particle uptake, and do not adhere to microscopy slides. Here, we overcame those challenges and adapted the method to perform measurements in living tissues. More specifically, we used precision-cut liver slices and were able to detect free radical generation during a stress response to ethanol, as well as the reduction in the radical load after adding an antioxidant.",

We build on the defined chromosomes time-dependent structures in an effort to probe their dynamics. Variants of the coiled chromosome structures, possibly further defining specific regions, are discussed. We propose, based on generalized specific uncoiling of mitotic chromosomes in telophase, large-scale reorganization of interphase chromosomes. Chromosome territories, organized as micron-sized small patches, are constructed, satisfying complex volume considerations. Finally, we unveiled the structures of replicated coiled chromosomes, still attached to centromeres, as part of chromosome architecture.",

Similar evidence for effects on traits linked to fitness in nature is rare, not least because experimentally manipulating the gut microbiota is challenging. We isolated, characterized, and cultured a bacterial strain, Lactobacillus kimchicus APC4233, directly from a wild bird (the great tit Parus major ) and provided it as a self-administered dietary supplement. We assessed the impact of the treatment on the host microbiota community, on weight, and tested whether the treatment affected a previous result linking microbiota alpha diversity to weight in nestlings. The treatment dramatically increased L. kimchicus abundance in the gut microbiota and increased alpha diversity. This effect was strongest in the youngest birds, validating earlier findings pointing to a brief developmental window when the gut microbiota are most sensitive. In time-lagged models, nestling weight was higher in the treatment birds suggesting L. kimchicus may have probiotic potential. There was also a positive time-lagged relationship between diversity and weight in control birds but not in the treatment birds, suggesting L. kimchicus helped birds compensate for low alpha diversity. We discuss why ecological context is likely key when predicting impacts of the microbiome. The manipulation of the gut microbiota with a host native strain in this wild population provides direct evidence for the role of the microbiota in the ecology and evolution of natural populations.",

          "abstract": "Obesity is one of the primary risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA), acting through cross talk among altered biomechanics, metabolism, adipokines, and dietary free fatty acid (FA) composition. Obesity and aging have been linked to cellular senescence in various tissues, resulting in increased local and systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction. We hypothesized that obesity and joint injury lead to cellular senescence that is typically associated with increased OA severity or with aging and that the ratio of omega-6 (ω-6) to omega-3 (ω-3) FAs regulates these pathologic effects. Mice were placed on an ω-6-rich high-fat diet or a lean control diet and underwent destabilization of the medial meniscus to induce OA. Obesity and joint injury significantly increased cellular senescence in subcutaneous and visceral fat as well as joint tissues such as synovium and cartilage. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for fat-1 , a fatty acid desaturase that converts ω-6 to ω-3 FAs, decreasing the serum ω-6:ω-3 FA ratio had a strong senomorphic and therapeutic effect, mitigating metabolic dysfunction, cellular senescence, and joint degeneration. In vitro coculture of bone marrow-derived macrophages and chondrocytes from control and AAV8- fat1- treated mice were used to examine the roles of various FA mediators in regulating chondrocyte senescence. Our results suggest that obesity and joint injury result in a premature “aging” of the joint as measured by senescence markers, and these changes can be ameliorated by altering FA composition using fat-1 gene therapy. These findings support the potential for fat-1 gene therapy to treat obesity- and/or injury-induced OA clinically.",

          "abstract": "The conservation status of monarch butterflies in North America is a topic of intense scrutiny and debate. It is clear that winter colonies in Mexico are declining, yet some recent studies suggest that summer breeding populations are relatively stable and similar to historical abundances. One possible explanation for these discordant patterns is that fall migration success has been recently disrupted. Here, we use a relatively unexplored citizen-scientist dataset on the size of monarch “roosts,” which are resting aggregations on vegetation, to infer changes in monarch abundance along the fall migration route over the last 17 y. We found that the timing of migration remained relatively unchanged while the flyway has generally become warmer and greener. Warmer and greener conditions were associated with larger roosts, yet we found steady, dramatic declines in roost sizes through time that were independent of climate and landscape factors. Roost sizes have declined as much as 80%, with losses increasing from north to south along the migration route. These findings suggest that failure during the fall migration could explain the apparent drop in monarch numbers from summer breeding to overwintering populations. This in turn suggests that conservation efforts that support fall migration success are most needed, such as providing high quality nectar plants along the migration route or limiting the planting of nonnative milkweeds that enhance monarch parasite loads. Overall, it appears the fall migration of monarch butterflies is under imminent threat, even if the species’ overall survival is not.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic changes in intracellular ultrastructure can be critical for the ability of organisms to acclimate to environmental conditions. Microalgae, which are responsible for ~50% of global photosynthesis, compartmentalize their Ribulose 1,5 Bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (Rubisco) into a specialized structure known as the pyrenoid when the cells experience limiting CO 2 conditions; this compartmentalization is a component of the CO 2 Concentrating Mechanism (CCM), which facilitates photosynthetic CO 2 fixation as environmental levels of inorganic carbon (Ci) decline. Changes in the spatial distribution of mitochondria in green algae have also been observed under CO 2 limitation, although a role for this reorganization in CCM function remains unclear. We used the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to monitor changes in mitochondrial position and ultrastructure as cells transition between high CO 2 and Low/Very Low CO 2 (LC/VLC). Upon transferring cells to VLC, the mitochondria move from a central to a peripheral cell location and orient in parallel tubular arrays that extend along the cell’s apico-basal axis. We show that these ultrastructural changes correlate with CCM induction and are regulated by the CCM master regulator CIA5. The apico-basal orientation of the mitochondrial membranes, but not the movement of the mitochondrion to the cell periphery, is dependent on microtubules and the MIRO1 protein, with the latter involved in membrane–microtubule interactions. Furthermore, blocking mitochondrial respiration in VLC-acclimated cells reduces the affinity of the cells for Ci. Overall, our results suggest that mitochondrial repositioning functions in integrating cellular architecture and energetics with CCM activities and invite further exploration of how intracellular architecture can impact fitness under dynamic environmental conditions.",

A generally accepted framework for the slip-rate and state dependence of friction involves a thermally activated process, whereby the probability of slip along microasperities adheres to an Arrhenius law. This model, which has become widely adopted among experimentalists and theoreticians, predicts a continuous increase of the direct effect with absolute temperature, but is it observed experimentally? Leveraging comprehensive laboratory data across diverse hydrothermal, barometric, and lithological conditions, we demonstrate that, contrary to the classical view, the direct effect for a given deformation mechanism remains largely temperature-independent. Instead, the incremental shifts in the direct effect often coincide with the brittle to semi-brittle transition, across which distinct deformation mechanisms operate. These considerations challenge the validity of the classical model. Realistic constitutive laws for rock failure within the lithosphere must incorporate the contributions of multiple deformation mechanisms within active fault zones.",

          "abstract": "The global steady state of a system in thermal equilibrium exponentially favors configurations with lesser energy. This principle is a powerful explanation of self-organization because energy is a local property of configurations. For nonequilibrium systems, there is no such property for which an analogous principle holds, hence no common explanation of the diverse forms of self-organization they exhibit. However, a flurry of recent empirical results has shown that a local property of configurations called “rattling” predicts the steady states of some nonequilibrium systems, leading to claims of a far-reaching principle of nonequilibrium self-organization. But for which nonequilibrium systems is rattling accurate, and why? We develop a theory of rattling in terms of Markov processes that gives simple and precise answers to these key questions. Our results show that rattling predicts a broader class of nonequilibrium steady states than has been claimed and for different reasons than have been suggested. Its predictions hold to an extent determined by the relative variance of, and correlation between, the local and global “parts” of a steady state. We show how these quantities characterize the local-global relationships of various random walks on random graphs, spin-glass dynamics, and models of animal collective behavior. Surprisingly, we find that the core idea of rattling is so general as to apply to equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems alike.",

          "abstract": "The poor prognosis of relatively undifferentiated cancers has long been recognized, suggesting that selection against differentiation and in favor of uncontrolled growth is one of the most powerful drivers of cancer progression. Goblet cells provide the mucous surface of the gut, and when present in colorectal cancers (CRC), the cancers are called mucinous. We have used the presence of MUC2, the main mucous product of goblet cells, and an associated gene product, TFF3, to classify a large panel of nearly 80 CRC-derived cell lines into five categories based on their levels of MUC2 and TFF3 expression. We have then shown that these five patterns of expression can be easily identified in the direct analysis of tumor specimens allowing a much finer characterization of CRCs with respect to the presence of goblet cell differentiation. In particular, about 30% of all CRCs fall into the category of expressing TFF3 but not MUC2, which has not previously been acknowledged. Using the cell line data, we suggest that there are up to 12 genes ( MUC2, TFF3, ATOH1, SPDEF, CDX1, CDX2, GATA6, HES1, ETS2, OLFM4, TOX3, and LGR5 ) that may be involved in selection against goblet cell differentiation in CRC by changes in methylation rather than mutations. Of these, LGR5 , which is particularly associated with lack of goblet cell features, may function in the control of differentiation rather than direct control of cell growth, as has so far mostly been assumed. These results emphasize the importance of methylation changes in driving cancer progression.",

MurG redeploys to the forespore surface during sporulation, where we show that the local pH is reduced and propose that this change in cytosolic nanoenvironment abrogates MurG function. Further, we show that SpoVK participates in a developmental checkpoint in which improper spore surface assembly mis-localizes SpoVK, which leads to sporulation arrest. The AAA+ ATPase clade containing SpoVK includes specialized chaperones involved in secretion, cell envelope biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that such fine-tuning might be a widespread feature of different subcellular nanoenvironments.",

          "abstract": "Aging is the biggest risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD), suggesting that age-related changes in the brain promote dopamine neuron vulnerability. It is unclear, however, whether aging alone is sufficient to cause significant dopamine neuron loss, and if so, how this intersects with PD-related neurodegeneration. Here, through examining a large collection of naturally varying Drosophila strains, we find a strong relationship between life span and age-related dopamine neuron loss. Strains with naturally short-lived animals exhibit a loss of dopamine neurons without generalized neurodegeneration, while animals from long-lived strains retain dopamine neurons across age. Metabolomic profiling reveals lower glutathione levels in short-lived strains which is associated with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), sensitivity to oxidative stress, and vulnerability to silencing the familial PD gene parkin . Strikingly, boosting neuronal glutathione levels via glutamate-cysteine ligase (Gcl) overexpression is sufficient to normalize ROS levels, extend life span, and block dopamine neurons loss in short-lived backgrounds, demonstrating that glutathione deficiencies are central to neurodegenerative phenotypes associated with short longevity. These findings may be relevant to human PD pathogenesis, where glutathione depletion is reported to occur in the idiopathic PD patient brain through unknown mechanisms. Building on this, we find reduced expression of the Gcl catalytic subunit in both Drosophila strains vulnerable to age-related dopamine neuron loss and in the human brain from familial PD patients harboring the common LRRK2 G2019S mutation. Our study across Drosophila and human PD systems suggests that glutathione synthesis and levels play a conserved role in regulating age-related dopamine neuron health.",

          "abstract": "Droplets of one fluid in a second, immiscible fluid are typically spherical in shape due to the interfacial tension between the two fluids. Shear forces can lead to droplet deformation when they are subjected to flow, and these effects can be further modified when the droplet is stabilized by a surfactant due to a flow-induced gradients in the surfactant concentration. An alternative method of stabilizing droplets is through the use of colloidal particles, whose stabilization behavior is intrinsically different from molecular surfactants. Under the same flow condition, a gradient of particle concentration can result in the jamming of particles in regions with a high packing density, making the interface solid-like, albeit only under compression and not tension. However, how this asymmetry in the surfactant properties alters the droplet shape under shear is unknown. Here, we show that shear of particle-stabilized droplets can lead to a remarkable array of shape deformations as the droplets flow through a constrained microchannel. The shear-induced migration of particles on the surface results in the formation of an elastic shell at the back of the droplet, which can wrinkle and invaginate, ultimately leading to a unique core–shell structure. The shapes depend on the Peclet number of the flow, reflecting the balance of shear forces that drive the particles and diffusion that randomizes them. These findings highlight the consequences of the asymmetry in the forces between the particles and provide a unique method to controllably create droplets with a vast array of different shapes.",

          "abstract": "Catalytic oxidation through the transfer of lattice oxygen from metal oxides to reactants, namely the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, has been widely reported. In this study, we evidence the overlooked oxidation route that features the in situ formation of surface OH species on Cu catalysts and its selective addition to the reactant carbonyl group. We observed that glucose oxidation to gluconic acid in air (21% O 2 ) was favored on low-valence Cu sites according to X-ray spectroscopic analyses. Molecular O 2 was activated in situ on Cu 0 /Cu + forming localized, adsorbed hydroxyl radicals (*OH) which played the primary reactive oxygen species as confirmed by the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study in D 2 O and in situ Raman experiments. Combined with DFT calculations, we proposed a mechanism of O 2 -to-*OH activation through the *OOH intermediate. The localized *OH exhibited higher selectivity toward glucose oxidation at C1HO to form gluconic acid (up to 91% selectivity), in comparison with free radicals in bulk environment that emerged from thermal, noncatalytic hydrogen peroxide decomposition (40% selectivity). The KIE measurements revealed a lower glucose oxidation rate in D 2 O than in H 2 O, highlighting the role of water (H 2 O/D 2 O) or its derivatives (e.g., *OH/*OD) in the rate-determining step. After proving the C1-H activation step kinetically irrelevant, we proposed the oxidation mechanism that was characterized by the rate-limiting addition of *OH to C1=O in glucose. Our findings advocate that by maneuvering the coverage and activity of surface *OH, high-performance oxidation of carbonyl compounds beyond biomass molecules can be achieved in water and air using nonprecious metal catalysts.",

Ascr18/BR-StNILR1 signaling requires the coreceptor potato BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (StBAK1) and perception of either ligand strengthens StNILR1 interaction with StBAK1 in plant cells. Significantly, the parasitically successful potato cyst nematode ( Globodera pallida ) utilizes the effector RHA1B, which is a functional ubiquitin ligase, to target StNILR1 for ubiquitination-mediated proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby countering Ascr18/BR-StNILR1-mediated PTI in potato and facilitating nematode parasitism. These findings broaden our understanding of PRR specificity and reveal a nematode parasitic mechanism that targets a PTI signaling pathway.",

          "abstract": "In the past decade, topological data analysis has emerged as a powerful algebraic topology approach in data science. Although knot theory and related subjects are a focus of study in mathematics, their success in practical applications is quite limited due to the lack of localization and quantization. We address these challenges by introducing knot data analysis (KDA), a paradigm that incorporates curve segmentation and multiscale analysis into the Gauss link integral. The resulting multiscale Gauss link integral (mGLI) recovers the global topological properties of knots and links at an appropriate scale and offers a multiscale geometric topology approach to capture the local structures and connectivities in data. By integration with machine learning or deep learning, the proposed mGLI significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark problems in 13 intricately complex biological datasets, including protein flexibility analysis, protein–ligand interactions, human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene potassium channel blockade screening, and quantitative toxicity assessment.

          "authors": "Giulia Paiardi, Matheus Ferraz, Marco Rusnati, Rebecca C. Wade",
          "abstract": "Although it is well established that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds to the host cell ACE2 receptor to initiate infection, far less is known about the tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility to the virus. Differential expression across different cell types of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, with variably sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and their synergistic interactions with host and viral N-glycans may contribute to tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility. Nevertheless, their contribution remains unclear since HS and N-glycans evade experimental characterization. We, therefore, carried out microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, followed by random acceleration molecular dynamics simulations, of the fully glycosylated spike:ACE2 complex with and without highly sulfated GAG chains bound. By considering the model GAGs as surrogates for the highly sulfated HS expressed in lung cells, we identified key cell entry mechanisms of spike SARS-CoV-2. We find that HS promotes structural and energetic stabilization of the active conformation of the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and reorientation of ACE2 toward the N-terminal domain in the same spike subunit as the RBD. Spike and ACE2 N-glycans exert synergistic effects, promoting better packing, strengthening the protein:protein interaction, and prolonging the residence time of the complex. ACE2 and HS binding trigger rearrangement of the S2’ functional protease cleavage site through allosteric interdomain communication. These results thus show that HS has a multifaceted role in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they provide a mechanistic basis for the development of GAG derivatives with anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential.",

Here, we compared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of human and bat ( Rhinolophus ferrumequinum ) pluripotent cells and fibroblasts. Since bat cells do not express an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that allows virus infection, we transduced the human ACE2 (hA) receptor into the cells and found that transduced cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Compared to human embryonic stem cells-hA, infected bat induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-hA produced about a 100-fold lower level of infectious virus and displayed lower toxicity. In contrast, bat embryonic fibroblast-hA produced no infectious virus while being infectable and synthesizing viral RNA and proteins, suggesting abortive infection. Indeed, electron microscopy failed to detect virus-like particles in infected bat fibroblasts in contrast to bat iPSCs or human cells, consistent with the latter producing infectious viruses. This suggests that bat somatic but not pluripotent cells have an effective mechanism to control virus replication. Consistent with previous results by others, we find that bat cells have a constitutively activated innate immune system, which might limit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to human cells.",

          "abstract": "The chemical compositions of island arc basalts (IAB) reflect contributions from the mantle as well as fluids and melts from the subducting slab. Addition of radiogenic seawater Sr to oceanic crust through hydrothermal alteration and subsequent subduction is often invoked to explain elevated 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures in modern IAB. However, changes in the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of island arc magmatic rocks through time has not been investigated, limiting our understanding of the factors influencing the Sr budgets of arcs throughout Earth’s history. To address this, we compiled 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values from island arc magmatic rocks ranging in age from modern to Paleoproterozoic, only including data from island arc localities that best preserve initial magmatic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. Median initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values are consistently elevated compared to depleted mantle 87 Sr/ 86 Sr over this period, indicating persistent enrichment in radiogenic Sr in island arcs. Moreover, the elevation in island arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr relative to the depleted mantle is variable. A notable rise in island arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr during the late Neoproterozoic coincides with a steep increase in seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and Sr concentration. To investigate this potential connectivity, we modeled the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of island arc magmas between 0 and 830 Ma with inputs of depleted mantle 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and seawater Sr concentration. The model reproduces the overall trajectory of the compiled data. We interpret the observed temporal variation in island arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values and its close association with fluctuations in seawater chemistry as evidence that changes in marine geochemistry have strongly influenced the Sr isotopic record of island arc magmas over time.",

Whether personal light exposure predicts mortality risk has not been established. We therefore investigated whether personal day and night light, and light patterns that disrupt circadian rhythms, predicted mortality risk. UK Biobank participants (N = 88,905, 62.4 ± 7.8 y, 57% female) wore light sensors for 1 wk. Day and night light exposures were defined by factor analysis of 24-h light profiles. A computational model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from light data. Cause-specific mortality was recorded in 3,750 participants across a mean (±SD) follow-up period of 8.0 ± 1.0 y. Individuals with brighter day light had incrementally lower all-cause mortality risk (adjusted-HR ranges: 0.84 to 0.90 [50 to 70th light exposure percentiles], 0.74 to 0.84 [70 to 90th], and 0.66 to 0.83 [90 to 100th]), and those with brighter night light had incrementally higher all-cause mortality risk (aHR ranges: 1.15 to 1.18 [70 to 90th], and 1.21 to 1.34 [90 to 100th]), compared to individuals in darker environments (0 to 50th percentiles). Individuals with lower circadian amplitude (aHR range: 0.90 to 0.96 per SD), earlier circadian phase (aHR range: 1.16 to 1.30), or later circadian phase (aHR range: 1.13 to 1.20) had higher all-cause mortality risks. Day light, night light, and circadian amplitude predicted cardiometabolic mortality, with larger hazard ratios than for mortality by other causes. Findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, photoperiod, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Minimizing night light, maximizing day light, and keeping regular light–dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity.",

However, the functions of ubr5 within animals remain unclear due to lethality in both mammals and flies when disrupted. Using Caenorhabditis elegans , we show that UBR-5 E3 ligase is required for timely exit of stem fate and complete transition into multiple cell type descendants in an ectodermal blast lineage. Animals lacking intact UBR-5 function simultaneously exhibit both stem fate and differentiated fate in the same descendant cells. A functional screen of UBR-5 physical interactors allowed us to identify the UBE2D2/3 E2 conjugase LET-70 working with UBR-5 to exit stem fate. Strikingly, we revealed that another UBR-5 physical interactor, namely the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 ortholog PABP-2, worked antagonistically to UBR-5 and LET-70. Lowering pabp-2 levels restored normal transition of cell state out of stemness and promoted normal cell fusion when either ubr-5 or let-70 UBE2D function was compromised. The UBR-5-LET-70 and PABP-2 switch works independently of the stem pool size determined by pluripotency factors like lin-28. UBR-5 limits PABP-2 protein and reverses the PABP-2-dependent gene expression program including developmental, proteostasis, and innate immunity genes. Loss of ubr-5 rescues the developmental stall when pabp-2 is compromised. Disruption of ubr-5 elevates PABP-2 levels and prolongs expression of ectodermal and muscle stem markers at the transition to adulthood. Additionally, ubr-5 mutants exhibit an extended period of motility during aging and suppress pabp-2- dependent early onset of immobility.",

In Drosophila cancer models, tumors have been known for decades to cause hypervolemic “bloating” of the abdominal cavity. Here we use allograft and transgenic tumors to show that hosts display fluid retention associated with autonomously defective secretory capacity of fly renal tubules, which function analogous to those of the human kidney. Excretion from these organs is blocked by abnormal cells that originate from inappropriate activation of normally quiescent renal stem cells (RSCs). Blockage is initiated by IL-6-like oncokines that perturb renal water-transporting cells and trigger a damage response in RSCs that proceeds pathologically. Thus, a chronic inflammatory state produced by the tumor causes paraneoplastic fluid dysregulation by altering cellular homeostasis of host renal units.",

The importance of HDAC3 in Kras mutant lung tumors has recently been identified, but HDAC3 function in this context remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we identified HDAC3 as a lung tumor cell–intrinsic transcriptional regulator of the tumor immune microenvironment. In Kras mutant lung cancer cells, we found that HDAC3 is a direct transcriptional repressor of a cassette of secreted chemokines, including Cxcl10 . Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of HDAC3 robustly up-regulated this gene set in human and mouse Kras , LKB1 (KL) and Kras , p53 (KP) mutant lung cancer cells through an NF-κB/p65-dependent mechanism. Using genetically engineered mouse models, we found that HDAC3 inactivation in vivo induced expression of this gene set selectively in lung tumors and resulted in enhanced T cell recruitment at least in part via Cxcl10 . Furthermore, we found that inhibition of HDAC3 in the presence of Kras pathway inhibitors dissociated Cxcl10 expression from that of immunosuppressive chemokines and that combination treatment of entinostat with trametinib enhanced T cell recruitment into lung tumors in vivo. Finally, we showed that T cells contribute to in vivo tumor growth control in the presence of entinostat and trametinib combination treatment. Together, our findings reveal that HDAC3 is a druggable endogenous repressor of T cell recruitment into Kras mutant lung tumors.",

Using a fleet turnover model and future electricity generation mix scenarios, we compare ambitious vehicle electrification to fleet renewal relying on newer internal combustion engine vehicles, without electric vehicles. The model includes vehicle-level pollutant emission factors and a reduced complexity air quality and valuation model and covers direct (tailpipe, brake wear, and tire wear) and indirect (production of electricity and liquid fuels) emissions of NO x , SO 2 , PM 2.5 , NH 3 , and VOCs, with a breakdown at the county level to identify geographical disparities in the distribution of health impacts. Short-term health benefits are mostly generated by reductions in NO x emissions from newer gasoline vehicles, while fleet electrification generates further benefits in the long term. The electricity mix plays a crucial role in the success of electrification policies. With continued grid decarbonization, electrification would reduce harmful air quality–related health impacts cumulatively by 84 to 188 billion USD over the study period, compared with fleet renewal without electric vehicles. In contrast, artificially freezing the 2022 grid would make electrification responsible for 32 to 71 billion USD additional health disbenefits compared with fleet renewal. Finally, we show that while fleet electrification achieves most of its benefits over fleet renewal in the long term, delaying the implementation of such policies would sacrifice meaningful cumulative benefits.",

When water was not limiting, all genotypes cooled leaves 2 to 5 °C below air temperatures. Homeothermic cooling was disrupted for weeks following a 72-h reduction in soil water, resulting in leaf temperatures rising 3 °C above air temperature and 1.3 °C above leaf thresholds for physiological damage, despite the water stress having little effect on leaf water potentials. Tradeoffs between leaf thermal safety and hydraulic safety emerged but, regardless of water use strategy, all genotypes experienced significant leaf mortality following water stress. Genotypes from warmer climates showed greater leaf cooling and less leaf mortality after water stress in comparison with genotypes from cooler climates.

Yet, the impact of such asymmetric seasonal warming on soil microbial carbon metabolism and growth remains poorly understood. Using 18 O isotope labeling, we examined the effects of a decade-long experimental seasonal warming on microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and growth in alpine grassland ecosystems. Moreover, the quantitative stable isotope probing with 18 O-H 2 O was employed to evaluate taxon-specific bacterial growth in these ecosystems. Results show that symmetric year-round warming decreased microbial growth rate by 31% and CUE by 22%. Asymmetric winter warming resulted in a further decrease in microbial growth rate of 27% and microbial CUE of 59% compared to symmetric year-round warming. Long-term warming increased microbial carbon limitations, especially under asymmetric winter warming. Long-term warming suppressed the growth rates of most bacterial genera, with asymmetric winter warming having a stronger inhibition on the growth rates of specific genera (e.g., Gp10 , Actinomarinicola , Bosea , Acidibacter , and Gemmata ) compared to symmetric year-round warming. Bacterial growth was phylogenetically conserved, but this conservation diminished under warming conditions, primarily due to shifts in bacterial physiological states rather than the number of bacterial species and community composition. Overall, long-term warming escalated microbial carbon limitations, decreased microbial growth and CUE, with asymmetric winter warming having a more pronounced effect. Understanding these impacts is crucial for predicting soil carbon cycling as global warming progresses.",

Here, we combine live-cell imaging and mathematical modeling to gain insights into the role of actin filament crosslinking proteins in force generation. Genetic manipulation showed that CME sites with more crosslinking proteins are more effective at internalization under high load. Simulations of an experimentally constrained, agent-based mathematical model recapitulate the result that endocytic networks with more double-bound fimbrin molecules internalize the plasma membrane against elevated turgor pressure more effectively. Networks with large numbers of crosslinks also have more growing actin filament barbed ends at the plasma membrane, where the addition of new actin monomers contributes to force generation and vesicle internalization. Our results provide a richer understanding of the crucial role played by actin filament crosslinking proteins during actin network force generation, highlighting the contribution of these proteins to the self-organization of the actin filament network and force generation under increased load.",

          "abstract": "Hyperpolarized nuclear spins in molecules exhibit high magnetization that is unachievable by classical polarization techniques, making them widely used as sensors in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The state of a hyperpolarized material, however, is typically only studied indirectly and with partial destruction of magnetization, due to the nature of conventional detection by resonant-pickup NMR spectroscopy or imaging. Here, we establish atomic magnetometers with sub-pT sensitivity as an alternative modality to detect in real time the complex dynamics of hyperpolarized materials without disturbing or interrupting the magnetogenesis process. As an example of dynamics that are impossible to detect in real time by conventional means, we examine parahydrogen-induced 1 H and 13 C magnetization during adiabatic eigenbasis transformations at μ T-field avoided crossings. Continuous but nondestructive magnetometry reveals previously unseen spin dynamics, fidelity limits, and magnetization backaction effects. As a second example, we apply magnetometry to observe the chemical-exchange-driven 13 C hyperpolarization of [1– 13 C]-pyruvate—the most important spin tracer for clinical metabolic imaging. The approach can be readily combined with other high-sensitivity magnetometers and is applicable to a broader range of general observation scenarios involving production, transport, and systems interaction of hyperpolarized compounds.",

          "abstract": "Two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels play a central role in modulating cellular excitability and neuronal function. The unique structure of the selectivity filter in K2P and other potassium channels determines their ability to allow the selective passage of potassium ions across cell membranes. The nematode C. elegans has one of the largest K2P families, with 47 subunit-coding genes. This remarkable expansion has been accompanied by the evolution of atypical selectivity filter sequences that diverge from the canonical TxGYG motif. Whether and how this sequence variation may impact the function of K2P channels has not been investigated so far. Here, we show that the UNC-58 K2P channel is constitutively permeable to sodium ions and that a cysteine residue in its selectivity filter is responsible for this atypical behavior. Indeed, by performing in vivo electrophysiological recordings and Ca 2+ imaging experiments, we demonstrate that UNC-58 has a depolarizing effect in muscles and sensory neurons. Consistently, unc-58 gain-of-function mutants are hypercontracted, unlike the relaxed phenotype observed in hyperactive mutants of many neuromuscular K2P channels. Finally, by combining molecular dynamics simulations with functional studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we show that the atypical cysteine residue plays a key role in the unconventional sodium permeability of UNC-58. As predicting the consequences of selectivity filter sequence variations in silico remains a major challenge, our study illustrates how functional experiments are essential to determine the contribution of such unusual potassium channels to the electrical profile of excitable cells.",

          "abstract": "Synaptic-vesicle (SV) recruitment is thought to maintain reliable neurotransmitter release during high-frequency signaling. However, the mechanism underlying the SV reloading for sustained neurotransmission at central synapses remains unknown. To elucidate this, we performed direct observations of SV reloading and mobility at a single-vesicle level near the plasma membrane in cerebellar mossy fiber terminals using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, together with simultaneous recordings of membrane fusion by capacitance measurements. We found that actin disruption abolished the rapid SV recruitment and reduced sustained release. In contrast, induction of actin polymerization and stabilization did not affect vesicle recruitment and release, suggesting that the presence of actin filaments, rather than actin dynamics, was required for the rapid recruitment. Single-particle tracking experiments of quantum dot-labeled vesicles, which allows nanoscale resolution of vesicle mobility, revealed that actin disruption caused vesicles to diffuse more rapidly. Hidden Markov modeling with Bayesian inference revealed that SVs had two diffusion states under normal conditions: free-diffusing and trapped. After disruption of the actin filament, vesicles tended to have only the free-diffusing state. F-actin staining showed that actin filaments were localized outside the active zones (AZs) and surrounded some SV trajectories. Perturbation of SV mobility, possibly through interference with biomolecular condensates, also suggested that the restricted diffusion state determined the rate of SV recruitment. We propose that actin filaments confined SVs near the AZ to achieve rapid and efficient recruitment followed by priming and sustained synaptic transmission.",

The socioeconomic implications of declining ice include diminished access to ice-based cultural activities, safety concerns in traversing ice, changes in fisheries, increases in shoreline erosion, and declines in water storage. Longer ice-free seasons allow more time and capacity for water to warm, threatening water quality and biodiversity. Food webs likely will reorganize, with constrained availability of ice-associated and cold-water niches, and ice loss will affect the nature, magnitude, and timing of greenhouse gas emissions. Examining these rapidly emerging changes will generate more-complete models of lake dynamics, and transdisciplinary collaborations will facilitate translation to effective management and sustainability.",

Yet, other environmental changes may affect the geographical distribution of species in unexpected ways. Here, we quantify multidecadal shifts in the distribution of European forest plants and link these shifts to key drivers of forest biodiversity change: climate change, atmospheric deposition (nitrogen and sulfur), and forest canopy dynamics. Surprisingly, westward distribution shifts were 2.6 times more likely than northward ones. Not climate change, but nitrogen-mediated colonization events, possibly facilitated by the recovery from past acidifying deposition, best explain westward movements. Biodiversity redistribution patterns appear complex and are more likely driven by the interplay among several environmental changes than due to the exclusive effects of climate change alone.",

Judges across the United States now anticipate an onslaught of litigation seeking to overturn federal regulatory actions, and many of these lawsuits will turn on scientific evidence that guided those actions. Instead of deferring to the scientific and technical expertise of federal agencies, courts must now independently review the scientific record behind a challenged regulation for its persuasiveness, along with scientific findings produced by the litigating parties.

Using topological analysis and genetic perturbations, we found that embryos progressively changed their cellular connectivity to a preferred topology, which could be predicted by a physical model in which actomyosin contractility and noise facilitate topological transitions, lowering surface energy. This mechanism favored regular embryo packing and promoted a higher number of inner cells in the 16-cell embryo.

          "abstract": "Observations of pathogen community structure provide evidence for both the coexistence and replacement of related strains. Despite many studies of specific host-pathogen systems, a unifying framework for predicting the outcomes of interactions among pathogens has remained elusive. We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains.",

We reveal the emergence of in-plane topological vortices within the periodic moiré patterns for both commensurate structures at small twist angles and the incommensurate quasicrystal structure that occurs at a 30° twist. The large-angle twist leads to mosaic chiral vortex patterns with tunable characteristics. A twisted quasicrystal bilayer, characterized by its 12-fold rotational symmetry, hosts complex vortex patterns and can be manipulated by picometer-scale interlayer displacement. Our findings highlight that twisting 2D bilayers is a versatile strategy for tailoring local electric polar vortices.",

          "abstract": "Variables related to socioeconomic status (SES), including income, ethnicity, and education, shape contact structures and affect the spread of infectious diseases. However, these factors are often overlooked in epidemic models, which typically stratify social contacts by age and interaction contexts. Here, we introduce and study generalized contact matrices that stratify contacts across multiple dimensions. We demonstrate a lower-bound theorem proving that disregarding additional dimensions, besides age and context, might lead to an underestimation of the basic reproductive number. By using SES variables in both synthetic and empirical data, we illustrate how generalized contact matrices enhance epidemic models, capturing variations in behaviors such as heterogeneous levels of adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions among demographic groups. Moreover, we highlight the importance of integrating SES traits into epidemic models, as neglecting them might lead to substantial misrepresentation of epidemic outcomes and dynamics. Our research contributes to the efforts aiming at incorporating socioeconomic and other dimensions into epidemic modeling.",

          "abstract": "A central barrier to effective governance and accountability in fisheries is the limited transparency of corporate ownership. Transshipment—the transfer of catches, fuel, parts, or crew between fishing and cargo vessels known as reefers—is often criticized for its opacity and poor governance. Better insight into the beneficial ownership of vessels involved in transshipment and their operational patterns could lead to more effective management. Our study presents a publicly accessible database of reefers’ owners, operators, and flags. We identified 569 individual reefers and found that Russian and Chinese owners control 26 and 20% of the global reefer fleet, respectively. Results also show that 65% of all reefer vessels fly the flags of Russia, Panama, or China. This high level of consolidation suggests considerable leverage for enhancing transparency and governance. Our findings highlight the potential for reforming existing transshipment practices through collaboration among owners, flag states, fishery regulators, and scientists.",

Federal assistance programs exist, but allocations across states have been nearly static since 1984, while the distribution of energy poverty is dynamic in location and time. We implement a LASSO-based machine learning approach using sociodemographic and geographical information to estimate energy burden in each US census tract for 2015 and 2020. We then compare the allocation to states from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to an optimized allocation. We allocate funds to the most burdened households, providing them with enough assistance to reduce their energy expenditures so that their household energy burden is equal to a new maximum allowable energy burden. This markedly shifts funds from the northern cold-weather states to the southern warm-weather states.",

          "abstract": "Calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling is fundamental to cellular processes in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. While the mechanisms underlying eukaryotic Ca 2+ transport are well documented, an understanding of prokaryotic transport remains nascent. LMCA1, a Ca 2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) from Listeria monocytogenes , has emerged as a prototype for elucidating structure and dynamics in prokaryotic Ca 2+ transport. Here, we used a multidisciplinary approach integrating kinetics, structure, and dynamics to unravel the intricacies of LMCA1 function. A cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a Ca 2+ -bound E1 state showed ion coordination by Asp 720 , Asn 716 , and Glu 292 . Time-resolved x-ray solution scattering experiments identified phosphorylation as the rate-determining step. A cryo-EM E2P state structure exhibited remarkable similarities to a SERCA1a E2-P* state, which highlights the essential role of the unique P-A domain interface in enhancing dephosphorylation rates and reconciles earlier proposed mechanisms. Our study underscores the distinctiveness between eukaryotic and prokaryotic Ca 2+ ATPase transport systems and positions LMCA1 as a promising drug target for developing antimicrobial strategies.",

          "abstract": "Efficient behavior requires the rapid attentional selection of task-relevant objects. Preparatory activity of target-selective neurons in visual cortex is thought to support attentional selection, guiding spatial attention and favoring processing of target-matching input. However, naturalistic searches are often guided by nontargets, including target-associated “anchor” objects. For instance, when looking for a pen, we may direct our attention to the office desk on which we expect to find it. Here, using fMRI and eye tracking in a context-guided search task, we tested whether preparatory activity in visual cortex reflected the target, the guiding anchor object, or both. Participants learned associations between targets and anchors, reversing across two scene contexts, before searching for these targets. Participants’ first fixations were reliably guided by the associated anchor. Preparatory activity in lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) represented the target-associated anchor rather than the target. These results shed light on the neural basis of context-guided search in structured environments.",

This study investigated alterations in the topographical structure of the brain related to aging and neurodegenerative diseases by analyzing brain gradients derived from structural MRI data across multiple cohorts ( n = 7323). The analysis identified distinct gradient patterns in AD, aging, and other neurodegenerative conditions. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that inorganic ion transmembrane transport was the most significant term in normal aging, while chemical synaptic transmission is a common enrichment term across various neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the findings show that each disorder exhibits unique dysfunctional neurophysiological characteristics. These insights are pivotal for elucidating the distinct biological mechanisms underlying AD, thereby enhancing our understanding of its unique clinical phenotypes in contrast to normal aging and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

However, it is virtually unknown how multiple biotic and abiotic drivers, such as climate, grazing, and fire, interact to determine woody dominance across global drylands. We conducted a standardized field survey in 304 plots across 25 countries to assess how climatic features, soil properties, grazing, and fire affect woody dominance in dryland rangelands. Precipitation, temperature, and grazing were key determinants of tree and shrub dominance. The effects of grazing were determined not solely by grazing pressure but also by the dominant livestock species. Interactions between soil, climate, and grazing and differences in responses to these factors between trees and shrubs were key to understanding changes in woody dominance.

Stable and long-lived degrader-mediated ternary complexes drive fast and profound target degradation; however, the mechanisms by which they affect target ubiquitination remain elusive. Here, we show cryo-EM structures of the VHL Cullin 2 RING E3 ligase with the degrader MZ1 directing target protein Brd4 BD2 toward UBE2R1-ubiquitin, and Lys 456 at optimal positioning for nucleophilic attack. In vitro ubiquitination and mass spectrometry illuminate a patch of favorably ubiquitinable lysines on one face of Brd4 BD2 , with cellular degradation and ubiquitinomics confirming the importance of Lys 456 and nearby Lys 368 /Lys 445 , identifying the “ubiquitination zone.” Our results demonstrate the proficiency of MZ1 in positioning the substrate for catalysis, the favorability of Brd4 BD2 for ubiquitination by UBE2R1, and the flexibility of CRL2 for capturing suboptimal lysines. We propose a model for ubiquitinability of degrader-recruited targets, providing a mechanistic blueprint for further rational drug design.",

When temporal changes in the environment mirror spatial gradients, it opens up the potential for predicting the course of adaptive evolution over time based on patterns of spatial genetic and phenotypic variation. We assessed this approach in a 30-year transplant experiment in the intertidal snail Littorina saxatilis . In 1992, snails were transplanted from a predation-dominated environment to one dominated by wave action. On the basis of spatial patterns, we predicted transitions in shell size and morphology, allele frequencies at positions throughout the genome, and chromosomal rearrangement frequencies.

Biological and transcriptomic approaches indicated that VRI-driven PD-L1 + neutrophils are endowed with potent regulatory functions and reduced classical antimicrobial properties, as compared to their PD-L1 − counterpart. VRI-induced regulatory PD-L1 + neutrophils were generated remotely in the bone marrow in an IFN-γ–dependent manner and were quickly mobilized into the inflamed lungs where they fulfilled their maturation. Neutrophil depletion and PD-L1 blockade during experimental VRI resulted in higher mortality, increased local inflammation, and reduced expression of resolving factors.

Here, we show that the perihatch synthesis of T 3 paralleling thyroid development is crucial for imprinting and endows newborn chicks with cognitive flexibility via a mechanism involving the nidopallium dorsocaudale, the avian “prefrontal cortex.” Imprinted chicks showed higher cognitive flexibility than those unimprinted in switching or reversal task experiments.

The role of volatiles in the mobilization of Au in the mantle is unclear because of the absence of direct geochemical evidence relating the mantle source of Au to Au mineralization in the overlying crust. This study uses lithium isotopes from a large suite of lamprophyres to characterize the mantle beneath the eastern North China Craton, which hosts giant Mesozoic gold deposits. Our results indicate a strong genetic link between carbonate metasomatism in the mantle and Au mineralization in the overlying crust.

Here, we propose and demonstrate a noise-enhanced microwave sensor using a thermal ensemble of interacting Rydberg atoms. Using the strong nonlinearity present in the Rydberg ensembles and leveraging stochastic noises in the system, we demonstrate the stochastic resonance driven by a weak microwave signal (from several microvolts per centimeter to millivolts per centimeter). A substantial enhancement in the detection is achieved, with a sensitivity surpassing that of a heterodyne atomic sensor by 6.6 decibels.

Simultaneously, the incorporation of (DF-CBA) 2 CuCl 4 as functional fillers leverages the formation of a hydrogen bonding network to enhance charge transfer processes. These fillers facilitate charge accumulation through an electric poling process, resulting in a power output improvement that surpasses 1400 times higher than that of a dense PSDU-based GS-TENG. Tapping onto the versatile properties of porous poly(siloxane-diphenylglyoxime-urethane)-perovskite (PSDU-PK) GS-TENGs, applications such as hand gesture/food recognition and dual-mode sensing system have been demonstrated, suggesting their promising potential in wearable electronics and smart agriculture.",

Heat capacity data show that the spins in both compounds are dominantly Ising-like, even after being manipulated by high magnetic fields. On cooling below the Néel temperatures, a sharp field–induced transition in magnetization is observed for CaCoGe 2 O 6 , while multiple magnetization plateaus beneath the full saturation moment are spotted for CaCoSi 2 O 6 . Our analysis shows that these contrasting behaviors potentially arise from the different electron configurations of germanium and silicon, in which the 3d orbitals are filled in the former but empty in the latter, enabling electron hopping.

Here, we showed that chloride intracellular channel 5 (CLIC5) exerts a critical role in mediating myogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration. Deletion of CLIC5 in skeletal muscle leads to reduced muscle weight and decreases the number and differentiation potential of satellite cells. In vitro, CLIC5 consistently inhibits myoblast proliferation while promoting myotube formation. CLIC5 promotes myogenic differentiation by activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in a biglycan (BGN)–dependent manner. CLIC5 deletion impairs muscle regeneration. Paired box gene 7 (Pax7) expression and the activity of BGN-mediated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling are reduced in CLIC5-deficient mice. Conversely, increasing CLIC5 levels in skeletal muscles enhances muscle regeneration capacity. In conclusion, our findings underscore CLIC5 as a pivotal regulator of myogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration, functioning through interaction with BGN to activate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",

Climate models forced by historical anthropogenic forcing suggest an increase in AR activity in the extratropics over the past four decades. However, reanalyses indicate a ~6° to 10° poleward shift of ARs during boreal winter in both hemispheres, featuring a rise along 50°N and 50°S and a decrease along 30°N and 30°S. Our analysis demonstrates that low-frequency sea surface temperature variability in the tropical eastern Pacific exhibits a cooling tendency since 2000 that plays a key role in driving this global AR shift, mostly over extratropical oceans, through a tropical-driven eddy-mean flow feedback. This mechanism also operates on interannual timescales, controlled by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and is less pronounced over the Southern Ocean due to weaker eddy activity during austral summer. These highlight the sensitivity of ARs to large-scale circulation changes driven by both internal variability and external forcing in current and upcoming decades.",

Here, we characterize the mass-independent Zn isotope compositions of meteorites from such planetesimals.

Our results suggest that, while differentiated planetesimals supplied ~70% of Earth’s mass, they provided only ~10% of its Zn.

This heatwave, spanning over 1.7 million square kilometers, persisting for 24 days with a peak intensity of 1.5°C, resulted in massive coral bleaching and fish mortality. This exceptional warming resulted from anomalously strong shortwave radiation and reduced heat loss via latent heat fluxes, owing to low wind speed and increased air humidity. These anomalies are attributed to a rare combined event “Madden-Julian Oscillation and extreme El Niño.” Following 10 February, the rapid dissipation of this marine heatwave results from the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the South Pacific.

Sulfate fluxes increased by 45% in the mainstem with 2.3°C of warming, and the temperature sensitivity suggests that continental-scale CO 2 fluxes could double by 2100. The largest increases occur in catchments with geomorphic settings which act to rapidly expose rocks through physical weathering and thermokarst processes.

AntimiRs targeting natural repressors miR-23b and miR-218 boost MBNL1 expression but must be optimized for a better pharmacological profile in humans. In untreated cells, miR-23b and miR-218 were up-regulated, which correlated with CTG repeat size, supporting that active MBNL1 protein repression synergizes with the sequestration by CUG expansions in DMPK . AntimiR treatment improved RNA toxicity readouts and corrected regulated exon inclusions and myoblast defects such as fusion index and myotube area across CTG expansions.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV)–mediated delivery of a floxed nanobody-TRPV1 into the striatum of adenosine-2a receptor–Cre drivers resulted in motor freezing when placed in a magnetic resonance imaging machine or adjacent to a transcranial magnetic stimulation device. Functional imaging and fiber photometry confirmed activation in response to magnetic fields. Expression of the same construct in the striatum of wild-type mice along with a second injection of an AAVretro expressing Cre into the globus pallidus led to similar circuit specificity and motor responses. Last, a mutation was generated to gate chloride and inhibit neuronal activity. Expression of this variant in the subthalamic nucleus in PitX2-Cre parkinsonian mice resulted in reduced c-fos expression and motor rotational behavior. These data demonstrate that magnetogenetic constructs can bidirectionally regulate activity of specific neuronal circuits noninvasively in vivo using clinically available devices.",

Deciphering the complexity of the membrane-binding behavior of α-syn is crucial to understand its functions and the pathology of PD. Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that α-syn forms multimers on lipid membranes with huge intermultimer distances. The multimers are characterized by self-limiting growth, manifesting in concentration-dependent exchanges of monomers, which are fast at micromolar concentrations and almost stop at nanomolar concentrations. We further uncovered movement patterns of α-syn’s occasional trapping on membranes, which may be attributed to sparse lipid packing defects. Mutations such as E46K and E35K may disrupt the limit on the growth, resulting in larger multimers and accelerated amyloid fibril formation. This work emphasizes sophisticated regulation of α-syn multimerization on membranes as a critical underlying factor in the PD pathology.",

The deficiency of a histone methyltransferase for H3K9 methylation does not lead to anomalous recombination.

Here, we report that VGLL3 plays an important role in DNA damage response (DDR). VGLL3 can be recruited to damage sites in a PARylation-dependent manner. VGLL3 depletion impairs the accumulation of RNF8 and RAD51 at sites of DNA damage, leading to reduced homologous recombination efficiency and increased cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, VGLL3 can prevent CtIP from KLHL15-mediated ubiquitination and degradation through competitive binding with KLHL15 and, meanwhile, stabilize MDC1 by limiting TRIP12-MDC1 but promoting USP7-MDC1 associations for optimal RNF8 signaling initiation. Consistently, VGLL3 depletion delays tumor development and sensitizes the xenografts to etoposide treatment. Overall, our results reveal an unexpected role of VGLL3 in DDR, which is distinct from its transcriptional cofactor function and not conserved among VGLL family members.",

The RC-LH1 monomer is composed of an RC encircled by an open LH1 ring comprising 15 αβ heterodimers and a PufX transmembrane polypeptide. In the RC-LH1 dimer, two crossing PufX polypeptides mediate dimerization. Unlike Rhodabacter sphaeroides counterpart, Rba. blasticus RC-LH1 dimer has a less bent conformation, lacks the PufY subunit near the LH1 opening, and includes two extra LH1 αβ subunits, forming a more enclosed S-shaped LH1 ring. Spectroscopic assays reveal that these unique structural features are accompanied by changes in the kinetics of quinone/quinol trafficking between RC-LH1 and cytochrome bc 1 .

The resulting readout can be high fidelity and QND, but readout times are currently limited to the order of 50 nanoseconds due to the dispersive cross-Kerr of magnitude 10 megahertz. Here, we present a readout scheme that uses the quarton coupler to facilitate a large (greater than 200 megahertz) cross-Kerr between a transmon qubit and its readout resonator. Full master equation simulations of the coupled system show a 5-nanosecond readout time with greater than 99% readout fidelity and greater than 99.9% QND fidelity. The quartonic readout circuit is experimentally feasible and preserves the coherence properties of the qubit.

We find a gradual increase in human habitat preferences toward rough terrains until about 1.1 million years ago (Ma), followed by a 300 thousand-year-long contraction of the ecological niche. This period coincided with the Mid-Pleistocene Transition and previously hypothesized ancestral population bottlenecks. Our statistical analysis further reveals that from 0.8 Ma onward, the human niche expanded again, with human species (e.g., H. heidelbergensis , H. neanderthalensis , and H. sapiens ) adapting to rougher terrain, colder and drier conditions, and toward regions of higher ecological diversity.",

Here, we unveil that neonatal naïve T cell quiescence is characterized by enhanced energy production and protein synthesis. This phenotype is associated with the absence of LINE1 expression attributed to tonic T cell receptor/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1)–mediated LINE1 splicing suppression. The absence of LINE1 expression primes these cells for rapid execution of the activation program by directly regulating protein synthesis. LINE1 expression progressively increases in childhood and adults, peaking in elderly individuals, and, by decreasing protein synthesis, contributes to immune senescence in aging.

We show that CED-9 or CED-4 mutations located in their CED-9–CED-4 binding regions reduce apoptosis without affecting the CED-9 anti-apoptotic function. These mutant CED-9 and CED-4 proteins are defective in a CED-9–CED-4 interaction in vitro and in vivo, revealing that the known CED-9–CED-4 interaction is required for the pro-apoptotic but not for the anti-apoptotic function of CED-9. The pro-apoptotic CED-9–CED-4 interaction occurs at mitochondria. In mammals, BCL-2 family members can activate APAF-1 via cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The conserved role of mitochondria in CED-9/BCL-2–dependent CED-4/APAF-1 activation is notable and suggests that understanding how CED-9 promotes apoptosis in C. elegans could inform the understanding of mammalian apoptosis and how disruptions of apoptosis promote certain human disorders.",

          "abstract": "One-carbon ring expansion reaction of N-heterocycles has gained particular attention in the past decade because this method allows for the conversion of readily available N-heterocycles into potentially useful complex ring-expanded N-heterocycles, which are inaccessible by traditional methods. However, the catalytic asymmetric variant of this reaction has been rarely reported to date. Herein, we disclose an enantioselective one-carbon ring expansion reaction through chiral copper-catalyzed diyne cyclization, leading to the practical, atom-economic and divergent assembly of an array of valuable chiral N-heterocycles bearing a quaternary stereocenter in generally good to excellent yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee). This protocol represents the first example of asymmetric one-carbon ring expansion reaction of N-heterocycles based on alkynes.",

          "abstract": "Decreased presence or activity of human SLC26A4 at the plasma membrane is a common cause of hearing loss. SLC26A4 (Pendrin) is necessary for normal reabsorption of endolymph, the fluid bathing the inner ear. We identified the μ2 subunit of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a protein-partner of SLC26A4 involved in regulating its plasma membrane abundance. We showed that, in the endolymphatic sac, where fluid reabsorption occurs, SLC26A4 is localized along the apical microvilli of mitochondria-rich cells, in contact with the endolymph, and associated with clathrin-coated pits where μ2 and AP-2 are present. Based on SLC26A4 structure, the elements involved in SLC26A4-μ2 interaction were identified and validated experimentally, allowing modeling of this interaction at the atomic level. Pharmacological inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis led to an increased plasma membrane abundance of hemagglutinin-tagged SLC26A4 virally or endogenously expressed in mitochondria-rich cells. These results indicate that the SLC26A4-μ2 interaction regulates SLC26A4 abundance at the apical surface of mitochondria-rich cells.",

          "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are strongly associated with low natriuretic peptide (NP) plasma levels and a down-regulation of NP guanylyl cyclase receptor-A (GCA) in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, no study has so far provided evidence for a causal link between atrial NP (ANP)/GCA deficiency and T2D pathogenesis. Here, we show that both systemic and skeletal muscle ANP/GCA deficiencies in mice promote metabolic disturbances and prediabetes. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is further associated with altered mitochondrial function and impaired endurance running capacity. ANP/GCA-deficient mice exhibit increased proton leak and reduced content of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins. We further show that GCA is related to several metabolic traits in T2D and positively correlates with markers of oxidative capacity in human skeletal muscle. Together, these results indicate that ANP/GCA signaling controls muscle mitochondrial integrity and oxidative capacity in vivo and plays a causal role in the development of prediabetes.",
