          "abstract": "Immigrants to high-income countries often face considerable and persistent difficulties in the labour market1,2,3,4,5,6, whereas their native-born children typically experience economic progress6,7,8,9. However, little is known about the extent to which these immigrant–native earnings differences stem from unequal pay when doing the same work for the same employer versus labour market processes that sort immigrants into lower-paid jobs. Here, using data from nine European and North American countries, we show that the segregation of workers with immigrant backgrounds into lower-paying jobs accounts for about three-quarters of overall immigrant–native earnings differences. Although within-job pay inequality remains notable for immigrants in several countries, our results demonstrate that unequal access to higher-paying jobs is the primary driver of the immigrant–native pay gap across a range of institutionally and demographically diverse contexts. These findings highlight the importance of policies aimed at reducing between-job segregation, such as language training10,11,12,13, job training13,14,15, job search assistance programmes13,15, improving access to domestic education13,16,17, recognizing foreign qualifications18,19, and settlement programmes aimed at enhancing access to job-relevant information and networks13,20,21. Policies that target employer bias in hiring and promotion decisions are also likely to be effective, whereas measures aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work may have more limited scope for further progress in closing the immigrant–native pay gap22,23,24,25,26,27,28.",

          "abstract": "The Standard Model of particle physics—the theory of particles and interactions at the smallest scale—predicts that matter and antimatter interact differently due to violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). Charge conjugation transforms particles into their antimatter particles, whereas the parity transformation inverts spatial coordinates. This prediction applies to both mesons, which consist of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are composed of three quarks. However, despite having been discovered in various meson decays, CP violation has yet to be observed in baryons, the type of matter that makes up the observable Universe. Here we report a study of the decay of the beauty baryon $${\\varLambda }_{0}^{b}$$ Λ 0 b to the p K − π + π − final state, which proceeds through b → u or b → s quark-level transitions, and its CP-conjugated process, using data collected by the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment 1 at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The results reveal significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the $${\\varLambda }_{0}^{b}$$ Λ 0 b baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, providing, to our knowledge, the first observation of CP violation in baryon decays and demonstrating the different behaviours of baryons and antibaryons. In the Standard Model, CP violation arises from the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa mechanism 2 , and new forces or particles beyond the Standard Model could provide further contributions. This discovery opens a new path in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.",

          "abstract": "Non-antibiotic drugs can alter the composition of the gut microbiome 1 , but they have largely unknown implications for human health 2 . Here we examined how non-antibiotics affect the ability of gut commensals to resist colonization by enteropathogens 3 . We also developed an in vitro assay to assess enteropathogen growth in drug-perturbed microbial communities. Pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria were more resistant to non-antibiotics than commensals and their post-treatment expansion was potentiated. For 28% of the 53 drugs tested, the growth of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. ( S . Tm) in synthetic and human stool-derived communities was increased, and similar effects were observed for other enteropathogens. Non-antibiotics promoted pathogen proliferation by inhibiting the growth of commensals, altering microbial interactions and enhancing the ability of S . Tm to exploit metabolic niches. Drugs that promoted pathogen expansion in vitro increased the intestinal S . Tm load in mice. For the antihistamine terfenadine, drug-induced disruption of colonization resistance accelerated disease onset and increased inflammation caused by S . Tm.

          "abstract": "Climate change has significantly increased adverse effects on human health, and economic growth1–3. However, few studies have differentiated the impacts of extreme temperatures at the city level, and analysed the future implications for human health under various climate change scenarios.4–6 Here, data on historical relationship among six kinds of climate-sensitive diseases (CSD) hospitalizations and temperatures across 301 cities (over 90% of all cities) and more than 7,000 hospitals in China are leveraged, and a nonlinear distributed lag model is used. This study projects hospitalization risks associated with extreme temperatures through to the year 2100 and develops the Hospitalization Burden Economic Index to assess the burden under three carbon emission scenarios in cities. Five dimensions including spatial distribution, disease categories, population age groups, future time horizons, and carbon emission development pathways have been evaluated. Historical data specifically indicate more temperature-related risks among the CSDs in northwestern and southwestern China. Notably, gestation-related disease risk is associated with increased vulnerability to extreme heat in specific regions. The projections reveal that, under current thermal conditions with no adaptations, the excess hospitalizations from extreme heat will reach 5.1 million people by 2100 under the high emission scenario.These findings highlight the need for targeted climate change mitigation strategies to reduce uneven climate-related hospitalization risks and economic burdens while accounting for differences in city geography, extreme temperatures, population groups and carbon emission development pathways.",

One strategy is superinfection exclusion, whereby an established viral infection prevents a secondary infection of the same cell1. This phenomenon has been shown to have an important role in the spread of eukaryotic viruses. Here we determine that superinfection exclusion proteins in bacterial viruses (bacteriophages, hereafter phages) perform a similar role, promoting viral spread through the bacterial community. We characterize a phage protein that alters the dynamics of a common phage receptor, the type IV pilus. This protein, known as Zip, does not abrogate pilus activity, but fine-tunes it, providing a strong phage defence without a fitness cost. Notably, Zip also prevents internalization and destruction of newly released phage progeny, a phenomenon that we call the anti-Kronos effect after the Greek god who consumed his offspring. Zip activity promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, thereby enhancing viral spread. We further demonstrate that the anti-Kronos effect is conserved across diverse prophage-encoded superinfection exclusion systems. Our results identify the mechanistic basis of a superinfection exclusion system that safeguards phage progeny and provide insights into the conservation of viral defence mechanisms among bacterial and eukaryotic systems.",

Processes that permit rapid and reversible transformations between these morphologies, however, have been difficult to realize because physical properties required for rapid shape change (for example, low interfacial tension or viscosity) provide pathways for relaxation that result in short-lived states. Fully reversible formation of long-lived microdomain states would expand the palette of properties that can be accessed dynamically using biphasic liquids (for example, tunable optical metamaterials). Here we report the discovery of shape-shifting and bistable microdomains of a biphasic liquid system consisting of an isotropic oil and a liquid crystalline oil. The isotropic oil forms stable wetting films (‘original’ shape) between solid surfaces and an overlying liquid crystal phase, and, when exposed to a transient (<1 s) a.c. electric field at low frequency (10 Hz), transforms into long-lived (>24 h) spherical domains (‘temporary’ shape) stabilized by topological defects in the liquid crystal1,4,5. Subsequent application of an a.c. electric field of high frequency (1 kHz) triggers solitons to form in the liquid crystal6,7,8, creating kinetic pathways that lead to remarkably rapid (<3 s) coalescence of the dispersed spherical domains and recovery of the original shape (wetting film)1,8,9. We show rapid and reversible switching between distinct optical states of the biphasic system, with each state persisting without continuous application of the field, thus providing a combination of optical properties long sought in thin liquid films10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. The fully reversible and long-lived emulsion formation reported here appears promising for materials synthesis, microchemical systems and tunable optical metamaterials (for example, to control visibility and transmittance of light through windows)17,18,19,20,21.",

With growing recognition of electrochemistry as a powerful tool to improve the scope and sustainability of organic synthesis1, increasing efforts have been directed towards developing asymmetric electrocatalytic reactions to access challenging chiral molecules2,3,4. However, many useful electrochemical reactions rely on direct electrolysis without a catalyst, making them inherently difficult to render enantioselective. Supporting electrolytes are integral to electrochemical systems and, in addition to ensuring sufficient solution conductivity, they can influence the rate and selectivity of electrochemical transformations5. Chiral supporting electrolytes can mediate asymmetric reactions via direct electrolysis, but their use in organic electrosynthesis remains largely unexplored6,7. Here we describe the use of substoichiometric chiral phosphate salts as supporting electrolytes to facilitate the oxidation of racemic trivalent phosphines to afford enantioenriched phosphine oxides. Our approach relies on a dynamic-kinetic-resolution strategy that exploits the rapid pyramidal inversion of an anodically generated phosphoniumyl radical cation8, while a high concentration of chiral phosphate at the electrode–electrolyte interface9,10 enhances enantioselective control during rate-limiting nucleophilic addition. Our results highlight the promise of chiral supporting electrolytes for promoting radical-ion-mediated asymmetric transformations.",

Here we examine the impact of WGD on somatic evolution and immune evasion at single-cell resolution in patient tumours. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we analysed 70 high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples from 41 patients (30,260 tumour genomes) and observed near-ubiquitous evidence that WGD is an ongoing mutational process. WGD was associated with increased cell–cell diversity and higher rates of chromosomal missegregation and consequent micronucleation. We developed a mutation-based WGD timing method called doubleTime to delineate specific modes by which WGD can drive tumour evolution, including early fixation followed by considerable diversification, multiple parallel WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy-number diversity, and evolutionarily late WGD in small clones and individual cells. Furthermore, using matched single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signalling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability, but this is restricted to predominantly diploid tumours (WGD-low). By contrast, predominantly WGD tumours (WGD-high), despite increased missegregation, exhibited cell-cycle dysregulation, STING1 repression, and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an ongoing mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.",

These networks sustain out-of-equilibrium regimes in which chemical energy is continually converted into controlled mechanical work and motion 1–3 . Out-of-equilibrium reaction networks have also enabled the design and successful development of artificial autonomously operating molecular machines 4,5 , in which networks comprising pairs of formally—but non-microscopically—reverse reaction pathways drive controlled motion at the molecular level. In biological systems, the concurrent operation of several reaction pathways is enabled by the chemoselectivity of enzymes and their cofactors, and nature’s dissipative reaction networks involve several classes of reactions. By contrast, the reactivity that has been harnessed to develop chemical reaction networks in pursuit of artificial molecular machines is limited to a single reaction type. Only a small number of synthetic systems exhibit chemically fuelled continuous controlled molecular-level motion 6–8 and all exploit the same class of acylation–hydrolysis reaction. Here we show that a redox reaction network, comprising concurrent oxidation and reduction pathways, can drive chemically fuelled continuous autonomous unidirectional motion about a C–C bond in a structurally simple synthetic molecular motor based on an achiral biphenyl. The combined use of an oxidant and reductant as fuels and the directionality of the motor are both enabled by exploiting the enantioselectivity and functional separation of reactivity inherent to enzyme catalysis.",

Here we report, however, that neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis. In multiple cancer mouse models, we found a tumour-elicited Ly6GHighLy6CLow neutrophil population that was unable to extravasate in response to inflammatory challenges but formed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) more efficiently than classical Ly6GHighLy6CHigh neutrophils. The presence of these ‘vascular-restricted’ neutrophils correlated with the appearance of a ‘pleomorphic’ necrotic architecture in mice. In tumours with pleomorphic necrosis, we found intravascular aggregates of neutrophils and NETs that caused occlusion of the tumour vasculature, driving hypoxia and necrosis of downstream vascular beds. Furthermore, we found that cancer cells adjacent to these necrotic regions (that is, in ‘perinecrotic’ areas) underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, explaining the paradoxical metastasis-enhancing effect of tumour necrosis. Blocking NET formation genetically or pharmacologically reduced the extent of tumour necrosis and lung metastasis. Thus, by showing that NETs drive vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis, we demonstrate that tumour necrosis is not necessarily a passive byproduct of tumour growth and that it can be blocked to reduce metastatic spread.",

However, current methods are constrained by the rapid evolution of plant pathogens and often lack broad-spectrum and durable protection. Here we report an innovative strategy to engineer broad-spectrum, durable and complete disease resistance in plants through expression of a chimeric protein containing a flexible polypeptide coupled with a single or dual conserved pathogen-originated protease cleavage site fused in frame to the N terminus of an autoactive nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat immune receptor (NLR) containing a coiled-coil or RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8-like coiled-coil domain. Following invasion, pathogen-originated specific proteases cleave the inactive chimeric protein to form free autoactive NLR, triggering broad-spectrum plant disease resistance. We demonstrate that a single engineered NLR can confer broad-spectrum and complete resistance against multiple potyviruses. Given that many pathogenic organisms across kingdoms encode proteases, this strategy has the potential to be exploited to control viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes and pests in plants.",

Here we report that transcripts upregulated after sleep deprivation, in sleep-control neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body 1,2 (dFBNs) but not ubiquitously in the brain, encode almost exclusively proteins with roles in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. These gene expression changes are accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation, enhanced mitophagy and an increase in the number of contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, creating conduits 3,4 for the replenishment of peroxidized lipids 5 . The morphological changes are reversible after recovery sleep and blunted by the installation of an electron overflow 6,7 in the respiratory chain. Inducing or preventing mitochondrial fission or fusion 8–13 in dFBNs alters sleep and the electrical properties of sleep-control cells in opposite directions: hyperfused mitochondria increase, whereas fragmented mitochondria decrease, neuronal excitability and sleep. ATP concentrations in dFBNs rise after enforced waking because of diminished ATP consumption during the arousal-mediated inhibition of these neurons 14 , which augments their mitochondrial electron leak 7 . Consistent with this view, uncoupling electron flux from ATP synthesis 15 relieves the pressure to sleep, while exacerbating mismatches between electron supply and ATP demand (by powering ATP synthesis with a light-driven proton pump 16 ) precipitates sleep. Sleep, like ageing 17,18 , may be an inescapable consequence of aerobic metabolism.",

SXRS has been long predicted as a means to launch and probe valence-electron wavepackets and as a building block for nonlinear X-ray spectroscopies5,6. However, experimental observations of SXRS to date4,7,8 have not provided spectroscopic information, and theoretical modelling has largely implemented hard-to-realize phase-coherent attosecond pulses. Here we demonstrate SXRS with spectroscopic precision, that is, detection of valence-excited states in neon with a near Fourier-limited joint energy–time resolution of 0.1 eV–40 fs. We used a new covariance analysis between statistically spiky broadband incident X-ray and scattered X-ray Raman pulses. Using 18,000 single shots, we beat not only the incident (about 8 eV) bandwidth but also the approximately 0.2 eV instrumental energy resolution, thus creating super-resolution conditions, in analogy to super-resolved fluorescence microscopy9. Our experimental results, supported by ab initio propagation simulations, reveal the competition between lasing in the ion and stimulated Raman scattering in the neutral. We demonstrate enhanced signal collection efficiency and a broad excitation window, surpassing spontaneous Raman efficiencies by orders of magnitude.

However, individuals at risk for early vascular disease often remain unidentified2. Recent research has identified new molecules in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis3, highlighting the need for alternative disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve early diagnosis and therapy efficacy. Here, we observed that imidazole propionate (ImP), produced by microorganisms, is associated with the extent of atherosclerosis in mice and in two independent human cohorts. Furthermore, ImP administration to atherosclerosis-prone mice fed with chow diet was sufficient to induce atherosclerosis without altering the lipid profile, and was linked to activation of both systemic and local innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. Specifically, we found that ImP caused atherosclerosis through the imidazoline-1 receptor (I1R, also known as nischarin) in myeloid cells. Blocking this ImP–I1R axis inhibited the development of atherosclerosis induced by ImP or high-cholesterol diet in mice. Identification of the strong association of ImP with active atherosclerosis and the contribution of the ImP–I1R axis to disease progression opens new avenues for improving the early diagnosis and personalized therapy of atherosclerosis.",

By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained [12, 1], necessitating the use of special resource states known as ‘magic states’ [13] to implement universal, classically hard circuits [14]. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform ‘distillation’, creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs [15, 13]. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture [16, 8] to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d  =  3 and d  =  5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.",

          "abstract": "Hybridized matter–photon excitations in hyperbolic crystals—anisotropic materials characterized by permittivity tensor components with opposite sign—have attracted substantial attention owing to their strong light–matter interactions in the form of hyperbolic polaritons1,2,3. However, these phenomena have been restricted to hyperbolic crystals, whose optical responses are confined to fixed spectral regions and lack tunability, thereby limiting their broader applicability4,5. Here we demonstrate the emergence of hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in a non-hyperbolic yttrium vanadate (YVO4) crystal. Using real-space nanoimaging combined with theoretical analyses, we visualize hyperbolic wavefronts of surface phonon polaritons on YVO4 crystal surfaces within its non-hyperbolic frequency range, where the permittivity tensor components of the material have the same negative sign. Furthermore, by varying the temperature from room temperature to cryogenic levels, we realize in situ manipulation of polariton dispersions, enabling a topological transition from hyperbolic to canalization and eventually to the elliptic regime. This temperature-controlled dispersion engineering not only provides precise control over polariton topology but also modulates their wavelength and group velocity, showing remarkable sensitivity alongside low-loss, long-range propagation. These findings extend the realm of hyperbolic nano-optics by removing the reliance on hyperbolic crystals, unlocking opportunities for applications in negative refraction6,7,8,9,10, superlensing11,12, polaritonic chemistry13, integrated photonics14,15,16 and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the largest natural source of new nitrogen (N) that supports terrestrial productivity1,2, yet estimates of global terrestrial BNF remain highly uncertain3,4. Here we show that this uncertainty is partly because of sampling bias, as field BNF measurements in natural terrestrial ecosystems occur where N fixers are 17 times more prevalent than their mean abundances worldwide. To correct this bias, we develop new estimates of global terrestrial BNF by upscaling field BNF measurements using spatially explicit abundances of all major biogeochemical N-fixing niches. We find that natural biomes sustain lower BNF, 65 (52–77) Tg N yr−1, than previous empirical bottom-up estimates3,4, with most BNF occurring in tropical forests and drylands. We also find high agricultural BNF in croplands and cultivated pastures, 56 (54–58) Tg N yr−1. Agricultural BNF has increased terrestrial BNF by 64% and total terrestrial N inputs from all sources by 60% over pre-industrial levels. Our results indicate that BNF may impose stronger constraints on the carbon sink in natural terrestrial biomes and represent a larger source of agricultural N than is generally considered in analyses of the global N cycle5,6, with implications for proposed safe operating limits for N use7,8.",

Here we introduce a deep learning model, EchoNext, trained on more than 1 million heart rhythm and imaging records across a large and diverse health system to detect many forms of structural heart disease. The model demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in internal and external validation, outperforming cardiologists in a controlled evaluation and showing consistent performance across different care settings and racial and/or ethnic groups. The models were prospectively evaluated in a clinical trial of patients without previous cardiac imaging, successfully identifying previously undiagnosed heart disease. These findings support the potential of artificial intelligence to expand access to heart disease screening at scale.

          "abstract": "A lithium (Li)-metal anode paired with a high-nickel cathode is considered to be a combination that holds promise to surpass the 500 Wh kg−1 threshold1,2. Approaching such high energy density, electrolytes capable of stabilizing both anode and cathode interphases are of importance to secure safe and long-term cycling3,4. Although anion-derived inorganic interphases have shown remarkable success at the Li side5,6,7, developing intrinsic strategies to concurrently protect both electrodes remains a key challenge. Here we report a micro-emulsion strategy for electrolyte design that bypasses the Li+ solvation regulation and produces fluoride-rich interphases for both electrodes. Specifically, liquid–liquid interfacial tension between the micelles and carbonate solvents, rather than the electric field, propels the motion of fluorinated droplets towards the anode and the cathode. In this way, the interphase construction of both electrodes can be enhanced and decoupled from the solvation structure strategy. Through use of the micro-emulsion electrolyte, two pouch full cells with energy densities of 531 Wh kg−1 and 547 Wh kg−1 retain 81% and 79% of their capacity after 189 and 155 cycles, respectively. The introduction of liquid–liquid interfacial tension provides a perspective for interphase regulation and electrolyte design, and paves the way for the development of high-voltage Li-metal batteries.",

          "abstract": "A pervasive dilemma in brain-wide association studies 1 (BWAS) is whether to prioritize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan time or sample size. We derive a theoretical model showing that individual-level phenotypic prediction accuracy increases with sample size and total scan duration (sample size × scan time per participant). The model explains empirical prediction accuracies well across 76 phenotypes from nine resting-fMRI and task-fMRI datasets ( R 2 = 0.89), spanning diverse scanners, acquisitions, racial groups, disorders and ages. For scans of ≤20 min, accuracy increases linearly with the logarithm of the total scan duration, suggesting that sample size and scan time are initially interchangeable. However, sample size is ultimately more important. Nevertheless, when accounting for the overhead costs of each participant (such as recruitment), longer scans can be substantially cheaper than larger sample size for improving prediction performance. To achieve high prediction performance, 10 min scans are cost inefficient. In most scenarios, the optimal scan time is at least 20 min. On average, 30 min scans are the most cost-effective, yielding 22% savings over 10 min scans. Overshooting the optimal scan time is cheaper than undershooting it, so we recommend a scan time of at least 30 min. Compared with resting-state whole-brain BWAS, the most cost-effective scan time is shorter for task-fMRI and longer for subcortical-to-whole-brain BWAS. In contrast to standard power calculations, our results suggest that jointly optimizing sample size and scan time can boost prediction accuracy while cutting costs. Our empirical reference is available online for future study design ( https://thomasyeolab.github.io/OptimalScanTimeCalculator/index.html ).",

Notably, the cardiac glycoside digoxin and other drugs identified in this epidemiological study are sufficient to alter the composition of the microbiome and the risk of infection with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.

Tm infection is transmissible through the microbiome, and characterization of this interaction highlights a digoxin-responsive β-defensin that alters the microbiome composition and consequent immune surveillance of the invading pathogen. Combining epidemiological and experimental approaches thus provides an opportunity to uncover drug–host–microbiome–pathogen interactions that increase the risk of infections in humans.",

Understanding how soil metabolic activity responds to climate-driven environmental perturbations is a key challenge 2,3 . However, the ecological, spatial and chemical complexity of soils 4–6 impedes understanding how these communities respond to perturbations. Here we address this complexity by combining dynamic measurements of respiratory nitrate metabolism 7 with modelling to reveal functional regimes that define soil responses to environmental change. Measurements across more than 1,500 soil microcosms subjected to pH perturbations 8,9 reveal regimes in which distinct mechanisms govern metabolite dynamics. A minimal model with two parameters, biomass activity and growth-limiting nutrient availability, predicts nitrate utilization dynamics across soils and pH perturbations. Parameter shifts under perturbation reveal three functional regimes, each linked to distinct mechanisms: (1) an acidic regime marked by cell death and suppressed metabolism; (2) a nutrient-limited regime in which dominant taxa exploit matrix-released nutrients; and (3) a resurgent growth regime driven by exponential growth of rare taxa in nutrient-rich conditions. We validated these model-derived mechanisms with nutrient measurements, amendment experiments, sequencing and isolate studies. Additional experiments and meta-analyses suggest that functional regimes are widespread in pH-perturbed soils.",

          "abstract": "Birds have a sex chromosome system in which females are heterogametic (ZW) and males are homogametic (ZZ)1. The differentiation of avian sex chromosomes from ancestral autosomes entails the loss of most genes from the W chromosome during evolution1,2. However, the extent to which mechanisms evolved that counterbalance this substantial reduction in female gene dosage remains unclear. Here we report functional in vivo and evolutionary analyses of a Z-linked microRNA (miR-2954) with strong male-biased expression, previously proposed to mediate avian sex chromosome dosage compensation3. We knocked out miR-2954 in chicken, which resulted in early embryonic lethality in homozygous knockout males, probably driven by specific upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked target genes. Evolutionary gene expression analyses further revealed that these dosage-sensitive target genes underwent both transcriptional and translational upregulation on the single Z in female birds. Altogether, this work unveils a scenario in which evolutionary pressures following W gene loss drove transcriptional and translational upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes in females but also their transcriptional upregulation in males. The resulting excess of transcripts in males, resulting from the combined activity of two upregulated dosage-sensitive Z gene copies, was in turn offset by the emergence of a highly targeted miR-2954-mediated transcript degradation mechanism during avian evolution. This study uncovered a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation system in birds, in which a microRNA has become essential for male survival.",

Here we present a hybrid copper–iodide that shows near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (99.6%) with an emission wavelength of 449 nm and colour coordinates (0.147, 0.087), alongside its emission mechanism and charge transport characteristics. We use the thin film of this hybrid as the sole active emissive layer to fabricate deep-blue light-emitting diodes and subsequently enhance the device performance through a dual interfacial hydrogen-bond passivation strategy. This synergetic surface modification approach, integrating a hydrogen-bond-acceptor self-assembled monolayer with an ultrathin polymethyl methacrylate capping layer, effectively passivates both heterojunctions of the copper–iodide hybrid emissive layer and optimizes charge injections. We achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.57%, a maximum luminance of 3,970.30 cd m−2 with colour coordinates (0.147, 0.091) and an excellent operational stability (half-lifetime) of 204 hours under ambient conditions.

Here, we show that a new strain of the bacterial genus Hominenteromicrobium (designated YB328) isolated from the faeces of patients who responded to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade augmented antitumour responses in mice. YB328 activated tumour-specific CD8+ T cells through the stimulation of CD103+CD11b− conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which, following exposure in the gut, migrated to the tumour microenvironment. Mice showed improved antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade when treated with faecal transplants from non-responder patients supplemented with YB238. This result suggests that YB328 could function in a dominant manner. YB328-activated CD103+CD11b− cDCs showed prolonged engagement with tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and promoted PD-1 expression in these cells. Moreover, YB238-augmented antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade treatment was observed in multiple mouse models of cancer. Patients with elevated YB328 abundance had increased infiltration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs in tumours and had a favourable response to PD-1 blockade therapy in various cancer types. We propose that gut microbiota enhance antitumour immunity by accelerating the maturation and migration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs to increase the number of CD8+ T cells that respond to diverse tumour antigens.",

However, despite offering insights into aspects of biology that are otherwise difficult to envisage from skeletal evidence alone (such as the presence of a crescentic fluke), information on their soft parts has hitherto been limited to a taxonomically narrow sample of small- to dolphin-sized animals 2,4–6 . Here we report the discovery of a metre-long front flipper of the large-bodied Jurassic ichthyosaur Temnodontosaurus , including unique details of its soft-tissue anatomy. In addition to revealing a wing-like planform, the fossil preserves a serrated trailing edge that is reinforced by novel cartilaginous integumental elements, herein denominated chondroderms. We also document chordwise-parallel skin ornamentations and a protracted fleshy distal tip that presumably acted like a flexible winglet in life. By integrating morphological and numerical data, we show that the observed features probably provided hydroacoustic benefits, and conclude that the visually guided 7,8 Temnodontosaurus relied on stealth while hunting in dim-lit pelagic environments. This unexpected combination of control surface modifications represents a previously unrecognized mode of concealment, and underscores the importance of soft-tissue fossils when inferring aspects of palaeoethology and predator–prey palaeoecology.",

Last year, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded hundreds of grants to researchers outside the country. In 2022–23, the country supplied about 42% of the overall donor-government assistance for global health and about 16% of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) funding. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it bankrolled a fair share of the global public vaccine effort.\n\nAs the current US administration seeks drastic cuts to research funding at home and abroad, the dangers of depending so much on one nation are becoming clear. My own projects are among those at risk.\n\nI am based in Lisbon, where, since 2020, I have been working on preclinical and clinical studies of several cancer therapies in collaboration with US and UK pharmaceutical companies and investigators. Now that our US partners (which were bringing the greatest share) are struggling to secure funds, all these projects are under threat.\n\nA fresh approach is needed to prevent further shocks — changes in governance, wars, natural disasters — from undermining essential global research and education.\n\nTurmoil at US science academy as Trump cuts force layoffs\n\nFor starters, more countries must provide more of the funding. Wealthier nations should increase their share of contributions to WHO initiatives, the success of which they stand to benefit from, such as those on pandemic preparedness. Programmes such as Horizon Europe should allocate resources to multilateral initiatives. Its ‘Cancer Mission’, which involves collaboration with Canada, is an encouraging example. By enabling various research projects on cancer, the programme aims to improve the lives of more than 3 million people by 2030. Future initiatives should include a greater diversity of stakeholders.\n\nLower-income nations, such as Nigeria and South Africa, could be persuaded to contribute more to initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, if they were given influence over how the money is spent. (In October 2024, the United States provided about 36% of the pledges and roughly 33% of the funds allocated to the Global Fund.) In fact, a permanent global research-funding initiative could provide emergency short-term funds to keep collaborations that are disrupted by geopolitical events running.\n\nIn general, those providing the most funds have the greatest influence on priorities and agendas. Decision-making and management that shapes research must instead also be shared more equitably between nations, and research should be evaluated in ways that are not so dependent on one nation.\n\nThe Global Research Council already coordinates transnational funding and policy among dozens of national science-funding agencies, although, as a voluntary organization, it cannot impose standards. Lessons can also be learnt from the European Research Council’s (ERC’s) multilingual grant-review panels, piloted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, reviewers from multiple countries can join meetings remotely. And there is collaboration between a decentralized ethics committee and the ethics committees of individual countries, ensuring that appraisals align with national laws and regulations.\n\nAll this must be underpinned by more-resilient shared databases and research-management platforms.",

          "title": "Smart brain-zapping implants could revolutionize Parkinson’s treatment",
          "authors": "Sally Adee",
          "abstract": "Keith Krehbiel lived with Parkinson’s disease for nearly 25 years before agreeing to try a brain implant that might alleviate his symptoms. He had long been reluctant to submit to the surgery. “It was a big move,” he says. But by 2020, his symptoms had become so severe that he grudgingly agreed to go ahead.\n\nDeep-brain stimulation involves inserting thin wires through two small holes in the skull into a region of the brain associated with movement. The hope is that by delivering electrical pulses to the region, the implant can normalize aberrant brain activity and reduce symptoms. Since the devices were first approved almost three decades ago, some 200,000 people have had them fitted to help calm the tremors and rigidity caused by Parkinson’s disease. But about 40,000 of those who received devices made after 2020 got them with a special feature that has largely not yet been turned on. The devices can read brain waves and then adapt and tailor the rhythm of their output, in much the same way as a pacemaker monitors and corrects the heart’s electrical rhythms, says Helen Bronte-Stewart, a neurologist at Stanford University in California.\n\nBronte-Stewart received approval to start a clinical trial of this new technology, known as adaptive deep-brain stimulation (aDBS), the same week that Krehbiel was preparing for surgery. He recalls the phone call in which she asked him if he wanted to be her first participant: “I said, ‘Boy, do I!’”\n\nBrain drugs can now cross the once impenetrable blood–brain barrier\n\nFive years on, the results of this 68-person trial, called ADAPT-PD, are under review for publication. Although the exact details are still under wraps, they were convincing enough to earn approval for the technology earlier this year from both US and European regulators.\n\nThe results of this study could be a boon for the estimated one million people in the United States and 1.2 million people in Europe who now live with Parkinson’s disease — and for Medtronic, the health-care technology company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that manufactures the implants. The seeming success also clears a path for other companies around the world that are racing for approval on advanced devices, says Martijn Beudel, a neurologist at Amsterdam University Medical Center who worked on the trial.\n\nThe approaching wave of therapies promises to level up DBS for Parkinson’s and other motor conditions. The technology might even help to treat neurological disorders such as Tourette’s syndrome and psychiatric conditions, including obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. Several clinicians suggest that the new technology could have even more profound health implications — that is, if funding for US brain-implant research isn’t cut.\n\nDeep trade-offs\n\nSince DBS was first approved in Europe and the United States in the late-1990s, the vast majority of devices have been given to people with Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s is a progressive disorder, typified by the death of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is key to controlling movements.\n\nExisting drugs that aim to increase dopamine levels can only manage the symptoms. They can’t match the constant dopamine production of a healthy brain. “No matter how clever we are with it, we have never been able to exactly mimic the way the brain supplies it,” says Bronte-Stewart. This means that symptoms vary throughout the day — from the unwanted involuntary movements induced by the morning flood of dopamine-mimicking drugs to increased rigidity later in the day as the drugs wear off. The medication also comes with other side effects that vary from person to person. For Krehbiel, it was nausea so severe he had to lie down multiple times a day.\n\nWhen these become overwhelming, a neurologist might recommend DBS. Implants typically dispense pulses of electrical energy deep into the brain 24 hours a day to regulate aberrant brain signals associated with uncontrollable body movements. Before this year, this always-on approach was the only commercially available form of the therapy.\n\nDeep-brain stimulation has often been considered a treatment of last resort for people with Parkinson’s disease.Credit: Zephyr/Science Photo Library\n\nBut continuous DBS can sometimes amplify the drugs’ effects — or generate new symptoms. Some of these are harmless: one man with OCD developed a passion for the music of Johnny Cash when his stimulator was turned on, but was uninterested in the artist when it was off1. Other symptoms are cause for more concern, including sudden-onset gambling disorders and other temporary changes in impulse control. More frequently, the addition of stimulation can induce speech impairments, such as slurring, raise the risk of falling and cause some involuntary movements.\n\nA clinician can try to balance the system by adjusting the intensity of stimulation, but there are limits to how precisely it can be calibrated.\n\nKrehbiel was aware of these shortcomings, and it contributed to his sense that DBS was a treatment of last resort. In the late 2010s, his neurologist hinted that big improvements were on the way. “So I thought, wait for the new technology.”\n\nCatching waves\n\nBrain-wave activity is different in people with and without Parkinson’s disease. In people with Parkinson’s, there are noticeable differences at one range of frequencies, known as β-oscillations (between about 13 and 30 hertz), in a region deep in the brain called the basal ganglia. This region processes sensorimotor, cognitive and mood information.\n\n‘Big leap’ for Parkinson’s treatment: symptoms improve in stem-cells trials\n\nβ-oscillations have become an important marker of motor state. In the early 2000s, researchers at University College London found increasing evidence that people with Parkinson’s have intense bursts of activity in this range2. When drug treatments are working, these bursts are less exaggerated. The same is true for DBS3. The more that stimulation normalizes β-oscillations, the better the relief of some symptoms, says Bronte-Stewart.\n\nAberrant oscillations were dubbed oscillopathies, and in the 2000s, Medtronic started focusing on developing a device that could both read and correct these rhythms, says Tim Denison, a biomedical engineer at the University of Oxford, UK, who was working at the company at the time. “Just like you can build a radio to tune in to an audio channel, can we build a circuit that will tune in to these oscillopathies and help to guide how to adjust the stimulator?” he asks.\n\nBy 2006, Denison and his colleagues had built a ‘brain radio’, a sensing chip that could tune in to the different frequency bands in which the electrode sits. The next challenge was finding out how changes in particular bands correspond to specific movement problems. That was “a huge part of the first eight to ten years of the research with the investigational hardware”, says Bronte-Stewart. She and other researchers, including Philip Starr at the University of California, San Francisco, used a succession of new prototype devices to map these oscillopathies and adjust to them.\n\nFor example, when β-oscillation intensity begins to dip after a dose of medication, aDBS automatically reduces stimulation, keeping β-power in a healthy range. As the medication wears off, it does the opposite (see ‘Fine-tuned stimulation’). In 2019, Bronte-Stewart developed one of the algorithms that would underpin aDBS. When she tested it on 13 people with Parkinson’s, it improved the halting movements, called bradykinesia, that are associated with the disease4. It also helped to reduce the inability to take steps, known as freezing of gait, in a study last year5. In a separate study, Starr found that aDBS shortened the duration of volunteers’ most bothersome motor disturbances, but without aggravating side effects6.\n\nSource: G. Tinkhause et al. Brain 140, 1053–1067 (2017).\n\nOther studies have suggested that aDBS reduces speech problems, such as slurring, that were another possible side effect of continuous DBS7,8. “It only suppressed the pathological brain activity,” without suppressing normal speech, says Beudel.\n\nSince 2013, small trials such as these have demonstrated these effects in around 400 people, estimates Robert Raike, the director of neuromodulation research and technology at Medtronic. What was missing was a way to validate these findings in real-world settings: in people’s homes and workplaces over a long period of time. Researchers needed a big trial.\n\nA personalized device\n\nAny Medtronic DBS implant manufactured after 2020 has the ability to be switched into adaptive stimulation mode. If people were enrolled in a clinical trial after 2020, their implant’s experimental capabilities could be activated by a firmware update, “a software unlock, like your iPhone”, says Raike. This approach opened up a large pool of possible trial participants. And the capability could be turned back off at the end of the trial.\n\nAfter two months with continuous DBS, Bronte-Stewart unlocked Krehbiel’s device. It continued to keep his tremor at bay. He needed fewer drugs.\n\nOther trial volunteers have reported similar improvements, along with a reduction of symptoms associated with continuous stimulation. Although she is not permitted to discuss the results, which are still pending publication, Bronte-Stewart points to data presented at a 2024 conference9. Of 45 volunteers in the trial who were given the choice to revert to the continuous DBS or to retain the new adaptive functionality for a further long-term follow-up, 44 chose to stay on aDBS, Krehbiel among them. “I would not have considered for more than 30 seconds reverting back,” he says. “I was feeling good and didn’t much care why.”\n\nBeudel saw a broadly similar trend among his participants. “It’s no secret that the results were positive,” he says. “We now see patients from all over the country coming to our centre saying that they want the aDBS.”\n\nBrain stimulation at home helps to treat depression\n\nSince the new system was approved earlier this year, the upgrade has been available to anyone with one of the post-2020 devices. Beyond straightforward symptom relief, these users might see beneficial effects that go beyond controlling motor symptoms.\n\nFor example, Parkinson’s disease notoriously interferes with sleep, and as the medicine wears off at night, problems emerge that range from insomnia to hallucinations. Sleep deprivation, in turn, worsens the symptoms. “It is a vicious circle,” says Beudel.\n\nAdaptive DBS could reduce sleep disturbances by automatically adjusting to the sleep-induced changes in β-oscillations.\n\nAnd better sleep might, in turn, protect the brain. If it does, says Denison, aDBS could shed light on the tantalizing but controversial hypothesis that DBS protects the brain when implanted earlier in Parkinson’s disease progression.",

          "abstract": "Other kids wanted to be scientists. Astronauts. Princesses.\n\nBut I knew, even then. I was going to become the funniest person on Earth. Later, I learnt that there was a word for that, too. A comedian.\n\nAnd still later, I learnt, along with everyone else, that there wasn’t just Earth. Fine. Greatest comedian in the Universe, then.\n\nThere was just one little problem. The Primulans didn’t laugh. As far as anyone could tell, they didn’t even have mouths. When they were amused — which didn’t happen all that often — their eye sacs would vibrate, making a sound like an angry bumblebee.\n\nHalf the time, no one could quite figure out what was making them laugh (well … vibrate), but it seemed to be some blend of irony, brutal honesty and self-deprecation. I had studied all the recordings, and the biggest punchline had been delivered — unknowingly and nervously — by a special envoy addressing a room full of Primulans. He looked tiny in the video, clutching the sides of a massive podium emblazoned with the golden rose of Primula. A slight tremor in his voice, he began his speech with “I am so happy to be here with you”. In the cacophony of vibrations that followed, he looked around, confused, until an assistant had to usher him off stage.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nActually, there was another little problem, too: Primula had started building military vessels. Big ones — no joking matter. Bigger and more advanced than anything we had on Earth, and people were getting nervous.\n\nNo one was quite sure where things had gone wrong, but we all knew it was our fault. Maybe it was when a cruiser full of tourists from Earth had accidentally knocked one of Primula’s halo satellites out of orbit, throwing the planet’s weather systems into chaos for weeks.\n\nOr maybe it had been the diplomatic delegation that came afterwards to offer profuse apologies. It had seemed like a good idea. And maybe it would have worked, except that someone on the delegation hadn’t followed proper quarantine protocols. No one knew exactly what triggered it, but within days, the treasured golden roses of Primula all started to turn black, and hadn’t changed back again.\n\nSubsequent apologies had been beamed to Primula from Earth, but had gone unanswered.\n\nSo, I was as surprised as everyone else when a Primulan emissary arrived out of the blue to deliver a message to the Earth Council; relieved when it wasn’t a declaration of war; and surprised all over again that the Primulans were proposing a cultural summit to promote understanding.\n\nI guess they were right about that. We really didn’t understand each other. Didn’t then. Don’t now. But sometimes you need to give it a try anyway, and I guess that was why I ended up getting the phone call. After all, a shared laugh is the fastest way to bring everyone together, right? Could it work for Primulans, too?\n\nThat had been three weeks ago, and now I was here, clutching the sides of the same podium as that nervous diplomat all those years ago. I looked out at the audience — the left side of the hall entirely occupied by dignitaries from Earth, the right side entirely by Primulans.\n\nI started my routine.\n\nSafe material first — I needed to take my time, build things up bit-by-bit. Sure enough, I was getting polite laughs from the humans, but complete silence from the Primulans. As I continued, the laughs started to fade, grow uneasy — people were nervous that nothing was working for the Primulans. Not a single buzz, not one vibrating eye sac. It was the moment I had been waiting for: no more safe material. I switched to jokes about mouthless aliens, about failed diplomats, about the absurdity of a cultural summit between Primula and Earth.\n\nSilence. Well, not silence exactly. Something more than silence.",

          "abstract": "The US National Institutes of Health, based in Bethesda, Maryland, is the world’s largest funder of biomedical research.Credit: Grandbrothers/Alamy\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will soon disinvite dozens of scientists who were about to take positions on advisory councils that make final decisions on grant applications for the agency, Nature has learnt. NIH staff members have been instructed to nominate replacements who are aligned with the priorities of the administration of US President Donald Trump — and have been warned that political appointees might still override their suggestions and hand-pick alternative reviewers.\n\nWho is on RFK Jr’s new vaccine panel — and what will they do?\n\nThe researchers up for dismissal, who are based at academic institutions across the country, were all nominated during the administration of Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, through a process that has been used for decades, but had not yet taken up their positions. The move will leave advisory councils at most of the NIH’s institutes understaffed and without a breadth of expertise in making final decisions about which research projects the agency funds.\n\nThe move throws away all the effort put into vetting those reviewers, says Eric Green, who was director of the NIH’s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) for more than 15 years, until March, when his tenure was not renewed. The NHGRI had 7 advisory council members vetted under Biden who have been awaiting final approval, Green says. Without them, the institute’s panel will have only 6 out of its potential 18 members. It’s unclear how long it will take to install new members. In the meantime, “to have it be that small is atrocious — you want these advisory groups to be robust because they’re taking the final look at everything going to be funded”, Green adds.\n\nThe NIH — a behemoth of biomedical science funding based in Bethesda, Maryland — and its parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), did not respond to Nature’s queries about the plans to disinvite scientists from advisory panels or to scientists’ concerns about the action. It is unclear when the formal disinvitation notices will be sent.\n\nA rare action\n\nNIH grant applications are considered by each of its institutes in two stages, by separate panels. The first is a study section, in which a group of independent scientists meets to score applications. The second is a gathering of the institute’s advisory council, which is also made up mainly of external researchers and advisers, and does final checks on applications before funding decisions are made.\n\n‘One of the darkest days’: NIH purges agency leadership amid mass layoffs\n\nIt is this second approval stage that is affected by the move.\n\nDozens of scientists nominated in 2023 and 2024 had gone through every step of the vetting process to join the advisory councils at various institutes, and were awaiting final approval from the HHS to begin their service. The removal of members from these panels is extremely rare, let alone removing dozens of pending members at the same time, according to an NIH employee who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n“I was really excited to provide that perspective and voice that is needed as one of the first Native American members on the NHGRI’s council,” says Katrina Claw, a geneticist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, who was nominated in March 2024. Claw says she stepped back from some of her responsibilities at the university in anticipation of the increased time demand that comes with serving as a council member.\n\nNIH staff members will now have to start again from the beginning to find a new slate of nominees, says the employee granted anonymity.\n\nA long vetting process\n\nThe usual process for picking new members is rigorous: administrative staff at each institute spend about two years screening candidates, formally nominating them, seeking approval from the agency and the HHS, shepherding candidates through a series of background and ethics checks and, once they have been confirmed, introducing them to the role. Staff members try to ensure that the composition of review panels reflects the diversity of people in the United States and encompasses an array of expertise, the employee says. “It’s almost like putting together an orchestra.”\n\nNIH chief stands by funding cuts to ‘politicized science’ at tense hearing\n\nWhen it comes to replacing council members, NIH staff members were told to keep administration priorities in mind when selecting new nominees, according to an e-mail obtained by Nature. The e-mail does not explain why the nominees will not move forwards, nor how staff members should comply with the request, leaving some in fear of losing their jobs if they choose incorrectly, says the employee.\n\nNature has learnt that, as a result, some staff members are screening candidates’ social-media presences to check whether they have expressed negative views about the Trump administration or been involved in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts — a topic targeted by the president — at their institutions.",

The microbe stimulates cells in the immune system called dendritic cells, which go on to amplify the effects of cancer drugs that unleash the body’s own defences against tumours.\n\nThe work, published on 14 July in Nature1, is the latest in a wave of increasingly sophisticated studies that are unpicking the relationship between microbes in the body and responses to cancer treatment, says Marlies Meisel, who studies immunology and microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and was not involved in the study. “This is a really valuable reservoir of bacteria,” she says. “These researchers have leveraged a gold mine.”\n\n‘A huge effort’\n\nUntil now, the humble bacterium Hominenteromicrobium mulieris had received little acclaim. Discovered only three years ago, it thrives quietly in the low-oxygen, nutrient-rich environment of the human intestine. Hiroyoshi Nishikawa, an immunologist at the National Cancer Center in Tokyo, and his colleagues came across a new strain of the microbe while analysing faecal samples from 50 people with cancer who had been treated with drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nHow gut bacteria could boost cancer treatments\n\nThese therapies can have remarkable effects, sometimes empowering the immune system to drive advanced cancers into long-lasting remission. But they do so in only a fraction of the people who receive them, and researchers have been searching for a way to broaden the drugs’ reach.\n\nTo learn more about why some people respond to checkpoint inhibitors and others do not, Nishikawa’s team used the faecal samples they had collected from people with cancer and transplanted them into mice with tumours. Mice that received transplants from people who responded well to the checkpoint inhibitor benefited more from this therapy than did mice with transplants from people who did not respond to the drug.\n\nNishikawa decided — naively, he now says — to track down the microorganism in the faecal transplant that was responsible for the difference. It would take his team about a year and a half to pinpoint the microbe that had the biggest effect: a strain of H. mulieris. “I’m an immunologist, not a microbiologist,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take such a huge effort.”\n\nWith that information in hand, the team was able to sort out how H. mulieris improved responses to checkpoint inhibitors. In mice, the microbe stimulates dendritic cells, which can travel through the blood to tumours. There, the dendritic cells activate a subset of other immune cells, called T cells, that can recognize and destroy cancer cells. This heightens the effects of checkpoint inhibitors, which work by unleashing those same tumour-targeting T cells.",

But so do the cost-of-living crisis and deepening inequality; environmental goals are often the first casualty of economic stagnation.\n\nGovernments and businesses should know better. Nature loss, volatile energy prices and air pollution all undermine productivity. Fail to address such issues and the resulting spiral will be vicious. So why is the business case for protecting nature not stronger? Or at least more familiar, made more forcefully, more regularly and by more captains of industry?\n\nWhile working on sustainable-finance projects with governments, banks and other financial institutions, I’ve found many smart, dedicated specialists. But, more widely, a basic grasp of natural capital is still lacking.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nOne reason is that agile global supply chains provide a false sense of security. War in Ukraine? Buy grain from India. Water levels low on the Mississippi River? Ship goods by road. It’s easy to conclude that risks apply only to ‘other’ sectors, such as agriculture, but not to ‘mine’.\n\nAnd some people fail to recognize the essential roles of nature in underpinning businesses. Natural capital provides environmental goods and services — raw materials, climate stability and flood protection. Depleting such assets means losing the economic benefits, too.\n\nBusiness schools must do more to be part of the solution. Climate and biodiversity are increasingly central to business risk and strategy, supply-chain management, regulatory and disclosure requirements, brand management and customer engagement. Bridging the science–business divide — through research, teaching, outreach and engagement — can equip graduates with the skills to create a net-zero, nature-positive economy.\n\nYet much of the talent and expertise found in business schools is rarely shared in mainstream scientific journals. Equally, the journals that determine career progression at these institutions — those ranked highly by the Chartered Association of Business Schools (CABS) or the Financial Times — have been slow to engage with topics such as climate change, biodiversity and infectious diseases.\n\nHere’s what business schools should do.\n\nAcknowledge that science is foundational to sustainability. Teaching and research must be integrated with ecological and planetary-systems sciences. Some of my favourite studies in biodiversity finance use machine-learning tools to link newspaper headlines about biodiversity to investor sentiment and stock-market performance. In others, researchers work with banks to analyse which characteristics of conservation interventions might unlock private finance. More such studies are needed. But responding to headlines is not the same as responding to ecological changes or biodiversity-related risks. And the fact that deals take place does not mean that nature has benefited. Financial researchers need to work with natural scientists to determine real-world outcomes.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them",

          "authors": "Sarah Wild",
          "abstract": "Each week since 1977, researchers at the Portal Project have monitored how rodents, ants and plants interact with each other and respond to their climate on plots of land in Arizona. At first, the team shared those data informally. Then, beginning in the 2000s, the researchers would publish a data paper, wait several years and then publish a new one with combined old and new data to keep the information current.\n\n“Data collection is not a one-time effort,” says Ethan White, an environmental data scientist at the University of Florida in Gainesville, who began collaborating with the project in 2002. New tools have allowed the team to automate and modernize its strategy. In 2019, White and his colleagues developed a data workflow based on the code-sharing site GitHub, the data repository Zenodo and the software automation tool Travis CI, to keep their data current while preserving earlier versions (G. M. Yenni et al. PLoS Biol. 17, e3000125; 2019); so far, the Zenodo repository holds around 620 versions. “We wanted an approach that would let us update things more consistently, but in a way that if someone ever wanted to replicate a past analysis, they could go back and find the precise original data that we used.”\n\nLong-term ecological research is not the only area that needs to maintain and update data for future use. Many researchers add to, revise or overhaul their data sets over the course of their projects or careers, all while continuing to publish articles.\n\nBut despite the need to update and preserve versions of data, there is little guidance for how to do so, says Crystal Lewis, a freelance data-management consultant in St. Louis, Missouri. “There are no standards for repositories; the journals are not telling you how to correct a data set or how to cite new data, so people are just winging it.”\n\nGood data-science practice can make the process more methodical. Here are five tips to help alter and cite data sets.\n\nChoose a repository\n\nAlthough it’s easy to place data on personal websites or in the cloud, using a repository is the simplest way for researchers to store, share and maintain multiple versions of their data, says Kristin Briney, a librarian at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who helps researchers to manage their data. “It’ll get it out of the supplemental information; it’ll stop being shared upon request; it’ll stop being shared on personal websites,” on which it can be lost.\n\nBy the end of this year, US federal funding agencies will require researchers to put data in a repository, with some agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, already implementing the policy. Some journals also require authors to use data repositories. PLoS ONE, for example, recommends several general and subject-specific repositories for its authors, including the Dryad Digital Repository and Open Science Framework.\n\nChallenge to scientists: does your ten-year-old code still run?\n\nA repository, or data archive, is more than just cloud storage. Repositories provide long-term storage with multiple backups. Zenodo, for example, says that data will be maintained as long as Europe’s particle-physics laboratory CERN, which runs the site, continues to exist. Generally, repositories also promise that archived data will remain unaltered and assign a persistent identifier to data sets so that others can find them.\n\nBriney suggests that researchers check whether their funding agency has specific recommendations. There might also be a particular repository for the type of data, such as GenBank for genetic sequences; or a discipline-specific repository for the field of study. Some universities offer institutional options, which usually have the added benefit of technical support. When there is no specific repository available, the non-profit organization the Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, recommends generalist repositories, such as Zenodo, Dataverse, Figshare and Dryad.\n\nCreate multiple versions\n\nFor transparency and accessibility, making a new version when data are added is essential. The alternative — overwriting the old data with the new — makes it impossible to repeat previous analyses or to see how the data have changed over time. Although best practice around creating versions and data alterations tends to focus on future users and scientific reproducibility, the real beneficiary is the researcher, says Lewis. “Three months from now, you will forget what you did — you will forget which version you’re working on, what changes you made to a data set. You are your biggest collaborator.”\n\nThis is when data repositories come into their own, because many create new versions by default when data are added. Some repositories, such as Zenodo, also mint a digital object identifier (DOI) for each version automatically. “Since the very beginning, Zenodo has provided versionable data with individual DOIs that will take you to a specific version of the data, and also an overarching DOI that will link together all of those versions,” says White. That creates an umbrella link, as well as a mechanism to cite specific versions of the data.\n\nManaging versions without a repository is also possible. Researchers who store their data on GitHub, for instance, can use automation to create new ‘releases’ whenever they update their data. They can also create a version of the data set manually, using distinct file names, to differentiate these files from the earlier set, Briney says.\n\nDefine file names and terminology\n\nBriney regularly helps researchers to wrangle their data. Her favourite tips for data management are to establish a file naming convention, which includes the date (often given as YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD), and to store files in their correct folders. This is true whether you’re storing data locally or in remote repositories. “It takes 10 minutes to come up with a file-naming convention, everything gets organized, and that way you can tell related files apart,” she says. “It’s like putting your clothes away at the end of the day.”\n\nBriney also recommends documenting metadata, explaining the different variables used, and the location of data in the various files and folders. These practices “help you, but are also good for data sharing, because somebody else can pick up your spreadsheet” and understand it.\n\nEleven tips for working with large data sets\n\nSabina Leonelli, who studies big-data methods at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, says that researchers should also explicitly document the terminology and queries used to generate and analyse their data. She gives an example of research using a biomedical database: “When you access certain databases, you frame your query” based on current definitions, she says. As knowledge develops, definitions shift and change, and if the specific definitions you used aren’t captured, she says, you might forget the query that originally shaped your data.\n\nWrite a change log",

Air pollution is a risk factor for faster ageing.Credit: Per-Anders Pettersson/Getty\n\nSocial inequality and weak democratic institutions are linked to faster ageing, as are other environmental features such as high levels of air pollution, finds a study spanning four continents1. Education was one of the top factors that protected against faster ageing.\n\nThe study also showed that ageing is accelerated by less-surprising factors such as high blood pressure and heart disease. But the link to social and political influences could help to explain why rates of ageing vary from country to country, the authors say.\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\n“It’s a very important study”, says Claudia Kimie Suemoto, a geriatrician at the University of São Paulo in Brazil who was not involved in the work. “It gives us the global perspective of how these dependent factors shape ageing in different regions of the world.”\n\nPolitical polarization and uncertainty mean that “we are living in a world of despair”, and that ages people, says lead author Agustín Ibañez, who directs the Latin American Brain Health Institute in Santiago. “We don’t think about the health impacts that this is going to have in the long run.”\n\nThe study was published today in Nature Medicine1.\n\nAge gaps\n\nThe study included 161,981 participants from 40 countries: 7 in Latin America, 27 in Europe, 4 in Asia and 2 in Africa. Just the process of harmonizing these data sets — such as checking that variables were measured in similar ways in different countries — took about 3 years, says Ibañez.\n\nThe researchers examined previous research to identify possible factors that hasten or slow ageing and that could be compared across countries. They fed data for these factors into a machine-learning model that predicts a person’s chronological age. That allowed them to calculate each person’s ‘biobehavioural age gap’: the difference between their true chronological age and their age as predicted by the model.\n\nFor example, if you are 50 years old but the model predicts that you are 60 years old, you have a biobehavioural age gap of 10 years.\n\nSchooling protects\n\nThe top medical risk factors for faster ageing were high blood pressure, hearing impairment and heart disease. Other risk factors included unhealthy weight, alcohol consumption, sleep problems, diabetes and impaired vision.\n\nThe factors that provide the best protection against speedy ageing were education, ability to perform activities of daily living and sound cognitive abilities. Other protective factors included physical activity, good memory and the ability to walk well.\n\nAir pollution and brain damage: what the science says\n\nEgypt and South Africa had the fastest ageing, whereas European countries showed the slowest, and nations in Asia and Latin America were in the middle.",

There have been many efforts to validate individual studies and key findings, some with shocking results.\n\nFor example in 2015, it was reported that more than half of 100 psychology studies fail reproducibility tests3, and earlier this year, a coalition of 56 research teams surveyed dozens of Brazilian biomedical studies and could replicate the results of less than half of the tested experiments.\n\nHuge reproducibility project fails to validate dozens of biomedical studies\n\nIn the latest preprints, Hanson, with Bruno Lemaitre, a geneticist who studies fruit-fly immunity at the Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne (EPFL), and their colleagues tried to assess the reproducibility of their entire research field.\n\n“This started with the observation that there was no follow-up of a number of big claims in big papers,” says Lemaitre, who led the study.\n\nThe team looked at 1,006 results from 400 papers published in the field between 1959 and 2011 — up until Jules Hoffmann won a share of the 2011 medicine Nobel prize for work on the Drosophila immune response.\n\nThey then went through the published literature looking for later work that either supported or refuted each claim. Rather than looking for studies that exactly replicated the methods of an experiment behind a result, or reproduced an identical effect, they searched to see if the claims were successfully built on by other studies, were broadly reproduced using more-modern techniques or still stood up to scrutiny now that knowledge of the field has moved on.\n\nUsing their expertise of the field, the researchers classified claims as either verified, unchallenged by other papers, challenged or partly verified.\n\nThey found that 61% of the 1,006 claims were verifiable, whereas only 7% had been challenged and weren’t reproducible.\n\nReplication games: how to make reproducibility research more systematic\n\nOf the 240 claims that had never been independently tested, the team could further categorize a subset of 111 as consistent with current knowledge and 22 as inconsistent with it. They performed experiments to test a further 45 claims, and found 38 of them to be inconsistent with current knowledge. “These were claims that I knew were a bit fragile,” says Lemaitre.",

The research community has long sought such a system to help us understand the humble beginnings of our own. Using both ground- and space-based telescopes, the team zeroed in on the young star HOPS-315, 420 parsecs from Earth, at the start of a most exciting time: its planet-forming era.\n\nThe researchers report their discovery today in Nature1.\n\n“What we’ve been trying to do is find a baby version of our Solar System somewhere else,” says Merel van’t Hoff, an astronomer at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and a co-author of the study.\n\nThe team originally focused its attention on HOPS-315 after detecting crystalline silicate minerals around it — a telltale sign of early planet formation. (Planets form as mineral grains condense and then clump together in the hot disks of gas and dust swirling around newborn stars.)\n\nLocated in the Orion constellation, the baby, or protostar, also stood out because it was oriented such that astronomers could get a glimpse of its surrounding disk of gas and dust. This view is rare because jets of gas emitted by a newborn star, known as outflow, often block the disk, but HOPS-315’s was on full display.\n\nThis video describes how astronomers detected and interpreted chemical signatures from the HOPS-315 system.

They also noticed that the silicate minerals they detected were rich in SiO, and that the midsection of the star’s disk was ultra-hot.\n\nAlongside observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array in Chile, these findings suggest that HOPS-315’s scorching midsection vaporized rock surrounding the star, and that the gas cooled and condensed into planet-forming minerals. “This hot mineral is the first feedstock that you have to start growing things in the disk,” says lead author Melissa McClure, an astronomer at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nFresh insight",

          "abstract": "Roger Deane speaks to early-career astronomers in the digital planetarium at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.Credit: Chanté Schatz/Wits University\nRadioastronomy in Africa\n\nIn 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world’s largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array, the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital-development programme to cultivate the talent needed to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research-chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million).\n\nNow, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and students at universities and institutions in African countries.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to grow Africa’s radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. In the third of a short series of articles investigating the growth of the discipline on the continent, Roger Deane, a SKA research chair at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, talks about what it was like to transition from being a scholarship recipient to becoming the director of the Wits Centre for Astrophysics.\n\nAt the end of my undergraduate degree, I was trying to figure out what to do with my life. I had always wanted to study astronomy, but my parents thought engineering was a better path. (They were hoping that astronomy would be a passing phase.)\n\nThen suddenly, there was this amazing opportunity in astronomy — South Africa was chosen to host part of the SKA. But even as a naive 20-something-year-old, it was clear to me that South Africa had a much bigger plan to grow astronomy on the continent and I wanted to be involved in it. Every child has some innate interest in the cosmos, and radioastronomy investigates some of the Universe’s most exotic phenomena, from black holes to spinning neutron stars and the Big Bang afterglow. When you combine the chance to study this fascinating topic with the largest radio telescopes in the world built by big international teams, what results is a natural magnet for aspiring young minds. There was also this overarching plan to grow radioastronomy in Africa.\n\nI received a South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) scholarship for my master’s in astrophysics and space science at the University of Cape Town (UCT), and then attended the University of Oxford, UK, for my PhD. Next, I had to make a key decision: I could pursue my career abroad or I could go back to South Africa, where it felt like things were happening in the field. I started my first postdoctoral position at UCT in 2012, the same year that it was decided to split the SKA site between South Africa and Australia — and the enthusiasm in South Africa was incredible. When I returned to UCT, the astronomy department had grown threefold since I had left. South Africa had hosted the FIFA Football World Cup two years before and South African researchers really felt as though, with the SKA, we had won the world cup of science. The collective sense of possibility was palpable.\n\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\n\nAfter finishing SARAO-funded postdoctoral studies at the UCT and at Rhodes University, Makhanda, I decided to jump away from the protected postdoc environment where you are attached to more senior people, and establish myself. I was energized by the idea of starting a group and contributing to this bigger picture in which Africa was a hub of astronomy research.\n\nWhen I arrived at the University of Pretoria in 2018 to establish a radioastronomy group, I remember walking down the corridor and thinking, ‘OK, we’ve got to take this from zero to something.’ But I wasn’t really alone as a new group leader — there was this group of senior SARAO staff members who had my back.\n\nKim Anthony, the head of the SARAO human-capital-development programme, is ready to help any of the programme’s members at any hour. This programme supported me again as a professor, and that’s been a real strength.\n\nThere were great students at the University of Pretoria and when I left about two and a half years later, the radioastronomy group had 2 faculty positions and about 20 graduate students. During my time there, we were part of the international Event Horizon Telescope team that produced the first direct image of a black hole, and we worked on brand new data from SKA’s precursor, the 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope, among other research.\n\nRoger Deane (front row, fifth from left) with many of the early-career astronomers he has trained at both the University of Pretoria and the University of the Witwatersrand at the International Astronomical Union general assembly in 2024 in Cape Town, South Africa.

I’ve also lectured in South Africa and Botswana as part of the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy programme, a joint UK–South African project that offers basic astronomy training in eight African countries.",

It aims to prevent babies inheriting harmful mutations from their mother’s mitochondrial DNA, which can cause debilitating diseases affecting power-hungry tissues such as those in the heart, brain and muscles.\n\n“This is a landmark study on preventing mitochondrial disease,” says Dietrich Egli, a stem-cell scientist at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nThe procedure has been dubbed three-person in vitro fertilization (IVF), because the resulting children carry nuclear DNA from a biological mother and father, alongside mitochondrial DNA from a separate egg donor.\n\nRare procedure\n\nThe UK became the first country in the world to explicitly regulate mitochondrial donation in 2015, after more than a decade of research, discussion and debate. Just one UK clinic, the Newcastle Fertility Centre, has been licensed to carry it out by fertility regulator the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).\n\nThe latest studies — published in the New England Journal of Medicine1,2 — are the first detailed reports of the Newcastle team’s efforts. In 2023, the Guardian newspaper revealed that up to five UK children had been born using mitochondrial donation. But there were few details about the children’s health and other questions surrounding the technique’s effectiveness.\n\nFirst UK children born using three-person IVF: what scientists want to know\n\nIn total, 22 women carrying disease-causing mitochondria went through a mitochondrial donation procedure called pronuclear transfer, leading to eight births (including a pair of twins) and one ongoing pregnancy, report reproductive biologist Mary Herbert, now at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and her team.\n\nThe children — four girls and four boys — were all born healthy and are developing normally. The oldest child is now over two years old, the youngest under five months. Five children have had no health problems at all, one experienced muscle jerks that went away on their own, another child was successfully treated for high level of fat in their blood and a heart-rhythm disturbance, a third had fever due to a urinary tract infection.\n\n“We’re cautiously optimistic about these results,” Robert McFarland, a paediatric neurologist at Newcastle University who co-led one of the studies, said at a press briefing. “To see babies born at the end of this is amazing, and to know there’s not going to be mitochondrial disease at the end of that.”\n\nMitochodrial donations have been performed in several other countries without explicit regulation — mostly as a fertility treatment, but, in at least one case, to prevent mitochondrial disease.",

Yet, A Book of Noises by journalist Caspar Henderson reminded me that a great book can also do the opposite. This lyrical exploration of the science of sounds rendered every noise more vivid and worthy of attention.\n\nHenderson traverses vast scales of time and space, demonstrating how all of history is infused with noise — from the ‘groaning’ of some moons as meteors crash into them to the throbbing of veins and cracking of icebergs. The northern lights, we learn, are both visual spectacles and auditory wonders, emitting crackling and sizzling sounds. Even plants can respond to the sound vibrations that nearby animals produce. The buzz of a bee’s wings, for example, can induce nearby suncup flowers to make nectar that has a higher concentration of sugar, to attract pollinators.\n\nIn its scope and passion, this book appeals to readers’ most romantic instincts — reminding us of our entanglement with the cosmos and the organisms that live in it.

With a humorous but critical eye, they run through some of the largest AI claims made in the past few years — and how some collapsed on closer inspection. AI models to predict sepsis, for example, have shown low performance and high false-positive rates.\n\nImparting too much trust in machine-learning models has harmed the health, education and law sectors. Bender and Hanna offer tools to assess hype. Simple questions can reveal flaws in the tools’ promises: who benefits from AI adoption? Who is harmed? What nuance is lost when perusing AI-compiled summaries instead of whole texts?\n\nBender and Hanna warn against anthropomorphizing AI, and show how many seemingly magical AI behaviours, such as creating art, come from copying humans, which has led to lawsuits from artists and film makers. Yet, AI technologies can be powerful for their intended purposes. With careful measurement, evaluation and a focus on capabilities over profit, they can automate mundane, repetitive tasks.

In Sultana’s Dream (1905), writing from the colonial Bengal Presidency, she evokes ‘Ladyland’ — a feminist utopia in which men take on domestic work while women run society, centring innovation around care, community and ecological balance.\n\nHer provocative vision is remarkable considering the structural exclusions she faced. That a Muslim woman in a colonized country conceived of green innovation, universal education and social equity as forms of justice more than a century ago is deeply inspiring. The solar kitchens, electric transport, geoengineering balloons (to harvest water, as a resource and to control rain) and zero-emission agriculture she describes seem fantastical — but they are part of a long-overlooked lineage of feminist techno-visions.\n\nAs a Bangladeshi scholar and feminist scientist, I find this manifesto against the extractivist science and capitalist consumption that are ruining the planet discerning. Sultana’s Dream deserves renewed attention as a creative, radically prescient blueprint from the margins. It shows the futures we might build, if only we choose them. — Farhana Sultana\n\nUnreliable\n\nCsaba Szabo Columbia Univ. Press (2025)\n\nPharmacologist Csaba Szabo is alarmed by the reproducibility crisis in biomedical science. According to reports, attempts to replicate biomedical work succeed in only 10–40% of cases — a dismal statistic. In Unreliable, Szabo guides readers through the issues that have led to this, including methodological flaws, structural problems in science and the hyper-competitive environment for grants. His engaging book is stuffed with facts and evidence.\n\nThe author pays special attention to scientific fraud, both by individuals and in the form of mass-produced fraudulent research churned out by paper mills. Dodgy papers are too often included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which could lead to people receiving ineffective treatments. Pharmaceutical companies, publishers and universities are failing to effectively promote and enforce integrity in science.\n\nBut there are ways to overcome the crisis. Szabo advocates fresh approaches to scientific training that centre collaborative work and emphasize robust and freely available data. He argues for replacing the for-profit publishing industry with data repositories and online information-storage systems, and for transforming systematic reviews, which need post-publication review to ensure lasting quality. His call to arms could not come soon enough. — Anna Abalkina\n\n10 to 25\n\nDavid Yeager Avid Reader Press/Simon & Schuster (2024)\n\nRenowned psychologist and former teacher David Yeager has spent more than a decade identifying adults who excel at helping young people to exceed expectations. These mentors share a common approach, he observes in 10 to 25. Whether they are training surgeons, perfecting elite athletes’ basketball shots or teaching calculus to secondary-school students, they do not just tell young people what to do. Instead, they ensure that young people have the emotional and logistical scaffolding that they need to meet high standards.\n\nYeager points out that these exceptional adults stand apart from many of us, who, despite our best intentions, get it wrong. There is often a mismatch between adolescents’ need, partly neurobiological, for status and respect and the way in which adults view and treat them. ‘Just say no’ campaigns are a classic example, often backfiring because of failed assumptions about youth and an over-reliance on authority.\n\nThrough a skilful synthesis of the science, Yeager frames adolescence not as a problem to be solved, but as something to invest in. This book offers a refreshing take on a transformative stage of life and is a must-read for parents, teachers and anyone who wants to better understand and support young people. — Candice L. Odgers\n\nFire Weather\n\nJohn Vaillant Hachette (2023)\n\nWith a frightening account of a devastating wildfire that ravaged Fort McMurray, an oil town in Canada, in 2016, writer John Vaillant gives us a glimpse of what fire events will be like in our warming planet.\n\nThis gripping tale is reminiscent of a disaster movie in which scientists’ warnings are ignored until it’s too late. Fiction has become reality. The irony at the heart of the Fort McMurray blaze makes the story a powerful one: the same industry that contributed to global warming was brought to a halt by its consequences.\n\nVaillant’s depiction of the fire, which forced more than 90,000 people to evacuate and destroyed thousands of homes, seems apocalyptic — but every detail is true. In the years since, other wildfires just as devastating have unfolded around the world.\n\nVaillant guides readers through fire and climate science. His focus on geology, meteorology and ecology highlights a warning: fire, once a natural part of the Earth system, has become something new. We have reshaped it. Fire Weather isn’t just about one fire. It’s about what the future could look like if we fail to act. Vaillant urges us to ask how this has happened but also what we’re willing to change to prevent it from happening again. — Renata Libonati\n\nAll Things are Full of Gods\n\nDavid Bentley Hart Yale Univ. Press (2024)\n\nFour Greek deities meet in a blooming garden to debate the nature of reality. Hephaistos, the god of artisans, argues that everything that exists is material, and so consciousness is an anomaly that the brain must miraculously produce. Psyche, Eros and Hermes — respectively personifying the principles of life, love and language — counter Hephaistos’ world-view by positing that life, language and the mind cannot be reduced to mechanical material causes.\n\nThis is the premise of All Things are Full of Gods, by philosopher and theologian David Bentley Hart, whose own views align with those of Psyche, Eros and Hermes. By presenting these ideas in the form of a 500-page Platonic dialogue, Hart can examine objections to his thesis through the voice of Hephaistos.\n\nHart even succeeds at enhancing science with theology. An alliance between materialists and atheists has long held sway in science — but the author refutes such doctrines and advocates for a concept of a god as the absolute and transcendent source of human and physical nature.\n\nAll Things are Full of Gods is an intellectual blessing in an age in which it can feel like algorithms threaten our souls. It’s hard going, but worth the effort. The foundations of existence and the mystery of consciousness are at stake. — Àlex Gómez-Marín\n\nThe Pregnancy Police\n\nGrace E. Howard Univ. California Press (2024)\n\nFor far too long, conversations about reproductive health, rights and justice have been reduced to sound bites and clichés. But decision-making in this field is much more complex. Political scientist Grace Howard’s gripping book, The Pregnancy Police, is a must-read for anyone attempting to make sense of our current environment — one in which Adriana Smith, a Black mother who was legally dead, was kept alive for four months to gestate a nine-week-old fetus to comply with Georgia’s anti-abortion law, without her family being consulted.",

          "abstract": "Artist's impression of two black holes merging, which can be detected on Earth through the gravitational waves the collision creates.Credit: Victor de Schwanberg/SPL\n\nPhysicists have detected the biggest ever merger of colliding black holes. The discovery has major implications for researchers’ understanding of how such bodies grow in the Universe.\n\n“It’s super exciting,” says Priyamvada Natarajan, a theoretical astrophysicist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who was not involved in the research. The merger was between black holes with masses too big for physicists to easily explain. “We’re seeing these forbidden high-mass black holes,” she says.\n\nThe discovery was made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), a facility involving two detectors in the United States. It comes at a time when US funding for gravitational-wave detection faces devastating cuts. The results, released as a preprint on the arXiv server1, were presented at the GR-Amaldi gravitational-waves meeting in Glasgow, UK, on 14 July.\n\nForbidden mass\n\nLIGO detects gravitational waves by firing lasers down long, L-shaped arms. Minuscule changes in arm length reveal the passage of gravitational waves through the planet. The waves are ripples in space-time, caused by massive bodies accelerating, such as when two inspiralling black holes or neutron stars merge.\n\nGravitational waves from giant black-hole collision reveal long-sought ‘ringing’\n\nHundreds of these mergers have been observed using gravitational waves since LIGO's first detection in 2015. But this latest detection, made in November 2023, is the biggest yet. By modelling the signal detected by LIGO, scientists have calculated that the event, dubbed GW231123, was caused by two black holes with masses of about 100 and 140 times that of the Sun merging to form a final black hole weighing in at some 225 solar masses.\n\n“It’s the most massive [merger] so far,” says Mark Hannam, a physicist at Cardiff University, UK, and part of the LVK Collaboration, a wider network of gravitational-wave detectors that encompasses LIGO, Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan. It’s “about 50% more than the previous record holder”, he says.\n\nMost of the events captured by LIGO involve stellar-mass black holes — those ranging from a few to 100 times the mass of the Sun — which are thought to form when massive stars end their lives as supernovae. However, the two black holes involved in GW231123 fall in or near a predicted range, of 60–130 solar masses, at which this process isn’t expected to work, with theories instead predicting that the stars should be blown apart. “So they probably didn’t form by this normal mechanism,” says Hannam.\n\nInstead, the two black holes probably formed from earlier merger events — hierarchical mergers of massive bodies that led to the event detected by LIGO, which is estimated to have happened 0.7 billion to 4.1 billion parsecs (2.3 billion to 13.4 billion light years) away.\n\nIt’s like “four grandparents merging into two parents merging into one baby black hole”, says Alan Weinstein, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and also part of the LVK Collaboration.\n\n‘It’s a dream’: JWST spies more black holes than astronomers predicted\n\nModels of the black holes also suggest that they were spinning exceedingly fast — about 40 times per second, which is near the limit of what Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicts black holes can reach while remaining stable. “They’re spinning very close to the maximal spin allowable,” says Weinstein.\n\nBoth the spin and the mass could provide clues to how black holes grow. One of the biggest questions in astronomy is how the largest black holes, the supermassive ones found at the centres of galaxies such as the Milky Way, grew in the early cosmos.\n\nAlthough there is plenty of evidence for the existence of stellar-mass black holes and supermassive black holes — those of more than a million solar masses — intermediate-mass black holes in the range of 100 to 100,000 solar masses have been harder to find. “We don’t see them,” says Natarajan.",

          "authors": "Brian M. Lucey, Andrew Urquhart, Samuel A. Vigne",
          "abstract": "Financial models can fail when unprecedented events hit.Credit: Getty\n\nAmid wars, political earthquakes, the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accelerating effects of climate change, the future seems more unpredictable than ever. That is true even though our ability to predict it — using simulations, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data — has never been so great.\n\nBut could part of the problem be part of the solution? Financial markets have developed ways to hedge against risks, to keep the global economy stable. Insurers foresee and cover costs of rare events, such as natural disasters. But risk tools fail when uncertainties get so great that no predictions can hold.\n\nWe argue that a fresh set of financial tools must be designed to hedge against uncertainty. It’s crucial if the world’s systems are to bear the brunt of unexpected crises in the future. And we set out pointers here.\n\nBut, to understand this problem, a crucial distinction needs to be grasped: the difference between risk and uncertainty. This isn’t just academic hair-splitting — it shapes how society tackles challenges ranging from climate change to AI to the future of the planet.\n\nManaging risk\n\nIn 1921, economist Frank Knight made an observation that would transform how people think about the unknown. Risk, he suggested, is quantifiable. It is like a game of dice, in which we can calculate the exact probability of rolling a six.\n\nWhy probability probably doesn’t exist (but it is useful to act like it does)\n\nProbability tools have been developed to analyse risk. Actuaries, insurers and sports bookmakers all work with them. As long as these professionals have a reasonable forecast, based on historical data, of how likely something is to happen, they can make an informed decision on whether to put aside money to cover the event or not.\n\nFinancial markets also have sophisticated tools to handle risk. The Black–Scholes model for pricing stock options1, for instance, is based on analyses of historical risk. Banks use ‘value at risk’ models to estimate their potential losses with statistical confidence2.\n\nInsurance companies increasingly use climate models to factor in how global warming will affect their bottom line, even in conditions that are unprecedented. For example, by 2030, more than 500,000 homes in Australia, out of 3 million at risk, might face annual flood threats so high that they become uninsurable3.\n\nBut it’s not always possible to calculate the odds. And that’s where uncertainty steps in. Some events have elements of both risk and uncertainty. For example, an earthquake, pandemic or flood might be known to happen once a decade or once a century on average. But it’s impossible to predict precisely when, where and how bad it will be.\n\nAt other times, outcomes are impossible to foresee. For example, researchers can speculate on the range of disruption AI might cause to industry sectors, but they cannot pin down the likelihoods in a meaningful way. Such events are ‘known unknowns’, in that scientists are aware of them but it is impossible to fully encapsulate them.\n\nTrain passengers were stranded when a massive power cut hit Spain in April.Credit: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty\n\nCompanies struggle to hedge against truly uncertain events. Businesses can find their factories destroyed by war, industries might be undercut by AI or changes in immigration policy could affect labour forces. Ultimately, these unforeseen events lead to financial losses, and fresh approaches to cushion these losses are sorely needed.\n\nNo current trading instruments enable us to tame uncertainty. The Cboe Volatility Index (see go.nature.com/4l6zau4), for instance, often called the ‘fear index’, measures asset-price volatility, which is a quantifiable risk. Catastrophe bonds4 pay out to insurers when unexpected but predictable events, such as hurricanes, happen. But they don’t cover unpredictable events.\n\nGrowing uncertainty\n\nUncertainty seems to be on the rise. Society has never before witnessed conditions like those now emerging. Researchers lack adequate models of how society, the environment and cutting-edge technologies work, in isolation or together.\n\nClimate change, for example, presents a parade of unknowns. How will shifting weather affect agriculture? How will coastal cities adapt to rising seas? What industries will emerge or vanish in a zero-carbon economy? The variables interact in ways too complex for conventional risk models to capture.\n\nHurricane risk in a changing climate — the role of uncertainty\n\nSimilarly, AI introduces more uncertainties. How will it reshape education, jobs and creative work? What will be the role of humans if AI exceeds our capabilities? What forms of cyber vulnerabilities might emerge? People have no idea how humans and machines will or even can co-evolve.\n\nPolitical and economic uncertainty is also soaring. Conventional models struggle to account for the impact of social media on political movements, the fragmentation of global trade networks or the emergence of digital currencies. We’re no longer just dealing with known unknowns, but are in the dead space of unknown unknowns.\n\nFinancial norms are shifting\n\nThe everyday workings of the financial sector are much more uncertain today than they were even a year ago. Basic assumptions no longer hold. For example, since US President Donald Trump took office in January, the role of US government debt as a fundamental, safe macroeconomic benchmark has been challenged.\n\nThe value of a financial asset is usually set using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)5. But this model is designed to always grant an investor a pay-off in relation to the risk of the asset itself — the riskier the stock you invest in, the higher the return you should receive.\n\nUsing the CAPM, the minimum level of return has been tacitly agreed to be that of a short-dated investment called a US government treasury bill — essentially a loan from an investor that the treasury promises to repay. Before January, this instrument was seen as ‘risk free’ — there was almost no chance of the US treasury being unable to pay back the monies borrowed in 90 or 180 days. But uncertainty around the US economy means that capital is draining from the United States to Europe because global investors no longer think that US debt is the least risky investment in the world.\n\nAs well as devaluing the dollar and moving to a tariff-based trading world, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Accord proposes levying a charge on foreign owners of US debt and dictating repayment terms of 100 years. If that happened, it would render US treasury bills financially worthless to investors. Investors from different countries might value US investments differently from each other, because each would rely on their own understanding of the risk of holding US debt6. The CAPM would no longer apply.\n\nWhen there is uncertainty, but no way to price it, the danger of catastrophic falls in asset values is there but cannot be computed. Investors will move to assets with lower degrees of uncertainty6 and interest rates will come under strain.\n\nA devastating earthquake in Myanmar killed thousands of people in March.Credit: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty\n\nTechnology offers some ways to assess uncertainty. By harnessing computing power and AI, scientists can scan millions of news articles, political speeches, social-media posts and financial reports for words, sentiments and tones that are associated with uncertainty7. Such analyses have been used to develop real-time measures of economic and cryptocurrency pricing and policy uncertainty8,9. Central banks also scrape product-price information from the Internet to give real-time inflation measures (see go.nature.com/4ll5cew).\n\nYet, like conventional risk models, these big-data tools are subject to the ‘garbage in, garbage out’ problem. They depend on human inputs and can add yet more uncertainty, rather than measure it.\n\nFinance experts need to think more radically.\n\nThree pricing tools\n\nTransforming uncertainty into something that can be managed requires building a financial architecture that explicitly prices, transfers and rewards adaptive capacity — the ability to thrive under the challenges of uncertainty — rather than merely dealing with known risks.\n\nThe approach we propose rests on three pillars: instruments in which prices and pay-offs vary with real-time uncertainty; markets that monetize resilience; and governance frameworks that ensure integrity and liquidity (ease of transferring an asset to cash). Here we sketch potential features of some assets that might be developed.\n\nUncertainty bonds. Many organizations issue debt (essentially a loan) with an interest rate that varies relative to a benchmark, such as another interest rate, inflation or profitability. We propose that uncertainty bonds fix their payout on the basis of an independently governed and calculated uncertainty index.\n\nThe index would need to capture elements such as policy volatility, market sentiment swings and supply-chain disruption signals. It must have strict safeguards, including governance by independent regulators, regular data audits and transparent methodologies to prevent financial gaming.\n\nWhen uncertainty (economic, trade or geopolitical, for example) is deemed high, companies would be able to withhold part of the payments they have promised, to ease financial strain. They would also have more money at hand to deal with issues arising during spikes in uncertainty.\n\nInvestors (banks, insurers or private individuals) would earn a premium for bearing the ambiguity; they would put their money at risk by loaning it to companies, with the payout dependent on the level of global uncertainty.\n\nHow to navigate uncertainty in an unpredictable world\n\nAlthough this arrangement would not eliminate uncertainty, it would transform it into risk: a quantifiable situation in which companies insure themselves by getting a financial reward if a specific negative event occurs.\n\nThink of it like insuring a home against fire damage: the fire is a spike in global uncertainty, the bond-issuing company is the owner of the house and the investor is the insurance company that insures the house. If there is no fire, the owner of the house pays an insurance premium to the insurance company for peace of mind. If, however, a fire burns down the house, the owner of the house delegates the financial burden of reconstruction to the insurance company, so that the owner doesn’t go bankrupt on top of losing their house.",

The premier scientific society announced today that Neil Shubin, a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago in Illinois and an NAS member, has been nominated to take the job when the final term of current president Marcia McNutt ends on 30 June 2026.\n\nIf the decision is ratified by NAS members later this year, Shubin will also replace McNutt as chair of the financially strapped National Research Council (NRC), the publications and operating arm of the NAS and its fellow academies of engineering and medicine.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has cancelled dozens of contracts for the NRC’s signature reports, which are written by academy members and other scientists to provide scientific advice to US government agencies and private clients. The NRC has laid off 50–100 staff members since the beginning of the year, and hundreds more lay-offs are expected.\n\nTumultuous times\n\nMcNutt, a geologist, has been at the NAS since 2016 and has had a long career heading a variety of high-profile science organizations. She was director of the US Geological Survey from 2009 to 2013 and editor-in-chief of Science from 2013 to 2016.\n\nMany members of the academies were critical of McNutt’s response to the Trump administration’s attacks on science, and some discussed holding a vote of no confidence. McNutt responded to the criticisms by acknowledging the “Faustian dilemma” and arguing that she does not want to put the academies “out of business”.\n\nA spokesperson for the NAS did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nShubin routinely posts on social media about the value of basic science. “The NAS, like my social media feed, is non-partisan but is a strong advocate for the value of science in informing public policy,” he said in an e-mail to Nature. “It’s not political to state the fact that investments in science enhance our well-being, expand our knowledge of the world, and drive economic growth.”",

          "title": "China’s shift towards ‘organized research’: how can coordination and innovation co-exist?",
          "authors": "Shuangmiao Han, Jing Xie",
          "abstract": "In the past two decades, China has made big advances in scientific research, and its rise to the top of the 2025 Nature Index tables highlights this shift (see go.nature.com/45vf99n). According to these metrics, which track and fairly compare each country’s contributions to research articles in top journals, China has surpassed the United States in producing high-quality natural-sciences research (see ‘High-impact research’).\n\nEven so, Chinese research faces big challenges. For example, the country still struggles to deliver groundbreaking discoveries and convert its research into commercial successes. The commercialization rate of Chinese university patents has remained below 5%. In the United States, the average annual patent transfer ratio is greater than 54%1. Several Chinese companies also continue to rely on imported technologies, particularly from the United States.\n\nThis innovation bottleneck is compounded by global trends: the COVID-19 pandemic, rising protectionism in trade and escalating US–China technological tensions, which have disrupted international cooperation and deepened the need for domestic technological independence. As global dynamics shift and the push to ‘decouple’ the United States from China intensifies2, the country now faces the urgent task of building greater scientific self-reliance.\n\nChina can build on advances it has made since 2022, when it shifted its science policy towards an ‘organized research’ model — emphasizing mission-driven science, nationwide resource mobilization and cross-institutional collaboration. By forming task-focused teams and tackling urgent challenges at the frontiers of science and economic needs, the policy seeks to drive scientific breakthroughs in areas that are crucial to the country’s strategic priorities, such as artificial intelligence (AI), renewable energy, biomedicine and fundamental science.\n\nHere, we outline the shifts in policy, explore the challenges and suggest ways to find a balance between pursuing collective national goals and fostering individual scientific creativity.\n\nBig science era\n\nModern science is deeply influenced by social, political and institutional factors. Changes under way in China include the following.\n\nHow science is organized. In 2023, China established the Central Science and Technology Commission to reinforce the Communist Party’s leadership over the country’s scientific and technological agenda. The commission is tasked with coordinating the development of ‘strategic science’ — research aligned with national priorities and long-term goals.\n\nAt the national level, more than 300 state key laboratories (SKLs) — the country’s top research centres — have been restructured since 2022 to promote cross-institutional collaboration. For example, the SKL for Photovoltaic Science and Technology was restructured around a partnership between photovoltaics company Trina Solar in Changzhou and Fudan University in Shanghai. This collaboration aims to harness the complementary strengths of academia and industry to drive innovation in solar technology.\n\nAt the institutional level, universities are building new research platforms. For example, last year, China Pharmaceutical University in Nanjing launched its Intelligent Pharmacy Institute, bringing together AI and drug discovery under a unified, centralized framework. By consolidating funding, personnel and interdisciplinary expertise, the institute seeks to streamline AI-driven pharmaceutical research. It also collaborates closely with leading pharmaceutical companies through initiatives such as the Intelligent Pharmacy Education–Industry Alliance to address real-world industrial challenges.\n\nHow resources are mobilized. Big science projects, which need massive resources, go beyond the capacity of a single institution or small research team. In 2024, to better channel resources and align research with pressing national priorities, China shifted the responsibility for key research and development programmes from the Ministry of Science and Technology to sector-specific government agencies, such as the Ministry of Water Resources. To boost China’s participation in international big-science initiatives, the latest key project for Intergovernmental International Cooperation on Science and Technology Innovation was launched in May. It aims to fund around 169 collaborative projects with a total budget of approximately 304 million yuan (US$42.4 million).\n\nRobotics is one of the Communist Party of China’s priority areas for research, along with artificial intelligence and biomedicine.Credit: Du Zixuan/Xinhua/eyevine\n\nBy contrast, individual researchers are facing tighter competition and fewer resources. The General Programs of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) — a major funding source for individual scientists — saw average grant sizes decline by 8.1% between 2022 and 2024, while applications surged by 53%, signalling increasingly limited funding opportunities for independent research3,4.\n\nHow scientists are evaluated. Appraisal and evaluation systems are being reshaped. Technology transfer and real-world impact are gaining more influence in how science and scientists are assessed. For instance, the updated Interim Measures for the Administration of the National Key R&D Program, issued last year, places greater emphasis on research outcomes than it does on academic publications, with a particular focus on how breakthroughs can translate into practical applications.\n\nResearchers in China are now encouraged to embody the ideal of Ding Tian Li Di scientists. Ding Tian — ‘reaching the sky’ — represents the pursuit of cutting-edge research, and Li Di — ‘standing on the ground’ — emphasizes serving national priorities and delivering tangible societal impact. This slogan encapsulates China’s broader shift in research evaluation: scientists are expected to excel not only in academic prestige but also in addressing real-world challenges and contributing to national competitiveness.\n\nEmerging concerns\n\nAlthough success will surely follow, we identify three challenges faced by the organized-research policy that might prevent China from achieving all its desired goals.\n\nFirst, Chinese universities remain organized mainly around conventional academic disciplines, with government resources allocated to specific departments. However, this structure is often ill-suited to addressing complex national priorities — such as achieving carbon neutrality — that demand coordinated efforts across disciplines, such as energy systems, chemistry, environmental science and management.\n\nIn response, research units and interdisciplinary platforms have begun to emerge. Yet, these often remain entangled with existing discipline-based structures. For example, the Institute of Carbon Neutrality at Peking University in Beijing, established in 2023, significantly overlaps with conventional departments: 113 of its researchers hold dual appointments with their original academic institutions. This dual affiliation creates competition for faculty members’ time and research funding, limiting the institute’s ability to function as an independent driver of interdisciplinary research.\n\nFurthermore, structural barriers persist. Faculty members must still declare a disciplinary affiliation when applying for grants and promotions, and their work is typically evaluated by their peers from the same field. As a result, there is little institutional incentive to engage in cross-disciplinary or cross-unit collaboration.\n\nSecond, the way in which the Chinese government is organizing research and allocating resources might draw scientists into a narrow set of fields, which could discourage grassroots innovation and limit academic freedom. One indicator of this is the shrinking share of General Programs in the NSFC budget — these programmes, known for their broad scope and investigator-driven nature, accounted for only 31.5% of total funding in 2023, down from 51.0% in 2013. This trend suggests growing challenges for researchers seeking support for self-directed, curiosity-driven research.\n\nChinese universities rely on strategic collaborations with industry to expand battery research.Credit: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nAlthough the mission-oriented model can mobilize national capacity for targeted goals, it risks producing scientific uniformity and undermining small-scale research efforts, which some studies suggest are more productive5 and more likely to yield original or disruptive discoveries6.\n\nAnother risk lies in the volatility of government priorities. When state support is withdrawn, entire research areas can stagnate. A historical example is the termination of the US Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) project in 1993 owing to budget overruns, management challenges and waning political support. The SSC had aimed to discover the Higgs boson — an achievement ultimately realized by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, in 2012. The SSC’s cancellation serves as a cautionary tale of how shifts in political will can derail long-term scientific efforts, regardless of their potential.\n\nThird, large-team, heavily funded ‘big science’ tends to concentrate decision-making and resources to a small group of leading scientists. Marginalized or less established researchers might have limited opportunities to contribute meaningfully to big projects. And even if they do participate, problems might arise with sharing awards, honours and resources equitably.\n\nA path forward\n\nHere, we propose a few suggestions to mitigate these challenges.",

          "title": "The breakthrough proof bringing mathematics closer to a grand unified theory",
          "authors": "Ananyo Bhattacharya",
          "abstract": "One of the biggest stories in science is quietly playing out in the world of abstract mathematics. Over the course of last year, researchers fulfilled a decades-old dream when they unveiled a proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture — a key piece of a group of interconnected problems called the Langlands programme. The proof — a gargantuan effort — validates the intricate and far-reaching Langlands programme, which is often hailed as the grand unified theory of mathematics but remains largely unproven. Yet the work’s true impact might lie not in what it settles, but in the new avenues of inquiry it reveals.\n\n“It’s a huge triumph. But rather than closing a door, this proof throws open a dozen others,” says David Ben-Zvi at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved with the work.\n\n‘Mind blowing’: quantum computer untangles the mathematics of knots\n\nProving the geometric Langlands conjecture has long been considered one of the deepest and most enigmatic pursuits in modern mathematics. Ultimately, it took a team of nine mathematicians to crack the problem, in a series of five papers spanning almost 1,000 pages1–5. The group was led by Dennis Gaitsgory at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, and Sam Raskin at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who completed his PhD with Gaitsgory in 2014.\n\nThe magnitude of their accomplishment was quickly recognized by the mathematical community: in April, Gaitsgory received the US$3-million Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics, and Raskin was awarded a New Horizons prize for promising early-career mathematicians. Like many landmark results in mathematics, the proof promises to forge bridges between different areas, allowing the tools of one domain to tackle intractable problems in another. All told, it’s a heady time for researchers in these fields.\n\n“It gives us the strongest evidence yet that something we’ve believed in for decades is true,” says Ben-Zvi. “Now we can finally ask: what does it really mean?”\n\nThe hole story\n\nThe Langlands programme traces its origins back 60 years, to the work of a young Canadian mathematician named Robert Langlands, who set out his vision in a handwritten letter to the leading mathematician André Weil. Over the decades, the programme attracted increasing attention from mathematicians, who marvelled at how all-encompassing it was. It was that feature that led Edward Frenkel at the University of California, Berkeley, who has made key contributions to the geometric side, to call it the grand unified theory of mathematics.\n\nLanglands’ aim was to connect two very separate major branches of mathematics — number theory (the study of integers) and harmonic analysis (the study of how complicated signals or functions break down into simple waves). A special case of the Langlands programme is the epic proof that Andrew Wiles published, in 1995, of Fermat’s last theorem — that no three positive integers a, b and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn if n is an integer greater than 2.\n\nRobert Langlands discussed his ideas in a letter to André Weil in 1967. On the cover page to the letter (left), Langlands says, “If you are willing to read it as pure speculation I would appreciate that; if not — I am sure you have a waste basket handy.”Credit: Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton, N.J.) Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center\n\nThe geometric Langlands conjecture was first developed in the 1980s by Vladimir Drinfeld, then at the B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Like the original or arithmetic form of the Langlands conjecture, the geometric conjecture also makes a type of connection: it suggests a correspondence between two different sets of mathematical objects. Although the fields linked by the arithmetic form of Langlands are separate mathematical ‘worlds’, the differences between the two sides of the geometric conjecture are not so pronounced. Both concern properties of Riemann surfaces, which are ‘complex manifolds’ — structures with coordinates that are complex numbers (with real and imaginary parts). These manifolds can take the form of spheres, doughnuts or pretzel-like shapes with two or more holes.\n\nMany mathematicians strongly suspect that the ‘closeness’ of the two sides means the proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture could eventually offer some traction for furthering the arithmetic version, in which the relationships are more mysterious. “To truly understand the Langlands correspondence, we have to realize that the ‘two worlds’ in it are not that different — rather, they are two facets of one and the same world,” says Frenkel. “Seeing this unity requires a new vision, a new understanding. We are still far from it in the original formulation. But the fact that, for Riemann surfaces, the two worlds sort of coalesce means that we are getting closer to finding this secret unity underlying the whole programme,” he adds.\n\nObesity-drug pioneers and 13,508 physicists win US$3-million Breakthrough Prizes\n\nOne side of the geometric Langlands conjecture concerns a characteristic called a fundamental group. In basic terms, the fundamental group of a Riemann surface describes all the distinct ways in which loops can be tied around it. With a doughnut, for example, a loop can run horizontally around the outer edge or vertically through the hole and around the outside. The geometric Langlands deals with the ‘representation’ of a surface’s fundamental group, which expresses the group’s properties as matrices (grids of numbers).\n\nThe other side of the geometric Langlands programme has to do with special kinds of ‘sheaves’. These tools of algebraic geometry are rules that allot ‘vector spaces’ (where vectors — arrows — can be added and multiplied) to points on a manifold in much the same way as a function describing a gravitational field, say, can assign numbers for the strength of the field to points in standard 3D space.\n\nBridgework in progress\n\nWork on bridging this divide began back in the 1990s. Using earlier work on Kac–Moody algebras, which ‘translate’ between representations and sheaves, Drinfeld and Alexander Beilinson, both now at the University of Chicago, Illinois, described how to build the right kind of sheaves to make the connection. Their paper (see go.nature.com/4ndp5ev), nearly 400 pages long, has never been formally published. Gaitsgory, together with Dima Arinkin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, made this relationship more precise in 20126; then, working alone, Gaitsgory followed up with a step-by-step outline of how the geometric Langlands might be proved7.\n\n“The conjecture as such sounds pretty baroque — and not just to outsiders,” says Ben-Zvi. “I think people are much more excited about the proof of geometric Langlands now than they would have been a decade ago, because we understand better why it’s the right kind of question to ask, and why it might be useful for things in number theory.”\n\nOne of the most immediate consequences of the new proof is the boost it provides to research on ‘local’ versions of the different Langlands conjectures, which ‘zoom in’ on particular objects in the ‘global’ settings. In the case of the geometric Langlands programme, for example, the local version is concerned with the properties of objects associated with discs around points on a Riemann surface — rather than the whole manifold, which is the domain of the ‘global’ version.\n\nRobert Langlands in 2016.Credit: Dan Komoda, Institute for Advanced Study\n\nPeter Scholze, at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, has been instrumental in forging connections between the local and global Langlands programmes. But initially, even he was daunted by the geometric side.\n\n“To tell the truth,” Scholze says, “until around 2014, the geometric Langlands programme looked incomprehensible to me.” That changed when Laurent Fargues at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris proposed a reimagining of the local arithmetic Langlands conjectures in geometrical terms8. Working together, Scholze and Fargues spent seven years showing that this strategy could help to make progress on proving a version of the local arithmetic Langlands conjecture9 concerning the p-adic numbers, which involve the primes and their powers. They connected it to the global geometric version that the team led by Gaitsgory and Raskin later proved.\n\nThe papers by Scholze and Fargues built what Scholze describes as a “wormhole” between the two areas, allowing methods and structures from the global geometric Langlands programme to be imported into the local arithmetic context. “So I’m really happy about the proof,” Scholze says. “I think it’s a tremendous achievement and am mining it for parts.”\n\nQuantum connection\n\nAccording to some researchers, one of the most surprising bridges that the geometric Langlands programme has built is to theoretical physics. Since the 1970s, physicists have explored a quantum analogue of a classical symmetry: that swapping electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations, which describe how the two fields interact, leaves the equations unchanged. This elegant symmetry underpins a broader idea in quantum field theory, known as S-duality.\n\n‘Grand unified theory of maths’ nets Abel Prize\n\nIn 2007, Edward Witten at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, and Anton Kapustin at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena were able to show10 that S-duality in certain four-dimensional gauge theories — a class of theories that includes the standard model of particle physics — possesses the same symmetry that appears in the geometric Langlands correspondence. “Seemingly esoteric notions of the geometric Langlands program,” the pair wrote, “arise naturally from the physics.”\n\nAlthough their theories include hypothetical particles, called superpartners, that have never been observed, their insight suggests that geometric Langlands is not just a rarefied idea in pure mathematics; instead, it can be seen as a shadow of a deep symmetry in quantum physics. “I do think it is fascinating that the Langlands programme has this counterpart in quantum field theory,” says Witten. “And I think this might eventually be important in the mathematical development of the Langlands programme.”\n\nAmong the first to take that possibility seriously was Minhyong Kim, director of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, UK. “Even simple-sounding problems in number theory — like Fermat’s last theorem — are hard,” he says. One way to make headway is by using ideas from physics, like those in Witten and Kapustin’s work, as a sort of metaphor for number-theoretic problems, such as the arithmetic Langlands conjecture. Kim is working on making these metaphors more rigorous. “I take various constructions in quantum field theory and try to cook up precise number-theoretic analogues,” he says.\n\nSam Raskin (left) and Dennis Gaitsgory led the team that proved the geometric Langlands conjecture.Credit: Dan Renzetti/Yale University, Lester Cohen/Getty Images for Breakthrough Prize",

Credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty\n\nExcitement is growing among researchers about another powerful artificial intelligence (AI) model to emerge from China, after DeepSeek shocked the world with its launch of R1 in January.\n\nThe performance of Kimi K2, launched on 11 July by Beijing-based company Moonshot AI, matches or surpasses that of Western rivals, as well as some DeepSeek models, across various benchmarks, according to the firm. In particular, it seems to excel at coding and scoring high in tests such as LiveCodeBench.\n\nScientists flock to DeepSeek: how they’re using the blockbuster AI model\n\nAs with DeepSeek’s models, Kimi K2 is open-weight, meaning it can be downloaded and built upon by researchers for free. It can be accessed through an application programming interface (API) for a fraction of the price of leading proprietary models, such as Claude 4 from Anthropic, based in San Francisco, California.\n\n“The community can freely use it, fine-tune it and build on it without training their own model from scratch,” says Adina Yakefu, an AI researcher at the open-science platform Hugging Face, based in New York City. Just one day after its launch, Kimi K2 was downloaded at a rate higher than any other model on the platform, Hugging Face data show. Its release is “another ‘DeepSeek moment’”, Yakefu says.\n\nUnlike many other powerful models, K2 is not a ‘reasoner’ — a model trained to approach queries using step-by-step logic. Instead, it specializes in being an agentic large language model (LLM), meaning that it promises to carry out multi-step tasks using a variety of tools, such as browsing the web or calling on mathematics software. Some models, including some versions of ChatGPT, can already do this, but they are proprietary. AI researchers are still checking whether they can replicate examples of agentic behaviour that Moonshot AI says Kimi K2 can do.\n\nThe next top model\n\nHaving a second impressive model emerge from China in six months suggests that the feat was not an anomaly. “The DeepSeek R1 release earlier this year was more of a prequel than a one-off fluke in the trajectory of AI,” wrote Nathan Lambert, a machine-learning researcher at the Allen Institute for AI, based in Seattle, Washington, in his newsletter, Interconnects. Kimi K2 is “the new best open model in the world”, he posted on the social-media site Bluesky.\n\nMoonshot AI, founded in March 2023, is a start-up organization that, until now, has been little known in the West. But its Kimi chatbot, based on a previous LLM, was already the third-most-used in China in November 2024, according to Counterpoint, a marketing-research firm based in Hong Kong. Chinese technology giants Alibaba and Tencent are reportedly among its investors.\n\nNEWS 10 July 2025 OpenAI’s o3 tops new AI league table for answering scientific questions",

Credit: Artem Cherednik/iStock via Getty\n\nData from five large open-access health databases are being used to generate thousands of poor-quality, formulaic papers, an analysis has found. Its authors say that the surge in publications could indicate the exploitation of these databases by people using large language models (LLMs) to mass-produce scholarly articles, or even by paper mills — companies that churn out papers to order.\n\nAI linked to explosion of low-quality biomedical research papers\n\nThe findings, posted as a preprint on medRxiv on 9 July1, follow an earlier study2 that highlighted an explosion of such papers that used data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The latest analysis flags a rising number of studies featuring data from other large health databases, including the UK Biobank and the US Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which documents the side effects of drugs.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2024, the number of papers using data from these databases rose from around 4,000 to 11,500 — around 5,000 more papers than expected on the basis of previous publication trends.\n\nThe study’s authors warn that a large number of these papers — many of which have repetitive, template-like titles — are likely to be of low quality and could flood the scientific literature. Their analysis is intended as “an early warning system … so that peer reviewers, editors and researchers can understand where the vulnerabilities in the system lie”, says co-author Matt Spick, a biomedical scientist at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK.\n\nUnexpected growth\n\nSpick and his colleagues analysed changes in publication counts, title wording and author affiliations for papers that were based on data from 34 open-access health databases. The team used an algorithm to predict the growth in the numbers of papers expected for each data set from 2014 to 2024 — a period during which text-generating LLM tools such as ChatGPT and Gemini became mainstream.\n\nBiomedical paper retractions have quadrupled in 20 years — why?\n\nWhen they compared their predictions with actual publication rates, the researchers identified six data sets that had significantly exceeded the growth rates predicted by the algorithm. All but one also showed a rise in the number of papers with ‘template-like’ titles. These data sets were NHANES, UK Biobank, FAERS, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and the Finnish genetic database FinnGen. By 2024, the number of papers using FinnGen data grew by nearly 15 times from 2021, for example, while those using FAERS increased by nearly 4 times and UK Biobank by 2.4 times over the same period.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered some dubious papers, which often linked complex health conditions to a single variable. One paper used Mendelian randomization — a technique that helps to determine whether a particular health risk factor causes a disease — to study whether drinking semi-skimmed milk could protect against depression, whereas another looked into how education levels affect someone’s chances of developing a hernia after surgery.\n\n“A lot of those findings might be unsafe, and yet they’re also accessible to the public, and that really worries me,” says Spick.",

          "title": "How your research can survive a US federal grant termination",
          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "Seven weeks after being awarded a US$12.9-million grant to assess dementia risks in vulnerable populations, Briana Mezuk received an e-mail informing her that it was being terminated.\n\nMezuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, had honed her federal grant application over two years to take advantage of the National Survey of American Life — a seminal study of 7,000 participants that examined racial, ethnic and cultural influences on mental health1. Started by Mezuk’s mentor, James S. Jackson, a former director of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, it is the only nationally representative sample of the mental health of Black Americans, who are twice as likely as their white counterparts to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Mezuk planned to follow up with those participants 25 years after the first interviews took place and examine how their life experiences and mental health had contributed to their dementia risk.\n\nThe five-year grant was awarded on 1 February by the National Institute on Aging, a division of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), based in Bethesda, Maryland. But on 21 March, it fell foul of the disdain that the administration of US President Donald Trump has expressed for projects including the terms diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\nHarvard researchers devastated as Trump team cuts nearly 1,000 grants\n\nAccording to Grant Watch, a database tracking terminated grants from the NIH and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) — the country’s independent federal science-funding agency — more than 4,500 NIH grants awarded to US institutions have been terminated, representing some $6.1 billion of lost funding. And according to its 27 May account, a total of 1,752 grants, amounting to roughly $1.5 billion, had by then been terminated at the NSF.\n\n“The largest studies on dementia risk only have 800 Black participants. We were going to have 3,000,” says Mezuk, who appealed through the NIH against her grant cancellation. “It is critically important that a diverse set of experiences are represented. If we keep asking the same question in the same populations, we will get the same answer.” Her planned research aimed to glean fresh insights to help ‘baby boomers’, referring to the generation born between 1946 and 1964, to manage dementia risks.\n\nEpidemiologist Briana Mezuk’s grant to study dementia risk in older Black people was reinstated after her appeal. Credit: University of Michigan School of Public Health\n\nBut such terminations don’t just affect the research team involved. Many grant cancellations affect community research partners. Adelia Cooley is a member of the community advisory board for the Healthier Black Elders Center, an outreach programme that includes researchers at three Michigan universities working to improve the health of older Black adults in Detroit and Flint. Cooley says her biggest concern is the impact that the cuts will have on Black Americans, a demographic in which the risk of dementia (in those aged 55 or over) is roughly 45%2. “To say this is irrelevant or not necessary is horrible.”\n\nAgency appeals, however, as well as multi-complaint lawsuits, are getting some terminations reversed. On 16 June, a judge in Maryland ruled that NIH grants in two lawsuits — one filed by 16 state attorneys-general, the other by four researchers and three organizations with scientific members — were terminated unlawfully. The ruling reinstates roughly 800 grants and subawards named in the lawsuits. A follow-up ruling on 2 July suggests that the NIH cannot use discriminatory directives to terminate grants. But the Trump administration is likely to appeal against the decision, extending delays and confusion over terminated grants.\n\nMezuk’s grant was not part of any lawsuit, but she received a 19 June memo from the NIH stating that her appeal “has convinced them that, with revision, the grant is likely allowable”. The vaguely worded correspondence offered her a piece of guidance: remove participant-survey questions about experiences of discrimination. On 10 July, she received notice that her grant had been fully reinstated.\n\nNature’s Careers team spoke to 20 researchers who have lost grants from the NIH, the NSF, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Defense, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NASA. Mezuk, for one, is lucky in that her institution supported her appeal. Some universities forbid such attempts.\n\n#OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers\n\nDuring the reporting of this article, several interviewees had their grants reinstated, offering hope amid the chaos — although only about one-fifth of NIH-terminated grants have been flagged by Grant Watch as possibly reinstated through appeals or court cases so far. Many researchers are spending the bulk of their time frantically applying for grants to secure enough funding just to keep their work going. But the amounts they can hope to gain pale in comparison with the money lost through the federal-government cuts. Others are exploring new fund-raising strategies altogether – including campaigning through GoFundMe, the world’s largest fundraising platform.\n\nCollateral community damage\n\nMara Freilich, an environmental scientist who started her research group at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in 2023, lost her first federally funded grant from NASA on 21 March because it was considered “radical and wasteful DEI” spending, according to the e-mail she received from the agency. The funding had been helping a multi-institutional team working with community advocates and citizen scientists to analyse air quality around the Salton Sea, a large, landlocked and highly saline lake in southern California. “One of my big concerns is that the trust in science and in scientists is broken,” says Freilich. It weighs on her that scientists might not be able to follow through on the promises they made to community partners, such as sharing the air-quality findings in a timely manner.\n\nThe Salton Sea field site in California, where Mara Freilich’s group studied air-pollution emissions; the project was funded by a now-terminated NASA grant. Credit: Ryan Sinclair, Loma Linda University\n\nIn a study published on 31 May3, Freilich and her collaborators identified hydrogen sulfide emissions from the Salton Sea as an air pollutant of concern. The research was funded, in part, by the terminated NASA grant, which was also intended to develop innovative ways of using satellite data to predict hydrogen sulfide emissions. Freilich’s appeal against the cancellation was unsuccessful.\n\nThe grant terminations for Mezuk, Freilich and others have had a domino effect. Big studies often involve collaborations between several institutions. Freilich’s grant termination compromises funding for research partners at the University of California, Los Angeles; Loma Linda University in southern California; and Alianza Coachella Valley, a community group that aims to improve environmental conditions in the region.\n\nAlida Cantor, a geographer at Portland State University in Oregon, is also trying hard to maintain ties with community partners. Cantor lost two grants, from the NSF and the EPA, because her research included the banned term “environmental justice”, as related to the intersection between energy development and water availability in the western United States. The funding loss affects four academic institutions, as well as community partners. “Out of respect for our research participants, I’m not going to chuck the data,” says Cantor. “My priority is just being ethical in my relationships with research collaborators, participants, community partners and students.” Oregon was one of 16 states that sued the government to get terminated grants reinstated, and although Cantor is hopeful, she hasn’t heard anything more.\n\nAppeals for some\n\nAppealing against a grant termination usually entails assembling a dossier of evidence to submit to the funder. But success rates have been difficult to determine. The University of Utah’s $38 million Clinical and Translational Science Award, a seven-year grant first awarded by the NIH in 2023, was reinstated on 29 March. Grant Watch states on its website that it thinks the government “has restored a limited number of NIH grants that it previously terminated, often without providing public notice”.\n\nCharles DeCarli, director of the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center, is another of the few people known to have succeeded in an appeal. DeCarli was in the fifth year of a $36-million NIH grant programme to study the vascular factors that lead to dementia in a diverse population. Currently, he and his team have around 1,700 participants enrolled out of a hoped-for total of 2,250. (They lost around 100 participants in the weeks after the grant was initially terminated). DeCarli says his wife summarized the recipe for success best: support from university, peers, the NIH, the Alzheimer’s Association and the American Heart Association, and a dash of pixie dust. “We don’t really know why our appeal was successful,” he says.\n\nDeCarli took three weeks to put together a 41-page appeal that contained 16–18 pages of justification, with 50 references; the rest he describes as “legalese”. He emphasized all the ways in which his work furthered NIH priorities to study chronic illness as promoted by Make America Healthy Again, Trump’s populist campaign tailored to promote the aims of the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. DeCarli also pointed out that he had been awarded the grant in 2020, during the first Trump administration. He received a grant-reinstatement notification just a few days after he submitted his appeal.\n\n“If at all possible, push back,” he advises. “Seek the support of your institution. Seek the support of the free press, colleagues, programme officers. Researchers are “a small group”, he adds. “We should organize.”\n\nEarly-career researchers who appeal against the termination of training awards earmarked for diverse candidates are on particularly uncertain terrain – especially if the funding mechanism is terminated. For example, the NIH’s F31 training grants are coveted awards designed to support an individual’s PhD training and research. Since 2002, there have been two options: a standard F31 and a diversity-focused F31, designed to bolster candidates from marginalized or low-income backgrounds. About 30% of the 1,000 or so F31 training grants awarded in 2024 were funded by the diversity mechanism. Patrick Kelly, a third-year PhD candidate at Brown University, was awarded one of them. Kelly’s grant was cancelled in May, along with other diversity-specific F31 awards. Still, he wrote an appeal emphasizing how his dissertation research focused on drug use and drug-related harm from fentanyl, a priority of the HHS.\n\nKelly, a white man, qualified for the award because he is a first-generation student from a low-income background. On 27 June, he was notified that his grant had been reinstated and that funds were available for him to continue the research proposed in the grant. “I remain cautiously optimistic that the remaining years of the fellowship will also be awarded,” he says, but he acknowledges there’s no guarantee of that.\n\nScientists who might be political targets themselves — notably those at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and at Columbia University in New York City — also hold out little hope for appeals. Trump has cut federal funding and contracts at both institutions, claiming that student protests in support of Palestinian people are evidence that the establishments “tolerate antisemitism”. On 16 June, a judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by faculty members at Columbia University over Trump-administration funding cuts — because the university itself was not a plaintiff.\n\nNIH grant cuts will axe clinical trials abroad — and could leave thousands without care\n\nColumbia pulmonologist Jeanine D’Armiento had one time point left to collect data related to diagnosing a rare genetic disorder that affects the lungs and liver. But on 28 March, she lost her NIH funding for the study. Without those final data “everything we’d done for the last four years was wasted”, she says. At the same time, she lost funding for research on another rare lung disease; both grants were terminated weeks after the initial wave of $400 million in grant losses at Columbia in mid-March.\n\nD’Armiento, who chairs the executive committee of Columbia’s university senate, says her grants have none of the “bad” phrases, such as DEI, that are red flags for the Trump administration. Her trial was designed to recruit individuals in often-overlooked rural settings, among others, she says. She thinks she’s been targeted because the senate supported due process for student protesters. “I’m saddened by the loss of so much of my work,” she says. As it stands, she hopes that patient advocacy groups will help to raise money for her to finish the research. In fact, one trial participant asked her wedding guests to donate to D’Armiento’s research — and raised roughly $13,000.\n\nPhilanthropic life support\n\nBeyond federal funding sources, many turned immediately to philanthropic institutes — notably, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJ) in Princeton, New Jersey, which is the largest such organization focused solely on health in the country. So far, the RWJ has put together several pools of money to keep terminated research “on life support”, says Alonzo Plough, the foundation’s chief science officer and vice-president for research evaluation and learning.\n\n“What philanthropy can do is important, but it is orders of magnitude less than the billions in federal funding,” says Plough. “We fund in the serious millions, but what has been cut has been serious billions,” he adds.",

          "abstract": "Theoretical models have been developed to understand how social class influences individual thoughts, feelings and behaviours. However, the validity of these models is threatened by the prevailing use of small, non-diverse samples and flexible measurement practices. We preregistered replications of 35 key hypotheses from 17 correlational and 5 experimental studies, and collected large, quota-based or probability samples from the USA, France, Switzerland and India ( N total = 33,536). Our analysis yielded three central findings: (1) ~50% of the effects were successfully replicated; (2) conclusions were consistent across different operationalizations of social class, although objective indicators yielded smaller estimates (for example, income and education); and (3) half of the effects were moderated—mostly strengthened—by social class identification, system-justification beliefs or local income inequality. Overall, hypotheses based on differences between social class contexts in terms of constraints, uncertainty and status were well supported. However, hypotheses based on models positing social class differences in psychological orientations towards ‘the self’ versus ‘others and the environment’ received less support. We conclude that these models need to be reassessed as individuals from higher social classes seem more oriented towards both themselves and others.

          "abstract": "Fluent speech production is mediated by serially ordering and preparing motor plans corresponding to target speech sounds, a process known as speech-motor sequencing. Here we used high-density direct cortical recordings while 14 participants spoke utterances with varying phonemic and syllabic sequence complexity after reading a target sequence and a delay period. Phasic activations corresponding to speech production and auditory feedback were observed, but also sustained neural activity that persisted throughout all task phases including the target presentation, the delay period and production of the sequence. Furthermore, sustained activity in a specific area, the middle precentral gyrus (mPrCG), was both modulated by sequence complexity and predicted reaction time, suggesting a role in speech-motor sequencing. Electrocortical stimulation of the mPrCG caused speech disfluencies resembling those seen in apraxia of speech. These results suggest that speech-motor sequencing is mediated by a distributed cortical network in which the mPrCG plays a central role.",

          "abstract": "The neurophysiological mechanisms supporting brain maturation are fundamental to attention and memory capacity across the lifespan. Human brain regions develop at different rates, with many regions developing into the third and fourth decades of life. Here, in this preregistered study (https://osf.io/gsru7), we analysed intracranial electroencephalography recordings from widespread brain regions in a large developmental cohort. Using task-based (that is, attention to to-be-remembered visual stimuli) and task-free (resting-state) data from 101 children and adults (5.93–54.00 years, 63 males; n electrodes = 5,691), we mapped aperiodic (1/ƒ-like) activity, a proxy of neural noise, where steeper slopes indicate less noise and flatter slopes indicate more noise. We reveal that aperiodic slopes flatten with age into young adulthood in both association and sensorimotor cortices, challenging models of early sensorimotor development based on brain structure. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), attentional state modulated age effects, revealing steeper task-based than task-free slopes in adults and the opposite in children, consistent with the development of cognitive control. Age-related differences in task-based slopes also explained age-related gains in memory performance, linking the development of PFC cognitive control to the development of memory. Last, with additional structural imaging measures, we reveal that age-related differences in grey matter volume are similarly associated with aperiodic slopes in association and sensorimotor cortices. Our findings establish developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity in localized brain regions and illuminate the development of PFC control during adolescence in the development of attention and memory.",

          "abstract": "Stress changes social behavior, yet its effects remain contradictory. Traditionally, stress was thought to trigger an antagonistic fight-or-flight response aimed at eliminating the stressor. However, recent studies have revealed the opposite response, tend-and-befriend, where individuals prosocially invest in their social network in exchange for support and mutual protection. We hypothesize that stress does not promote one response over the other; instead, it stimulates both behaviors, dissociable on the neuropharmacological level and moderated by social context. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind psychopharmacological study, we administered hydrocortisone and yohimbine—alone or in combination—to manipulate the actions of the main stress hormone cortisol and the arousal transmitter noradrenaline. Participants then made decisions in an intergroup conflict task. They teamed up with others to form an in-group and played against multiple out-groups. Notably, out-group members initiated financial harm to in-group participants before these responded. Participants then chose either to 1) maximize their own payoff, 2) cooperatively increase the payoff of their in-group, or 3) increase the in-group’s payoff while competitively decreasing that of the out-group. Consistent with our hypotheses, glucocorticoid activation increased generosity toward the in-group, whereas noradrenergic activation increased parochial competition, i.e., prosocial in-group support combined with hostility toward the out-group. These findings challenge the dichotomy between fight-or-flight and tend-and-befriend, suggesting stress-related behavior is neither static nor one-directional, but shaped by the relative dominance of cortisol versus noradrenaline in the neurohormonal stress response and by intergroup dynamics. We highlight broader societal implications, offering a potential biological mechanism underlying the self-perpetuating cycle of intergroup conflict.",

          "abstract": "Nature-based solutions (NbS) have emerged as a key strategy for sustainably addressing multiple urban challenges, with rapidly increasing knowledge production requiring synthesis to better understand whether and how NbS work in different social, ecological, economic, or governance contexts. Insights in this Perspective are drawn from a thematic review of 61 NbS review articles supported by an expert assessment of NbS knowledge in seven global regions to examine key challenges, fill gaps in Global South assessment, and provide insights for scaling up NbS for impact in cities. Eight NbS challenges emerged from our review of NbS reviews including conceptual, thematic, geographic, ecological, inclusivity, health, governance, and systems challenges. An additional expert assessment reviewing literature and cases in seven global regions further revealed the following: 1) Local context-based ecological knowledge is essential for NbS success; 2) Improved technical knowledge is required for planning and designing NbS; 3) NbS need to be included in all levels of planning and governance; 4) Putting justice and equity at the center of urban NbS approaches is critical, and 5) Inclusive and participatory governance processes will be key to long-term success of NbS. We synthesized findings from the NbS review results and regional expert assessments to offer four critical pathways for scaling up NbS: 1) foster new NbS research, technological innovation, and learning, 2) build a global NbS alliance for sharing knowledge, 3) ensure a systems approach to NbS planning and implementation, and 4) increase financing and political will for diverse NbS implementation.",

          "abstract": "Global economic development has been associated with an increased prevalence of obesity and related health problems. Increased caloric intake and reduced energy expenditure are both cited as development-related contributors to the obesity crisis, but their relative importance remains unresolved. Here, we examine energy expenditure and two measures of obesity (body fat percentage and body mass index, BMI) for 4,213 adults from 34 populations across six continents and a wide range of lifestyles and economies, including hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, farming, and industrialized populations. Economic development was positively associated with greater body mass, BMI, and body fat, but also with greater total, basal, and activity energy expenditure. Body size–adjusted total and basal energy expenditures both decreased approximately 6 to 11% with increasing economic development, but were highly variable among populations and did not correspond closely with lifestyle. Body size–adjusted total energy expenditure was negatively, but weakly, associated with measures of obesity, accounting for roughly one-tenth of the elevated body fat percentage and BMI associated with economic development. In contrast, estimated energy intake was greater in economically developed populations, and in populations with available data (n = 25), the percentage of ultraprocessed food in the diet was associated with body fat percentage, suggesting that dietary intake plays a far greater role than reduced energy expenditure in obesity related to economic development.",

          "abstract": "The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed that upcoming decades are likely to be accompanied with an increase in climate impacts in urban areas, thereby stressing the need for empowering cities to help them address the challenges ahead by closing the urban adaptation gap. The lock-in systems in which cities are often trapped create resistance to change and leads to missed opportunities to cocreate better futures. Putting nature at the center of urban adaptation agenda is a promising vision that nature-based solutions can help realize if city leaders are adequately supported in accessing the knowledge and resources they need to take action. Despite their proven potential, important barriers to the planning, implementation, and management of nature-based solutions (NbS) for urban climate adaptation persist and need to be urgently addressed. We highlight key barriers related to knowledge gaps and dissemination, policy incentives, and financial autonomy faced by city leaders trying to integrate NbS into policy and planning. In this perspective, we propose four levers of transformative adaptation which build on examples from Europe, the United States, Africa, and Latin America and which have proven successful in supporting cities adopting nature-based adaptation actions, including to 1) produce, assess and share knowledge; 2) adopt incentive-based policies and regulations; 3) facilitate access to multiple sources of funding; and 4) create reflexive monitoring mechanisms. If these steps are taken with the goal of addressing vulnerabilities on the ground, they can unleash the potential of NbS to engage on a path of transformative adaptation.",

          "authors": "Melissa K. Nelson, Graeme Reed",
          "abstract": "Indigenous peoples have long histories and diverse contemporary practices of caring for and enhancing biodiversity at different scales, in rural and urban contexts. As has been researched and documented by the Convention on Biological Diversity and others, Indigenous peoples globally only constitute 5% of the world’s population and control and care for just 20% of the Earth’s surface yet protect nearly 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity. Indigenous peoples have forms of biodiversity conservation that could be characterized as “nature-based solutions” (NbS), or would they be culture-based solutions? Given the extraordinary diversity of Indigenous peoples globally, there will never be a “one size fits all” solution. Yet there are general principles that have been articulated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples that articulate global concepts of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). IKS, TEK, and Native ways of knowing and caring for biodiversity can find both resonance and conflict with what is currently being called NbS. This article articulates Indigenous concerns and critiques of the conceptual and ontological framework of NbS, demonstrating that Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge systems include a similar framework but extend it to include a distinctly biocultural and relational orientation that does not make an artificial division between nature and culture. Different Indigenous perspectives and approaches to sustainability will be highlighted, including two case stories. We conclude with recommendations for respectful, just, decolonial, and transparent ways to explore greater resonance between NbS and Indigenous peoples’ rights.",

          "abstract": "Nature-based solutions (NBS) are used to transform existing unsustainable and undesirable path dependencies in cities. For NBS to contribute to just urban transformations, a stronger inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge base is needed. This knowledge base is essential to engage with six complex yet crucial questions about NBS, including “for what?,” “which nature?,” “where?,” “how?,” “when,” and “for whom?.” To address these questions, we identify two critical opportunities to advance the knowledge of NBS. First, we argue for solidifying interdisciplinary approaches to examine how NBS can be designed, planned, and implemented for multifunctionality. Second, we argue that researchers need to work transdisciplinarily with diverse stakeholders to ensure the design, siting, and planning of NBS are appropriate to the context. In both critical opportunities, justice should be a core guiding principle from the beginning of planning the NBS, starting with the foundational understanding that NBS are not inherently just or unjust. Instead, their value depends on a holistic examination of the context in which they operate and the institutional logic that guides their planning. To center justice in the inter- and transdisciplinary research and practice of NBS, a knowledge shift from epistemological injustice to epistemological inclusivity is a critical way forward.",

However, resistance that impaired major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression on tumors can be developed in many patients after ICB treatment, resulting in insufficient antigen presentation to CTLs. Herein, we rationally design a ver s atile and po w erful i mmunomodula t ed hierar ch ical nanoCRISPR converter (SWITCH) targeting PD-L1 and PCSK9 loci to convert the immune-resistance state of tumors with high PD-L1 and low MHC-I expression for augmenting the susceptibility and visibility of tumors to the immune system. SWITCH possesses enhanced blood circulation and tumor-targeting capacity through PEGylation, acid-triggered pH low insertion peptides (pHLIPs), and interaction of hyaluronan with CD44 receptors. With the assistance of hyaluronidase and preternatural oxidative stress within tumor cells, SWITCH undergoes enzyme-responsive disassembly, charge reversal, rapid lysosomal escape, and efficient disruption of PD-L1 and PCSK9 orderly. This dual-action mechanism simultaneously blocks PD-1/PD-L1 immunosuppression while restoring MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation, resulting in enhanced the susceptibility and visibility of tumors to the immune system. Our results demonstrate SWITCH's remarkable efficacy in suppressing primary, contralateral, and recurrent tumor growth. Taken together, our study provides an encouraging strategy for relieving tumor immune resistance and further potentiating the efficacy of ICB.",

Chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-M) therapies have demonstrated impressive therapeutic efficacy in solid tumors; however, the cost and rigor associated with manufacturing engineered macrophages ex vivo can be prohibitive. Here, we utilized enucleated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as vehicles for the targeted delivery of CAR-encoding plasmid to reprogram glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAM), thereby achieving CAR-M preparation in vivo. Specifically, we observed that the enucleated cells retained the key organelle function and membrane integrity, and actively homed to glioma tissue. Interestingly, enucleated MSCs underwent intrinsic apoptosis due to the absence of the nucleus, which subsequently triggered macrophage-specific endocytosis, thereby achieving precise delivery of CAR-plasmids to GAM. Compared with lipid nanoparticles, this strategy specifically generated sufficient numbers of CAR-M in glioma situ to achieve GBM therapy. Moreover, this process altered the immune cell profiles within the tumor by increasing cytotoxic T cells and M1-like macrophages with antitumor activity. When combined with CD47-blocking therapies, tumor growth was completely suppressed in the GBM orthotopic mouse model, resulting in a 90-d survival rate of 83%. Collectively, our strategy provides a viable platform technology for CAR-M generation in vivo, which is expected to provide an approach for GBM therapy.",

          "abstract": "SHP1 (PTPN6) and SHP2 (PTPN11) are closely related protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which are autoinhibited until their SH2 domains bind paired tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory/switch motifs (ITIMs/ITSMs). These PTPs bind overlapping sets of ITIM/ITSM-bearing proteins, suggesting that they might have some redundant functions. By studying T cell–specific single and double knockout mice, we found that SHP1 and SHP2 redundantly restrain naïve T cell differentiation to effector and central memory phenotypes, with SHP1 playing the dominant role. Surprisingly, loss of SHP2 alone in T cells enhanced the antitumor effects of anti-PD-1 antibodies, whereas there was no effect of SHP1 deletion. Also unexpectedly, the absence of both PTPs resulted in poorer tumor control and failure to respond to Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) blockade, associated with reduced frequency and activation of T cells and dendritic cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that CD4 + , but not CD8 + , T cells lacking SHP1 and SHP2 show increased activation-induced cell death upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation. Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD4 + T cells restored normal levels of tumor control in mice lacking both PTPs. Together, our results demonstrate that SHP1 or SHP2 is required to prevent activation-induced cell death of CD4 + T cells and is critical for tumor immunity, raising the possibility that inhibition of SHP2 might augment the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1-based immune therapy.",

The state-of-the-art PM stains are bright, specific, fluorogenic, and compatible with superresolution imaging. However, when recording membrane dynamics using advanced fluorescence microscopes, PM is prone to photodynamic damage introduced by dyes due to its phospholipid bilayer nature. Here, we introduce PK Mem dyes tailored for time-lapse fluorescence imaging. By integrating triplet-state quenchers into the MemBright dyes featuring cyanine chromophores and amphiphilic zwitterion anchors, PK Mem dyes exhibited a three-fold reduction in phototoxicity and a more than four-fold improvement in photostability in imaging experiments compared to MemBright prototypes. These dyes enable 2D and 3D imaging of live or fixed cancer cell lines and a wide range of primary cells, at the same time pair well with various fluorescent markers. PK Mem dyes can be applied to neuronal imaging in brain slices and in vivo two-photon imaging. The gentle nature of PK Mem palette enables ultralong-term recording of cell migration, cardiomyocyte beating, spermiogenesis, and axonal growth cone dynamics, which are prohibitively challenging using traditional PM dyes. Notably, PK Mem dyes are optically compatible with STED/SIM imaging, which can handily upgrade the routine of time-lapse neuronal imaging, such as growth cone tracking and mitochondrial transportations, into nanoscopic resolutions.",

          "abstract": "Impairment of mitochondrial protein stability is associated with neurodegeneration in Huntington’s disease (HD). However, the E3 ligase responsible for maintaining mitochondrial protein homeostasis in HD remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that NEDD4L protein levels are elevated in human striatal organoids (hSOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of patients as well as in a mouse model of HD. Overexpression of NEDD4L leads to degeneration and cell death of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), along with a reduction in motor activities. Conversely, deletion of NEDD4L restores abnormal MSN morphology, corrects deficits in calcium signaling, alleviates neurodegeneration in HD-hSOs, and improves motor dysfunction observed in YAC128 mice. Mechanistically, NEDD4L disrupts mitochondrial function by binding to lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase 2 (LIPT2) and promoting its degradation through ubiquitination and lysosomal pathways. This process impairs lipoic acid biosynthesis and the lipoylation of E2 subunits of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH E2). Furthermore, either overexpressing LIPT2 or administering lipoic acid mitigates neurodegeneration and rectifies deficits in motor coordination activity. These findings unveil a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of lipoic acid metabolism and underscore the potential therapeutic role of protein lipoylation in the treatment of HD.",

The parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis infects an estimated 600 million people worldwide and is one of the soil-transmitted helminthiases, a WHO-defined neglected tropical disease. It has long been suggested that human S. stercoralis infection may be a zoonosis from dogs. We investigated this by whole genome sequence analysis of S. stercoralis from sympatric human and dog populations in Asia. We find that human- and dog-derived S. stercoralis have genetically distinct nuclear genomes, but we also find evidence of rare cross-infection. Analysis of the S. stercoralis mitochondrial genome reveals evidence of historical introgression between human- and dog-derived parasites. Based on these data, we suggest that S. stercoralis was originally a parasite of canids, that began to infect humans when people domesticated dogs, since when human- and dog-derived parasites have differentiated, but have not become separate species.",

          "abstract": "The retinal photoreceptors possess specialized sensory cilia critical for phototransduction while the nonphotoreceptor cells typically exhibit simpler primary cilia or lack them altogether. This dichotomy in ciliary architecture underpins the functional specialization of retinal cell types, but how this dichotomy arises and is maintained remains elusive. This study explores the role of the transcription factor Foxn3 in establishing and maintaining this divergence. We generated retina-specific Foxn3 conditional knockout (Foxn3CKO) mice, which show that Foxn3 is essential for repressing ciliary gene expression in nonphotoreceptor cells, such as bipolar and amacrine cells. Foxn3CKO mice exhibit significant reductions in electroretinogram b-wave amplitudes and oscillatory potentials, indicating functional impairments in inner retinal neurons. Loss of Foxn3 leads to ectopic ciliary gene expression and abnormal ciliogenesis in nonphotoreceptor neurons, without affecting retinal cell specification and differentiation. Single-Cell RNA Sequencing, chromatin profiling, and transcription assays reveal that Foxn3 directly binds to and represses the promoters of ciliary genes and their transactivators, including Foxj1 and Rfx family members. Our data together highlight Foxn3 as a key transcriptional repressor that may function to ensure the proper ciliary architecture of retinal neurons by preventing nonphotoreceptor neurons from adopting photoreceptor-like ciliary features and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms governing retinal development and ciliopathies.",

          "abstract": "Prion diseases can manifest with distinct phenotypes in a single species, a phenomenon known as prion strains. Upon cross-species transmission, alterations in the disease phenotype can occur, interpreted as the emergence of a new strain. Two main and non–mutually exclusive evolutionary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon: the “conformational shift” or “deformed templating” and the “conformational selection.” The conformational shift hypothesis proposes that the introduction of a new host prion protein (PrP C ) forces a change in the conformation of the pathological prion protein (PrP Sc ), causing the new prion strain emergence. On the contrary, the conformational selection model postulates that prion isolates are a conglomerate of PrP Sc conformations with relative distribution frequencies, wherein the species barrier acts as a filter selecting the one fittest for the new species environment. Previous studies reported the emergence of the classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent (c-BSE) upon transmission of Nor98/atypical scrapie (AS) onto a bovine PrP. This study investigates the evolutionary dichotomy of this c-BSE emergence by using prion strain thermostability combined with protein misfolding cyclic amplification to distinguish between both strains. Our results suggest that the conformational shift could be the principal mechanism responsible for the c-BSE emergence. Furthermore, the selection model was dismissed as the key mechanism based on the analysis of an artificial c-BSE and AS mixture. The ability of the AS conformers to shift conformation to a c-BSE one supports the hypothesis that the epidemic c-BSE prion may have originated from the transmission of AS in cattle.",

          "abstract": "Forests are potential carbon (C) sinks that partially offset anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions via enhanced C assimilation and productivity. However, the question remains whether mature trees will express sufficient plasticity in nutrient acquisition strategies to support enhanced growth under elevated CO 2 (eCO 2 ). Trees may sustain growth by investing C belowground to enhance nutrient acquisition, e.g., by increasing root absorptive surfaces for greater soil available resource exploration (a “do-it-yourself” strategy) or utilizing C exudation or mycorrhizal associations as priming mechanisms for nutrient acquisition (“outsourcing”). We show that 4 y of eCO 2 (+140 ± 38 ppm; i.e., +35% above ambient) altered the relative belowground C investment strategies of mature oak ( Quercus robur L.) in a 180-y-old temperate forest. Fine-root branching frequency increased 73% under eCO 2 . Specific root C exudation was enhanced under eCO 2 (63%), particularly outside the peak growing season, and the exudate C to nitrogen (N) ratio was increased (28%). Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) biomass production increased during leaf fall (17%) while ECM turnover increased almost fourfold under eCO 2 . The exudate and root metabolome composition were considerably altered during the late growing season under eCO 2 . We find, therefore, that a broad suite of nutrient acquisition strategies are upregulated under eCO 2 , with dynamic shifting between different outsourcing and do-it-yourself elements at different times of the year. These belowground changes support the increase in net primary productivity observed in this forest, with implications for the role of mature temperate forests in the global carbon sink.",

We use a combination of mathematical models and in vivo experiments to study a simple organ in the zebrafish embryo called Kupffer’s vesicle (KV). Modeling indicates that dynamic forces generated by tissue movements in the embryo produce shape changes in KV that are observed during development. Laser ablations in the zebrafish embryo that alter these forces result in altered organ shapes matching model predictions.

We examined language lateralization in 24 bilingual and 46 monolingual adults with temporal lobe epilepsy using functional MRI. In a group of primarily early sequential bilingual patients, the first acquired language (L1) showed more bilateral lateralization than in monolingual patients, with no effect of seizure onset laterality. In contrast, the second-acquired language (L2) was more bilateral in the presence of left hemisphere epilepsy and more left-lateralized in right hemisphere epilepsy. Most notably, in left hemisphere epilepsy, seizure onset closer to L2 acquisition was associated with more right-lateralized L2 representation. These findings suggest a compensatory process in which L2 networks strengthen in the hemisphere opposite the seizure focus, potentially reflecting neural adaptation in early bilingualism. Conversely, L1 appears to have less dynamic reorganization in response to neurological insult. Together, these findings highlight the importance of timing in both language experience and neurological stress in shaping language network organization. They support the view that the bilingual brain is not simply the sum of two monolingual systems, but a dynamic and unique system marked by high interindividual variability, in which divergence between languages may emerge under certain experience- and context-dependent conditions.",

          "abstract": "Characterizing the morphology of lithium (Li) is crucial for developing long-lasting lithium metal batteries. It is well established that more uniform Li deposition correlates with better cell performance. Li morphology is often characterized through qualitative analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images; however, there are no widely accepted metrics to quantitatively describe deposition uniformity. Here, we propose a framework to quantify uniformity through SEM image analysis via the index of dispersion ( ID ) metric, which is defined and presented in the context of Li metal batteries. We also explore experimental impacts of sampling protocols on ID measurements. Our results demonstrate that the ID metric is highly sensitive to variations in deposition uniformity, including the coexistence and uniformity of multiple morphologies, uniformity within a single morphology, and particle size distribution uniformity. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that uniformity, as measured by the ID , can be related to the average potential of Li||Li symmetric cells over cycling. Higher capacity cycling leads to more pronounced changes in both ID and average cell potential. Local minima/maxima are found consistently in both ID and average cell potential immediately before cells short-circuit, which we suggest may indicate a collapse of the microstructure prior to failure. We put forward this framework as a more robust approach to quantify Li deposition uniformity, advancing the development of Li metal batteries that are safer and longer lasting.",

Understanding and quantifying the impact of these activities on soil is central to the well-being of our societies. Here, we investigate the isotope ratios of the trace element lithium in detrital sediments of Lake Bourget, European Alps, and provide a reconstruction of the impact of human activities on the evolution of alpine soil during the Holocene. We demonstrate that during the Early Holocene, soil formation was altered by the development of pastoralism followed by tillage. This led to three major erosive surges (3.8 to 3.0, 2.8 to 1.6, and 1.6 ky cal BP to modern times), thinning soils down to a state close to that of their early development 10,000 y ago. The detailed study of the lithium detrital signal reveals the appearance of an altitudinal decoupling in the response of the Critical Zone in the Alps following the development of the agropastoral activities during the Iron Age. The onset of agropastoral activities disrupted the balance between soil formation and erosion, leading to erosion rates 3 to 10 times faster than soil production since the end of the Ice Age.",

The upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana sleeps, and this behavior is controlled by radially spaced marginal ganglia. After defining a sleep–wake threshold, we compared gene expression profiles of ganglia from animals deprived of sleep and found differential expression in many sleep-related genes including GABAergic, melatonergic, and cholinergic receptors. In particular, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit-like (Chrnal-E) was strongly differentially expressed in sleep deprived animals. Animals deprived of sleep under both mechanical and light perturbations suggested chrnal-E as a key gene regulating sleep. We found that chemical cholinergic neuromodulators regulate pacemaker activity. Visualization of chrnal-E mRNA revealed it is expressed primarily within the ganglia, and that the area of expression expands after sleep deprivation. In order to confirm the functional role of chrnal-E , we developed RNAi for use in Cassiopea and determined that Chrnal-E promotes wakefulness. Finally, we field-sampled control and sleep deprived animals and found chrnal-E has lowest expression late at night in controls, while in sleep deprived animals, chrnal-E peaks at this time, supporting a link to wakefulness. Our finding that Cassiopea sleep is regulated by the cholinergic-like system underscores that some components of sleep regulation are deeply conserved even in an animal with a distributed nervous system.",

Physical reservoir computing leverages these nonlinear dynamics to produce complex input–output mappings by interpreting the dynamical system as a physical recurrent neural network. A source of physical nonlinearity is crucial for enabling the reservoir to predict nonlinear relationships. Despite the significance of nonlinearity, most physical reservoirs leverage only a single source of nonlinearity. Furthermore, there exists a gap between analyses that examine fundamental capabilities of reservoir computers and those that evaluate the practical performance of reservoir computers. In this study, an optomechanical reservoir is introduced that combines both the nonlinear dynamics from bilinear springs and nonlinear sensing from optical fibers. Both the nonlinear springs and the optical fibers are shown to contribute significantly to the range of nonlinear frequency content produced by the optomechanical reservoir. A novelty search of simulated reservoirs highlights the range of performance exhibited by the optomechanical reservoir, and several high performing designs are validated experimentally. Additionally, a frequency content metric is introduced to characterize the nature of a given reservoir’s nonlinearity, highlighting what kinds of frequencies the reservoir can and cannot produce. This analysis is an important step toward the rational design of reservoir computers as it allows one to match reservoir computers with computational tasks.

Uncertainties in global climate models (GCMs)-particularly in projecting changes in remote drivers like tropical warming, stratospheric polar vortex strengthening, and asymmetric tropical Pacific warming-hinder predictions of EDJ trends and associated regional outcomes. In this study, we develop a causal framework that combines observations, reanalysis datasets, and storylines estimated from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) projections to attribute past EDJ changes and predict plausible future trajectories. Our findings indicate that tropical warming has evolved along the low end of plausible CMIP trajectories, while the stratospheric polar vortex shows robust strengthening, both strongly influencing observed EDJ trends. Our results suggest that 50% of the observed EDJ latitude shift can be directly attributed to global warming (GW), and the remaining 50% to remote drivers whose attribution to GW remains uncertain. Importantly, GCMs appear to accurately estimate the observed latitudinal shifts but underestimate the observed strengthening of the EDJ, while the proposed storylines are able to capture the observed trend. By integrating causal inference with climate storylines, our approach narrows the divide between attribution and prediction, offering a physically grounded method to estimate plausible pathways of future climate change.",

We modeled paleobiome dynamics over a 120 Ma period and produced a nuclear phylogenomic dataset of 458 loci for ~700 species (~74%) to show that historical diversification rates across the Grevilleoideae phylogeny are closely associated with ecological opportunity provided by emerging and expanding biomes. Diversification is rapid in emerging and expanding biomes, while long-occupied biomes tend to have higher species richness but lower diversification rates, as expected if these biomes have approached equilibrium diversity. Our results reveal a strong and heterogeneous legacy of climatic and geological history on today’s floristic diversity and explain why diversity is often decoupled from expectations based on measures of ecological “carrying capacity” such as the area or climate of present-day biomes.",

          "abstract": "The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel is expressed in primary nociceptive afferents, which participate in processes such as pain and inflammation. Considerable efforts have been directed toward finding inhibitors of TRPV1 and understanding the molecular details of their interactions with this channel. α-humulene (AH) is a sesquiterpene derived from plants such as hops and other members of Cannabaceae family, with a long history of popular use as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory. Using a combination of behavioral assays, electrophysiology, site-directed mutagenesis, cryo-EM, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that AH inhibits TRPV1-related pain responses and currents by interacting with a region composed of the S2, S2-S3 linker, and S3 transmembrane segments and stabilizing the closed conformation of the channel. The interaction of ligands in this region of the TRPV1 channel has not been previously described and the results of the present study highlight that it may constitute part of a negative regulatory region. These findings allow us to understand the molecular basis by which substances such as some sesquiterpenes, abundantly found in medicinal plants used by humans for hundreds of years, reduce pain. Pain management can include the use of opioids, which results in hepatic and renal damage and possible addiction. Our study offers insight into a poorly understood group of compounds that could be used as scaffold to produce novel nonopioid analgesic therapies and clarifies the molecular mechanisms that underlie the effects of these analgesic molecules.",

          "abstract": "Light eyes, hair, and skins probably evolved several times as Homo sapiens dispersed from Africa. In areas with lower UV radiation, light pigmentation alleles increased in frequency because of their adaptive advantage and of other contingent factors such as migration and drift. However, the tempo and mode of their spread is not known. Phenotypic inference from ancient DNA is complicated, both because these traits are polygenic and because of low sequence depth. We evaluated the effects of the latter by randomly removing reads in three high-coverage ancient samples, the Paleolithic Ust’-Ishim from Russia, the Mesolithic SF12 from Sweden, and the Neolithic I5077 from current Croatia. We could thus compare three approaches to pigmentation inference, concluding that for suboptimal levels of coverage (&lt;8×), a probabilistic method estimating genotype likelihoods leads to the most robust predictions. We then applied that protocol to 348 ancient genomes from Eurasia, describing how skin, eye, and hair color evolved over the past 45,000 y. The shift toward lighter pigmentations turned out to be all but linear in time and place, and slower than expected, with half of the individuals showing dark or intermediate skin colors well into the Bronze and Iron ages. We also observed a peak of light eye pigmentation in Mesolithic times, and an accelerated change during the spread of Neolithic farmers over Western Eurasia, although localized processes of gene flow and admixture, or lack thereof, also played a significant role.",

Here, we characterize a group of excitatory reticular interneurons located in the supratrigeminal area that express the homeodomain transcription factor Phox2b . This nucleus—Sup5 Phox2b —is premotor to both jaw-closing and jaw-opening motoneurons and receives direct input from cranial sensory afferents, motor cortex, and satiation related nuclei. Its activity differentially tracks lapping, biting, and chewing movements, suggesting its involvement in the elaboration of distinct orofacial motor patterns in vivo. Acute global activation or inhibition of Sup5 Phox2b by optogenetics interrupt volitional feeding sequences. Thus, Sup5 Phox2b is an obligatory subcortical node, topologically and genetically defined, in the neural circuits that control the oral phase of feeding in mice.",

However, because crystalline phases are recalcitrant to enzymatic hydrolysis, this technology fails for rapidly crystallizing polyester wastes such as poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), unsortable mixed polyesters, or heterogeneous formulated PET waste streams. We show that melt transesterification and vitrimerization of mixtures of rapidly crystallizing polyester wastes, leveraging catalysts already present, produce copolyesters that crystallize slowly and are readily depolymerized. For example, reactive blending of a rapidly crystallizing postindustrial PET nonwoven waste with PBT improves depolymerization yields from 20% (PET nonwoven) and 1% (PBT) to 90%. Synergistic mixing can replace sorting, extending the scope of enzymatic recycling to recalcitrant, heterogeneous, and unsortable wastes.",

          "abstract": "Separation membranes are critical for a range of processes, including but not limited to water desalination, chemical and fuel production, and recycling and recovery applications. Fundamentally, there are intrinsic trade-offs between permeability and selectivity. Local water organization and content can impact membrane structure (short- and long-range) in laminar transition metal carbide (MXene) membranes and impact selective ion permeation. Intercalation of chaotropic cesium (Cs + ) ions within the layers reduces the water content in the membrane and at the surface which cannot be found in the intercalation of other ions. Additionally, 3D imaging using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy showed fewer defects in the Cs-MXene membrane, due to reduced local water content, leading to more efficient ion sieving. X-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations on the nanochannel structure demonstrated that the chaotropic ion results in the smallest nanochannel size and induces a stronger resistance to water-induced nanochannel swelling. With a narrower nanochannel, the Cs-MXene membrane limits ion transport pathways, resulting in more selective transport of lithium over other metal cations, as evidenced in both experiment and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings highlight the potential for controlling the structural organization of 2D MXene membranes to enable on-demand transport of ions for diverse applications.",

In human adults, visual performance varies systematically around the polar angle for many visual dimensions and tasks: Performance is superior along the horizontal than the vertical meridian (horizontal–vertical anisotropy, HVA) and the lower than upper vertical meridian (vertical meridian asymmetry, VMA). These asymmetries are resistant to spatial and temporal attention. However, it remains unknown whether visual adaptation differs around the polar angle. Here, we investigated how adaptation influences contrast sensitivity at the fovea and perifovea across the four cardinal meridian locations for both horizontal and vertical stimuli in an orientation discrimination task. In the nonadapted conditions, the HVA was more pronounced for horizontal than vertical stimuli. For both orientations, adaptation was stronger along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, exceeding foveal adaptation. Additionally, perifoveal adaptation effects positively correlated with individual V1 cortical surface area. These findings reveal that visual adaptation mitigates the HVA in contrast sensitivity, fostering perceptual uniformity around the visual field while conserving bioenergetic resources.",

Traditional methods are invasive or require bulky equipment, making them impractical for mobile, continuous sensing. We present a wearable bioimpedance sensor with strategic electrode placement across the arm for noninvasive, continuous, and mobile WBH monitoring. Although whole-body bioimpedance is a proven method for indicating WBH, the effectiveness of local bioimpedance measurement has been unclear. Our finite element analysis demonstrated that with an optimized cross-arm sensing configuration, a strong linear relationship exists between arm bioimpedance and muscle electrical resistivity, confirming the utility of arm bioimpedance for assessing WBH given the well-established relationship between muscle electrical resistivity and body water. Our IRB-approved diuretic-induced dehydration study demonstrated a strong linear correlation between the increase of arm bioimpedance and the decrease in body weight due to water loss, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.956 ± 0.033 among eight participants. Arm and whole-body demonstrated strong alignment, suggesting that arm bioimpedance measurements can reflect not only changes in WBH but also potentially absolute WBH status when compared against established population reference data. In a 24-h free-living experiment, the wireless, dry electrode-based, arm-conformable bioimpedance sensor continuously tracked dehydration and rehydration despite motions associated with daily activities. These results suggest that properly measured arm bioimpedance can serve as a surrogate for WBH, offering a reliable and accessible solution.

          "abstract": "Hearing hinges upon the ear’s ability to enhance its responsiveness by means of an energy-expending active process that amplifies the very mechanical inputs that it detects. This process is defined by four properties that, although seemingly unrelated, consistently occur together: amplification, sharp frequency tuning, compressive nonlinearity, and spontaneous otoacoustic emission. In nonmammal tetrapods, the active process is evident in individual hair cells. The hair bundles of the bullfrog, for example, exhibit all four attributes by operating near a Hopf bifurcation—a critical regime in which these properties naturally coalesce. In mammals, however, the delicate nature of the cochlea has restricted the evidence for an active process to studies in vivo, where it is generally attributed to the collective effort of the outer hair cells that energize the traveling wave along the cochlear spiral. As a result, the cellular mechanisms that underlie the properties of mammalian hearing remain contested, with uncertainty about whether criticality plays a role in the cochlea’s active process. Here we show that, when placed in a recording chamber that closely mimics the in vivo physiological environment, a segment of the mammalian cochlea ex vivo displays the features of the active process—amplification, frequency tuning, compressive nonlinearity, and the generation of distortion products. We show that this process operates locally, independently of traveling waves, and that the sensory epithelium achieves active amplification by operating near criticality at a Hopf bifurcation. The results reveal the existence of a unified biophysical principle that underlies auditory processing across species and even phyla.",

We combined dietary DNA metabarcoding, GPS tracking, and a machine-learning algorithm to cluster and compare dietary profiles within and among five migratory large-herbivore species from Yellowstone National Park. Interspecific niche partitioning was weak, but statistically significant (PERMANOVA: pseudo- F 4,498 = 14.7, R 2 = 0.11, P ≤ 0.001), such that some diet profiles from different species were as similar as those from within one species. Instead of affirming species’ identity as a primary determinant of diet composition, we found three statistically different clusters of diet profiles—one concentrated on graminoids and forbs, another on forbs and deciduous shrubs, and a third on gymnosperms—each including samples from all herbivore species. Clusters did not reflect traditional diet classification schemes such as the grazer-browser continuum that is often used to distinguish species by percent grass consumption or use of grassland habitat in African savannas. Instead, clusters in Yellowstone reflected seasonal dietary variation within species that often equaled or exceeded niche differences between species, contributing to our growing understanding of why environmental variability may favor generalist foraging strategies at temperate latitudes, whereas specialized grazer and browser guilds appear to predominate in tropical savannas. Data-driven strategies that untangle complex trophic networks without relying on a priori groupings can offer new insights into wildlife diets, with potential applications in resource management and environmental monitoring.",

Recent evidence suggests that these amyloidogenic proteins act in synergy, with their coaggregation frequently observed in these disorders. In this study, we investigate the interaction of Aβ and αSyn using various biophysical tools. In particular, we explore the cocondensation of Aβ with αSyn, elucidating the pathways through which Aβ modulates αSyn phase separation. We studied different variants of Aβ, focusing on the most prominent species, namely Aβ42 and Aβ40. We found that Aβ42 and Aβ40 have fundamentally different mechanistic effects on the kinetics of αSyn condensation. Aβ42 initially forms large aggregates that act as heterogeneous nucleation sites which initiate the phase separation of αSyn. In contrast, Aβ40 is sequestered into αSyn condensates where it accelerates the liquid-to-solid transition of αSyn into amyloid aggregates. All other Aβ variants we probed fell into one of these two mechanistic pathways, with Aβ37, Aβ39, and Aβ35-25 exhibiting similar behavior to Aβ40, whereas Aβ43 triggered nucleation processes similar to Aβ42. Given the complexity behind amyloid formation, it is key to understand how molecular partners can interact with one another. Our results thus illustrate the extreme sensitivity of protein mixtures and shed light on some of the mechanisms involved in the cocondensation and aggregation of Aβ with αSyn.",

Measurements with optical tweezers revealed important differences between the folding cooperativity, pathways, energy barriers, and kinetics of these proteins. In contrast to the two-state folding of hamster PrP, dog PrP always folded through multiple intermediates. However, both featured rapid native folding, homogeneous energy barriers, and no readily observable misfolding. Bank vole PrP also folded via intermediates, but more slowly and via inhomogeneous barriers. Most notably, it formed several metastable misfolded states starting from the unfolded state. Analyzing the sequence of intermediates seen in pulling curves, we found significant differences in the folding pathways for dog and bank vole PrP, implying that sequence mutations altered energy barriers so as to redirect folding pathways. These results show that subtle differences in PrP sequence between species produce profound changes in folding behavior, providing insight into the factors underlying misfolding propensity.",

While interest in studying the impacts of climate change on storm behavior is growing, nor’easters have historically received far less attention than tropical cyclones, largely due to challenges in documenting and categorizing these storms combined with the relatively short observational record. Here, we address these challenges by employing a cyclone tracking approach in concurrence with long-term reanalysis data to create a reliable historical database of these storms. We find a significant increasing trend in the maximum wind speeds of the most intense (&gt;66th percentile) nor’easters. We also observe an increasing trend in hourly precipitation rates associated with these storms.

Using global datasets of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal observations linked to spore morphological traits, we show that climate shapes spore trait variation and functional diversity. Larger spore volumes were more prevalent in warm, wet climates but were associated with smaller species range sizes, suggesting a trade-off between persistence and dispersal potential. Similarly, ornamented spores were more common in warm, wet climates and were associated with narrower range sizes. Cell wall investment (i.e., wall thickness relative to volume) decreased in warmer, wetter climates compared to cooler, drier ones and was the strongest predictor of species range size, with intermediate investment associated with larger geographic distributions. Spore shape and color (i.e., melanin pigmentation) also exhibited climate-driven patterns, with spherical spores and greater pigmentation more common in warm, wet climates. Phylogenetic analyses revealed high conservatism for spore ornamentation, moderate for volume, low for color, and none for shape and cell wall investment. Additionally, functional diversity analyses showed that warm, wet climates promote higher within-community trait richness but lower trait divergence, while broader climatic variability drives higher beta diversity. These findings support growing evidence that trait–environment relationships extend to microbial communities, reflecting ecological principles such as environmental filtering, evolutionary constraint, and dispersal–persistence trade-offs. Incorporating microbial traits improves predictions of biogeographic shifts and their cascading effects on plant–microbe interactions and ecosystem stability under climate change.",

Herein, we found that natural soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor 1- O -acetyl-4 R ,6 S -britannilactone (AB) regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways to suppress the microglial activation by regulating inflammation and autophagy in vitro and in vivo, contributing to the improvement of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated neuroinflammation. Protein microarray analysis indicated that AB could selectively target PDZ binding kinase (PBK) through covalently binding to C70, exhibiting a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.62 μM, which was corroborated by subsequent chemical biology experiments. We gained a deeper understanding of the mechanistic by which AB interfered PBK function, specifically by disrupting its interaction with tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein-8 like-2 (TIPE2), blocking the serine 3 (S3) phosphorylation-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation of TIPE2. Additionally, our study revealed that PBK genetic deletion alleviated the course of LPS-mediated neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo, and AB did not exhibit any extra effects in LPS-mediated PBK -/- mice. These findings first offered broader prospects for treating neuroinflammation by targeting PBK to repress inflammation and activate autophagy, suggesting that AB had the potential to serve as a direct inhibitor in the PBK–TIPE2 interaction.",

          "abstract": "Lithium (Li) metal batteries offer high energy density but face significant safety challenges due to gas evolution under thermal abuse conditions. At the anode, the reduction of organic carbonate-based electrolytes generates flammable gases (e.g., H 2 , CH 4 ), while the poor thermal stability of the cathode results in the release of O 2 , CO, and CO 2 . The accumulation of these gases contributes to mechanical rupture, and their migration further exacerbates thermal runaway. To address these challenges, we propose a smart gas management strategy that constructs continuous flame-retardant interfaces (FRIs) by incorporating flame-retardant polymers (FRPs) into the cathode. Smart gas management is defined as the ability to suppress gas production, alter gas composition to reduce flammability, and mitigate internal pressure buildup, thereby preventing thermal runaway. The FRIs significantly enhance the thermal stability of the cathode by suppressing oxygen release and minimizing electrolyte oxidation caused by active oxygen species. Additionally, the FRP releases flame-retardant radicals that diffuse into the electrolyte, interrupting reactions that generate flammable gases at the anode. This dual-action mechanism reduces gas production and mitigates the risks associated with thermal runaway, forming the foundation of a smart gas management strategy. With this strategy, we demonstrate zero thermal runaway in a 0.58-Ah Li||NCM811 pouch cell with 100% state of charge under thermal abuse conditions. This approach is highly compatible with current manufacturing processes, offering a scalable solution for improving the safety of high-energy-density Li metal batteries. This work provides a promising pathway toward fire-safe Li metal batteries for electric vehicles and other energy storage applications.",

          "abstract": "To persist under unprecedented rates of global change, populations can adapt or acclimate. However, how these resilience mechanisms interact, particularly the role of epigenetic variation in long-term adaptation, is unknown. To address this gap, we experimentally evolved the foundational marine copepod Acartia tonsa for 25 generations under ocean acidification, warming, and their combination and then measured epigenomic, genomic, and transcriptomic responses. We observed clear and consistent epigenomic and genomic divergence between treatments, with epigenomic divergence concentrated in genes related to stress response and the regulation of transposable elements. However, epigenetic and genetic changes were inversely related and occurred in different regions of the genome; levels of genetic differentiation (F ST ) were up to 2.5× higher in regions where methylation did not differ between treatments compared to regions with significant methylation changes. This negative relationship between epigenetic and genetic divergence could be driven by local inhibition of one another or distinct functional targets of selection. Finally, epigenetic divergence was positively, though weakly, associated with gene expression divergence, suggesting that epigenetic changes may facilitate phenotypic change. Taken together, these results suggest that unique, complementary genetic and epigenetic mechanisms promote resilience to global change.",

Structural elucidation of GPCRs is crucial for drug discovery efforts. However, structural studies of GPCRs remain challenging, particularly for inactive-state structures, which often require extensive protein engineering. Here, we present a de novo design strategy termed “click fusion” for generating fusion proteins to facilitate GPCR structural studies. Our method involves the rational design of structurally stable protein domains rigidly linked to GPCRs. The resulting fusion protein enhances the thermostability of the target GPCR and aids in determining GPCR structures via cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We further demonstrate that the designed fusion protein can be transferred among structurally similar GPCRs with minor adjustments to the linker region. Our study introduces a promising approach for facilitating GPCR structural studies and advancing drug discovery efforts.",

According to predictive coding, optimal learning, which maximizes epistemic value, depends on balancing predictability and uncertainty, implying that musical pleasure should also reflect this equilibrium. We tested this idea in two independent large samples using a novel decision-making paradigm, where participants indicated preferences for melodies varying in surprise and entropy. Consistent with prior research, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between predictability and preference. Moreover, our results revealed an interaction between predictability and entropy, with smaller surprises preferred in low-entropy melodies and larger surprises favored in high-entropy music, consistent with predictive coding principles. Computational models incorporating this interaction predicted individuals’ genre preferences and pleasure responses to real compositions, highlighting its applicability to real-world music experiences. These findings advance our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms driving music preferences and the role of predictive processes in affective responses.",

Yet a number of existing microrobot platforms, despite significant advantages in speed, robustness, power consumption, or ease of fabrication, have no clear path toward electronics integration, limiting their potential for intelligence. Here, we show how to upgrade a class of self-propelled particles into electronically integrated microrobots, reaping the best of both platforms in a single design. Inspired by electrokinetic micromotors, these robots generate electric fields in a surrounding fluid, and by extension propulsive electrokinetic flows. The underlying physics is captured by a model in which robot speed is proportional to applied current, making design and control straightforward. As proof, we build basic robots at the 100-micron scale that use rudimentary, on-board photovoltaic circuits and a closed-loop optical control scheme to navigate waypoints and move in coordinated swarms at speeds of up to one body length per second. Broadly, the unification of micromotor propulsion with on-robot electronics invites future work to realize robust, fast, easy to manufacture, electronically programmable microrobots that remain operationally viable for months to years.",

          "abstract": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is the metabolic gatekeeper to the photoreceptors, thus playing many essential roles in healthy vision. Under certain conditions, RPE cells may transdifferentiate and migrate from the RPE layer. Ectopic RPE cells are potential signal sources for hyperreflective foci, prominent clinically visible biomarkers in age-related macular degeneration, which causes central vision loss globally. Applying multiple imaging modalities including ex vivo optical coherence tomography, autofluorescence microscopy, and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to human retina tissue, we compared lipid profiles in ectopic and orthotopic RPE cells. Our results showed that ectopic RPE cells share some molecular signatures with normal RPE cells as revealed through autofluorescence imaging and IMS. In both orthotopic and ectopic RPE cells, IMS detected phosphatidylglycerol, PG 36:2, and several triacylglycerols containing long-chain fatty acids. GM3 gangliosides (40:1, 42:1, and 42:2) were also detected in ectopic RPE cells with differences in abundance in different populations of ectopic RPE cells. Lactosylceramide (LacCer 44:5) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer 44:5) were found exclusively in ectopic RPE cells. In contrast, ectopic RPE did not exhibit signals of phosphatidylinositols (PI) (PI32:0, PI32:1, PI34:1, and PI34:2) normally detected in RPE cells. Near-single-cell resolution IMS results suggest that RPE transdifferentiation, with loss of normal functions and gain of new functions like migration, may be linked to altered metabolism of glycosphingolipids and PIs.",

          "abstract": "Cytochalasin D (CytoD), a widely used actin inhibitor, is typically employed in cell studies as a simple barbed end capper. However, accumulating evidence suggests broader effects on actin dynamics. We addressed this by observing single actin filaments using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Our depolymerization assay confirmed that, at nanomolar concentrations, CytoD tightly caps barbed ends. The K 1/2 for inhibition was 4.1 nM, consistent with previous bulk measurements, and our approach revealed a capping duration of ~2 min. In polymerization assays, nanomolar CytoD completely suppressed barbed end elongation. Interestingly, at subnanomolar concentrations, CytoD caps barbed ends only transiently, rapidly associating and dissociating under both polymerizing and depolymerizing conditions. We interpreted this contradictory behavior as arising from differences in binding modes: capping one strand (fast dissociation) or both strands (slow dissociation). CytoD severs actin filaments at micromolar levels, a concentration range commonly used in cell biological studies. Although the severing rate is slower than cofilin, its higher frequency leads to filament fragmentation. Severing activity was suppressed by inorganic phosphate or cofilin. Our crystal structure of CytoD bound to filamentous conformation (F-form) actin showed that CytoD fits better in the hydrophobic cleft of F-form actin than monomeric conformation actin, explaining its preference for barbed end subunits. CytoD prevents barbed end depolymerization by stabilizing the terminal subunits in the F-form, which is supported by our MD simulations. These findings reveal the molecular mechanisms by which CytoD modulates actin dynamics and highlight the need for careful dosage control when treating cells with CytoD.",

Cribra orbitalia was associated with several hallmarks of compromised immune function, including fewer B cells, fewer naïve CD4 + T cells, a lower CD4 + /CD8 + T cell ratio, and higher tuberculosis risk. However, neither lesion type predicted other physician-diagnosed respiratory diseases, other markers of cell-mediated immunity, or hemoglobin values.

In this study, we used heterochronic parabiosis (HP) combined with single-cell RNA sequencing to generate comprehensive transcriptomic profiles of murine retinas from young, aged, and HP pairs, aiming to identify antiaging targets. Our analysis revealed extensive transcriptional alterations across retinal cell types with aging. HP experiments demonstrated that systemic factors from young mice rejuvenated aged retinas and alleviated senescent phenotypes, while aged blood accelerated aging in young mice. Integrative analysis pinpointed adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and the downstream adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway as central to the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal rejuvenation. Treatment with the AdipoR1 agonist AdipoRon reversed retinal aging. Mechanistically, AdipoR1-AMPK activation promoted mitochondrial function, contributing to the restoration of youthful cellular phenotypes. Together, our study identifies AdipoR1 as a therapeutic target for retinal aging and provides insights into the molecular programs driving retinal rejuvenation.",

Our findings suggest strong genetic influence on several traits, particularly B cell abundance. In contrast, cytokine responses from in vitro stimulations appeared mainly shaped by environmental exposures. Regarding associations with atopy, greater abundance of both B cells and basophils were observed in atopic individuals as well as increased expression of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor.

We find that within a range of anchor stiffnesses around 1 micronewton per micrometer, the homeostatic tension in muscle is insensitive to stiffness, offering greater design flexibility. The proximity of motor neurons results in a fourfold improvement in muscle contractility. Improved contractility and nonlinear design allow for a peak swimming speed about two orders of magnitude higher than previous biohybrid flagellate swimmers, reaching 0.58 body lengths per minute (86.8 micrometers per second), by a mechanism involving inertia that we verify through flow field imaging.

This screen revealed a notable synthetic lethality when MYC inhibition was paired with disruption of mitochondrial complex I components, but not other complexes. Mechanistically, MYC inhibition reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, triggering a compensatory up-regulation of complex I genes. Consequently, genetic or pharmacological targeting of complex I sensitized tumors to MYCi975 treatment, leading to increased purine catabolism and infiltration of CD8 + T cells and macrophages into tumors. Additionally, a wide range of tumor cells with lower complex I expression showed increased MYC dependency.

To overcome these limitations, we developed a flexible multichannel electrical impedance sensor (FMEIS) for noninvasive detection of skeletal muscle contractions. By applying an imperceptible current, the FMEIS can target multiple deep muscles by capturing electric-field ripples generated by their contractions. With an ultrathin profile (~220 micrometers), a low elastic modulus (212.8 kilopascals) closely matching human skin, and engineered adhesive sensor surfaces, the FMEIS conforms nicely to human skin with minimized motion artifacts. The FMEIS achieved high accuracy in both hand gesture recognition and muscle force prediction using machine learning models.

This is more efficient than the conventional approach that serially creates birefringent voxels in glass (e.g., nanogratings or oblate nanopores) via scanning an ultrafast laser while varying its polarizations. We demonstrated parallel writing of 16 by 16 birefringent voxels with eight different slow-axis azimuths by controlling the shapes of the projected light spots. Next, we demonstrated five-layer parallel data writing with 100% readout accuracy and a 1.5-terabyte storage capacity per disc. With a high repetition rate femtosecond laser amplifier (e.g., 100 kilohertz), our method may achieve a theoretical writing speed of 7.5 megabytes per second, paving the way for high-speed, high-capacity optical data storage.",

          "abstract": "WNK family kinases are regulated by osmotic stress and control ion homeostasis by activating SPAK and OXSR1 kinases. Using a proximity labeling approach, we found that osmotic stress promotes the association of WNK1 with the NRBP1 pseudokinase and TSC22D2/4 adaptor proteins, results that are confirmed by immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting studies. NRBP1 pseudokinase is closely related to WNK isoforms and contains a RΦ-motif–binding conserved C-terminal (CCT) domain, like the CCT domains in WNKs, SPAK, and OXSR1. Knockdown or knockout of NRBP1 markedly inhibited basal as well as sorbitol-induced activation of WNK1 and downstream components. We demonstrate that recombinant NRBP1 can directly induce the activation of WNK4 in vitro. AlphaFold-3 modeling predicts that WNK1, SPAK, NRBP1, and TSC22D4 form a complex, in which two TSC22D4 RΦ-motifs interact with the CCTL1 domain of WNK1 and the CCT domain of NRBP1. Our data indicate that NRBP1 and likely its close homolog NRBP2 function as an upstream activator of the WNK pathway.",

We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy, we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AFM. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS, we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Last, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency.

Ti-mitoEVs that contain abundant functional mitochondria can be highly efficiently isolated from muscles via an optimized method. In vitro, Ti-mitoEV treatment increased mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced mitochondrial damage in recipient cells, and these effects occurred at least partly via mitochondrial genome transfer. In vivo, Ti-mitoEV treatment attenuated diverse types of tissue injury (e.g., muscle and kidney) by rescuing mitochondrial injury and its associated inflammation. As natural nanovesicles, the therapeutic potency of mitoEVs can be further improved by integrating them with other engineering methods. This study highlights the promising role of Ti-mitoEVs in boosting mitochondrial biogenesis, positioning them as potential therapies for treating various types of tissue injury characterized by mitochondrial damage.",

There was no evidence to support the other hypotheses, although the possibility of microbubble formation due to bubble aggregation/coalescence or swelling due to gas absorption in vivo could not be completely ruled out. Nanobubbles may offer advantages in terms of circulatory stability and potential for therapeutic delivery compared with microbubbles, but these advantages must be weighed against the need to use higher bubble concentrations, higher ultrasound frequencies, and/or higher intensities to achieve equivalent imaging and/or therapeutic effects.",

While enabling smaller feature sizes, EUV lithography imposes increasingly stringent requirements on the comprehensive performance and stochastic defect suppression of photoresist. The widely recognized strategy to minimize these defects is a material that integrates high EUV absorption and energy utilization into a homogeneous system based on molecular building blocks—the ideal formulation for EUV photoresist. However, achieving these integrated characteristics within a single molecule has remained an unresolved challenge. Here, we address all these requirements by polytelluoxane using an organic telluride monomer polymerized via Te─O bonds. This polymeric photoresist, operating through a main chain scission mechanism, demonstrates high-performance positive-tone lithography. Attributed to this ideal formulation, our photoresist achieves a comprehensive 18-nm line width at a dose of 13.1 mJ/cm 2 with a line edge roughness of 1.97 nm.

Host-responsive CathB proteins localize to plant processing bodies (p-bodies), cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules involved in messenger RNA storage or decay. Upon localization, these CathB proteins recruit key immune regulators EDS1, PAD4, and ADR1 to these bodies, suppressing plant defenses. A plant protein, Acd28.9 (Hsp20 family), counteracts this CathB activity and contributes to plant resistance to aphids.

These designs enable the creation of three-dimensional structures with spatially varying mechanical properties, ranging from tissue-like compliance to rigid, bone-like load-bearing capabilities.

We establish a positive correlation between the density of BDs, macroscopic polarization, and strain response. The BDs in BNT-based thin films leads to a remarkable enhancement in the strain response, reaching ~400% of the virgin state. This enhancement arises from the lower energy barriers for dipole flipping and domain switching associated with BDs, in comparison to conventional domain structures. Under an applied electric field, the rotation of polarized BDs, combined with a reduction in dipole flux due to the articulated rotation between BDs and surrounding domains, further amplifies the strain response. These findings advance our understanding of BDs in electromechanical materials and provide theoretical guidance for designing high-performance piezoelectrics with polar topologies.",

Using this framework, we fabricated elastomeric robotic actuators and demonstrated 3D printing with direct ink writing. The actuators achieved 50% higher curvature with the same design, and the 3D-printed parts exhibited over 200% improvement in interlayer adhesion.

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents reward attributes, such as delay and magnitude, alongside expected uncertainties about upcoming rewards, serving its established role in both value- and risk-based behaviors. However, the cellular basis of how reward and uncertainty interact remains unclear. To investigate, we trained rats on a task where odor cues predicted sucrose rewards with varying uncertainties in delay or magnitude. Single-unit recordings revealed that many OFC neurons encoded expected uncertainties related to reward delay or magnitude. Population-level analysis showed distinct neural codes for delay and magnitude uncertainties, separate from those for reward delay and magnitude. Signals for each reward attribute and associated uncertainty converged onto the same neurons, reducing the sensitivity of delay and magnitude encoding as uncertainty increased. These findings suggest a cellular-level computation in OFC neurons, whereby uncertainty signals are integrated into attribute-specific reward representations, potentially supporting flexible learning and risk control.",

          "abstract": "Biological lifeforms can heal, grow, adapt, and reproduce, which are abilities essential for sustained survival and development. In contrast, robots today are primarily monolithic machines with limited ability to self-repair, physically develop, or incorporate material from their environments. While robot minds rapidly evolve new behaviors through artificial intelligence, their bodies remain closed systems, unable to systematically integrate material to grow or heal. We argue that open-ended physical adaptation is only possible when robots are designed using a small repertoire of simple modules. This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot platform. We show how robots can grow bigger, faster, and more capable by consuming materials from their environment and other robots. We suggest that machine metabolic processes like those demonstrated here will be an essential part of any sustained future robot ecology.",

          "abstract": "Human impacts on carnivores are a persistent conservation challenge worldwide. We present a global analysis showing the overlap of conservation lands and the cumulative impact of humans on the distribution ranges of 257 terrestrial carnivore species. Our findings reveal that 64% of carnivore ranges overlap with areas characterized by high human pressures. We found that Indigenous peoples’ lands emerge as crucial for carnivore population viability, potentially safeguarding 26% of carnivore ranges globally, while protected and wilderness areas cover roughly 10 and 16% of carnivore ranges, respectively. These three areas combined cover 35% of the global range of carnivores. Reducing human pressure on conservation lands and managing them to protect carnivores are therefore critical, yet challenging. The extent of carnivore ranges outside these areas underscores the necessity to expand the network of conservation lands, which are a pivotal component of global conservation planning, alongside broader proactive species-specific conservation measures.",

          "abstract": "Biohybrid actuators using muscle rings have been limited to twitching movements and are unsuitable for sustained contractile force applications. In this study, we developed muscle rings capable of generating high contractile forces under tetanus stimulation. By enhancing the rigidity of pillar-shaped supports and increasing myoblast density through reduced extracellular matrix, we promoted the formation of dense, well-aligned muscle fiber bundles. The optimized muscle rings exhibited higher contractile forces compared to traditional methods. Integrating these muscle rings with C-shaped anchors efficiently converted contractile force into bending motion. We demonstrated the application of these muscle rings in gripper- and slither-type biohybrid robots, achieving large deformation and undulatory movement. This work advances biohybrid robotics by enabling sophisticated movements requiring continuous and powerful muscle contractions.",

          "abstract": "Membranes with precise ion transport behaviors are regarded as an alternative for lithium (Li) extraction from water streams. Current membranes demonstrate limited viability due to the lack of efficient Li + -selective architectures. We propose an electric field–assisted ion control hypothesis in reinforcing ultraefficient Li + -selective membranes, in which an ionized zeolitic imidazolate framework layer (Q-PEI@ZIF) is constructed via polyethylenimine (PEI) in situ confinement conversion and subsequent quaternization of 2,3-epoxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. In electrodialysis at 5 milliampere per square centimeter, the resulting membrane Q(5%)-PEI(1.0)@ZIF#CEM shows that the ion permeation rates follow the order of K +  ~ Li +  &gt; Na +  &gt; Ca 2+  ~ Mg 2+ , corresponding to 0.31, 0.30, 0.25, 0, and 0 mole per square meter per hour in 120 minutes, respectively. With a 25-millimolar Li + /Mg 2+ mixed solution, it exhibits an unprecedented Li + /Mg 2+ permselectivity of 20,000 and 99.99% purity of Li + product in 120 minutes.

          "abstract": "Glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) represents an economical pathway for transforming renewable feedstock to value-added chemicals. However, the inertness of C(sp 3 )─H bonds of glycerol and intermediates results in the high energy barrier of the dehydrogenation step, relating to poor product selectivity at high glycerol conversion. Here, a carbon nanotube–supported PdBO x @Pd heterostructure catalyst (PdBO x @Pd/CNTs) was synthesized in which in situ–exsoluted PdBO x clusters covalently covered Pd nanoparticles, thus yielding strong electronic interaction between Pd nanoparticles and PdBO x clusters. The strong electronic interaction in PdBO x @Pd/CNTs induces the hybridization between Pd(d), B(s, p), and O(s, p) atom orbits, optimizing the adsorption of reactants and intermediates, thus enhancing the activity for the GOR. The density functional theory calculation result reveals that the strong electronic interaction in PdBO x @Pd/CNTs facilitates the hydrogen transfer in the primary C─H bond of the CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 O* intermediate, thus reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step and improving glyceric acid selectivity toward the GOR.",

          "abstract": "Engineered skeletal muscle holds potential for tissue engineering and biohybrid robotics applications. However, current strategies face challenges in enhancing force generation while maintaining stability and scalability of the muscle, largely due to insufficient oxygenation and limited nutrient delivery. In this study, we present an engineering approach to address these limitations by coculturing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( C. reinhardtii ), a photosynthetic unicellular green microalga, with C2C12 myoblasts in a hydrogel matrix. Leveraging the photosynthetic activity of C. reinhardtii , our microalgae-empowered muscle (MAM) constructs exhibited superior contractility and almost three times higher active force generation compared to conventional muscle constructs. MAM showed higher cellular viability and reduced tissue damage, attributed to in situ oxygenation and nutrient supply provided by microalgal photosynthesis. In addition, improved myotube alignment was observed in MAM, which contributed to enhanced force generation. Our findings showcase the potential of photosynthetic microalgae as a functional component in engineered skeletal muscle, offering a solution to longstanding challenges in muscle engineering.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric methane concentration (AMC) surged by ~50% during the last deglaciation, with northern (&gt;30°N) sources accounting for ~40% of the rise. However, hypothesized sources including expanding lakes, peatlands, and destabilized permafrost or hydrates fail to explain this rapid increase. We use biomarkers, isotopes, and radiocarbon data to reconstruct temperature change, methane cycling, and permafrost thaw from a Tibetan thermokarst lake. Radiocarbon evidence and ultradepleted δ 13 C values (−80.3 per mil) of methane-diagnostic lipids indicate intense cycling of ancient (~2500-year-old) methane during the Younger Dryas–Preboreal transition, coeval with the AMC surge and the most rapid warming. By contrast, methane cycling was weak during the Holocene Climatic Optimum despite peak temperatures. These findings imply that anomalously high rates of warming, rather than absolute temperature alone, may play an important role in triggering enhanced paleo-methane cycling. Rapid warming likely intensified emissions from existing northern lakes, fueling the elusive yet clearly amplified northern methane source that contributed to the deglacial abrupt rise in AMC.",

However, challenges such as limited force output and inefficient force transfer at tissue interfaces persist. The myotendinous junction, a specialized interface connecting muscle to the tendon, plays a critical role in efficient force transmission for movement. Engineering muscle-tendon units in vitro is essential for replicating native musculoskeletal functions in biohybrid actuators. Here, we present a three-dimensionally bioprinted system integrating skeletal muscle tissue with tendon-mimicking anchors containing fibroblasts, forming a biomimetic interdigitated myotendinous junction. Using computational models, we optimized muscle geometries to enhance deformation and force generation. The engineered system improved mechanical stability, myofiber maturation, and force transmission, generating contractile forces of up to 350 micronewtons over a 3-month period. This work highlights how biomimetic designs and mechanical optimization can advance bioactuator technologies for applications in medicine and robotics.",
