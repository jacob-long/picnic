Imagine, then, the puzzled faces of the referees who first read a paper reporting direct experimental evidence that atomically thin films of graphite not only exist, but are stable at room temperature — and conduct electricity remarkably well. What had prevented those layers of carbon atoms from melting or even flying off in fragments? It turns out that real life doesn’t always abide by the assumptions of mathematical theorems. The referees evidently agreed, and so, 20 years ago, Science published a paper in which Novoselov et al.2 showed that layers of ‘graphene’ could exist.",

Here the authors examine the integration of GenAI as a tool for human learning, addressing its promises and challenges from a holistic viewpoint that integrates insights from learning sciences, educational technology and human–computer interaction. GenAI promises to enhance learning experiences by scaling personalized support, diversifying learning materials, enabling timely feedback and innovating assessment methods. However, it also presents critical issues such as model imperfections, ethical dilemmas and the disruption of traditional assessments. Thus, cultivating AI literacy and adaptive skills is imperative for facilitating informed engagement with GenAI technologies. Rigorous research across learning contexts is essential to evaluate GenAI’s effect on human cognition, metacognition and creativity. Humanity must learn with and about GenAI, ensuring that it becomes a powerful ally in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, rather than a crutch that undermines our intellectual abilities.",

          "abstract": "Maintaining COVID-19 vaccine demand was key to ending the global health emergency. To help do this, many governments used chatbots that provided personalized information guiding people on where, when and how to get vaccinated. We designed and tested a WhatsApp chatbot to understand whether two-way interactive messaging incorporating behaviourally informed functionalities could perform better than one-way message reminders. We ran a large-scale preregistered randomized controlled trial with 249,705 participants in Argentina, measuring vaccinations using Ministry of Health records. The behaviourally informed chatbot more than tripled COVID-19 vaccine uptake compared with the control group (a 1.6 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (1.36 pp, 1.77 pp)) and nearly doubled uptake compared with the one-way message reminder (a 1 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (0.83 pp, 1.17 pp)). Communications tools designed with behaviourally informed functionalities that simplify the vaccine user journey can increase vaccination more than traditional message reminders and may have applications to other health behaviours.",

Because physical face-to-face interactions were limited, virtual online interactions became the norm in a remarkably short period of time. Since then, people worldwide have embraced a society in which meetings can occur anytime without geographical constraints through online video calls, and in environments that support natural human activities, such as virtual reality spaces (including the metaverse).\n\nThis expansion of geographically unconstrained online social interactions has created opportunities for social participation among those who cannot leave their homes owing to illness or disability1. Thanks to improved virtual communication systems, people can now work with fewer limitations imposed by location, time and language. Video conferences enable participation with desired avatars, and collaborative meetings in virtual reality spaces are emerging. Human society has an unprecedented opportunity to facilitate participation from previously marginalized groups, such as disabled individuals providing services in cafes through robots2,3.",

          "abstract": "Executive function (EF) delays are well documented in paediatric neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs). There is no consensus about whether EF delay represents a transdiagnostic feature of NDCs. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized 180 studies reporting two or more NDC comparisons on EF, examined differences between NDCs, and the moderating effects of gender, age, publication year, DSM editions and assessment types. Studies using established EF measures across seven domains (attention, fluency, set-shifting, set-switching, response inhibition, planning and working memory) in participants under 18 were included. Summary effects were compared: (1) for all reported NDCs relative to control, (2) for each individual NDC relative to control and (3) between NDC groups. Results confirmed that EF delay was a transdiagnostic feature of neurodevelopmental delay, with a moderate effect size of delay across all NDCs ( g = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–0.63) compared with control. This effect increased with comorbidities ( g = 0.72, 95% CI 0.59–0.86), DSM-5 criteria and informant measures. Comparisons between NDCs revealed few differences: children with tic disorders (TD) showed smaller EF delays, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed larger delays in attention, response inhibition, planning and working memory compared with TD and specific learning disorders, while children with autism spectrum disorders showed greater delays on set-switching compared with ADHD. Findings support transdiagnostic models of neurodevelopment to further a developmentally sensitive science that can reveal how EF delays contribute to brain circuitry, symptom profiles and functioning, and ultimately support early interventions and outcomes for all children with NDCs.",

          "abstract": "Public concerns about the societal effects of generative artificial intelligence (AI) are shaped by narratives that have the potential to influence research priorities and policy agendas. Understanding the origins and dynamics of these narratives is crucial to effectively address the actual impacts of AI and ensure a constructive discourse about its risks and potential.\n\nThis shift in media coverage points to the need for a closer examination of the underlying discourse. We currently see four main types of narratives around generative AI:\n\n(1)\n\nThe ‘existential risk’ narrative contends that existential risks from artificial superintelligence or artificial general intelligence could stem from the next generations of generative AI-type systems. As generative AI systems become more sophisticated, their capabilities could surpass human control and lead to potentially existentially catastrophic consequences. Strong versions of this narrative raise the concern that artificial superintelligence or artificial general intelligence technologies could lead to human extinction3.\n\n(2)\n\nThe ‘effective accelerationist’ narrative champions the rapid development of AI. Proponents argue that its potential benefits for solving complex global problems far outweigh the risks, and the existential risks from advanced AI are zero or near zero and so can be dismissed4. This narrative is driven by a strong belief in the power of AI progress to bring about substantial positive change.\n\n(3)\n\nThe ‘real, immediate societal risks’ narrative focuses only on the tangible, immediate societal risks of generative AI. It emphasizes issues such as the creation of deepfake pornography, unjust capability distribution or the growing environmental effects of generative AI, and argues that these present-day concerns are much more pressing and relevant than speculative existential risks. Proponents of this view argue that focusing on distant existential threats distracts us from addressing the real and present dangers of AI5.\n\n(4)\n\nThe ‘balanced risks’ narrative advocates for an approach to AI risk governance that acknowledges both the existential and immediate societal risks posed by AI. It encourages finding meaningful connections between these two classes of risks, and suggests that addressing them in tandem can lead to more comprehensive and effective risk mitigation strategies and policies6.",

We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and artificial intelligence thought partners can engage, and we propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, we motivate an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the partners we construct actively build and reason over models of the human and world.",

          "abstract": "Nuanced portrayals of stigmatized groups in media have been shown to reduce prejudice. In an online experiment (N = 749), we tested whether a feature film depicting incarcerated peoples’ experiences in the criminal justice system can increase a) empathic accuracy and compassion toward people who have been incarcerated and b) support for criminal justice reform. We measured baseline empathic accuracy via a well-validated task, where participants infer the emotions of people sharing stories about difficult life events. All storytellers were formerly incarcerated and students. However, in half the videos we labeled them as “formerly incarcerated” and in the remaining half as “college student.” We then surveyed people’s baseline attitudes toward criminal justice reform. Next, we assigned participants to watch one of three films. The intervention film chronicled the true stories of Black men on death row. Two docudramas of similar length served as control films. Finally, participants completed the empathic accuracy task and survey again and were given the opportunity to sign a petition. Compared to those who watched a control film, participants who watched the intervention film more accurately inferred the emotions of storytellers labeled “formerly incarcerated,” and increased their support for criminal justice reform. These effects held for conservative and liberal participants alike. However, the film had no effect on feelings of compassion. Together, these results demonstrate the power of narrative interventions to not only increase empathic accuracy for members of a severely stigmatized group, but to increase support for reforms designed to improve their lives.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between sociopolitical organization and violence remains an enduring question in anthropological research. Less studied is the articulation of gender with violence in societies of different sociopolitical organization. We investigate the frequency and type of violence experienced by adult males and females in pre-Hispanic Andean archaeological contexts, comparing exposure to antemortem (nonlethal) and perimortem (potentially lethal) violence across three categories of sociopolitical organization: autonomous communities, regional cultural formations, and states. Using a database of 8,607 adults from 169 publications and over 155 sites, we construct a multinomial logistic regression using Bayesian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to fit our model. The odds of antemortem and perimortem trauma were low for both sexes. However, the odds of antemortem trauma were consistently higher for males than females in all categories of sociopolitical organization, suggesting that men were more frequently exposed to violence. Males display similar odds of cranial trauma across all forms of sociopolitical organization, while females display slightly reduced odds of cranial trauma in states compared to autonomous communities. Perimortem trauma is especially strongly patterned by sex. In autonomous communities, the odds of potentially lethal cranial trauma are equivalent between the sexes; in states, they are consistent for males, but depressed for females. In the pre-Hispanic Andes, living in states dramatically reduced the chances of encountering lethal violence for females, but not males. Our study complicates the notion that increasing sociopolitical complexity leads to decreasing interpersonal violence and highlights the importance of gender in understanding the human history of violence.",

          "abstract": "Reducing hostility in social media interactions is a key public concern. Most extant research emphasizes how online contextual factors breed hostility. Here, we take a different perspective and focus on the offline roots of hostility, that is, offline experiences and stable individual-level dispositions. Using a unique dataset of Danish Twitter users (N = 4,931), we merge data from administrative government registries with a behavioral measure of online hostility. We demonstrate that individuals with more aggressive dispositions (as proxied by having many more criminal verdicts) are more hostile in social media conversations. We also find evidence that features of childhood environments predict online hostility. Time spent in foster care is a strong correlate, while other indicators of childhood instability (e.g., the number of moves and divorced parents) are not. Furthermore, people from more resourceful childhood environments—those with better grades in primary school and higher parental socioeconomic status—are more hostile on average, as such people are more politically engaged. These results offer an important reminder that much online hostility is rooted in offline experiences and stable dispositions. They also provide anuanced view of the core group of online aggressors. While these individuals display general antisocial personality tendencies by having many more criminal verdicts, they also come from resourceful backgrounds more often than not.",

          "abstract": "The major organelles of the endomembrane system were in place by the time of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) (~1.5 billion years ago). Their acquisitions were defining milestones during eukaryogenesis. Comparative cell biology and evolutionary analyses show multiple instances of homology in the protein machinery controlling distinct interorganelle trafficking routes. Resolving these homologous relationships allows us to explore processes underlying the emergence of additional, distinct cellular compartments, infer ancestral states predating LECA, and explore the process of eukaryogenesis itself. Here, we undertake a molecular evolutionary analysis (including providing a transcriptome of the jakobid flagellate Reclinomonas americana ), exploring the origins of the machinery responsible for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LROs), the Biogenesis of LRO Complexes (BLOCs 1,2, and 3). This pathway has been studied only in animals and is not considered a feature of the basic eukaryotic cell plan. We show that this machinery is present across the eukaryotic tree of life and was likely in place prior to LECA, making it an underappreciated facet of eukaryotic cellular organisation. Moreover, we resolve multiple points of ancient homology between all three BLOCs and other post-endosomal retrograde trafficking machinery (BORC, CCZ1 and MON1 proteins, and an unexpected relationship with the “homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting” (HOPS) and “Class C core vacuole/endosomal tethering” (CORVET) complexes), offering a mechanistic and evolutionary unification of these trafficking pathways. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive account of the rise of the LROs biogenesis machinery from before the LECA to current eukaryotic diversity, integrating it into the larger mechanistic framework describing endomembrane evolution.",

          "abstract": "Liquid–liquid phase separation has emerged as a crucial mechanism driving the formation of membraneless biomolecular condensates, which play important roles in numerous cellular processes. These condensates, found both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, are formed through multivalent, low-affinity interactions between various molecules. P62-containing condensates serve, among other functions, as proteolytic hubs for the ubiquitin–proteasome system. In this study, we investigated the dynamic interplay between nuclear p62 condensates and promyelocytic nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). We show that p62 condensates stabilize PML-NBs under both basal conditions and following exposure to arsenic trioxide which stimulates their degradation. We further show that this effect on the stability of PML-NBs is due to sequestration of their ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 in the p62 condensates with subsequent rapid degradation of the ligase. The sequestration of the ligase is made possible by association between the proline-rich domain of the PML protein and the PB1 domain of p62, which results in the formation of a PML-NB shell around the p62 condensates. Importantly, these hybrid structures do not undergo fusion and mixing of their contents which leaves unsolved the mechanism of sequestration of RNF4 in the condensates. These findings suggest an additional possible mechanism of PML-NB as a tumor suppressor which is mediated via interactions between different biomolecular condensates.",

To quantitatively assess the individual contributions of human ASCT1 and ASCT2 to the fusogenic activity of Syncytin-1, we developed a model system where the ASCT1 and ASCT2 double knockout was rescued by ectopic expression of either ASCT1 or ASCT2. We demonstrated that ASCT2 was required for Syncytin-1 binding, cellular entry, and cell-to-cell fusion, while ASCT1 was not involved in this receptor interaction. We experimentally validated the ASCT1–ASCT2 heterotrimers as a possible explanation for the previous misidentification of ASCT1 as a receptor for Syncytin-1.

However, there is no comprehensive pan-Arctic overview of industrial and urban development, which is crucial for the planning of sustainable development of the region. In this study, we utilize satellite-derived artificial light at night (ALAN) data to quantify the hotspots and the development of light-emitting human activity across the Arctic from 1992 to 2013. We find that out of 16.4 million km 2 analyzed a total area of 839,710 km 2 (5.14%) is lit by human activity with an annual increase of 4.8%. The European Arctic and the oil and gas extraction regions in Russia and Alaska are hotspots of ALAN with up to a third of the land area lit, while the Canadian Arctic remains dark to a large extent. On average, only 15% of lit area in the Arctic contains human settlement, indicating that artificial light is largely attributable to industrial human activity. With this study, we provide a standardized approach to spatially assess human industrial activity across the Arctic, independent from economic data. Our results provide a crucial baseline for sustainable development and conservation planning across the highly vulnerable Arctic region.",

          "abstract": "The dysfunction of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) facilitates the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While targeting the UPS for HCC therapy has been proposed, identifying effective targets has been challenging. In this study, we conducted a focused screen of siRNA libraries targeting UPS-related WD40 repeat (WDR) proteins and found that silencing WDR20, a deubiquitinating enzyme activating factor, selectively inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells without affecting normal hepatocytes. Moreover, the downregulation of WDR20 expression induced HCC cellular senescence and suppressed tumor progression in xenograft, sleeping beauty transposon/transposase, and hydrodynamic tail vein injection-induced HCC models, and Alb-Cre + / MYC + HCC transgenic mouse models. Mechanistically, we found that WDR20 silencing disturbed the protein stability of c-Myc, orchestrating the simultaneous USP12/46-mediated deubiquitination of c-Myc, thereby promoting the transcriptional activation of CDKN1A . Further investigation revealed a positive coexpression of WDR20 and c-Myc in a tissue microarray with 88 HCC clinical samples. By employing three patient-derived organoids from individuals with HCC, we have validated the decrease in c-Myc expression and the significant induction of senescence and growth inhibition following silencing of WDR20. This study not only uncovers the biological function of WDR20 and elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying its negative regulation of HCC cellular senescence but also highlight the potential of WDR20 as a promising target for HCC therapy.",

CYC was delivered into lipid bilayer vesicles as well as living cells, with a cellular uptake ratio approaching 90%. Mechanistic studies showed that CYC was internalized into cells through a permeation pathway directly into the cytoplasm, bypassing endosomal entrapment. Upon carrier-assisted internalization, CYC retained its bioactivity, as reflected by an induced cell apoptosis rate of 25% at low dose (1 µM).

          "abstract": "The eIF4F translation initiation complex plays a critical role in melanoma resistance to clinical BRAF and MEK inhibitors. In this study, we uncover a function of eIF4F in the negative regulation of the rat sarcoma (RAS)/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. We demonstrate that eIF4F is essential for controlling ERK signaling intensity in treatment-naïve melanoma cells harboring BRAF or NRAS mutations. Specifically, the dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP6/MKP3, which acts as a negative feedback regulator of ERK activity, requires continuous production in an eIF4F-dependent manner to limit excessive ERK signaling driven by oncogenic RAF/RAS mutations. Treatment with small-molecule eIF4F inhibitors disrupts the negative feedback control of MAPK signaling, leading to ERK hyperactivation and EGR1 overexpression in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our quantitative analyses reveal a high spare signaling capacity in the ERK pathway, suggesting that eIF4F-dependent feedback keeps the majority of ERK molecules inactive under normal conditions. Overall, our findings highlight the crucial role of eIF4F in regulating ERK signaling flux and suggest that pharmacological eIF4F inhibitors can disrupt the negative feedback control of MAPK activity in melanomas with BRAF and NRAS activating mutations.",

As hubs where diverse immune cells converge and interact, the alterations in the immune microenvironment within lymph nodes (LNs) are intricately linked to immune responses. Herein, we designed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) loaded with circular RNA (circRNA) and targeted to LNs, in which CXCL13 was directly integrated into antigen-encoding circRNA strands. We demonstrated that CXCL13 alters the transcriptomic profiles of LNs, especially the upregulation of IL-21 and IL-4. Meanwhile, CXCL13 promotes the formation of germinal center and elicits robust antigen-specific T cell responses. With the codelivery of CXCL13 and the antigen, CXCL13 enhances cross-reactive antibodies against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, achieving protection against both homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges in a mouse model. Notably, the targeted modification of LNP surfaces with antibodies helps address some of the challenges associated with lyophilized LNP vaccines, which is crucial for the long-term storage of LNP-circRNA vaccines. Overall, the circRNA-based antigen-CXCL13 coexpression system developed herein provides a simple and robust platform that enhances the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses against multiple viral glycoproteins, highlighting the potential utility of CXCL13 in inducing broad immune responses.",

          "abstract": "The loss of wild plant populations is often assumed to lead to coextinctions, particularly among specialized insects. Despite global declines in both terrestrial insects and plants, the relationship between these trends remains elusive. Here, we address this gap by analyzing the relationship between population trends of insects and their host plants in Germany, encompassing over 150,000 interactions among 3,429 plant and 2,239 insect species, including both pollinators (bees and hoverflies) and herbivores (butterflies, moths, and sawflies). Our findings reveal parallel population declines of insects and host plants across taxa, except for more generalist hoverflies. However, simulated extinctions of threatened host plants led to limited coextinctions in insects. Notably, 96% of insect species retained over 25% of their host plant diversity, and among those, 98% still retained at least one common species in their interaction portfolio. Even highly specialized insects may persist because they tend to specialize in nonthreatened plant species. While uncertainties remain regarding the interchangeability of host plants, our findings suggest that insect coextinctions are far from a 1:1 match with plant extinctions. Our findings suggest the declining abundance of many plant species can contribute to insect decline yet challenge the common assumption that the extinction of threatened plant species will necessarily trigger an imminent extinction wave of associated insects.

          "abstract": "Metapopulation models have been instrumental in quantifying the ecological impact of landscape structure on the survival of a focal species. However, extensions to multiple species with arbitrary dispersal networks often rely on phenomenological assumptions that inevitably limit their scope. Here, we propose a multilayer network model of competitive dispersing metacommunities to investigate how spatially structured environments impact species coexistence and ecosystem stability. We introduce the concept of landscape-mediated fitness, quantifying how fit a species is in a given environment in terms of colonization and extinction. We show that, when all environments are equivalent, one species excludes all the others—except the marginal case where species fitnesses are in exact trade-off. However, we prove that stable coexistence becomes possible in sufficiently heterogeneous environments by introducing spatial disorder in the model and solving it exactly in the mean-field limit. Crucially, coexistence is supported by the spontaneous localization of species through the emergence of ecological niches. We show that our results remain qualitatively valid in arbitrary dispersal networks, where topological features can improve species coexistence by buffering competition. Finally, we employ our model to study how correlated heterogeneity promotes spatial ecological patterns in realistic terrestrial and riverine landscapes. Our work provides a framework to understand how landscape structure enables coexistence in metacommunities by acting as the substrate for ecological interactions.",

These measurements show that the record-high CH 4 growth in 2020–2022 was accompanied by a sharp decline in δ 13 C CH4 , indicating that the increase in CH 4 abundance was mainly driven by increased emissions from microbial sources such as wetlands, waste, and agriculture.

          "abstract": "Ecological change in the Brazilian Amazon is closely linked to human mobility and health. Mining, agriculture, logging, and other activities alter highly diverse ecological and demographic contexts and subsequent exposure to diseases such as malaria. Studies that have attempted to quantify the impact of deforestation on malaria in the Brazilian Amazon have produced conflicting results. However, they varied in methodology and data sources. Most importantly, all studies used annual data, neglecting the subannual seasonal dynamics of malaria. Here, we fill the knowledge gap on the subannual relationship between ecological change in the Brazilian Amazon and malaria transmission. Using the highest spatiotemporal resolution available, we estimated the effect of deforestation on malaria cases between 2003 and 2022 using a stratified Bayesian spatiotemporal hierarchical zero-inflated Poisson model fitted with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation. The model was also stratified by state. We found that a 1% increase in 1-mo lagged deforestation increased malaria cases in a given month and municipality by 6.3% [95% credible interval (Crl): 6.2, 6.5%]. Based on an interaction term included in the model, the effect of deforestation on malaria was even larger in areas with higher forest cover. We found that the coefficients for deforestation and mobility were highly variable when stratified by state. Our results provide detailed evidence that, on average, deforestation increases malaria transmission, but that the relationship is not spatiotemporally uniform. These results have implications for stratifying malaria control interventions based on ecological dynamics to help Brazil achieve its goal of malaria elimination by 2035.",

          "abstract": "Complement activation through antibody–antigen complexes is crucial in various pathophysiological processes and utilized in immunotherapies to eliminate infectious agents, regulatory immune cells, or cancer cells. The tertiary structures of the four IgG antibody subclasses are largely comparable, with the most prominent difference being the hinge regions connecting the Fab and Fc domains, providing them with unique structural flexibility. Complement recruitment and activation depend strongly on IgG subclass, which is commonly rationalized by differences in hinge flexibility and the respective affinities for C1, the first component of the classical complement pathway. However, a unifying mechanism of how these different IgG subclass properties combine to modulate C1 activation has not yet been proposed. We here demonstrate that complement activation is determined by their varying ability to form IgG oligomers on antigenic surfaces large enough to multivalently bind and activate C1. We directly visualize the resulting IgG oligomer structures and characterize their distribution by means of high-speed atomic force microscopy, quantify their complement recruitment efficiency from quartz crystal microbalance experiments, and characterize their ability to activate complement on tumor cell lines as well as in vesicle-based complement lysis assays. We present a mechanistic model of the multivalent interactions that govern C1 binding to IgG oligomers and use it to extract kinetic rate constants from real-time interaction data from which we further calculate equilibrium dissociation constants. Together, we provide a comprehensive view on the parameters that govern complement activation by the different IgG subclasses, which may inform the design of future antibody therapies.",

Burmese pythons possess extreme intestinal regenerative capacity yet lack crypts, thus providing opportunities to identify noncanonical but potentially conserved mechanisms that expand our understanding of regenerative capacity in vertebrates, including humans. Here, we leverage single-nucleus RNA sequencing of fasted and postprandial python small intestine to identify the signaling pathways and cell–cell interactions underlying the python’s regenerative response. We find that python intestinal regeneration entails the activation of multiple conserved mechanisms of growth and stress response, including core lipid metabolism pathways and the unfolded protein response in intestinal enterocytes. Our single-cell resolution highlights extensive heterogeneity in mesenchymal cell population signaling and intercellular communication that directs major tissue restructuring and the shift out of a dormant fasted state by activating both embryonic developmental and wound healing pathways. We also identify distinct roles of BEST4+ enterocytes in coordinating key regenerative transitions via NOTCH signaling. Python intestinal regeneration shares key signaling features and molecules with mammalian gastric bypass, indicating that conserved regenerative programs are common to both. Our findings provide different insights into cooperative and conserved regenerative programs and intercellular interactions in vertebrates independent of crypts which have been otherwise obscured in model species where temporal phases of generative growth are limited to embryonic development or recovery from injury.",

Infection with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is the strongest environmental risk factor, and HLA-DR15 is the strongest genetic risk factor for MS. We employed computational methods and in vitro assays for CD4 T cell activation to investigate the DR15-restricted response to EBV. Using a machine learning-based HLA ligand predictor, the EBV glycoprotein B (gB) was predicted to be enriched in epitopes restricted to presentation by DRB1*15:01. In DR15-positive individuals, two epitopes comprised the major CD4 T cell response to gB. Surprisingly, the expression of recombinant gB in a DR15-homozygous B cell line or primary autologous B cells elicited a CD4 T cell response, indicating that intracellular gB was loaded onto HLA class II molecules. By deleting the signal sequence of gB, we determined that this pathway for direct activation of CD4 T cells was dependent on trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within the B cell. We screened seven recombinant EBV antigens from the ER compartment for immune responses in DR15-negative vs. DR15-homozygous individuals. In addition to gB, gH was a key CD4 T cell target in individuals homozygous for DR15. Compared to non-DR15 controls, DR15-homozygotes had significantly higher T cell responses to both gB and gH but not to EBV latent or lytic antigens overall. Responses to gB and gH were slightly elevated in DR15 homozygotes with MS. Our results link MS environmental and genetic risk factors by demonstrating that HLA-DR15 dictates CD4 T cell immunity to EBV antigens.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. We demonstrate that enriched Gzmk + CD8 + T cells within the niche of esophageal DCSCs restrict the outgrowth of tumor mass. Nonetheless, DCSCs can escape immune elimination by enhancing PD-L1 signaling, thereby maintaining immune equilibrium. Quiescent fibroblast-derived quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) promotes the expression of PD-L1 and its own expression in DCSCs by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, high QSOX1 in the dormant tumor niche contributes to the exclusion of CD8 + T cells. Conversely, blocking QSOX1 with Ebselen in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy can effectively eradicate residual DCSCs by reducing PD-L1 expression and promoting CD8 + T cell infiltration. Clinically, high expression of QSOX1 predicts a poor response to anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with esophageal cancer. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism whereby QSOX1 promotes PD-L1 upregulation and T cell exclusion, facilitating the immune escape of DCSCs, and QSOX1 inhibition, combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, represents a promising therapeutic approach for eliminating DCSCs and preventing recurrence.",

We previously identified a patient-derived point mutation (Q84E) in ATP11A at the phospholipid entry site, which acquired the ability to flip phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). This mutation led to elevated levels of sphingomyelin (SM) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. We herein present two de novo ATP11A dominant mutations (E114G and S399L) in heterozygous patients exhibiting neurological and developmental disorders. These mutations, situated near the predicted phospholipid exit site, similarly confer the ability for ATP11A to recognize PtdCho as a substrate, resulting in its internalization into cells. Cells expressing these mutants had increased SM levels on their surface, attributed to the up-regulated expression of the sphingomyelin synthase-1 gene, rendering them more susceptible to SM phosphodiesterase-mediated cell lysis. Corresponding mutations in ATP11C and ATP8A2, paralogs of ATP11A, exerted similar effects on PtdCho-flipping activity and increased SM levels on the cell surface. Molecular dynamics simulations, based on the ATP11C structure, suggest that the E114G and S399L mutations enhance ATP11C’s affinity toward PtdCho. These findings underscore the importance of the well-conserved exit and entry sites in determining phospholipid substrate specificity and indicate that aberrant flipping of PtdCho contributes to neurological disorders.",

Type III interferons (IFNλs) are ordinarily considered inducible antiviral cytokines involved in intestinal immunity. Unlike other IFNλs, we found that newly identified IFNλ4 is an intestinal antibacterial protein. Large amounts of natural IFNλ4 are present in the secretory layer of the intestinal tracts of healthy piglets, which suggests that IFNλ4 is in direct physiological contact with microbial pathogens. We also identified two biochemical functions of mammalian IFNλ4, the induction of bacterial agglutination and direct microbial killing, which are not functions of the other IFNλs. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that after binding to the carbohydrate fraction of lipopolysaccharide, mammalian IFNλ4 self-assembles into bacteria-surrounding nanoparticles that agglutinate bacteria, and that its unique cationic amphiphilic molecular structure facilitates the destruction of bacterial membranes. Our data reveal features of IFNλ4 distinct from those of previously reported IFNλs and suggest that noncanonical IFNλ4 is deeply involved in intestinal immunity, beyond simply cytokine signaling.",

Many current methods rely on solid sorbents that cycle between capture and release at slow rates. We envision a radically different approach where water is transformed and directly captured into a liquid salt solution that is suitable for subsequent distillation or other processing using existing methods. In contrast to other methods utilizing hydrogels as sorbents, we do not store water within hydrogels—we use them as a transport medium. Inspired by nature, we capture atmospheric water through a hydrogel membrane “skin” at an extraordinarily high rate of 5.50 kgm − 2 d − 1 at a low humidity of 35%. and up to 16.9 kgm − 2 d − 1 at higher humidities. For a drinking-water application, calculated performance of a hypothetical one-square-meter device shows that water could be supplied to two to three people in arid environments. This work is a significant step toward providing new resources and possibilities to water-scarce regions.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that the CD73/Axl axis could regulate Smad3-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote NSCLC metastasis. Mechanically, CD73 can be secreted via the Golgi apparatus transport pathway. Then secreted CD73 may activate AXl by directly bind with site R55 located in Axl extracellular domain independently of GAS6. In addition, we proved that CD73 can stabilize Axl expression via inhibiting CBLB expression. We also identified the distinct function of CD73 activity in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

          "abstract": "The conserved mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is known for protecting dopaminergic neurons and functioning in various other tissues. Previously, we showed that Caenorhabditis elegans manf-1 null mutants exhibit defects such as increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and abnormal protein aggregation. These findings suggest an essential role for MANF in cellular processes. However, the mechanisms by which intracellular and extracellular MANF regulate broader cellular functions remain unclear. We report a unique mechanism of action for MANF-1 that involves the transcription factor HLH-30/TFEB-mediated signaling to regulate autophagy and lysosomal function. Multiple transgenic strains overexpressing MANF-1 showed extended lifespan of animals, reduced protein aggregation, and improved neuronal survival. Using fluorescently tagged MANF-1, we observed tissue-specific localization of the protein, which was dependent on the ER retention signal. Further subcellular analysis showed that MANF-1 localizes within cells to the lysosomes and utilizes the endosomal pathway. Consistent with the lysosomal localization, our transcriptomic study of MANF-1 and analyses of autophagy regulators demonstrated that MANF-1 promotes proteostasis by regulating autophagic flux and lysosomal activity. Collectively, our findings establish MANF as a critical regulator of stress response, proteostasis, and aging.",

          "abstract": "Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there exists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows with low Reynolds number. This has triggered a search for alternative hydroelectric conversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet triboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy, or flow-induced ionic Coulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate charge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that the kinetic energy of small-scale “waste” flows can be directly and efficiently converted into electricity thanks to the hydroelectronic drag effect, by which an ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between fluid motion and electron transport. We develop a nonequilibrium thermodynamic formalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion, dubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to thermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless figure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this figure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the liquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest strategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste flow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.",

Here, we demonstrate how theropod trackways can be used as indirect evidence of pre-avian aerial behavior, expanding the approaches available to study vertebrate flight origins. This involved exploring the behavioral implications of a two-toed Cretaceous-aged theropod trackway produced by a small, bird-like microraptorine moving at high speed. Applying first principle running biomechanics, we were able to conclude that the trackway is atypical, indirectly evidencing pre-avian aerial behavior. This trackway documents the evidence of wing-assisted aerodynamic force production during locomotion, supporting a broader distribution of this behavior than currently known. These findings support previously proposed aerial behavior in early bird-like theropods, showing how trackways will help to deepen our understanding of theropod flight origins.",

          "abstract": "Large meteorite impacts must have strongly affected the habitability of the early Earth. Rocks of the Archean Eon record at least 16 major impact events, involving bolides larger than 10 km in diameter. These impacts probably had severe, albeit temporary, consequences for surface environments. However, their effect on early life is not well understood. Here, we analyze the sedimentology, petrography, and carbon isotope geochemistry of sedimentary rocks across the S2 impact event (37 to 58 km carbonaceous chondrite) forming part of the 3.26 Ga Fig Tree Group, South Africa, to evaluate its environmental effects and biological consequences. The impact initiated 1) a giant tsunami that mixed Fe 2+ -rich deep waters into the Fe 2+ -poor shallow waters and washed debris into coastal areas, 2) heating that caused partial evaporation of surface ocean waters and likely a short-term increase in weathering and erosion on land, and 3) injection of P from vaporization of the S2 bolide. Strata immediately above the S2 impact event contain abundant siderites, which are associated with organic matter and exhibit light and variable δ 13 C carb values. This is consistent with microbial iron cycling in the wake of the impact event. Thus, the S2 impact likely had regional, if not global, positive and negative effects on life. The tsunami, atmospheric heating, and darkness would likely have decimated phototrophic microbes in the shallow water column. However, the biosphere likely recovered rapidly, and, in the medium term, the increase in nutrients and iron likely facilitated microbial blooms, especially of iron-cycling microbes.",

Here, we show that GPR31, which is activated by the gut bacterial metabolite pyruvate, is specifically expressed on type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) in the lamina propria of the human intestine. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cDC1s and a monolayer human gut organoid coculture system, we show that cDC1s extend their dendrites toward pyruvate on the luminal side, forming transepithelial dendrites (TED). Accordingly, GPR31 activation via pyruvate enhances the fundamental function of cDC1 by allowing efficient uptake of gut luminal antigens, such as dietary compounds and bacterial particles through TED formation. Our results highlight the role of GPCRs in tuning the human gut immune system according to local metabolic cues.",

Although many animals routinely consume ethanol in low concentrations as part of their natural diets, its inherent toxicity can cause severe damage. Even species particularly well adapted to ethanol consumption face detrimental effects when exposed to concentrations above 4%. Here, we investigated the metabolism of ethanol and its impact on survival and behavior in the Oriental hornet ( Vespa orientalis ), a social wasp that naturally consumes ethanol. We show that chronic ethanol consumption, even at concentrations as high as 80%, had no impact on hornet mortality, construction behavior, or agonistic behavior. Using 13 C1 labeled ethanol, we show that hornets efficiently metabolized ingested ethanol and at a much higher rate than honey bees. The presence of multiple copies of the alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) gene in the Vespa genera suggests a potential mechanism for ethanol tolerance. These findings support the hypothesis that the mutualistic relationship between ethanol-producing organisms and vespid hosts may be at the origin of their remarkable capacity to utilize and metabolize ethanol.",

Neither the D- nor the L-RNA components alone can achieve autocatalytic self-replication. Cross-chiral exponential amplification can be continued indefinitely through a serial-transfer process that provides an ongoing supply of the component D- and L-substrates. Unlike the familiar paradigm of semiconservative nucleic acid replication that relies on Watson–Crick pairing between complementary strands, cross-chiral replication relies on tertiary interactions between structured nucleic acids “across the mirror.” There are few examples, outside of biology, of autocatalytic self-replication systems that undergo exponential amplification and there are no prior examples, in either biological or chemical systems, of cross-chiral replication enabling exponential amplification.",

          "abstract": "The dominance of beneficial mutations is a key evolutionary parameter affecting the rate and genetic basis of adaptation, yet it is notoriously difficult to estimate. A leading method to infer it is to compare the relative rates of adaptive substitution for X-linked and autosomal genes, which—according to a classic model by Charlesworth et al. (1987)—is a simple function of the dominance of new beneficial mutations. Recent evidence that rates of adaptive substitution are faster for X-linked genes implies, accordingly, that beneficial mutations are usually recessive. However, this conclusion is incompatible with leading theories of dominance, which predict that beneficial mutations tend to be dominant or overdominant with respect to fitness. To address this incompatibility, we use Fisher’s geometric model to predict the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations and the relative rates of positively selected substitution on the X and autosomes. Previous predictions of faster-X theory emerge as a special case of our model in which the phenotypic effects of mutations are small relative to the distance to the phenotypic optimum. But as mutational effects become large relative to the optimum, we observe an elevated tempo of positively selected substitutions on the X relative to the autosomes across a broader range of dominance conditions, including those predicted by theories of dominance. Our results imply that, contrary to previous models, dominant and overdominant beneficial mutations can plausibly generate patterns of faster-X adaptation. We discuss resulting implications for genomic studies of adaptation and inferences of dominance.",

We show an exceptionally strong expansion of both methanogens and CH 4 -oxidizing bacteria (up to 87% of hopanoid-producing bacteria) during this Event. Grazing on CH 4 -oxidizing bacteria by zooplankton (up to 47% of ciliate diets) within the chemocline transferred substantial CH 4 -derived carbon to the higher trophic levels, representing an important CH 4 sink in the water column.

To tackle this challenge, we introduce PENGUIN, a principled framework for polygenic genetic confounding control based on variance component estimation. In addition, we present extensions of this approach that can estimate genetically unconfounded associations using GWAS summary statistics alone as input and between multiple generations of study samples. Through simulations, we demonstrate superior statistical properties of PENGUIN compared to the existing approaches. Applying our method to multiple population cohorts, we reveal and remove substantial genetic confounding in the associations of educational attainment with various complex traits and between parental and offspring education.

Simultaneously assessing multiple traits identified combinations associated with lifetime reproductive success measured as the number of livebirths. Women with the most livebirths had distinctive hematological and cardiovascular traits. A hemoglobin concentration near the sample mode and a high percent of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin raised arterial oxygen concentration without risking elevated blood viscosity. We propose ongoing stabilizing selection on hemoglobin concentration because extreme values predicted fewer livebirths and directional selection favoring higher oxygen saturation because higher values had more predicted livebirths. EPAS1, an oxygen homeostasis locus with strong signals of positive natural selection and a high frequency of variants occurring only among populations indigenous to the Tibetan Plateau, associated with hemoglobin concentration. High blood flow into the lungs, wide left ventricles, and low hypoxic heart rate responses aided effective convective oxygen transport to tissues. Women with physiologies closer to unstressed, low altitude values had the highest lifetime reproductive success.

However, an understanding of how the ENSO might have evolved over geological timescales is still lacking, despite a well-accepted recognition that such an understanding has direct implications for constraining human-induced future ENSO changes. Here, using climate simulations, we show that ENSO has been a leading mode of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the past 250 My but with substantial variations in amplitude across geological periods. We show this result by performing and analyzing a series of coupled time-slice climate simulations forced by paleogeography, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, and solar radiation for the past 250 My, in 10-My intervals. The variations in ENSO amplitude across geological periods are little related to mean equatorial zonal SST gradient or global mean surface temperature of the respective periods but are primarily determined by interperiod difference in the background thermocline depth, according to a linear stability analysis. In addition, variations in atmospheric noise serve as an independent contributing factor to ENSO variations across intergeological periods. The two factors together explain about 76% of the interperiod variations in ENSO amplitude over the past 250 My. Our findings support the importance of changing ocean vertical thermal structure and atmospheric noise in influencing projected future ENSO change and its uncertainty.",

By applying internal exposure analyses coupled with 15 N isotope tracing, we found that maternal NO 2 inhalation induced acquired methemoglobinemia through its byproducts and placental hypoxia in pregnant mice. Importantly, by combining transcriptional profiling, bioinformatics analysis, and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP)/chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP), we clarified that placental-fetal hypoxia transmission activated hypoxia-inducible factors, disturbed hematopoiesis through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1β-long noncoding RNAs-CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha-proinflammatory signaling pathway, ultimately contributing to FGR progression. These findings provide insights for risk prevention and clinical intervention to promote child well-being in NO 2 -polluted areas.",

However, our study finds widespread isoprene emission in herbaceous sedge plants, with a stronger temperature response surpassing current tree-derived models. We measured and compared isoprene emissions from sedges grown in different climatic zones, all showing an exponential temperature response with a Q10 range of 7.2 to 12, significantly higher than the Q10 of about 3 for other common isoprene emitters. The distinct temperature sensitivity of sedges makes them a hidden isoprene source, significant during heat waves but not easily detected in mild weather. For instance, isoprene emissions from Carex praegracilis can increase by 320% with a peak emission of over 100 nmol m −2 s −1 compared to preheat wave emissions. During heat waves, the peak isoprene emissions from C. praegracilis can match those from Lophostemon confertus , a commonly used street tree species which is considered the dominant urban isoprene source due to higher biomass and emission capacities. This surge in isoprene from globally distributed sedges, including those in urban landscapes, could contribute to peak ozone and aerosol pollutants during heat waves.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial ice nucleating proteins (INPs) are exceptionally effective in promoting the kinetically hindered transition of water to ice. Their efficiency relies on the assembly of INPs into large functional aggregates, with the size of ice nucleation sites determining activity. Experimental freezing spectra have revealed two distinct, defined aggregate sizes, typically classified as class A and C ice nucleators (INs). Despite the importance of INPs and years of extensive research, the precise number of INPs forming the two aggregate classes, and their assembly mechanism have remained enigmatic. Here, we report that bacterial ice nucleation activity emerges from more than two prevailing aggregate species and identify the specific number of INPs responsible for distinct crystallization temperatures. We find that INP dimers constitute class C INs, tetramers class B INs, and hexamers and larger multimers are responsible for the most efficient class A activity. We propose a hierarchical assembly mechanism based on tyrosine interactions for dimers, and electrostatic interactions between INP dimers to produce larger aggregates. This assembly is membrane-assisted: Increasing the bacterial outer membrane fluidity decreases the population of the larger aggregates, while preserving the dimers. Inversely, Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline buffer increases the population of multimeric class A and B aggregates 200-fold and endows the bacteria with enhanced stability toward repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Our analysis suggests that the enhancement results from the better alignment of dimers in the negatively charged outer membrane, due to screening of their electrostatic repulsion. This demonstrates significant enhancement of the most potent bacterial INs.",

Here, we find that the key parameter is the acceleration, which greatly simplifies the complexity of the phenomenon.

T cells lacking AMBRA1 resisted FAS-mediated cell death by down-regulating FAS expression at the translational level. We show that AMBRA1 is a vital regulator of ribosome protein biosynthesis and ribosome loading on select mRNAs, whereby it plays a key role in balancing TCR signaling with cell cycle regulation pathways. We also found that AMBRA1 itself is translationally controlled by TCR stimulation via the CD28–PI3K–mTORC1–EIF4F pathway. Together, these findings shed light on the molecular control of translation after T cell activation and implicate AMBRA1 as a translational regulator governing TCR signaling, cell cycle progression, and T cell death.",

          "abstract": "Atherosclerosis results from lipid-driven inflammation of the arterial wall that fails to resolve. Imbalances in macrophage accumulation and function, including diminished migratory capacity and defective efferocytosis, fuel maladaptive inflammation and plaque progression. The neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 has dichotomous roles in inflammation partly due to its multiple receptors; in atherosclerosis, netrin-1 promotes macrophage survival and retention via its receptor Unc5b. To minimize the pleiotropic effects of targeting netrin-1, we tested the therapeutic potential of deleting Unc5b in mice with advanced atherosclerosis. We generated Unc5b fl/fl Cx3cr1 creERT2/WT mice, which allowed conditional deletion of Un5b (∆ Unc5b MØ ) in monocytes and macrophages by tamoxifen injection. After inducing advanced atherosclerosis by hepatic PCSK9 overexpression and western diet feeding for 20 wk, Unc5b was deleted and hypercholesterolemia was normalized to simulate clinical lipid management. Deletion of myeloid Unc5b led to a 40% decrease in atherosclerotic plaque burden and reduced plaque complexity compared to Unc5b fl/fl Cx3cr1 WT/WT littermate controls (Ctrl MØ ). Consistently, plaque macrophage content was reduced by 50% in ∆ Unc5b MØ mice due to reduced plaque Ly6C hi monocyte recruitment and macrophage retention. Compared to Ctrl MØ mice, plaques in ∆ Unc5b MØ mice had reduced necrotic area and fewer apoptotic cells, which correlated with improved efferocytotic capacity by Unc5b -deficient macrophages in vivo and in vitro. Beneficial changes in macrophage dynamics in the plaque upon Unc5b deletion were accompanied by an increase in atheroprotective T cell populations, including T-regulatory and Th2 cells. Our data identify Unc5b in advanced atherosclerosis as a therapeutic target to induce pro-resolving restructuring of the plaque immune cells and to promote atherosclerosis regression.",

Using a well-established connectopic mapping technique on two large resting-state functional MRI datasets, we systematically quantified topographic organization of the hippocampal functional connectivity (hippocampal gradient) and its cortical interaction in developing brains. We revealed hippocampal functional hierarchy within the large-scale cortical brain systems, with the anterior hippocampus preferentially connected to an anterior temporal (AT) pathway and the posterior hippocampus embedded in a posterior medial (PM) pathway. We examined the developmental effects of the primary gradient and its whole-brain functional interaction. We observed increased functional specialization along the hippocampal long axis and found a general whole-brain connectivity shift from the posterior to the anterior hippocampus during development. Using phenotypic predictive modeling, we further delineated how the hippocampus is differentially integrated into the whole-brain cortical hierarchy underlying episodic memory and identified several key nodes within PM/AT systems. Our results highlight the importance of hippocampal gradient and its cortical interaction in development and for supporting episodic memory.",

Consequently, we still cannot link nanoscale phenomena with the macroscopic toughness of materials. The unsolved challenge is to observe the movement of the crack front at the nanoscale while extracting quantitative information. Here, we address this challenge by monitoring stable crack growth inside a transmission electron microscope. Our analysis demonstrates how phase transformation toughening, previously thought to be effective at the microscale and above, promotes crack deflection at the nanolevel and increases the fracture resistance. The work is a first step to help connecting the atomistic and continuous view of fracture in a way that can guide the design of the next generation of strong and tough materials demanded by technologies as diverse as healthcare, energy generation, or transport.",

Through careful examination of inelastic neutron scattering powder spectra, we propose a modified Kitaev model to accurately describe the twisted chains of edge-sharing octahedra surrounding Co 2 + ions. The extended Kitaev–Heisenberg model, including a significant anisotropic bond-dependent exchange term with K / | J | = 0.96 , is identified as the key descriptor of the magnetic interactions in SrCoGe 2 O 6 . Furthermore, our heat capacity measurements reveal an effect of an external magnetic field (approximately 13 T) which shifts the system from a fragile antiferromagnetic ordering with T N = 9 K to a field-induced state. We argue that pyroxenes, particularly those modified by substituting Ge with Si and its less extended p orbitals, emerge as a platform for the Kitaev model. This opens up possibilities for advancing our understanding of Kitaev physics.",

Greenland ice cores provide key records of DO climate variability, but gas-calibrated estimates of the temperature change magnitudes have been limited to central and northwest Greenland. Here, we present ice-core δ 15 N-N 2 records from south (Dye 3) and coastal east Greenland (Renland) to calibrate the local water isotope thermometer and provide a Greenland-wide spatial characterization of DO event magnitude. We combine these data with existing records of δ 18 O, deuterium excess, and accumulation rates to create a multiproxy “fingerprint” of the DO impact on Greenland. Isotope-enabled climate models have skill in simulating the observational multiproxy DO event impact, and we use a series of idealized simulations with such models to identify regions of the North Atlantic that are critical in explaining DO variability. Our experiments imply that wintertime sea ice variation in the subpolar gyre, rather than the commonly invoked Nordic Seas, is both a sufficient and a necessary condition to explain the observed DO impacts in Greenland, whatever the distal cause. Moisture-tagging experiments support the idea that Greenland DO isotope signals may be explained almost entirely via changes in the vapor source distribution and that site temperature is not a main control on δ 18 O during DO transitions, contrary to the traditional interpretation. Our results provide a comprehensive, multiproxy, data-model synthesis of abrupt DO climate variability in Greenland.",

We show that new collective phases emerge where the school of fish “follows the tank wall” or “double mills.” Importantly, confinement induces repeated switching between two collective states, schooling and milling. We describe the group dynamics probabilistically, uncovering bistable collective states along with unintuitive bifurcations driving phase transitions. Our findings support the hypothesis that collective transitions in fish schools could occur spontaneously, with no adjustment at the individual level, and opens venues to control and engineer emergent collective patterns in biological and synthetic systems that operate far from equilibrium.",

Here, we provide animal and human data showing a role of PC in protecting β-cells against senescence and maintaining GSIS under different physiological and pathological conditions. β-cell-specific deletion of PC impaired GSIS and induced β-cell senescence in the mouse models under either a standard chow diet or prolonged high-fat diet feeding. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that p53-related senescence and cell cycle arrest are activated in PC-deficient islets. Overexpression of PC inhibited hyperglycemia- and aging-induced p53-related senescence in human and mouse islets as well as INS-1E β-cells, whereas knockdown of PC provoked senescence. Mechanistically, PC interacted with MDM2 to prevent its degradation via the MDM2 binding motif, which in turn restricts the p53-dependent senescent program in β-cells. On the contrary, the regulatory effects of PC on GSIS and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) anaplerotic flux are p53-independent.

While optical sectioning techniques achieve 3D live cell imaging, lateral versus depth resolution differences further complicate analysis. We present a scalable microfluidic method capable of 3D fluorescent isotropic imaging of live, nonadherent cells suspended inside picoliter droplets with high-speed single-cell volumetric readout (800 to 1,200 slices in 5 to 8 s) and near-diffraction limit resolution (~216 nm). The platform features a droplet trap array that leverages flow-induced droplet interfacial shear to generate intradroplet microvortices, which rotate single cells on their axis to enable optical projection tomography (OPT)-based imaging. This allows gentle (~1 mPa shear stress) observation of cells encapsulated inside nontoxic isotonic buffer droplets, facilitating scalable OPT acquisition by simultaneous spinning of hundreds of cells. We demonstrate 3D imaging of live myeloid and lymphoid cells in suspension, including K562 cells, as well as naive and activated T cells—small cells prone to movement in their suspended phenotype. Our fully suspended, orientation-independent cell morphometry, driven by isotropic imaging and spherical harmonic analysis, enabled the study of primary T cells across various immunological activation states. This approach unveiled six distinct nuclear content distributions, contrasting with conventional 2D images that typically portray spheroid and bean-like nuclear shapes associated with lymphocytes.

          "abstract": "Climate change increases fire-favorable weather in forests, but fire trends are also affected by multiple other controlling factors that are difficult to untangle. We use machine learning to systematically group forest ecoregions into 12 global forest pyromes, with each showing distinct sensitivities to climatic, human, and vegetation controls. This delineation revealed that rapidly increasing forest fire emissions in extratropical pyromes, linked to climate change, offset declining emissions in tropical pyromes during 2001 to 2023. Annual emissions tripled in one extratropical pyrome due to increases in fire-favorable weather, compounded by increased forest cover and productivity. This contributed to a 60% increase in forest fire carbon emissions from forest ecoregions globally. Our results highlight the increasing vulnerability of forests and their carbon stocks to fire disturbance under climate change.",

          "abstract": "Human biomonitoring studies typically capture only a small and unknown fraction of the entire chemical universe. We combined chemical analysis with a high-throughput in vitro assay for neurotoxicity to capture complex mixtures of organic chemicals in blood. Plasma samples of 624 pregnant women from the German LiNA cohort were extracted with a nonselective extraction method for organic chemicals. 294 of &gt;1000 target analytes were detected and quantified. Many of the detected chemicals as well as the whole extracts interfered with neurite development. Experimental testing of simulated complex mixtures of detected chemicals in the neurotoxicity assay confirmed additive mixture effects at concentrations less than individual chemicals’ effect thresholds. The use of high-throughput target screening combined with bioassays has the potential to improve human biomonitoring and provide a new approach to including mixture effects in epidemiological studies.",

Attempts to heterologously produce these molecules have consistently failed, although the genes responsible for each biosynthetic step have been identified. Here we identify a cellulose synthase like protein, an unexpected biosynthetic component that interacts with the early pathway enzymes, enabling steroidal scaffolds production in plants. Moreover, knockout of this gene in black nightshade, Solanum nigrum resulted in plants lacking both steroidal alkaloids and saponins. Unexpectedly, these knockout plants also revealed that steroidal saponins deter serious agricultural insect pests. This discovery provides the missing link to engineer these high value steroidal molecules, and also pinpoints the ecological role for the steroidal saponins.",

Hormone release is controlled through metabolite-sensing proteins. Low expression, interspecies differences, and the existence of multiple EEC subtypes have posed challenges to the study of these sensors. We describe differentiation of stomach EECs to complement existing intestinal organoid protocols. CD200 emerged as a pan-EEC surface marker, allowing deep transcriptomic profiling from primary human tissue along the stomach-intestinal tract. We generated loss-of-function mutations in 22 receptors and subjected organoids to ligand-induced secretion experiments. We delineate the role of individual human EEC sensors in the secretion of hormones, including GLP-1.

The recovered capacity sustains and replicates through multiple pulses, providing a constant capacity advantage.

Using Türkiye’s extensive and continuous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) network during the moment magnitude 7.8 and 7.6 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes on 6 February 2023, we show that large earthquakes can induce far-field crustal deformations (&gt;700 kilometers), exceeding current predictions from elastic dislocation models. They can lead to the mobilization of tectonic plates and the triggering of far-field earthquakes, which carries profound implications for seismic hazard assessments and necessitates a new perspective on crustal deformation and earthquake mechanics.",

We identified 30 structurally distinct haplotypes at nucleotide resolution among 98 present-day humans, revealing that the coding sequences of AMY1 copies are evolving under negative selection. Genomic analyses of these haplotypes in archaic hominins and ancient human genomes suggest that a common three-copy haplotype, dating as far back as 800 KYA, has seeded rapidly evolving rearrangements through recurrent non-allelic homologous recombination. Additionally, haplotypes with more than three AMY1 copies have significantly increased in frequency among European farmers over the past 4,000 years, potentially as an adaptive response to increased starch digestion.",

We relate insect and spider richness to biomass and PUFA-mass from stream and terrestrial communities encompassing nine land uses. PUFA-mass and biomass relate positively to biodiversity across ecosystems. In terrestrial systems, human-dominated areas have lower biomass and PUFA-mass than more natural areas, even at equivalent levels of richness. Aquatic ecosystems have consistently higher PUFA-mass than terrestrial ecosystems.

Among existing thermoelectrics, tin selenide (SnSe) has had particularly rapid development owing to the unexpectedly high thermoelectric efficiency that has been continuously established over the past decade. Several transport mechanisms and strategies used to interpret and improve the thermoelectric performance of SnSe have been important for understanding and developing other material systems with SnSe-like characteristics. Similar to other thermoelectrics, building commercially viable SnSe-based devices requires advances in device efficiency and service stability. Further optimization across all material systems should enable thermoelectric technology to play a critical role in the future global energy landscape.",

We show that predator-prey contact can be established by gliding motility or extracellular assemblages we call “grappling hooks.” Cryo–electron microscopy identified the grappling hooks as heptamers of a type IX secretion system substrate. After close predator-prey contact is established, cryo–electron tomography and functional assays showed that puncturing by a type VI secretion system mediated killing. Single-cell analyses with stable isotope–labeled prey revealed that prey components are taken up by the attacker. Depending on nutrient availability, insertion sequence elements toggle the activity of ixotrophy. A marine metagenomic time series shows coupled dynamics of ixotrophic bacteria and prey. We found that the mechanism of ixotrophy involves multiple cellular machineries, is conserved, and may shape microbial populations in the environment.",

However, empirical evidence from managed and mature forests on the impact of this enrichment on ecological (multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality) and economic dimensions remains scarce, particularly when nonnative species are used. Here, we propose and test a framework that integrates economic multifunctionality, encompassing timber production–oriented goals and resistance against disturbances, with multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality in European beech forest stands enriched with conifers. Our results show that enriched beech forest stands (~80 years old) can provide high levels of economic multifunctionality without compromising multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality. In comparison to pure beech stands, enriched stands with Douglas-fir supported win-win-win situations for these three dimensions. Our findings contribute to the discussion of integrating biodiversity, ecosystem, and economic functions, providing empirical evidence for future forest management.",

Across three studies, we reveal the developmental differences and computational mechanisms that underlie the social media engagement and feedback processing of adolescents and adults. First, using a reinforcement learning model on a large Instagram trace dataset ( N = 16,613, 1.6+ million posts), we show that adolescents are more sensitive to social feedback than adults. Second, in an experimental study ( N = 194), we show that adolescents’ mood is affected more strongly by a reduction in likes than adults. Last, in a neuroimaging study ( N = 96), we show that social media feedback sensitivity is related to individual differences in subcortical-limbic brain volumes of emerging adults. Together, these findings highlight the need for digital competence programs to help youth manage the constant feedback they encounter on social media platforms.",

Here, we evaluate the age profile of SWB among three small-scale subsistence societies ( n = 468; study 1), forest users from 23 low-income countries ( n = 6987; study 2), and Tsimane’ horticulturalists ( n = 1872; study 3). Across multiple specifications, we find variability in SWB age profiles. In some cases, we find no age-related differences in SWB or even inverted U-shapes. Adjusting for confounders reduces observed age effects. Our findings highlight variability in average well-being trajectories over the life course. Ensuring successful aging will require a greater focus on cultural and socioecological determinants of individual trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Chiral structures and functions are essential natural components in biominerals and biological crystals. Chiral molecules direct inorganics through chiral growth of facets or screw dislocation of crystal clusters. As chirality promoters, they initiate an asymmetric hierarchical self-assembly in a quasi-thermodynamic steady state. However, achieving chiral assembly requires a delicate balance between intricate interactions. This complexity causes the roles of achiral-chiral and inorganic components in crystallization to remain ambiguous. Here, we elucidate a definitive mechanism using an achiral-chiral ligand strategy to assemble inorganics into hierarchical, self-organized superstructures. Achiral ligands cluster inorganic building blocks, while chiral ligands impart chiral rotation. Achiral and chiral ligands can flexibly modulate the chirality of superstructures by fully using their competition in coordination chemistry. This dual-ligand strategy offers a versatile framework for engineering chiroptical nanomaterials tailored to optical devices and metamaterials with optical activities across a broad wavelength range, with applications in imaging, detection, catalysis, and sensing.",

          "abstract": "Optical imaging is a powerful tool for early disease detection and effective treatment planning, but its accuracy is often compromised by the uptake of imaging materials by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Herein, we leverage multivalent host-guest interactions between cyanine dyes and β-cyclodextrin polymers to develop supramolecular probes with enhanced stability, optical, and transport profiles for accurate in vivo imaging. These multivalent interactions not only ensure the stability of the probes but also enhance fluorescence efficiency by minimizing nonradiative decay. Our self-assembly approach effectively modulates probe size and surface properties, enabling evasion of MPS clearance and promoting prolonged bloodstream circulation, thereby improving the signal-to-background ratio for imaging. The effectiveness of our design is demonstrated by substantial advancements in the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury and by providing high-contrast imaging and precise surgical navigation across various tumor models. Our strategy not only advances optical imaging materials toward clinical translation but also establishes a versatile platform applicable to multiple imaging modalities.",

Chondrocytes frequently undergo energy stress under pathological conditions, characterized by disrupted cellular metabolism and reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. However, there has limited progress in modulating energy metabolism for cartilage regeneration thus far. Here, we developed bioenergetic-active exosomes (Suc-EXO) to promote cartilage regeneration and homeostasis maintenance. Suc-EXO exhibited a 5.42-fold increase in ATP content, enabling the manipulation of cellular energy metabolism by fueling the TCA cycle. With continuous energy supply, Suc-EXO promoted BMSC chondrogenic differentiation via the P2X7-mediated PI3K-AKT pathway. Moreover, Suc-EXO improved chondrocyte anabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis via the P2X7-mediated SIRT3 pathway. In a rabbit cartilage defect model, the Suc-EXO–encapsulated hydrogel notably promoted cartilage regeneration and maintained neocartilage homeostasis, leading to 2.26 and 1.53 times increase in Col2 and ACAN abundance, respectively. These findings make a remarkable breakthrough in modulating energy metabolism for cartilage regeneration, offering immense potential for clinical translation.",

Here, we developed a fully integrated breathable haptic textile (FIBHT) to solve these trade-off issues, where the FIBHT exhibits high-level integration of 128 pixels over the palm, great stretchability of 400%, and superior permeability of over 657 g/m 2 /day (moisture) and 40 mm/s (air).

The experiments have been performed on a frozen solution of trityl radicals in water/glycerol on a homebuilt X-band electron paramagnetic resonance/DNP spectrometer at 80 kelvins.

To unify known and uncover unknown principles governing eukaryotic elongation rate, we developed a machine learning pipeline to analyze RiboSeq datasets. We find that the chemical nature of the incoming amino acid determines how codon optimality influences elongation rate, with hydrophobic residues more dependent on transfer RNA (tRNA) levels than charged residues. Unexpectedly, we find that wobble interactions exert a widespread effect on elongation pausing, with wobble-mediated decoding being slower than Watson-Crick decoding, irrespective of tRNA levels. Applying our ribosome pausing principles to ribosome collisions reveals that disomes arise upon apposition of fast-decoding and slow-decoding signatures. We conclude that codon choice and tRNA pools are evolutionarily constrained to harmonize elongation rate with cotranslational folding while minimizing wobble pairing and deleterious stalling.",

This phenomenon is relatively well understood for inorganic materials but much less so for organic semiconductors (OSs). These materials present a challenge because the strong thermal fluctuations of electronic coupling between the molecules result in partially delocalized charge carriers that cannot be treated with traditional theories for thermoelectricity. Here, we develop a quantum dynamical simulation approach revealing in atomistic detail how the charge carrier wave function moves along a temperature gradient in an organic molecular crystal. We find that the wave function propagates from hot to cold in agreement with the experiment, and we obtain a Seebeck coefficient in good agreement with experimental measurements that are also reported in this work. Detailed analysis reveals that gradients in thermal electronic disorder play an important role in determining the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient, opening unexplored avenues for the design of OSs with improved Seebeck coefficients.",

Here, we report the development of a chemoproteomic platform, single-cell activity-dependent proximity ligation, which uses automated, microfluidics-based single-cell capture and nanoliter volume manipulations to convert the interactions of family-wide chemical activity probes with native protein targets into multiplexed, amplifiable oligonucleotide barcodes. We demonstrate accurate, reproducible, and multiplexed quantitation of a six-enzyme (Ag-6) panel with known ties to cancer cell aggressiveness directly in single cells.

We report an anisotropic composite PEM, mimicking the water-conductive composite structure of bamboo that meets this challenge. Micro- and nanoscale alignment of conductive pathways is achieved by in-plane thermal compression of a mat composed of co-electrospun Nafion and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers stabilizing the alignment. This translates to pronounced TP-enhanced proton conductivity, twice that of pure Nafion at high humidity, 13 times larger at low humidity, and 10 times larger water diffusivity. This remarkable improvement is elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that stronger nanochannels alignment upon dehydration compensates for reduced water content.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of MBV on RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in vitro and particulate-induced osteolysis in vivo. Results showed that MBV attenuated osteoclast differentiation and activity by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway and downstream NFATc1, DC-STAMP, c-Src, and cathepsin K expression. In vivo, local administration of MBV attenuated ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene particle-induced osteolysis, bone reconstruction, and periosteal inflammation. The results suggest that MBV may be a therapeutic option for preventing periprosthetic loosening.",

Nonetheless, the necessity of the main astrocyte glucose transporter, i.e., GLUT1, for brain glucose metabolism has not been defined. Unexpectedly, we found that brain glucose metabolism was paradoxically augmented in mice with astrocytic GLUT1 reduction (GLUT1 ΔGFAP mice). These mice also exhibited improved peripheral glucose metabolism especially in obesity, rendering them metabolically healthier. Mechanistically, we observed that GLUT1-deficient astrocytes exhibited increased insulin receptor–dependent ATP release, and that both astrocyte insulin signaling and brain purinergic signaling are essential for improved brain function and systemic glucose metabolism. Collectively, we demonstrate that astrocytic GLUT1 is central to the regulation of brain energetics, yet its depletion triggers a reprogramming of brain metabolism sufficient to sustain energy requirements, peripheral glucose homeostasis, and cognitive function.",

Here, we report the observation of quantum superposition of topological defects in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. By engineering long-range spin-spin interactions, we observe a spin kink splitting into a superposition of kinks at different positions, creating a “Schrodinger kink” that manifests nonlocality and quantum interference. Furthermore, by preparing superposition states of neighboring kinks with different phases, we observe the propagation of the wave packet in different directions, thus unambiguously verifying the quantum coherence in the superposition states.

Extensive chemical and enzymatic treatments can liberate fermentable carbohydrates from plant biomass, but microbial routes offer many advantages, including concomitant conversion to industrial chemicals. Here, testing of lignin content of nonpretreated biomass using the cellulolytic thermophilic bacterium, Anaerocellum bescii , revealed that the primary microbial degradation barrier relates to methoxy substitutions in lignin. This contrasts with optimal lignin composition for chemical pretreatment that favors high S/G ratio and low H lignin.

The reorganization of activity is so profound that decoding of sound representation under anesthesia is not possible based on awake activity. However, population-level parameters, such as average tuning strength and population decoding accuracy, are weakly affected by anesthesia, explaining why its effect has previously gone unnoticed when comparing independently sampled neurons. Together, our results indicate that the functional organization of the auditory brainstem largely depends on the network state and is ill-defined under anesthesia.

We show that direct contact with profibrotic but not proinflammatory macrophages triggers acute fibroblast contractions. The contractile response depends on αvβ3 integrin expression on macrophages and Piezo1 expression on fibroblasts. The touch of macrophages elevates fibroblast cytosolic calcium within seconds, followed by translocation of the transcription cofactors nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 and Yes-associated protein, which drive fibroblast activation within hours. Intriguingly, macrophages induce mechanical stress in fibroblasts on soft matrix that alone suppresses their spontaneous activation. We propose that acute contact with suitable macrophages mechanically kick-starts fibroblast activation in an otherwise nonpermissive soft environment.

This result is unexpected because GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing due to white frequency noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events.

Here, we decode the errors associated with writing and shifting domain walls using nanosecond current pulses in a ~5-micrometer-wide wire composed of a Pt/GdFeCo bilayer. We find that writing a domain wall at the edge of the wire causes a bit positioning error of ~0.3 micrometers, whereas the shifting process induces an error of ~0.1 micrometers per a 2-nanosecond-long current pulse. The error correlation among successive shifting is negligible when the current drive is sufficiently large.

Here, we propose an alternative approach to solve the electronic structure problem using VQE with a single qudit. Our approach exploits a high-dimensional orbital angular momentum state of a heralded single photon and notably reduces the required quantum resources compared to conventional multi-qubit–based VQE. We experimentally demonstrate that our single-qudit–based VQE can efficiently estimate the ground state energy of hydrogen (H 2 ) and lithium hydride (LiH) molecular systems corresponding to two- and four-qubit systems, respectively.

This work designs a type II band alignment in STM junction to achieve effective charge-transfer state decoupling. This strategy enables the successful identification of the lowest-frequency H g (ω 1 ) (Raman-active H g mode) vibronic excitation within single C 60 molecules, which, despite being notably pronounced in electron transport of C 60 single-molecule transistors, has remained hidden at submolecular level. Our results show that the observed H g (ω 1 ) excitation is “anchored” to all molecules, irrespective of local geometry, challenging common understanding of structural definition of vibronic excitation governed by Franck-Condon principle. Density functional theory calculations reveal existence of molecule-substrate interfacial charge-transfer dipole, which, although overlooked previously, drives the dominant H g (ω 1 ) excitation.

However, the regulation of its different functions remains poorly understood. Here, we report the role of PARP1 acetylation status in modulating its DNA repair and transactivation functions. We demonstrate that histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) determines PARP1 acetylation at Lys498 and Lys521 sites. HDAC5-mediated deacetylation at Lys498 site regulates PARP1 DNA damage response and facilitates efficient recruitment of DNA repair factors at damaged sites, thereby promoting cell survival. Additionally, HDAC5-mediated deacetylation at Lys521 site promotes PARP1 coactivator function, resulting in induction of proliferative and metabolic genes in an activating transcription factor 4-dependent manner. Thus, PARP1 induces metabolic adaptation to spur malignant phenotype. Our studies in mouse tumor models suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity does not block tumor progression robustly as transactivation function remains unperturbed.

This enables selective transformation of platinum-iron nanowire surfaces into intermetallic structures via atomic ordering at a low temperature. The catalysts exhibit enhanced MEA stability with 50% less Fe loss while maintaining high catalytic activity comparable to that in half-cells.

          "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis is well accepted as a potential precursor of hepatocellular carcinoma. Previously, we reported that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) revealed a novel anti-inflammatory activity via inhibiting the TLR4–IL-17A signaling, which could be a potential anticarcinogenetic mechanism to prevent to MASH-HCC transition. Here, we set out to determine whether FGF21 has a major impact on Kupffer cells’ (KCs) ability during MASH-HCC transition. We found aberrant hepatic FGF21 and KC pool in human MASH-HCC. Lack of FGF21 up-regulated ALOX15, which converted the oxidized fatty acids to induce excessive KC death and mobilization of monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs) for KC replacement. Lack of FGF21 oversupplied free fatty acids for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) cascade synthesis to mediate MASH-HCC transition via S1P-YAP signaling and cross-talk between tumor cells and macrophages. In conclusion, lack of FGF21 accelerated MASH-HCC transition via the S1P-AP signaling. Compromised MoMFs could present as tumor-associated macrophage phenotype rendering tumor immune microenvironment for MASH-HCC transition.",

In our system, a polaritonic condensate is confined by a spatially patterned pump laser in an annular trap that supports energy-degenerate vortex states of the polariton superfluid. Using temporal interference measurements, we observe coherent oscillations between a pair of counter-circulating vortex states coupled by elastic scattering of polaritons off the laser-imprinted potential. The qubit basis states correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the two vortex states. By engineering the potential, we tune the coupling and coherent oscillations between the two circulating current states, control the energies of the qubit basis states, and initialize the qubit in the desired state. The dynamics of the system is accurately reproduced by our theoretical two-state model, and we discuss potential avenues to implement quantum gates and algorithms with polaritonic qubits analogous to quantum computation with standard qubits.",

Human pluripotent stem cells are differentiated into transplantable dopamine (DA) progenitors which are proliferative at the time of grafting and undergo terminal differentiation and maturation in vivo. While the progenitors are homogeneous at the time of transplantation, they give rise to heterogeneous grafts composed not only of therapeutic DA neurons but also of other mature cell types. The mechanisms for graft diversification are unclear. We used single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to profile DA progenitors before transplantation combined with molecular barcode-based tracing to determine origin and shared lineages of the mature cell types in the grafts. Our data demonstrate that astrocytes, vascular leptomeningeal cells, and DA neurons are the main component of the DAergic grafts, originating from a common progenitor that is tripotent at the time of transplantation.",

Both cell types produce abundant proteoglycan aggrecan (ACAN), crucial for the extracellular matrix. We generated two human iPSC lines containing an ACAN-2A-mScarlet reporter. The reporter cell lines were validated using CRISPR-mediated transactivation and functionally validated during notochord and cartilage differentiation. The ability to isolate differentiated cell populations producing ACAN enables their enrichment even in the absence of specific cell markers and allows for comprehensive studies and protocol refinement.

The recent discovery of room-temperature plasticity in some inorganic semiconductors offers a promising solution, but the deformation mechanisms remain controversial. Here, we investigate the deformation of indium selenide, a two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductor with substantial plasticity. By developing a machine-learned deep potential, we perform atomistic simulations that capture the deformation features of hexagonal indium selenide upon out-of-plane compression. Unexpectedly, we find that indium selenide plastifies through a martensitic transformation; that is, the layered hexagonal structure is converted to a tetragonal lattice with specific orientation relationship. This observation is corroborated by high-resolution experimental observations and theory. It suggests a change of paradigm, where the design of new plastically deformable inorganic semiconductors can focus on compositions and structures that facilitate phase transformations, going beyond the conventional dislocation slip.",

Here, we examine temporal trends in the diversity of nitrogen-fixing plants and their relationships with anthropogenic nitrogen deposition while accounting for changes in temperature and aridity. We used forest-floor vegetation resurveys of temperate forests in Europe and the United States spanning multiple decades. Nitrogen-fixer richness declined as nitrogen deposition increased over time but did not respond to changes in climate. Phylogenetic diversity also declined, as distinct lineages of N-fixers were lost between surveys, but the “winners” and “losers” among nitrogen-fixing lineages varied among study sites, suggesting that losses are context dependent.

While many studies have identified the mechanisms of Rb phosphorylation, the mechanism underlying Rb’s decreasing concentration in G 1 was unknown. Here, we found that Rb’s concentration decrease in G 1 requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5. UBR5 knockout cells have increased Rb concentration in early G 1 , exhibited a lower G 1 -S transition rate, and are more sensitive to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (Cdk4/6).

The engineered peptide nanofibers can hitchhike ultrafast (&lt;5 s) and efficiently on both resting and activated platelets in a receptor-independent and species-independent manner. Mechanistic studies showed that unique secondary structure of nanofibers, which lead to surface exposure of hydrophobic and hydrogen bond–forming groups, might primarily contribute to the selective and efficient platelet-hitchhiking behavior. After intravenous injection, these peptide nanofibers hitchhiked in situ on circulating platelets and achieved almost 20-fold lung accumulation.

Furthermore, inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase with erlotinib hydrochloride attenuated stromal activation.

This has raised concerns about the practice’s impact on wild fish stocks, ecosystems, and coastal communities that rely on these fish. The aquaculture industry claims a decreasing dependence on wild fish, relying on the Fish In:Fish Out (FIFO) metric as a ratio of the quantity of wild fish required for farmed fish production. This is misleading because it usually assumes constant FM or FO yields, inclusion rates and feed conversion ratios, which vary widely. Thus, a constant FIFO value for a given species cannot be assumed. Furthermore, low FIFO values resulting from averaging carnivores and herbivores conceal the high feed requirements of carnivore species. The increasing use of FMFO from by-products does not demonstrate a decreased use of wild fish but rather reflects a growing demand for FMFO, particularly for the fast growing and valuable salmon and shrimp farming industries.",

However, the hyperpolarized state exponentially decays back to the thermal equilibrium, depending on the spin-lattice relaxation time ( T 1 ). Because of the limitation in T 1 , peptide-based DNP NMR molecular probes applicable in vivo have been limited to amino acids or dipeptides. Here, we report the direct detection of in vivo metabolic conversions of hyperpolarized 13 C-oligopeptides. Structure-based T 1 relaxation analysis suggests that the C-terminal [1- 13 C]Gly- d 2 residue affords sufficient T 1 for biological uses, even in relatively large oligopeptides, and allowed us to develop 13 C-β-casomorphin-5 and 13 C-glutathione.

We explore this question with large-scale networks of spatially ordered spiking neuron models where a downstream network receives input from an upstream sender network. We show that linear measures of the communication between the sender and receiver networks can discriminate between emergent or inherited population dynamics. A match in the dimensionality of the sender and receiver population activities promotes faithful communication. In contrast, a nonlinear mapping between the sender to receiver activity, for example, through downstream emergent population-wide fluctuations, can impair linear communication.

Collectively, we refer to these four types of risks as “dewilding.” In this systematic review, we searched Scopus and Web of Science for recent literature documenting mariculture’s dewilding impacts to organize and collate this evidence under one unified framework. We find that mariculture’s dewilding impacts are consistently documented, though often in isolation, and that captivity and conceptual dewilding impacts are recognized as potential harms far less than impacts on the environment and wildlife. Future work examining mariculture’s dewilding impacts will be paramount to guiding human decision-making and activity going forward.",

Pancreatic-specific knockout of the SEMA3D gene from the KRAS G12D and TP53 R172H mutation knock-in, PDX1-Cre(KPC) mouse model demonstrated delayed tumor initiation, prolonged survival, absence of metastasis, and reduced M2 macrophage expression. Mechanistically, tumor- and nerve-derived SEMA3D indirectly reprograms macrophages through KRAS MUT -dependent ARF6 signaling in PDA cells, resulting in increased lactate production, which is sensed by GPCR132 on macrophages to stimulate protumorigenic M2 polarization. Multiplex immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased M2-polarized macrophages proximal to nerves in SEMA3D-expressing human PDA tissue. This study suggests that altered SEMA3D expression leads to an acquisition of cancer-promoting functions, and nerve-derived SEMA3D is “hijacked” by PDA cells to support growth and metastasis in a KRAS MUT -dependent manner.",

We designed an e-Flower achieving a curvature as low as 300 micrometers within minutes, a value tunable by the choice of reswelling media and hydrogel cross-linker concentration.

Furthermore, a metric that incorporates wild fish mortality during capture and excludes unfed systems raises the wild fish mortality–to–farmed fish output ratio to 0.57 to 1.78. We also evaluate terrestrial ingredients in aquaculture feeds. Widely cited estimates of declines in wild fish use from 1997 to 2017 entailed a trade-off of more than fivefold increase in feed crops over the same period.

Here, we show that field-scale observations of sliding velocity and pore water pressure at two creeping landslides are explained by velocity-strengthening friction, in close agreement with laboratory measurements on similar materials. This suggests that the rate-strengthening friction commonly measured in clay-rich materials may govern episodic slow slip in landslides, in addition to tectonic faults. Further, our results show more generally that transient slow slip can arise in velocity-strengthening materials from modulation of effective normal stress through pore pressure fluctuations. This challenges the idea that episodic slow slip requires a narrow range of transitional frictional properties near the stability threshold, or pore pressure feedbacks operating on initially unstable frictional slip.",

Molecular screening of infectious agents in farmed and wild salmon and environmental DNA highlights a further 4 agents that are likely elevated near salmon farms and 37 that co-occur in wild and farmed salmon. Pathogens likely affect wild salmon indirectly by mediating migration, competition, and predation. Current net-pen aquaculture practices pose these risks to numerous populations of all species of wild salmon in BC, most of which are not covered in Government of Canada science and advisory reports.

Transitioning from a proliferative to an invasive melanoma phenotype is coupled with increased ferroptosis vulnerability.

In this work, we identified Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) as the top lipid-metabolism gene segregating the melanoma MITF high /AXL low proliferative/ferroptosis-resistant from MITF low /AXL high invasive/ferroptosis-sensitive state. Mechanistically, ApoE secreted by the MITF high /AXL low cells protects the invasive phenotype from ferroptosis-inducing agents by reducing the content of peroxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids and boosting GPX4 levels both in vitro and in vivo. Whole-exome sequencing indicates that APOE high expression in patients with melanoma is associated with resistance to ferroptosis, regardless of APOE germline status. In aggregate, we found a ferroptosis-resistance mechanism between melanoma cell states relying on secreted ApoE and APOE high expression as a potential biomarker for poor ferroptosis response in melanoma.",

However, 2′3′-cGAMP function beyond innate immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that 2′3′-cGAMP promotes cell migration independent of innate immunity. 2′3′-cGAMP interactome analysis identifies the small GTPase Rab18 as a 2′3′-cGAMP binding partner and effector in cell migration control. Mechanistically, 2′3′-cGAMP binds Rab18 to facilitate GTP loading and subsequent Rab18 activation, which further promotes FosB transcription in facilitating cell migration. Induced synthesis of endogenous 2′3′-cGAMP by intrabreast tumor bacterium S. aureus infection or low-dose doxorubicin treatment facilitates cell migration depending on the cGAS/cGAMP/Rab18/FosB signaling. We find that lovastatin induces Rab18 deprenylation that abolishes 2′3′-cGAMP recognition therefore suppressing cell migration. Together, our study reveals a previously unidentified 2′3′-cGAMP function in cell migration control via the 2′3′-cGAMP/Rab18/FosB signaling that provides additional insights into clinical applications of 2′3′-cGAMP.",

Framing aquaculture as a monolith, however, overlooks its extreme taxonomic diversity. This paper assesses the welfare risks associated with that diversity, establishing seven species-level risk factors from involved parental care to long lifespans. Investigating these welfare risks across all aquatic species reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed an uneven distribution of risk, with extreme species-level risks in chordates, crustaceans, and cephalopod mollusks. Compared to species with fewer risks, species with extreme welfare risks were found to cost more and contribute the least to global production. This work challenges the notion that prioritizing animal welfare is incompatible with addressing food security and creates the possibility of identifying certain plant and invertebrate species, like seaweeds and bivalves, that minimize welfare concerns while providing affordability and accessibility. Going forward, proactive welfare approaches are needed to inform consumer choice and shape just and sustainable aquaculture policy.",

These step changes in the sources of intraplate magmatism stem from a rapid increase in the supply of deeply subducted lithosphere during the protracted formation of Pangea following the widespread onset of “modern” (cold and deep) subduction in the late Neoproterozoic.

We find that stably enriched transcripts contain inefficiently excised introns and that disruption of nuclear speckles specifically affects splicing of speckle-enriched transcripts. We further reveal RNA sequence features contributing to transcript speckle localization, indicating a tight interplay between transcript speckle enrichment, genome organization, and splicing efficiency. Collectively, our data highlight a role of nuclear speckles in both co- and posttranscriptional splicing regulation.

The displacement paradox refers to circumstances where increasing use of a potential substitute for a resource (e.g., farmed fish) does not lead to proportionate reduction in consumption of the other resource (e.g., wild fish). The literature on the displacement paradox and the Jevons paradox suggests that there may be unanticipated consequences from the rise of aquaculture that may be detrimental for fisheries conservation. Here, we present theoretical explanations, drawing on the tragedy of the commodity, for understanding the tendencies for these technological paradoxes to occur and emphasize their relevance for concerns associated with fisheries and aquaculture systems.",

          "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve tumors driven by loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor in Schwann cells. PNFs are rich in immune cells, but whether immune cells are necessary for tumorigenesis is unknown. We show that inhibition of stimulator of interferon gene (STING) reduces plasma CXCL10, tumor T cell and dendritic cell (DC) recruitment, and tumor formation. Further, mice lacking XCR-1 + DCs showed reduced tumor-infiltrating T cells and PNF tumors. Antigen-presenting cells from tumor-bearing mice promoted CD8 + T cell proliferation in vitro, and PNF T cells expressed high levels of CCL5, implicating T cell activation. Notably, tumors and nerve-associated macrophages were absent in Rag1 −/− ; Nf1 f/f ; DhhCre mice and adoptive transfer of CD8 + T cells from tumor-bearing mice restored PNF initiation. In this setting, PNF shrunk upon subsequent T cell removal. Thus, STING pathway activation contributes to CD8 + T cell–dependent inflammatory responses required for PNF initiation and maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have achieved impressive antitumor clinical outcomes. However, the limited response rates suggest the incomplete understanding of PD-L1 regulation. Here, we demonstrate that vacuole protein sorting 11 and 18 (VPS11/18), two key players in vesicular trafficking, positively regulate PD-L1 and confer resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. VPS11/18 interact with PD-L1 in endosome recycling accompanied by promoting PD-L1 glycosylation and protein stability. VPS18 deficiency enhances antitumor immune response. Pharmacological inhibition by VPS18 inhibitor RDN impaired PD-L1 member trafficking and protein stability. Combination treatment of RDN and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 synergistically enhances antitumor efficacy in aggressive and drug-resistant tumors. RDN exerted lung-preferred distribution and good bioavailability, suggesting a favorable drug efficacy. Together, our study links VPS18/11-mediated trans-Golgi network recycling of PD-L1 and points to a promising treatment strategy for the enhancement of antitumor immunity.",
