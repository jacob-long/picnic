          "abstract": "Most birds can navigate seamlessly between aerial and terrestrial environments. Whereas the forelimbs evolved into wings primarily for flight, the hindlimbs serve diverse functions such as walking, hopping and leaping, and jumping take-off for transitions into flight1. These capabilities have inspired engineers to aim for similar multimodality in aerial robots, expanding their range of applications across diverse environments. However, challenges remain in reproducing multimodal locomotion, across gaits with distinct kinematics and propulsive characteristics, such as walking and jumping, while preserving lightweight mass for flight. This trade-off between mechanical complexity and versatility2 limits most existing aerial robots to only one additional locomotor mode3,4,5. Here we overcome the complexity–versatility trade-off with RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments), which uses its bird-inspired multifunctional legs to jump rapidly into flight, walk on the ground, and hop over obstacles and gaps similar to the multimodal locomotion of birds. We show that jumping for take-off contributes substantially to the initial flight take-off speed6,7,8,9 and, remarkably, that it is more energy efficient than taking off without the jump. Our analysis suggests an important trade-off in mass distribution between legs and body among birds adapted for different locomotor strategies, with greater investment in leg mass among terrestrial birds with multimodal gait demands. Multifunctional robot legs expand the opportunities to deploy traditional fixed-wing aircraft in complex terrains through autonomous take-offs and multimodal gaits.",

          "abstract": "Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) 1 , which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations 2,3 . However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk. Overall, MLWP has remained less accurate and reliable than state-of-the-art NWP ensemble forecasts. Here we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, ENS, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 4 . GenCast is an ML weather prediction method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25° latitude–longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 min. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.2% of 1,320 targets we evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, in which crucial weather-dependent decisions are made more accurately and efficiently.",

          "abstract": "Although separation is entropically unfavourable, it is often essential for our life1,2. The separation of very similar macromolecules such as deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) and their single nucleotide variants is difficult but holds great advantage for the progress of life science3. Here we report that a particular liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) at a solid–liquid interface led to the partitioning of DNAs with nearly identical structures. We found this intriguing phenomenon when we did drop-casting onto a glass plate an aqueous ammonium sulfate dispersion of phase-separated droplets comprising a homogeneous mixture of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) samples with different termini. Even when the molecular weights of their PEG parts were identical to each other, terminally different PEGs spread competitively at the solid–liquid interface and partitioned into micrometre-scale concentric circles. We found that this competitive spreading was induced by an ammonium sulfate layer spontaneously formed on the glass surface. We successfully extended the above mechanism to partitioning a mixture of nearly identical DNAs into concentric circles followed by their selective extraction using the salting-in effect. We could isolate a human cancer-causing single nucleotide variant in 97% purity from its 1:1 mixture with the original DNA.",

          "abstract": "New particle formation (NPF) in the tropical upper troposphere is a globally important source of atmospheric aerosols 1–4 . It is known to occur over the Amazon basin, but the nucleation mechanism and chemical precursors have yet to be identified 2 . Here we present comprehensive in situ aircraft measurements showing that extremely low-volatile oxidation products of isoprene, particularly certain organonitrates, drive NPF in the Amazonian upper troposphere. The organonitrates originate from OH-initiated oxidation of isoprene from forest emissions in the presence of nitrogen oxides from lightning. Nucleation bursts start about 2 h after sunrise in the outflow of nocturnal deep convection, producing high aerosol concentrations of more than 50,000 particles cm − 3 . We report measurements of characteristic diurnal cycles of precursor gases and particles. Our observations show that the interplay between biogenic isoprene, deep tropical convection with associated lightning, oxidation photochemistry and the low ambient temperature uniquely promotes NPF. The particles grow over time, undergo long-range transport and descend through subsidence to the lower troposphere, in which they can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that influence the Earth’s hydrological cycle, radiation budget and climate 1,4–8 .",

          "abstract": "The stretch reflex is a fundamental component of the motor system that orchestrates the coordinated muscle contractions underlying movement. At the heart of this process lie the muscle spindles (MS), specialized receptors finely attuned to fluctuations in tension within intrafusal muscle fibres. The tension variation in the MS triggers a series of neuronal events including an initial depolarization of sensory type Ia afferents that subsequently causes the activation of motoneurons within the spinal cord 1,2 . This neuronal cascade culminates in the execution of muscle contraction, underscoring a presumed closed-loop mechanism between the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. By contrast, here we report the discovery of a new population of macrophages with exclusive molecular and functional signatures within the MS that express the machinery for synthesizing and releasing glutamate. Using mouse intersectional genetics with optogenetics and electrophysiology, we show that activation of MS macrophages (MSMP) drives proprioceptive sensory neuron firing on a millisecond timescale. MSMP activate spinal circuits, motor neurons and muscles by means of a glutamate-dependent mechanism that excites the MS. Furthermore, MSMP respond to neural and muscle activation by increasing the expression of glutaminase, enabling them to convert the uptaken glutamine released by myocytes during muscle contraction into glutamate. Selective silencing or depletion of MSMP in hindlimb muscles disrupted the modulation of the stretch reflex for force generation and sensory feedback correction, impairing locomotor strategies in mice. Our results have identified a new cellular component, the MSMP, that directly regulates neural activity and muscle contraction. The glutamate-mediated signalling of MSMP and their dynamic response to sensory cues introduce a new dimension to our understanding of sensation and motor action, potentially offering innovative therapeutic approaches in conditions that affect sensorimotor function.",

          "abstract": "A central question in biology is how macromolecular machines function cooperatively. In bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, and can be physically and functionally coupled 1–4 . Although high-resolution structures of the ribosome–RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex have provided initial mechanistic insights into the coupling process 5–10 , we lack knowledge of how these structural snapshots are placed along a dynamic reaction trajectory. Here we reconstitute a complete and active transcription–translation system and develop multi-colour single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments to directly and simultaneously track transcription elongation, translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and the RNAP in real time. Our data show that physical coupling between ribosome and RNAP can occur over hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA by mRNA looping, a process facilitated by NusG. We detect active transcription elongation during mRNA looping and show that NusA-paused RNAPs can be activated by the ribosome by long-range physical coupling. Conversely, the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP. We hereby provide an alternative explanation for how the ribosome can efficiently rescue RNAP from frequent pausing without requiring collisions by a closely trailing ribosome. Overall, our dynamic data mechanistically highlight an example of how two central macromolecular machineries, the ribosome and RNAP, can physically and functionally cooperate to optimize gene expression.",

          "abstract": "During reproduction, multiple species such as insects and all mammals undergo extensive physiological and morphological adaptions to ensure health and survival of the mother and optimal development of the offspring. Here we report that the intestinal epithelium undergoes expansion during pregnancy and lactation in mammals. This enlargement of the intestinal surface area results in a novel geometry of expanded villi. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ (RANK, encoded by TNFRSF11A ) and its ligand RANKL were identified as a molecular pathway involved in this villous expansion of the small intestine in vivo in mice and in intestinal mouse and human organoids. Mechanistically, RANK–RANKL protects gut epithelial cells from cell death and controls the intestinal stem cell niche through BMP receptor signalling, resulting in the elongation of villi and a prominent increase in the intestinal surface. As a transgenerational consequence, babies born to female mice that lack Rank in the intestinal epithelium show reduced weight and develop glucose intolerance after metabolic stress. Whereas gut epithelial remodelling in pregnancy/lactation is reversible, constitutive expression of an active form of RANK is sufficient to drive intestinal expansion followed by loss of villi and stem cells, and prevents the formation of Apc min -driven small intestinal stem cell tumours. These data identify RANK–RANKL as a pathway that drives intestinal epithelial expansion in pregnancy/lactation, one of the most elusive and fundamental tissue remodelling events in mammalian life history and evolution.",

          "abstract": "Anhedonia, the diminished drive to seek, value, and learn about rewards, is a core feature of major depressive disorder 1–3 . The neural underpinnings of anhedonia and how this emotional state drives behaviour remain unclear. Here we investigated the neural code of anhedonia by taking advantage of the fact that when mice are exposed to traumatic social stress, susceptible animals become socially withdrawn and anhedonic, whereas others remain resilient. By performing high-density electrophysiology to record neural activity patterns in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral CA1 (vCA1), we identified neural signatures of susceptibility and resilience. When mice actively sought rewards, BLA activity in resilient mice showed robust discrimination between reward choices. By contrast, susceptible mice exhibited a rumination-like signature, in which BLA neurons encoded the intention to switch or stay on a previously chosen reward. Manipulation of vCA1 inputs to the BLA in susceptible mice rescued dysfunctional neural dynamics, amplified dynamics associated with resilience, and reversed anhedonic behaviour. Finally, when animals were at rest, the spontaneous BLA activity of susceptible mice showed a greater number of distinct neural population states. This spontaneous activity allowed us to decode group identity and to infer whether a mouse had a history of stress better than behavioural outcomes alone. This work reveals population-level neural dynamics that explain individual differences in responses to traumatic stress, and suggests that modulating vCA1–BLA inputs can enhance resilience by regulating these dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Most stars in today’s Universe reside within spheroids, which are bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies1,2. Their formation is still an unsolved problem3,4,5. Infrared/submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshifts6 have long been suspected to be related to spheroid formation7,8,9,10,11,12. Proving this connection has been hampered so far by heavy dust obscuration when focusing on their stellar emission13,14,15 or by methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking at submillimetre wavelengths16,17. Here we show that spheroids are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies in the distant Universe. This follows from the ALMA submillimetre surface brightness profiles, which deviate substantially from those of exponential disks, and from the skewed-high axis-ratio distribution. Most of these galaxies are fully triaxial rather than flat disks: the ratio of the shortest to the longest of their three axes is half, on average, and increases with spatial compactness. These observations, supported by simulations, reveal a cosmologically relevant pathway for in situ spheroid formation through starbursts that is probably preferentially triggered by interactions (and mergers) acting on galaxies fed by non-coplanar gas accretion streams.",

Continuous measurements yield information-rich time series of physiological data that are holistic and clinically meaningful. Although most wearable sensors were initially restricted to biophysical measurements, the next generation of wearable devices is now emerging that enable biochemical monitoring of both small and large molecules in a variety of body fluids, such as sweat, breath, saliva, tears and interstitial fluid. Rapidly evolving data analysis and decision-making technologies through artificial intelligence has accelerated the application of wearables around the world. Although recent pilot trials have demonstrated the clinical applicability of these wearable devices, their widespread adoption will require large-scale validation across various conditions, ethical consideration and sociocultural acceptance. Successful translation of wearable devices from laboratory prototypes into clinical tools will further require a comprehensive transitional environment involving all stakeholders. The wearable device platforms must gain acceptance among different user groups, add clinical value for various medical indications, be eligible for reimbursements and contribute to public health initiatives. In this Perspective, we review state-of-the-art wearable devices for body-fluid analysis and their translation into clinical applications, and provide insight into their clinical purpose.",

However, established technologies such as chimeric antigen receptors3 can only detect immobilized antigens, have limited output scope and lack built-in drug control3,4,5,6,7. Here we engineer synthetic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are capable of driving a wide range of native or non-native cellular processes in response to a user-defined antigen. We achieve modular antigen gating by engineering and fusing a conditional auto-inhibitory domain onto GPCR scaffolds. Antigen binding to a fused nanobody relieves auto-inhibition and enables receptor activation by drug, thus generating programmable antigen-gated G-protein-coupled engineered receptors (PAGERs). We create PAGERs that are responsive to more than a dozen biologically and therapeutically important soluble and cell-surface antigens in a single step from corresponding nanobody binders. Different PAGER scaffolds allow antigen binding to drive transgene expression, real-time fluorescence or endogenous G-protein activation, enabling control of diverse cellular functions. We demonstrate multiple applications of PAGER, including induction of T cell migration along a soluble antigen gradient, control of macrophage differentiation, secretion of therapeutic antibodies and inhibition of neuronal activity in mouse brain slices. Owing to its modular design and generalizability, we expect PAGERs to have broad utility in discovery and translational science.",

It has been proposed that fructose promotes the growth of some tumours directly by serving as a fuel2,3. Here we show that fructose supplementation enhances tumour growth in animal models of melanoma, breast cancer and cervical cancer without causing weight gain or insulin resistance. The cancer cells themselves were unable to use fructose readily as a nutrient because they did not express ketohexokinase-C (KHK-C). Primary hepatocytes did express KHK-C, resulting in fructolysis and the excretion of a variety of lipid species, including lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). In co-culture experiments, hepatocyte-derived LPCs were consumed by cancer cells and used to generate phosphatidylcholines, the major phospholipid of cell membranes. In vivo, supplementation with high-fructose corn syrup increased several LPC species by more than sevenfold in the serum. Administration of LPCs to mice was sufficient to increase tumour growth. Pharmacological inhibition of ketohexokinase had no direct effect on cancer cells, but it decreased circulating LPC levels and prevented fructose-mediated tumour growth in vivo. These findings reveal that fructose supplementation increases circulating nutrients such as LPCs, which can enhance tumour growth through a cell non-autonomous mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) 1,2 , partly because there are immunosuppressive myeloid cells in tumours 3,4 . However, the heterogeneity of myeloid cells has made them difficult to target, making blockade of the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) clinically ineffective. Here we use single-cell profiling on patient biopsies across the disease continuum and find that a distinct population of tumour-associated macrophages with elevated levels of SPP1 transcripts ( SPP1 hi -TAMs) becomes enriched with the progression of prostate cancer to mCRPC. In syngeneic mouse modelling, an analogous macrophage population suppresses CD8 + T cell activity in vitro and promotes ICI resistance in vivo. Furthermore, Spp1 hi -TAMs are not responsive to anti-CSF1R antibody treatment. Pathway analysis identifies adenosine signalling as a potential mechanism for SPP1 hi -TAM-mediated immunotherapeutic resistance. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) significantly reverses Spp1 hi -TAM-mediated immunosuppression in CD8 + T cells in vitro and enhances CRPC responsiveness to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in vivo. Consistent with preclinical results, inhibition of A2ARs using ciforadenant in combination with programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade using atezolizumab induces clinical responses in patients with mCRPC. Moreover, inhibiting A2ARs results in a significant decrease in SPP1 hi -TAM abundance in CRPC, indicating that this pathway is involved in both induction and downstream immunosuppression. Collectively, these findings establish SPP1 hi -TAMs as key mediators of ICI resistance in mCRPC through adenosine signalling, emphasizing their importance as both a therapeutic target and a potential biomarker for predicting treatment efficacy.",

          "abstract": "The response of breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies substantially, even when tumours belong to the same molecular or histological subtype1. Here we identify the oestrous cycle as an important contributor to this heterogeneity. In three mouse models of breast cancer, we show reduced responses to NAC when treatment is initiated during the dioestrus stage, when compared with initiation during the oestrus stage. Similar findings were observed in retrospective premenopausal cohorts of human patients. Mechanistically, the dioestrus stage exhibits systemic and localized changes, including (1) an increased number of cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition linked to chemoresistance2,3,4 and (2) decreased tumour vessel diameter, suggesting potential constraints to drug sensitivity and delivery. In addition, an elevated presence of macrophages, previously associated with chemoresistance induction5, characterizes the dioestrus phase. Whereas NAC disrupts the oestrous cycle, this elevated macrophage prevalence persists and depletion of macrophages mitigates the reduced therapy response observed when initiating treatment during dioestrus. Our data collectively demonstrate the oestrous cycle as a crucial infradian rhythm determining chemosensitivity, warranting future clinical studies to exploit optimal treatment initiation timing for enhanced chemotherapy outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The inclusion of microexons by alternative splicing occurs frequently in neuronal proteins. The roles of these sequences are largely unknown, and changes in their degree of inclusion are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders1. We have previously shown that decreased inclusion of a 24-nucleotide neuron-specific microexon in CPEB4, a RNA-binding protein that regulates translation through cytoplasmic changes in poly(A) tail length, is linked to idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD)2. Why this microexon is required and how small changes in its degree of inclusion have a dominant-negative effect on the expression of ASD-linked genes is unclear. Here we show that neuronal CPEB4 forms condensates that dissolve after depolarization, a transition associated with a switch from translational repression to activation. Heterotypic interactions between the microexon and a cluster of histidine residues prevent the irreversible aggregation of CPEB4 by competing with homotypic interactions between histidine clusters. We conclude that the microexon is required in neuronal CPEB4 to preserve the reversible regulation of CPEB4-mediated gene expression in response to neuronal stimulation.",

Ageing-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress tumorigenesis3,4, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here we use physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered5,6 mouse models and primary cells5,6 to demonstrate that ageing suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading the stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by the ageing-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, which leads to functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1–lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescues stemness and promotes the tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1–lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells through ferroptosis induction. Ageing-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites is associated with increased NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells through DNA methylation inhibition. We uncover that ageing drives functional iron insufficiency that leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate at a young age, thereby highlighting the importance of directing cancer prevention efforts towards young individuals.",

          "abstract": "The maintenance of genomic integrity in rapidly proliferating cells is a substantial challenge during embryonic development1,2,3. Although numerous cell-intrinsic mechanisms have been revealed4,5,6,7, little is known about genome-protective effects and influences of developmental tissue microenvironments on tissue-forming cells. Here we show that fetal liver hepatocytes provide protection to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) genomes. Lineage tracing and depletion in mice demonstrated that delayed hepatocyte development in early fetal livers increased the chromosomal instability of newly colonizing HSPCs. In addition, HSPCs developed tolerance to genotoxins in hepatocyte-conditioned medium, suggesting that hepatocytes protect the HSPC genome in a paracrine manner. Proteomic analyses demonstrated the enrichment of fetuin-A in hepatocyte-conditioned medium but not in early fetal livers. Fetuin-A activates a Toll-like receptor pathway to prevent pathogenic R-loop accumulation in HSPCs undergoing DNA replication and gene transcription in the fetal liver. Numerous haematopoietic regulatory genes frequently involved in leukaemogenic mutations are associated with R-loop-enriched regions. In Fetua-knockout mice, HSPCs showed increased genome instability and susceptibility to malignancy induction. Moreover, low concentrations of fetuin-A correlated with the oncogenesis of childhood leukaemia. Therefore, we uncover a mechanism operating in developmental tissues that offers tissue-forming cell genome protection and is implicated in developmental-related diseases.",

          "abstract": "Aircraft observations have revealed ubiquitous new particle formation in the tropical upper troposphere over the Amazon 1,2 and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans 3,4 . Although the vapours involved remain unknown, recent satellite observations have revealed surprisingly high night-time isoprene mixing ratios of up to 1 part per billion by volume (ppbv) in the tropical upper troposphere 5 . Here, in experiments performed with the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber, we report new particle formation initiated by the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with isoprene at upper-tropospheric temperatures of −30 °C and −50 °C. We find that isoprene-oxygenated organic molecules (IP-OOM) nucleate at concentrations found in the upper troposphere, without requiring any more vapours. Moreover, the nucleation rates are enhanced 100-fold by extremely low concentrations of sulfuric acid or iodine oxoacids above 10 5 cm −3 , reaching rates around 30 cm −3 s −1 at acid concentrations of 10 6 cm −3 . Our measurements show that nucleation involves sequential addition of IP-OOM, together with zero or one acid molecule in the embryonic molecular clusters. IP-OOM also drive rapid particle growth at 3–60 nm h −1 . We find that rapid nucleation and growth rates persist in the presence of NO x at upper-tropospheric concentrations from lightning. Our laboratory measurements show that isoprene emitted by rainforests may drive rapid new particle formation in extensive regions of the tropical upper troposphere 1,2 , resulting in tens of thousands of particles per cubic centimetre.",

In this Registered Report, we asked participants to infer the mental states of unfamiliar people, identified by their neutral faces, under specific contexts. To increase generalizability, we representatively sampled all stimuli from inclusive sets using computational methods. We tested four hypotheses: that trait impressions of faces (1) are correlated with subsequent mental state inferences in a range of contexts, (2) alter the dimensional space that underlies mental state inferences, (3) are associated with specific mental state dimensions in this space and (4) causally influence mental state inferences.

We introduce a diffusion index that quantifies whether research areas have been amplified within social and scientific bubbles, or have diffused and become evaluated more broadly. We illustrate the utility of our diffusion approach in tracking the trajectories of cardiac stem cell research (a bubble that collapsed) and cancer immunotherapy (which showed sustained growth). We then trace the diffusion of 28,504 subfields in biomedicine comprising nearly 1.9 M papers and more than 80 M citations to demonstrate that limited diffusion of biomedical knowledge anticipates abrupt decreases in popularity. Our analysis emphasizes that restricted diffusion, implying a socio-epistemic bubble, leads to dramatic collapses in relevance and attention accorded to scientific knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Active labor market programs (ALMPs) are widely used to speed up return to work among the unemployed. We examine their long-run effects on employment- and health-related outcomes for different target groups, arguing that ALMPs are associated with heterogeneous effects for different target groups and may even detrimentally influence the mental health for the most disadvantaged groups. To this end, we use evidence from randomized controlled trials conducted in Denmark in 2005–2008, in which treatment groups were exposed to intensified active labor market policies in the form of more frequent compulsory meetings with case workers and/or early activation and estimate effects over a period of 10 y. In line with expectations, we find that while ALMPs have the potential to increase labor market participation among resourceful clients even 10 after the original intervention, they have long-run negative effects on the mental health for the most disadvantaged groups among the unemployed. The negative effects are entirely driven by clients who already prior to the trial had mental health issues. These findings suggest that the effects of ALMPs are lasting, but at the same time greatly depend on how they fit with the resources of clients.",

          "abstract": "Childhood exposure to social disadvantage is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders and poor developmental, educational, and occupational outcomes, presumably because adverse exposures alter the neurodevelopmental processes that contribute to risk trajectories. Yet, given the limited social mobility in the United States and other countries, childhood social disadvantage is frequently preceded by maternal social disadvantage during pregnancy, potentially altering fetal brain development during a period of high neuroplasticity through hormonal, microbiome, epigenetic, and immune factors that cross the placenta and fetal blood–brain barrier. The current study examines prenatal social disadvantage to determine whether these exposures in utero are associated with alterations in functional brain networks as early as birth. As part of the Early Life Adversity and Biological Embedding study, mothers were recruited during pregnancy, prenatal social disadvantage was assessed across trimesters, and their healthy, full-term offspring were imaged using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging during the first weeks of life. Multivariate machine learning methods revealed that neonatal functional connectivity (FC) varied as a function of prenatal exposure to social disadvantage (n = 261, R = 0.43, R 2 = 0.18), with validation in an independent sample. Alterations in FC associated with prenatal social disadvantage occurred brain-wide and were most pronounced in association networks (fronto-parietal, ventral attention, dorsal attention) and the somatomotor network. Amygdala FC was altered at birth, with a pattern shared across subcortical structures. These findings provide critical insights into how early in development functional networks begin to diverge in the context of social disadvantage and elucidate the functional networks that are most impacted.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to promote sustainable resource use through reduced meat consumption face challenges as global meat consumption persists. The resistance may be attributed to the lower sales price of meat compared to most plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs). Addressing this, our research delves into the pivotal question of which PBMAs resonate most with consumers and how pricing affects demand. In a hypothetical restaurant context, we conducted 2 representative studies among 2,126 individuals in the United States to scrutinize preferences for meat, analog, semi-analog, and non-analog burgers. First, in a survey, we assessed rankings of the four burgers, alongside evaluating participants’ genuine consideration of these choices to discern a diverse preference distribution. Subsequently, in an experiment, we examined the influence of prices on participants’ consideration and choice of PBMAs, thereby capturing both phases of the decision-making process. Our survey shows that meat has considerably higher utility and consumer preference than all PBMAs on average, but we also find substantial heterogeneity (i.e., some consumers prefer PBMAs over meat). In the experiment, we establish that there is a negative association between the consideration of meat and PBMA burgers, though consideration of any one PBMA is positively associated with considering other PBMAs. A noteworthy increase in consideration and choice is observed when prices of PBMAs are reduced, while changing the price of the meat burger only has minimal effect on demand. Such findings underscore the importance of affordability beyond price parity in catalyzing the shift toward plant-based diets.",

          "authors": "Rebecca A. Johnson, Tyler Simko, Kosuke Imai",
          "abstract": "A large body of research documents the barriers faced by first-generation, low-income (FGLI) students as “hidden minorities” on elite college campuses. Although existing studies show brief psychological interventions can help mitigate some of these obstacles, universities are investing in more intensive interventions that try to both shift mindsets and mitigate structural disadvantages in FGLI students’ academic preparation. In collaboration with the administrators at a highly selective university, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of a summer bridge program targeted at FGLI students. During summers between 2017 and 2019, we randomly selected 232 out of 418 first-generation or low-income students and invited them to attend an intensive, six-week-long residential summer program featuring courses for academic credit. Students randomized to the control group either interacted with online content offering no academic credit or had no summer intervention. Our preregistered analysis shows that the program encouraged FGLI students to pursue a more ambitious first-year program, increasing the proportion of nonintroductory courses by 7 percentage points. The program also increased the proportion of courses taken for a grade rather than as pass-fail by 6 percentage points. These improvements were accompanied by no discernible impact on first-year grade point averages (GPAs) and academic withdrawal. The findings show the potential to academically integrate FGLI students into selective university communities.",

          "abstract": "In fighting infectious diseases posing a global health threat, ranging from influenza to Zika, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social distancing and face covering, remain mitigation measures public health can resort to. However, the success of NPI lies in sufficiently high levels of collective compliance, otherwise giving rise to recurrent infections that are not only driven by pathogen evolution but also changing vigilance in the population. Here, we show that compliance with each NPI measure can be highly dynamic and context-dependent during an ongoing epidemic, where individuals may prefer one to another or even do nothing, leading to intricate temporal switching behavior of NPI adoptions. By characterizing dynamic regimes through the perceived costs of NPI measures and their effectiveness in particular regarding face covering and social distancing, our work offers insights into overcoming barriers in NPI adoptions.",

Recent AI language models have shown impressive ability in fact-checking tasks, but how humans interact with fact-checking information provided by these models is unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of fact-checking information generated by a popular large language model (LLM) on belief in, and sharing intent of, political news headlines in a preregistered randomized control experiment. Although the LLM accurately identifies most false headlines (90%), we find that this information does not significantly improve participants’ ability to discern headline accuracy or share accurate news. In contrast, viewing human-generated fact checks enhances discernment in both cases. Subsequent analysis reveals that the AI fact-checker is harmful in specific cases: It decreases beliefs in true headlines that it mislabels as false and increases beliefs in false headlines that it is unsure about. On the positive side, AI fact-checking information increases the sharing intent for correctly labeled true headlines. When participants are given the option to view LLM fact checks and choose to do so, they are significantly more likely to share both true and false news but only more likely to believe false headlines. Our findings highlight an important source of potential harm stemming from AI applications and underscore the critical need for policies to prevent or mitigate such unintended consequences.",

          "authors": "Makaiko G. Khonje, Matin Qaim",
          "abstract": "Child undernutrition remains a widespread public health problem in the Global South, especially in Africa. Childhood stunting—meaning linear growth retardation—is a comprehensive and commonly used indicator of chronic child undernutrition and is mostly the result of insufficient nutrient intake, among other factors. Previous research showed that the consumption of animal-sourced foods (ASF), including meat, dairy, eggs, and fish, is associated with lower rates of child stunting, but reliable evidence for Africa is scant. In Africa, average ASF consumption is low. We use representative panel data from five African countries—Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda—with over 32,000 observations from children aged 0 to 5 y to show that ASF consumption increases mean child height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) by 0.30 ( P &lt; 0.01) and reduces the likelihood of stunting by 6.8 percentage points ( P &lt; 0.01), after controlling for confounding factors. The child nutritional benefits of diets containing ASF are larger than those of purely plant-based diets. Nutritious plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and legumes, can provide most of the nutrients required and also have positive effects on HAZ, but they are sometimes not available and accessible in sufficient quantities all year round, especially in rural areas. Given the large environmental footprints of livestock farming, initiatives to make food systems more sustainable often call for a strong reduction in ASF consumption. While ASF consumption should be reduced where consumption quantities are high, our results suggest that poor households’ access to ASF in Africa should be further improved to help reduce child undernutrition.",

          "abstract": "The Planetary Health Diet (PHD), also known as the EAT-Lancet reference diet, was developed to optimize global dietary quality while keeping the environmental impacts of food production within sustainable planetary boundaries. We calculated current national and global adherence to the PHD using the Planetary Health Dietary Index (PHDI). In addition, we used data on diet and mortality from three large US cohorts (n = 206,404 men and women, 54,536 deaths) to estimate the total and cause-specific mortality among adults 20 y of age and older that could be prevented by shifting from current diets to the reference PHD. The PHDI varied substantially across countries, although adherence was universally far from optimal (mean PHDI = 85 out of 140). By improving the global PHDI to 120, approximately 15 million deaths (27% of total deaths) could be prevented annually. Estimates of preventable deaths due to this shift ranged from 2.5 million for cardiovascular diseases to 0.7 million for neurodegenerative diseases. Our analysis suggests that adopting healthy and sustainable diets would have major direct health benefits by reducing mortality due to multiple diseases and could contribute substantially to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. These numbers of preventable deaths are based on evidence that human biology is similar across racial and ethnic groups, but the exact numerical estimates should be interpreted with caution because some assumptions used for the calculations build on limited data. Refinement of these estimates will be possible when additional regional data on diet and mortality become available.",

          "abstract": "Arctic shorelines are vulnerable to climate change impacts as sea level rises, permafrost thaws, storms intensify, and sea ice thins. Seventy-five years of aerial and satellite observations have established coastal erosion as an increasing Arctic hazard. However, other hazards at play—for instance, the cumulative impact that sea-level rise and permafrost thaw subsidence will have on permafrost shorelines—have received less attention, preventing assessments of these processes’ impacts compared to and combined with coastal erosion. Alaska’s Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) is ideal for such assessments because of the high-density observations of topography, coastal retreat rates, and permafrost characteristics, and importance to Indigenous communities and oilfield infrastructure. Here, we produce 21st-century projections of Arctic shoreline position that include erosion, permafrost subsidence, and sea-level rise. Focusing on the ACP, we merge 5 m topography, satellite-derived coastal lake depth estimates, and empirical assessments of land subsidence due to permafrost thaw with projections of coastal erosion and sea-level rise for medium and high emissions scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s AR6 Report. We find that by 2100, erosion and inundation will together transform the ACP, leading to 6-8x more land loss than coastal erosion alone and disturbing 8-11x more organic carbon. Without mitigating measures, by 2100, coastal change could damage 40 to 65% of infrastructure in present-day ACP coastal villages and 10 to 20% of oilfield infrastructure. Our findings highlight the risks that compounding climate hazards pose to coastal communities and underscore the need for adaptive planning for Arctic coastlines in the 21st century.",

          "abstract": "Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs), which exploit the reversible redox reactions of water-soluble organic electrolytes to store electricity, have emerged as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology. Organic electrolytes possess fast electron-transfer rates that are two or three orders of magnitude faster than those of their inorganic or organometallic counterparts; therefore, their performance at the electrode is limited by mass transport. Direct adoption of conventional cell stacks with flow fields designed for inorganic electrolytes may compromise AORFB performance owing to severe cell polarization. Here, we report the design of a flow field for flow-through type AORFBs based on three-dimensional multiphysics simulation, to realize the uniform distribution of electrolyte flow and flow enhancements within a porous electrode. The electrolyte flow is visualized by operando imaging. Our results show that multistep distributive flow channels at the inlet and point-contact blocks at the outlet are crucial geometrical merits of the flow field, significantly reducing local concentration overpotentials. The prototype pH-neutral TEMPTMA/MV cell at 1.5 M assembled with the optimized flow field exhibits a peak power density of 267.3 mW cm −2 . The flow field design enables charging of the cell at current densities up to 300 mA cm −2 , which is unachievable with the conventional serpentine flow field, where immediate voltage cutoff of the cell occurs. Our results highlight the importance of AORFB cell stack engineering and provide a method to visualize electrolyte flow, which will be appealing to the field of aqueous flow batteries.",

          "abstract": "Dirac fluids—interacting systems obeying particle–hole symmetry and Lorentz invariance—are among the simplest hydrodynamic systems; they have also been studied as effective descriptions of transport in strongly interacting Dirac semimetals. Direct experimental signatures of the Dirac fluid are elusive, as its charge transport is diffusive as in conventional metals. In this paper, we point out a striking consequence of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics: The full counting statistics (FCS) of charge transport is highly non-Gaussian. We predict the exact asymptotic form of the FCS, which generalizes a result previously derived for certain interacting integrable systems. A consequence is that, starting from quasi-one-dimensional nonequilibrium initial conditions, charge noise in the hydrodynamic regime is parametrically enhanced relative to that in conventional diffusive metals.",

          "abstract": "Circadian clocks respond to temperature changes over the calendar year, allowing organisms to adjust their daily biological rhythms to optimize health and fitness. In Drosophila , seasonal adaptations are regulated by temperature-sensitive alternative splicing (AS) of period ( per ) and timeless ( tim ) genes that encode key transcriptional repressors of clock gene expression. Although Clock ( Clk ) gene encodes the critical activator of circadian gene expression, AS of its transcripts and its potential role in temperature regulation of clock function have not been explored. Here, we observed that Clk transcripts undergo temperature-sensitive AS. Specifically, cold temperature leads to the production of an alternative Clk transcript, hereinafter termed Clk -cold, which encodes a CLK isoform with an in-frame deletion of four amino acids proximal to the DNA binding domain. Notably, serine 13 (S13), which we found to be a CK1α-dependent phosphorylation site, is deleted in CLK-cold protein. We demonstrated that upon phosphorylation at CLK(S13), CLK-DNA interaction is reduced, thus decreasing transcriptional activity of CLK. This is in agreement with our findings that CLK occupancy at clock genes and transcriptional output are elevated at cold temperature likely due to higher amounts of CLK-cold isoforms that lack S13 residue. Finally, we showed that PER promotes CK1α-dependent phosphorylation of CLK(S13), supporting kinase-scaffolding role of repressor proteins as a conserved feature in the regulation of eukaryotic circadian clocks. This study provides insights into the complex collaboration between AS and phospho-regulation in shaping temperature responses of the circadian clock.",

Using the recently developed ab initio quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB 2 under different cavity setups and find that in the strong light–matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature T c can be enhanced at most by ≈ 10% in an in-plane (or out-of-plane) polarized and realistic cavity via photon vacuum fluctuations. The results highlight that strong light–matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a nonperturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity materials engineering.",

In this work, we investigate a hybrid bonding hydrogel composed of peptide amphiphile supramolecular nanofibers covalently attached to a photoresponsive network, in which high-aspect-ratio ferromagnetic nanowires are aligned along the length of the sample, designed to swim under oscillating magnetic fields. This hybrid hydrogel swimmer can autonomously swim toward a light source by utilizing photoinduced interactions between supramolecular and covalent networks reminiscent of phototactic swimming in living systems. Using a combination of experimental techniques and a continuum model incorporating photochemistry, magnetoelasticity, and hydrodynamics, we explain the swimming mechanism and predict phototactic behavior. Our work highlights the potential role of hybrid bonding polymers, which leverage the interplay between supramolecular assemblies and covalent networks.

          "abstract": "Reduced consumption of animal-sourced food (ASF) has been recommended for environmental and human health objectives; however, ASF can be important for food security and diet affordability. We explored country-level relationships among various metrics of food supply, socioeconomic context, food security, diet affordability, and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) to characterize how optimal inclusion ranges for ASF vary with socioeconomic factors and food system goals. Data from 2015 to 2022 for 153 countries were sourced to generate Bayesian Networks representing relationships among the studied food system metrics. Networks were used in simulations to characterize optimal ASF inclusion to achieve environmental, food security, or diet affordability goals based on individual country data. Results are most appropriately interpreted in aggregate rather than as representations of specific countries due in large part to data limitations. Across countries simulated, median total ASF inclusion in the food supply to support food security, GHGe, or affordability objectives was 18.2% ± 12.1%, 11.9% ± 6.8%, and 17.6% ± 8.5%, respectively. Joint optimization for these goals resulted in median ASF inclusion of 15.1% ± 7.2%, with notable regional differences. Although ASF increases were supported in most developing regions, decreases were supported in developed countries. The reported SD in optimal ASF inclusion were considerable, and represented between-country variation. Empirical relationships of food categories to goals consistently favored dairy and egg products over meats. These results support previous literature highlighting the environmental intensity of ASF, but also indicate that moderate ASF supplies contribute to multiple food system goals simultaneously.",

          "abstract": "The toxic effects of C9orf72-derived arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (R-DPRs) on cellular stress granules in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia remain unclear at the molecular level. Stress granules are formed through the switch of Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) by RNA from a closed inactive state to an open activated state, driving the formation of the organelle by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). We show that R-DPRs bind G3BP1 a thousand times stronger than RNA and initiate LLPS much more effectively. Their pathogenic effect is underscored by the slow transition of R-DPR–G3BP1 droplets to aggregated, ThS-positive states that can recruit ALS-linked proteins hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, and TDP-43. Deletion constructs and molecular simulations show that R-DPR binding and LLPS are mediated via the negatively charged intrinsically disordered region 1 (IDR1) of the protein, allosterically regulated by its positively charged IDR3. Bioinformatic analyses point to the strong mechanistic parallels of these effects with the interaction of R-DPRs with nucleolar nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and underscore that R-DPRs interact with many other similar nucleolar and stress-granule proteins, extending the underlying mechanism of R-DPR toxicity in cells. Our results also highlight characteristic differences between the two R-DPRs, poly-GR and poly-PR, and suggest that the primary pathological target of poly-GR is not NPM1 in nucleoli, but G3BP1 in stress granules in affected cells.",

Mechanisms enabling magnetite formation require the complex action of numerous proteins for iron acquisition, sequestration in dedicated magnetosome organelles, and precipitation into magnetite. The MamP protein contains c-type cytochromes called magnetochrome domains that are found exclusively in magnetotactic bacteria. Ablation of magnetochromes in MamP prevents bacteria from aligning with external magnetic fields, showing their importance to maintain this biological function. MamP has been proposed, mostly from in vitro experimentations, to regulate iron redox state and maintain an Fe(II)/Fe(III) balance compatible with magnetite formation via the iron oxidase activity of magnetochromes. To test the proposed function for MamP in vivo in the magnetotactic strain Magnetospirillum magneticum (AMB)-1, we characterized the iron species in chemical MamP-mediated magnetite syntheses as well as in bacteria unable to produce MamP using a combination of physicochemical methodologies. We show that MamP has no apparent control on the speciation and oxidation state of intracellular iron or on the Fe(II)/Fe(III) balance in magnetite. We propose that MamP promotes magnetite growth by incorporating Fe(III) into preexisting magnetite seeds and that magnetite structure and stoichiometry is maintained by further equilibration with dissolved Fe(II) in magnetosome organelles.",

          "abstract": "Reducing meat and dairy intake has been identified as a necessary strategy for mitigating the high environmental impacts food systems are currently having on climate change, biodiversity loss associated with land-use changes, and freshwater use. Having a choice of dedicated meat and milk replacements available to consumers can help in the transition toward more plant-based diets, but concerns about nutritional and health impacts and high costs can impede uptake. Here, we conduct a multicriteria assessment of 24 meat and milk alternatives that integrates nutritional, health, environmental, and cost analyses with a focus on high-income countries. Unprocessed plant-based foods such as peas, soybeans, and beans performed best in our assessment across all domains. In comparison, processed plant-based products such as veggie burgers, traditional meat replacements such as tempeh, and plant milks were associated with less climate benefits and greater costs than unprocessed foods but still offered substantial environmental, health, and nutritional benefits compared to animal products. Our findings suggest that a range of food products exist that when replacing meat and dairy in current diets would have multiple benefits, including reductions in nutritional imbalances, dietary risks and mortality, environmental resource use and pollution, and when choosing unprocessed foods over processed ones also diet costs.

          "authors": "Tingtao Zhou, John F. Brady",
          "abstract": "Mechanical properties of disordered materials are governed by their underlying free energy landscape. In contrast to external fields, embedding a small fraction of active particles within a disordered material generates nonequilibrium internal fields, which can help to circumvent kinetic barriers and modulate the free energy landscape. In this work, we investigate through computer simulations how the activity of active particles alters the mechanical response of deeply annealed polydisperse colloidal gels. We show that the “swim force” generated by the embedded active particles is responsible for determining the mode of mechanical failure, i.e., brittle vs. ductile. We find, and theoretically justify, that at a critical swim force the mechanical properties of the gel decrease abruptly, signaling a change in the mode of mechanical failure. The weakening of the elastic modulus above the critical swim force results from the change in gel porosity and distribution of attractive forces among gel particles, while below the critical swim force, the ductility enhancement is caused by an increase of gel structural disorder. Above the critical swim force, the gel develops a pronounced heterogeneous structure characterized by multiple pore spaces, and the mechanical response is controlled by dynamical heterogeneities. We contrast these results with those of a simulated monodisperse gel that exhibits a nonmonotonic trend of ductility modulation with increasing swim force, revealing a complex interplay between the gel energy landscape and embedded activity.",

Homologous with ATP synthases, these multisubunit enzymes consist of a soluble catalytic V 1 subcomplex and a membrane-embedded proton-translocating V O subcomplex. The V 1 and V O subcomplexes can undergo reversible dissociation to regulate proton pumping, with reassociation of V 1 and V O requiring the protein complex known as RAVE (regulator of the ATPase of vacuoles and endosomes). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , RAVE consists of subunits Rav1p, Rav2p, and Skp1p. We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a structure of yeast RAVE bound to V 1 . In the structure, RAVE is an L-shaped complex with Rav2p pointing toward the membrane and Skp1p distant from both the membrane and V 1 . Only Rav1p interacts with V 1 , binding to a region of subunit A not found in the corresponding ATP synthase subunit. When bound to RAVE, V 1 is in a rotational state suitable for binding the free V O complex, but in the structure, it is partially disrupted, missing five of its 16 subunits. Other than these missing subunits and the conformation of the inhibitory subunit H, the V 1 complex with RAVE appears poised for reassembly with V O .",

Although inactivating mutations in CASP8 are frequently found in human OSCC their role in the disease is unknown. To investigate this, we deleted Casp8 in the oral epithelium of adult mice. Loss of Caspase-8 resulted in defects in the tongue epithelial barrier and triggered a neutrophil-rich immune infiltrate distinct from that observed on epidermal Casp8 deletion. Oral Casp8 deletion led to activation of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy partially rescued epithelial integrity in Casp8 −/− mice, while induction of autophagy in wild type mice resulted in oral barrier defects and excessive neutrophil infiltration. On treatment with the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide Casp8 −/− mice showed increased susceptibility to developing oral tumors. Depletion of neutrophils reduced tumor incidence, which correlated with a reduction in reactive oxygen species and decreased epithelial DNA damage. Our findings establish a functional link between epithelial integrity, autophagy, and the tumor immune microenvironment, placing Caspase-8 at the center of these processes.",

How this might impact immune cells is not well understood. Using multiple mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, glutamine antagonists, as well as genetic and pharmacological inhibition of glutamine utilization, we found that the number and frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) is dependent on microenvironmental glutamine levels. cDCs comprise two distinct subsets—cDC1s and cDC2s, with the former subset playing a critical role in antigen cross-presentation and tumor immunity. While both subsets show dependence on glutamine, cDC1s are particularly sensitive. Notably, glutamine antagonism did not reduce the frequency of DC precursors but decreased the proliferation and survival of cDC1s. Further studies suggest a role of the nutrient sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in this process. Taken together, these findings uncover glutamine dependence of cDC1s that is coopted by tumors to escape immune responses.",

This paper introduces an innovative strategy using the commercially available and cost-effective hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodobenzene (HTIB) as a radical initiator, enabling clean and bidirectional disulfide metathesis under biocompatible conditions. Our method facilitates efficient forward reactions by utilizing an excess of one disulfide to shift the equilibrium toward unsymmetrical disulfides, while also ensuring clean reverse reactions by the removal of low boiling point dimethyl disulfide. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular approach using a cyclic five- or eight-membered disulfide avoids the need for an excess of one disulfide, effectively yielding unsymmetrical disulfide molecules. The radical mechanism of this approach, validated through various control experiments and EPR analysis, enables selective and biocompatible modifications of carbohydrates, drugs, native amino acids, and proteins.

          "abstract": "Increasing food production and ensuring drinking water safety have always been a focus of attention, especially for people in underdeveloped regions of the world. Traditional excessive fertilizer applications have increased crop yield but also caused groundwater nitrate pollution. Agricultural irrigating water is an important reservoir for nitrogen (N) (e.g., nitrate) accumulation after fertilization. Ammonium (NH 4 + -N) is a more readily absorbed N form by rice than nitrate (NO 3 − -N). In this study, we proposed a strategy using iron single-atom catalysts (Fe-SAC) to selectively reduce NO 3 − -N to NH 4 + -N from the real paddy field irrigating water to provide sustainable NH 4 + -N supplies for rice uptakes, thereby highlighting decreasing N fertilizer applications and mitigating NO 3 − -N pollution. Then, we constructed a solar-energy-driven electrochemical reactor for NO 3 − -N reduction, with the Fe single atom as the core catalyst, and achieved an average NH 4 + -N selectivity of 80.2 ± 2.6% with no additional energy input. Sustainable NH 4 + -N supplies resulted in a 30.4 % increase in the 100-grain weight of the cultivated rice and a 50% decrease of fertilizer application than those of the fertilization group in the pot experiment, which were one of the best values ever reported. Furthermore, the 15 N isotope tracing results indicated a N use efficiency (NUE) from 15 NO 3 − -N of 71.2 ± 3.2%. Sustainable NH 4 + -N supplies played a key role in promoting rice root development which contributed to the high NUE. Our study shares unique insights in increasing grain yield, reducing fertilizer applications, and preventing nitrate leaching into groundwater.",

Using gene fusions, atomic force microscopy, simulations, and microfluidics, we show that the β-barrel domain of OmpA is critical for maintaining the permeability barrier, but both the β-barrel and CW–binding domains are necessary to enhance the cell envelope’s strength. OmpA integrates the compressive properties of the OM protein lattice with the tensile strength of the CW, forming a mechanically robust composite that increases overall integrity.

This is due to its genetic similarity to humans, its evolutionary position between rodents and humans, and its primate-like features encapsulated within a rodent-sized brain. Despite its potential, the absence of a comprehensive reference brain atlas impedes the progress of research endeavors in this species, particularly at the microscopic level. Existing references have largely been confined to the macroscopic scale, lacking detailed anatomical information. Here, we present eLemur, a unique resource, comprising a repository of high-resolution brain-wide images immunostained with multiple cell type and structural markers, elucidating the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the mouse lemur brain. Additionally, it encompasses a segmented two-dimensional reference and 3D anatomical brain atlas delineated into cortical, subcortical, and other vital regions. Furthermore, eLemur includes a comprehensive 3D cell atlas, providing densities and spatial distributions of non-neuronal and neuronal cells across the mouse lemur brain. Accessible via a web-based viewer ( https://eeum-brain.com/#/lemurdatasets ), the eLemur resource streamlines data sharing and integration, fostering the exploration of different hypotheses and experimental designs using the mouse lemur as a model organism. Moreover, in conjunction with the growing 3D datasets for rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans, our eLemur 3D digital framework enhances the potential for comparative analysis and translation research, facilitating the integration of extensive rodent study data into human studies.",

          "abstract": "The brain has evolved mechanisms to dynamically modify blood flow, enabling the timely delivery of energy substrates in response to local metabolic demands. Several such neurovascular coupling (NVC) mechanisms have been identified, but the vascular signal transduction and transmission mechanisms that enable dilation of penetrating arterioles (PAs) remote from sites of increased neuronal activity are unclear. Given the exponential relationship between vessel diameter and blood flow, tight control of arteriole membrane potential and diameter is a crucial aspect of NVC. Recent evidence suggests that capillaries play a major role in sensing neural activity and transmitting signals to modify the diameter of upstream vessels. Thin-strand pericyte cell bodies and processes cover around 90% of the capillary bed, and here we show that these cells play a central role in sensing neural activity and generating and relaying electrical signals to arterioles. We identify a K ATP channel–dependent neurovascular signaling pathway that is explained by the recruitment of thin-strand pericytes and we deploy vascular optogenetics to show that currents generated in individual thin-strand pericytes are sent over long distances to upstream arterioles to cause dilations in vivo. Genetic disruption of vascular K ATP channels reduces the arteriole diameter response to neural activity and laser ablation of thin-strand pericytes eliminates the K ATP -dependent component of NVC. Together, our findings indicate that thin-strand pericytes sense neural activity and transform this into K ATP channel–dependent electrometabolic signals that inform upstream arterioles of local energy needs, promoting spatiotemporally precise energy distribution.",

Thick filament mechanosensing is thought to control the number of motors switching ON in relation to the systolic performance, but its molecular basis is still controversial. Here, we use high spatial resolution X-ray diffraction data from electrically paced rat trabeculae and papillary muscles to provide a molecular explanation of the modulation of heart performance that calls for a revision of the mechanosensing hypothesis. We find that upon stimulation, titin-mediated structural changes in the thick filament switch motors ON throughout the filament within ~½ the maximum systolic force. These structural changes also drive Myosin Binding Protein-C (MyBP-C) to promote first motor attachments to actin from the central 1/3 of the half-thick filament. Progression of attachments toward the periphery of half-thick filament with increase in systolic force is carried on by near-neighbor cooperative thin filament activation by attached motors. The identification of the roles of MyBP-C, titin, thin and thick filaments in heart regulation enables their targeting for potential therapeutic interventions.",

While the charge components of these stripes have now been observed in nearly all cuprate families, their detailed evolution with doping varies across different materials and at high and low temperatures. We address this problem using nonperturbative determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the three-band Hubbard model. Using an efficient implementation, we can resolve the model’s fluctuating spin and charge modulations and map their evolution as a function of the charge transfer energy and doping. We find that the incommensurability of the charge modulations is decoupled from the spin modulations and decreases with hole doping, consistent with experimental measurements at high temperatures. These findings support the proposal that the high-temperature charge correlations are distinct from the intertwined stripe order observed at low-temperature and in the single-band Hubbard model.",

          "abstract": "The consequences of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells are complex and have been shown to both promote and retard tumorigenesis in different models. In mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), loss of the antioxidant defense gene Tigar results in both a reduction in the development of early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and an increase in invasive and metastatic capacity, accompanied by decreased survival of mice lacking pancreatic TIGAR. We previously demonstrated that increased ROS following loss of TIGAR promotes various cancer cell–intrinsic changes that contribute to metastatic capacity, including epithelial to mesenchymal transition, enhanced migration and invasion, and an increase in ERK signaling. In this study, we show that pancreatic overexpression of TIGAR decreases metastatic capacity and migratory phenotypes in an aggressive model of PDAC, consistent with the concept that dynamic modulation of TIGAR in PDAC contributes to the development and progression of these tumors. Using TIGAR deficient and overexpressing mouse models, we find that the impact of modulation of TIGAR and ROS in PDAC cells also has a profound effect on the normal stromal cells surrounding the tumor. Loss of TIGAR promotes the production of cytokines by cancer cells that induce changes in the surrounding fibroblasts to adopt a tumor-supportive phenotype. Furthermore, these cytokines also attract macrophages that support PDAC dissemination and metastasis. Taken together our work shows that TIGAR-modulated ROS in PDAC can control cell intrinsic and extrinsic changes to impact tumor aggression.",

Here, we investigate the rheotactic behavior of Escherichia coli near walls in non-Newtonian fluids. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial upstream swimming is enhanced by an order of magnitude in shear-thinning (ST) polymeric fluids relative to Newtonian fluids. This result is explained by direct numerical simulations, revealing a torque that promotes the alignment of bacteria against the flow. From this analysis, we develop a theoretical model that accurately describes experimental rheotactic data in both Newtonian and ST fluids.",

Here, we construct a dumbbell-shaped fullerene-indacenodithiophene triad, IT2 , modified with two C 60 units in the donor indacenodithiophene. Exciting the C 60 units, ultrafast m-ET occurs with a time constant of 0.5 ps, accumulating two holes with a lifetime of 10 μs. Benefitting from a larger driving force, lower reorganization energy, and smaller structural changes, the rate of m-ET is 23 times faster than that of s-ET, and the lifetime of the m-ET product is 1.4 × 10 5 times longer than that of the s-ET products. These attributes endow IT2 with superior photocatalytic performance in multielectron oxidation reactions. This is an instance of achieving faster m-ET and a longer m-ET product lifetime than s-ET in a single molecule.

          "abstract": "Climate warming can alleviate temperature and nutrient constraints on tree growth in boreal regions, potentially enhancing boreal productivity. However, in permafrost environments, warming also disrupts the physical foundation on which trees grow, leading to leaning trees or “drunken” forests. Tree leaning might reduce radial growth, undermining potential benefits of warming. Here, we found widespread radial growth reductions in southern latitude boreal forests since the 1980s. At mid latitudes, radial growth increased from ~1980 to ~2000 but showed recent signs of decline afterward. Increased growth was evident since the 1980 s at higher latitudes, where radial growth appears to be temperature limited. However, recent changes in permafrost stability, and the associated increased frequency of tree leaning events, emerged as a significant stressor, leading to reduced radial growth in boreal trees at the highest latitudes, where permafrost is extensive. We showed that trees growing in unstable permafrost sites allocated more nonstructural carbohydrate reserves to offset leaning which compromised radial growth and potential carbon uptake benefits of warming. This higher allocation of resources in drunken trees is needed to build the high-density reaction wood, rich in lignin, that is required to maintain a vertical position. With continued climate warming, we anticipate widespread reductions in radial growth in boreal forests, leading to lower carbon sequestration. These findings enhance our understanding of how climate warming and indirect effects, such as ground instability caused by warming permafrost, will affect boreal forest productivity in the future.",

This paper defines the relative nutritional needs across each stage of the life cycle to support human health and identifies who is nutritionally vulnerable. Findings in this paper suggest that there are biological nutritional vulnerabilities stemming from high micronutrient needs per calorie in certain phases of the life cycle, particularly for infants and young children, women of reproductive age, pregnant and lactating women, and older adults, particularly older women. The paper demonstrates the role of micronutrient-dense animal-source foods and plant-source foods important in meeting essential nutrient needs to support healthy growth, development, and aging across vulnerable stages of the life cycle.",

Despite the expanding utility of ultrasound neuromodulation in the neuroscience research field and clinical applications, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ultrasound impacts neural activity in the brain are still largely unknown. Here, we report that transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6), a mechanosensitive nonselective cation channel, is essential for ultrasound neuromodulation of mammalian neurons in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that ultrasound irradiation elicited rapid and robust Ca 2+ transients mediated via extracellular Ca 2+ influx in cultured mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons. Ultrasound-induced neuronal responses were massively diminished by blocking either the generation of action potential or synaptic transmission. Importantly, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deficiency of TRPC6 almost completely abolished neuronal responses to ultrasound. Furthermore, we found that intracerebroventricular administration of a TRPC6 blocker significantly attenuated the number of neuronal firings in the cerebral cortex evoked by transcranial ultrasound irradiation in mice. Our findings indicate that TRPC6 is an indispensable molecule of ultrasound neuromodulation in intact mammalian brains, providing fundamental understanding of biophysical molecular mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation as well as insight into its future feasibility in neuroscience and translational research in humans.",

          "abstract": "Phase transition between ordered phases has garnered attention from the viewpoint of materials science as well as statistical physics. One interesting example is martensitic transformation and the resulting formation of twin structures, in which atoms or molecules that form one crystalline phase move in a concerted and diffusionless manner toward another crystalline phase. Recently martensitic transformation has been observed experimentally also in various soft materials. However, the complex internal structures involving many molecules have eluded direct investigation of the dynamical processes of martensitic transformation. Here, we carry out a direct simulation of mesoscale structural transition of a liquid crystalline blue phase (BP) of cubic symmetry, known as BP II. The dynamics is simulated by a Langevin-type equation for the orientational order parameter with thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that machine-learning-aided analysis of local structures successfully unravels the transformation process from a perfect lattice of BP II to a twinned lattice of another BP (BP I). The nucleation of BP I is initiated by the breakup of junctions of line defects (disclinations), followed by the deformation of disclination network. We further show that twinned BP I is reversibly transformed to a perfect lattice of BP II by temperature variation. Order-parameter-based simulations with machine-learning-aided local structure identification provide valuable insights into not only the martensitic transformation of soft materials but also a wider class of complex structural transitions between ordered phases.",

In graphene, emergent properties have been observed in ABC stacking domains obtained by exfoliation followed by expert mechanical twisting and alignment with the desired orientation, a process very challenging and nonscalable. Here, conductive atomic force microscopy shows in untwisted epitaxial graphene grown on SiC the surprising presence of striped domains with dissimilar conductance, a contrast that demonstrates the presence of ABA and ABC domains since it matches exactly the conductivity difference observed in ABA/ABC domains in twisted exfoliated graphene and calculated by density functional theory. The size and geometry of the stacking domains depend on the interplay between strain, solitons crossing, and shape of the three-layer regions. Interestingly, we demonstrate the growth of three-layer regions in which the ABA/ABC stacking domains self-organize in stable stripes of a few tens of nanometers. The growth-controlled production of isolated and stripe-shaped ABA/ABC domains open the path to fabricate quantum devices on these domains. These findings on self-assembly formation of ABA/ABC epitaxial graphene stripes on SiC without the need of time-consuming and nonscalable graphene exfoliation, alignment, and twisting provide different potential applications of graphene in electronic devices.",

          "authors": "Ge Zhang, Meiyi Xiang, Liankun Gu, Jing Zhou, Baozhen Zhang, Wei Tian, Dajun Deng",
          "abstract": "There are three distinct forms of autophagy, namely, macroautophagy, microautophagy, and HSPA8 chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). While macroautophagy is widely recognized as a regulator of chromosomal instability (CIN) through various pathways, the contributions of CMA and microautophagy to CIN remain uncertain. TTC28 , a conserved gene in vertebrates, is frequently mutated and down-regulated in numerous human cancers. This study presents findings demonstrating the interaction between human tetratricopeptide repeat domain 28 (TTC28) and heat shock protein member 8 (HSPA8) and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A proteins. The tetratricopeptide repeat domains of TTC28 bind to the C-terminal motif (PTIEEVD) in HSPA8, resulting in the subsequent degradation of TTC28 via CMA/microautophagy. Notably, the baseline frequency of micronuclei (FMN) in human cancer cells with TTC28 knockout cells was three times greater than that in cells with wild-type TTC28 (7.7% vs. 2.3%, P = 4.86E−09). Furthermore, the overexpression of Ttc28 mitigated the impact of TTC28 knockout on FMN (11.9% vs. 4.8%, P = 2.83E−11). Our findings also demonstrate that CMA has a protective effect on genome stability and that TTC28 plays an essential role in the effect of CMA. These results were further supported by the quantification of γH2AX and comet analyses and the analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data via bioinformatics. Mechanistically, TTC28 regulates mitosis and cytokinesis, which are involved in the maintenance of genome integrity by CMA. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TTC28 is not only an HSPA8-mediated CMA/microautophagy substrate but also essential for maintaining chromosomal stability via CMA. Comprehensive TTC28 downregulation may lead to CIN in cancer cells.",

          "abstract": "Fischer-Tropsch synthesis represents a key endeavor aimed at converting nonpetroleum carbon resources into clean fuels and valuable chemicals. However, the current state-of-the-art industrial FTS employing Fe-based catalysts is still challenged by the low carbon efficiency (&lt;50%), mainly attributed to the prominent formation of CO 2 and CH 4 resulting from the nonregulated side water gas shift reaction. Herein, we describe a shielding strategy involving the encapsulation of the active Hägg carbide (χ-Fe 5 C 2 ) by a graphene layer, exhibiting excellent resilience under reaction conditions and exposure to air, thereby eliminating the need for reduction or activation before the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction. The graphene layer helps to stabilize the Hägg carbide active phase, and more importantly, greatly suppresses the side water gas shift reaction. Theoretical calculations suggest that graphene shielding inhibits the water gas shift reaction by reducing the absorption strength of OH x species. Remarkably, the optimum χ-Fe 5 C 2 @Graphene catalyst demonstrates a minimized CO 2 and CH 4 formation of only 4.6% and 5.9%, resulting in a high carbon efficiency (ca. 90%) for value-added products. These results are expected to inspire unique designs of Fe-based nanocomposite for highly efficient FTS with regulated carbon transfer pathways.",

          "abstract": "In unconventional superconductors, coupled charge and lattice degrees of freedom can manifest in ordered phases of matter that are intertwined. In the cuprate family, fluctuating short-range charge correlations can coalesce into a longer-range charge density wave (CDW) order which is thought to intertwine with superconductivity, yet the nature of the interaction is still poorly understood. Here, by measuring subtle lattice fluctuations in underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ y on quasi-static timescales (thousands of seconds) through X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, we report sensitivity to both superconductivity and CDW. The atomic lattice shows remarkably faster relaxational dynamics upon approaching the superconducting transition at T c ≈ 65 K. By tracking the momentum dependence, we show that the intermediate scattering function almost monotonically scales with the relaxation distance of atoms away from their average positions above T c and in the presence of the CDW state, while this peculiar trend is reversed for other temperatures. These observations are consistent with an incipient CDW stabilized by local strain. This work provides insights into the crucial role of relaxational atomic fluctuations for understanding the electronic physics cuprates, which are inherently disordered due to carrier doping.",

          "abstract": "Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumor and are often associated with severe neurological deficits and mortality. Unlike many cancers, gliomas rarely metastasize outside the brain, indicating a possible dependency on unique features of brain microenvironment. Synapses between neurons and glioma cells exist, suggesting that glioma cells rely on neuronal inputs and synaptic signaling for proliferation. Yet, the locations and properties of neurons that innervate gliomas have remained elusive. In this study, we utilized transsynaptic tracing with an EnvA-pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus to specifically infect TVA and glycoprotein-expressing human glioblastoma cells in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, allowing us to identify the neurons that form synapses onto the gliomas. Comprehensive whole-brain mapping revealed that these glioma-innervating neurons (GINs) from brain regions, including diverse neuromodulatory centers and specific cortical layers, known to project to the glioma locations. Molecular profiling revealed that long-range cortical GINs are predominantly glutamatergic, and subsets express both glutamatergic and GABAergic markers, whereas local striatal GINs are largely GABAergic. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that while GINs share passive intrinsic properties with cortex-innervating neurons, their action potential waveforms are altered. Our study introduces a method for identifying and mapping GINs and reveals their consistent integration into existing location-dependent neuronal networks involving diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. The observed intrinsic electrophysiological differences in GINs lay the groundwork for future investigations into how these alterations relate to the postsynaptic characteristics of glioma cells.",

          "abstract": "Despite the tremendous accomplishments of AlpaFold2/3 in predicting biomolecular structure, the protein folding problem remains unsolved in the sense that accurate atomistic models of how protein molecules fold into their native conformations from an unfolded ensemble are still elusive. Here, using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR experiments and a comprehensive four-state kinetic model of the folding trajectory of a 71 residue four-helix bundle FF domain from human HYPA/FBP11 we present an atomic resolution structure of a transiently formed intermediate, I2, that along with the structure of a second intermediate, I1, provides a description of the FF domain folding trajectory. By recording CEST profiles as a function of urea concentration the extent of compaction along the folding pathway is evaluated. Our data establish that unlike the partially disordered I1 state, the I2 intermediate that is also formed before the rate-limiting folding barrier is well ordered and compact like the native conformer, while retaining nonnative interactions similar to those found in I1. The slow-interconversion from I2 to F, involving changes in secondary structure and the breaking of nonnative interactions, proceeds via a compact transition-state. Interestingly, the native state of the FF1 domain from human p190-A Rho GAP resembles the I2 conformation, suggesting that well-ordered folding intermediates can be repurposed by nature in structurally related proteins to assume functional roles. It is anticipated that the strategy for elucidation of sparsely populated and transiently formed structures of intermediates along kinetic pathways described here will be of use in other studies of protein dynamics.",

Specific subsets of CD8+ T cells, as well as certain innate T cells, displayed the most pronounced dysregulation in ME. We observed upregulation of key transcription factors associated with T cell exhaustion in CD8+ T cell effector memory subsets, as well as an altered chromatin landscape and metabolic reprogramming consistent with an exhausted immune cell state. To validate these observations, we analyzed expression of exhaustion markers using flow cytometry, detecting a higher frequency of exhaustion-associated factors. Together, these data identify T cell exhaustion as a component of ME, a finding which may provide a basis for future therapies, such as checkpoint blockade, metabolic interventions, or drugs that target chronic viral infections.",

Numerous studies using environmental life cycle assessments confirmed plant-based meat alternatives are more environmentally favorable than animal-derived meat. However, most missed other factors from protein extraction and concentration that contribute to environmental impact (both positive and negative). Furthermore, few studies examined the entire environmental impact because they overlooked social and nutritional life cycle assessments. Many publications assumed most environmental impact occurred in crop cultivation before high protein products are manufactured. However, industrial plant-based protein extraction, concentration, and purification require large amounts of natural resources, energy, chemicals, and highly specialized equipment seldom accurately assessed from an environmental, social, and nutritional perspective. This paper presents opinions and perspectives on additional information to consider to fully realize environmental benefits of highly proteinaceous plant-based food ingredients.

This study investigates the effectiveness of pelleted bromoform-containing seaweed ( Asparagopsis taxiformis ) (Brominata) as an enteric methane (CH 4 ) inhibitor in grazing beef cattle. The primary objective was to assess the impact of this antimethanogenic additive on enteric CH 4 emissions under real-world farm conditions. Twenty-four beef steers, crossbreeds of Wagyu and Angus, with an average liveweight of 399 ± 21.7 kg, were allocated to two treatment groups: Control and Brominata. These animals underwent regular weigh-ins every 14 d, and measurements of CH 4 , carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and hydrogen (H 2 ) emissions were conducted using the GreenFeed system. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS 9.4, wherein the model incorporated fixed effects for treatment, time, their interaction, and a covariate, while accounting for animal variations as a random effect within each phase. Three phases of bromoform intake were identified: a 3-wk ramp-up phase, a 3-wk optimal phase, and a 2-wk decreasing phase. No differences were observed between the weekly initial and final liveweight, average daily gain, and predicted dry matter intake. During optimal and decreasing phases, average enteric CH 4 emissions were significantly reduced in steers that received Brominata supplementation compared to those without supplementation (115 vs. 185 g/d, respectively). Additionally, both groups had similar CO 2 emissions (6.8 vs. 7.2 kg/d), while H 2 emissions were lower in the control group (3.4 vs. 1.8 g/d). The findings suggest that pelleted bromoform-containing feed additive has the potential to reduce enteric CH 4 emissions from grazing beef cattle.",

We used femtosecond spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis to map out the critical elementary steps by following the dynamics of initial reactants, various intermediates, and final products. We observed initial direct ultrafast electron tunneling from the hydroquinone flavin cofactor to 6-4PP in 300 ps through an intervening adenine as a mediator, minimizing the electron bifurcation of a two-step hopping pathway bridged also by the adenine as an intermediate. The subsequent proton transfer (PT) from the neighboring histidine to anionic 6-4PP in 2 ns is critical and competes with the futile back electron transfer in 151 ps. Mutations of either of two histidines in the active site nearly abolish repair, indicating their essential role on repair reactivity and structural integrity. These results elucidate the electron-coupled PT mechanism and the repair photocycle of this bifunctional cryptochrome at the molecular level, further supporting that the hydroquinone flavin is the active state in vivo for dual functions or one of the two functions is excessive.",

          "abstract": "HIV, like other membrane-enveloped viruses, has protein spikes that include a fusion peptide (Fp) segment that binds the host cell membrane and plays a critical role in fusion (joining) viral and cell membranes. The HIV Fp is the ~23 N-terminal residues of the gp41 spike protein. Fp adopts intermolecular antiparallel β sheet structure when lipid fraction cholesterol ≈0.3, which is comparable to host cells. Rotational-echo double-resonance NMR was applied to probe the registries (alignments) of adjacent Fp molecules in membrane-bound sheets. The data were fitted to determine quantitative populations, f(t)’s, of individual antiparallel registries indexed by t, the number of residues in the registry. Both wild-type (WT) and fusion-defective V2E Fp sheets have broad but very different registry distributions, each with at least eight populated registries with f(t) &gt; 0.02, and t WT = 16.1 and ⟨t⟩ V2E = 18.5. The broad WT distribution likely improves mutational robustness for HIV, as Fp is a neutralization epitope of the immune system, and Fp mutations are required for immune evasion during chronic HIV infection. V2E fusion is reduced because longer Fp sheets increase separation between initially apposed membranes. The f(t) WT were well-fitted to free energies that were sums of contributions from sheet length, aligned leucines, and sidechain membrane insertion. The f(t) V2E ’s were similarly well-fitted except there wasn’t the insertion contribution. Relative to V2E, WT fusion is enhanced by deeper membrane insertion of Fp with accompanying greater dislocation of neighboring lipids. This study provides a rare quantitative determination of broad molecular structural distributions by experiment.",

          "abstract": "Motile organisms can expand into new territories and increase their fitness, while nonmotile viruses usually depend on host migration to spread across long distances. In general, faster host motility facilitates virus transmission. However, recent ecological studies have also shown that animal host migration can reduce viral prevalence by removing infected individuals from the migratory group. Here, we use a bacteria-bacteriophage copropagation system to investigate how host motility affects viral spread during range expansion. We find that phage spread during chemotaxis-driven navigated range expansion decreases as bacterial migration speed increases. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the navigated migration leads to a spatial sorting of infected and uninfected hosts in the copropagating front of bacteria-bacteriophage, with implications for the number of cells left behind. The preferential loss of infected cells in the copropagating front inhibits viral spread. Further increase in host migration speed leads to a phase transition that eliminates the phage completely. These results illustrate that navigated range expansion of the host can promote the migratory culling of infectious diseases in the migration group.",

We report an alternate route for humans to acquire visual knowledge, through the direct sculpting of activity patterns in the human brain that mirror those expected to arise through learning. We used neurofeedback from closed-loop real-time functional MRI to create new categories of visual objects in the brain, without the participants’ explicit awareness. After neural sculpting, participants exhibited behavioral and neural biases for the learned, but not for the control categories. The ability to sculpt new perceptual distinctions into the human brain offers a noninvasive research paradigm for causal testing of the link between neural representations and behavior.

We found that the π -bond ring formed within the LiMn 6 structure could participate in stable redox reactions as one unit, but Co could disrupt its symmetry. We thus designed and synthesized Co-free concentration-gradient LLOs (CF-CG-LLOs) materials. The combination of concentration gradient and Co removal leads to exceptional capacity retention without any fading over 100 cycles of the pouch cell. More importantly, it exhibits an extraordinarily low voltage decay of 0.15 mV/cycle, accompanied by a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.86%.

This microscope combines ratiometric spectral imaging of membrane fluidity and interferometric imaging of membrane morphology. As a preliminary demonstration, we simultaneously visualized the interface between a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) and a glass substrate at different temperatures. We identified more fluid regions of the membrane and membrane adhesion sites (conversely, low-fluidic, ordered membrane domains correlate with nonadhered regions). This microscopic system was applied to human breast cancer cell lines with different malignancies; then, we identified adhesion signature of cancer cells: 1) low-fluidic, ordered membrane domains at the cell periphery and 2) large fluidic deviation at the nonadhered region. Inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis pathway suppresses the ordered membrane domains at the cancer cell periphery; thus, high level of cholesterol supports the appearance. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the unsaturated lipid synthesis pathway suppressed the large fluidic deviation at the nonadhered region; variation of unsaturated lipids contributes to heterogeneity of the cancer membrane. Therefore, our advanced optical microscopy enables us to couple membrane physical properties with cell adhesion, leading to definition of adhesion signatures of broad cell types, not just for cancer cells, that regulate life phenomena.",

Here, we target the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) as an “autocrine master amplifier” of multiple upstream activators of lung fibroblasts. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common fibrotic lung disease, we found that lung myofibroblasts had high LIF expression, and the fibroblasts in fibroblastic foci coexpressed LIF and LIFR. In IPF, fibroblastic foci are the “leading edge” of fibrosis and a key site of disease pathogenesis. TGFβ1, one of the principal drivers of fibrosis, up-regulated LIF expression in IPF fibroblasts. We found that TGFβ1, IL-4, and IL-13 stimulations of fibroblasts require the LIF-LIFR axis to evoke a strong fibrogenic effector response in fibroblasts. In vitro antibody blockade of LIFR on IPF lung fibroblasts reduced the induction of profibrotic genes after TGFβ1 stimulation. Silencing LIF and LIFR reduced profibrotic fibroblast activation following TGFβ1, IL-4, and IL-13 stimulations. We also demonstrated that LIFR amplified profibrotic stimuli in precision-cut lung slices from IPF patients. These LIFR signals were transduced via JAK2, and STAT1 in IPF lung fibroblasts. Together, we find that LIFR drives an autocrine circuit that amplifies and sustains pathogenic activation of IPF fibroblasts. Targeting a single, downstream master amplifier on fibroblasts, like LIFR, is an alternative therapeutic strategy that simultaneously attenuates the profibrotic effects of multiple upstream stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Solute transport and biogeochemical reactions in porous and fractured media flows are controlled by mixing, as are subsurface engineering operations such as contaminant remediation, geothermal energy production, and carbon sequestration. Porous media flows are generally regarded as slow, so the effects of fluid inertia on mixing and reaction are typically ignored. Here, we demonstrate through microfluidic experiments and numerical simulations of mixing-induced reaction that inertial recirculating flows readily emerge in laminar porous media flows and dramatically alter mixing and reaction dynamics. An optimal Reynolds number that maximizes the reaction rate is observed for individual pore throats of different sizes. This reaction maximization is attributed to the effects of recirculation flows on reactant availability, mixing, and reaction completion, which depend on the topology of recirculation relative to the boundary of the reactants or mixing interface. Recirculation enhances mixing and reactant availability, but a further increase in flow velocity reduces the residence time in recirculation, leading to a decrease in reaction rate. The reaction maximization is also confirmed in a flow channel with grain inclusions and randomized porous media. Interestingly, the domain-wide reaction rate shows a dramatic increase with increasing Re in the randomized porous media case. This is because fluid inertia induces complex three-dimensional flows in randomized porous media, which significantly increases transverse spreading and mixing. This study shows how inertial flows control reaction dynamics at the pore scale and beyond, thus having major implications for a wide range of environmental systems.",

Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to explore their origin, particularly focusing on EuCd 2 P 2 . While the low-energy spectral weight royally tracks that of the resistivity anomaly near the temperature with maximum magnetoresistance ( T MR ) as expected from transport-spectroscopy correspondence, the spectra are completely incoherent and strongly suppressed with no hint of a Landau quasiparticle. Using systematic material and temperature dependence investigation complemented by theory, we attribute this nonquasiparticle caricature to the strong presence of entangled magnetic and lattice interactions, a characteristic enabled by the p - f mixing. Given the known presence of ferromagnetic clusters, this naturally points to the origin of CMR being the scattering of spin-polarized polarons at the boundaries of ferromagnetic clusters. These results are not only illuminating to investigate the strong correlations and topology in EuCd 2 X 2 family, but, in a broader view, exemplify how multiple cooperative interactions can give rise to extraordinary behaviors in condensed matter systems.",

Here, we propose a sequential leaching strategy to utilize the dynamic restructuring and enhance the chemical bond strength for highly active and stable OER. Modeling on nickel-iron sulfides (NiFe-S), we introduced and utilized foreign Mo dopant preleaching as the sacrificial agent to alleviate the oxidation corrosion of partial M─S bonds. Operando spectroscopic reveal that foreign Mo dopant leach from the matrix and then adsorb on the surface of NiFe O(S)OH as molybdate at lower OER potential. The crystal occupation hamiltonian population analysis uncovers that the charge transfer from molybdate into NiFe O(S)OH will enhance bond energy of M─S, thus preventing further S and Fe/Ni leaching. By manipulating ion leaching, the resulting active phase achieves an ultralow overpotential of 250 mV at 400 mA cm −2 and high stability of more than 3,700 h at 100 mA cm −2 . An industrial water electrolysis equipment using our catalysts delivered ultralow energy consumption of 4.30 kWh m −3 H2 and record stability over 250 h (2,300 h lifetime by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) under a high working current of 8,000 mA.

This study explores the potential for green hydrogen in Texas as a substitute for current development, underscoring numerous advantages such as ample renewables, established demand, and operational infrastructure. We present an hourly-resolution, cross-sector assessment framework to optimize grid-integrated green hydrogen supply paths from managing local applications to meeting potential export opportunities. The analysis indicates that by 2030, Texas could have over 50 million tons of green hydrogen available at $1.5/kg. Even with the incrementality, deliverability, and temporal matching requirements of 45 V, green hydrogen remains more competitive than blue hydrogen. On the supply side, the grid-electrolysis integration results in synergetic benefits, including overall cost reductions, less curtailment of renewables, and enhanced operational flexibility and reliability. On the demand side, this cost-competitive hydrogen could bring the cost of hydrogen fueling and ammonia production down to $4/kg and $350/ton respectively, with a significant impact in replacing fossil fuels in transport and industry. For most of the states, green hydrogen and ammonia imported from Texas could become an affordable alternative to local supplies. Through both onshore pipelines and offshore shipments, Texas has the potential to develop as a major green fuel supplier, aiding in decarbonization efforts not only for the United States but also beyond.",

Phosphorylation serves as a canonical way to regulate p38α activation through a phosphorylation cascade. Thus, understanding the mechanism governing p38α phosphorylation is important. The present study demonstrated that p38α undergoes methylation at K165, which promote its phosphorylation in tumor cells. Inhibition of p38α methylation impairs p38α phosphorylation, repressing tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, KDM5D is a demethylase that interacts with p38α, mediating demethylation at K165 and inhibiting p38α phosphorylation. Moreover, KDM5D is expressed at low levels in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and high KDM5D expression is positively correlated with cancer survival. KDM5D markedly inhibits cell proliferation and migration via inactivating p38α, thereby slowing cancer progression in xenograft models. In summary, these findings highlight KDM5D as a demethylase of p38α at K165, elucidating a unique role for lysine demethylation in integrating cytoplasmic kinase-signaling cascades. The present results revealed the critical role of KDM5D in suppressing tumor progression, suggesting that KDM5D can serve as a potential drug target for combating hyperactive p38α-driven lung cancer.",

As such, the endolysosomal system plays a critical role in determining the abundance of proteins on the cell surface and influencing cellular identity and function. Highly polarized cells, like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system for axonal and dendritic specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Parkinson’s to Alzheimer’s disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to technical limitations. Here, we develop a toolkit for capturing EEA1-positive endosomes (termed Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (termed Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrate its utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for stem cells and cortical-like iNeurons, and profiling endosomes in response to potassium-mediated neuronal depolarization. Through global profiling of endocytic cargo, we identify hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling reveals a simpler protein repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled recycling or degradation for many endocytic targets. This system will facilitate mechanistic interrogation of endolysosomal components found as risk factors in neurodegenerative disease.",

While soy and gluten dominate the market, there is a trend to explore alternative crops for functional ingredient production.

Methionine, cysteine, and lysine were decisive for the amino acid score, which even varied between ingredients produced from the same raw material. Such differences were also observed in the protein solubility profiles, characterized by their raw material–specific protein pattern.

First, it acts as an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1. Deficiency in RAD51 causes excessive ubiquitination and degradation of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, leading to the loss of global DNA methylation. Second, RAD51 helps UHRF1 to monoubiquitinate histone H3 to generate DNMT1 recruiting signal. It binds H3 directly, enabling UHRF1 to bind and ubiquitinate H3 more readily. Disrupting the interaction between RAD51 and H3 diminishes DNMT1 recruitment and the failure of maintenance methylation of genomic DNA. Thus, RAD51 dually regulates UHRF1.

The developing world is the source of 75% of global emissions from ruminants and will house 86% of the world’s human population by 2050. The adoption of cost-effective, genetic, feed and nutrition practices, and improving livestock health in LMIC are seen as the most promising interventions to reduce emissions resulting from projected increased TASF demand though 2050. Genetic improvement is a particularly attractive approach to productivity enhancements, as such improvements are permanent and cumulative. Alternative proteins may play a role in addressing demand for affordable sources of nutrient-dense foods, however, price will be a major factor influencing adoption given 3.1 billion people globally (42%) were currently unable to afford a healthy diet in 2021. Additionally, there is currently a mismatch between the location of alternative protein companies, and both projected increased TASF demand and emissions.

          "abstract": "Perception is influenced by sensory stimulation, prior knowledge, and contextual cues, which collectively contribute to the emergence of perceptual biases. However, the precise neural mechanisms underlying these biases remain poorly understood. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing neural recordings from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys performing a vibrotactile frequency discrimination task. Our findings provide empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that perceptual biases can be reflected in the neural activity of the PFC. We found that the state-space trajectories of PFC neuronal activity encoded a warped representation of the first frequency presented during the task. Remarkably, this distorted representation of the frequency aligned with the predictions of its Bayesian estimator. The identification of these neural correlates expands our understanding of the neural basis of perceptual biases and highlights the involvement of the PFC in shaping perceptual experiences. Similar analyses could be employed in other delayed comparison tasks and in various brain regions to explore where and how neural activity reflects perceptual biases during different stages of the trial.",

          "abstract": "The living cell creates a unique internal molecular environment that is challenging to characterize. By combining single-molecule displacement/diffusivity mapping (SM d M) with physiologically active extracts prepared from Xenopus laevis eggs, we sought to elucidate molecular properties of the cytoplasm. Quantification of the diffusion coefficients of 15 diverse proteins in extract showed that, compared to in water, negatively charged proteins diffused ~50% slower, while diffusion of positively charged proteins was reduced by ~80 to 90%. Adding increasing concentrations of salt progressively alleviated the suppressed diffusion observed for positively charged proteins, signifying electrostatic interactions within a predominately negatively charged macromolecular environment. To investigate the contribution of RNA, an abundant, negatively charged component of cytoplasm, extracts were treated with ribonuclease, which resulted in low diffusivity domains indicative of aggregation, likely due to the liberation of positively charged RNA-binding proteins such as ribosomal proteins, since this effect could be mimicked by adding positively charged polypeptides. Interestingly, in extracts prepared under typical conditions that inhibit actin polymerization, negatively charged proteins of different sizes showed similar diffusivity suppression consistent with our separately measured 2.22-fold higher viscosity of extract over water. Restoring or enhancing actin polymerization progressively suppressed the diffusion of larger proteins, recapitulating behaviors observed in cells. Together, these results indicate that molecular interactions in the crowded cell are defined by an overwhelmingly negatively charged macromolecular environment containing cytoskeletal networks.",

Utilizing a multivalent photoaffinity probe in combination with quantitative proteomics approach, we identify DPF2 as a candidate target of H3K14la. Biochemical studies as well as CUT&amp;Tag analysis reveal that DPF2 is capable of binding to H3K14la and colocalizes with it on promoters of oncogenic genes. Notably, disrupting the DPF2–H3K14la interaction through structure-guided mutation blunts those cancer-related gene expression along with cell survival.

Specifically, a cell line overexpressing the EMT transcription factor ZEB1 displayed alterations in translational reprogramming and fidelity. Furthermore, using riboproteomics, we unveiled an increased level of the ribosomal protein RPL36A in mesenchymal ribosomes, indicating precise tuning of ribosome composition.

          "abstract": "A hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is the progressive loss of proteostasis, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins or protein aggregates, with subsequent cytotoxicity. To combat this toxicity, cells have evolved degradation pathways (ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy) that detect and degrade misfolded proteins. However, studying the underlying cellular pathways and mechanisms has remained a challenge, as formation of many types of protein aggregates is asynchronous, with individual cells displaying distinct kinetics, thereby hindering rigorous time-course studies. Here, we merge a kinetically tractable and synchronous agDD-GFP system for aggregate formation with targeted gene knockdowns, to uncover degradation mechanisms used in response to acute aggregate formation. We find that agDD-GFP forms amorphous aggregates by cryo-electron tomography at both early and late stages of aggregate formation. Aggregate turnover occurs in a proteasome-dependent mechanism in a manner that is dictated by cellular aggregate burden, with no evidence of the involvement of autophagy. Lower levels of misfolded agDD-GFP, enriched in oligomers, utilizes UBE3C-dependent proteasomal degradation in a pathway that is independent of RPN13 ubiquitylation by UBE3C. Higher aggregate burden activates the NRF1 transcription factor to increase proteasome subunit transcription and subsequent degradation capacity of cells. Loss or gain of NRF1 function alters the turnover of agDD-GFP under conditions of high aggregate burden. Together, these results define the role of UBE3C in degradation of this class of misfolded aggregation-prone proteins and reveals a role for NRF1 in proteostasis control in response to widespread protein aggregation.",

However, the identity of the effector gene regulating melanic wing color within this locus remains unknown. We show that none of the four candidate protein-coding genes within this locus, including cortex , serve as major effectors. Instead, a microRNA (miRNA), mir-193 , serves as the major effector across three deeply diverged lineages of butterflies, and its role is conserved in Drosophila . In Lepidoptera, mir-193 is derived from a gigantic primary long noncoding RNA, ivory , and it functions by directly repressing multiple pigmentation genes.

Taking classic bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 )–based thermoelectric semiconductors as an example, we show that antisite defects can lead to high-density, diverse microstructures that substantially affect mechanical properties and thus successfully transform these bulk semiconductors from brittle to plastic, leading to a high figure of merit of up to 1.05 at 300 kelvin compared with other plastic semiconductors, similar to the best brittle semiconductors.

In this work, we use live imaging of individual symbiotic bacterial cells colonizing the gut of living Drosophila melanogaster to show that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum specifically recognizes the fruit fly foregut as a distinct physical niche. L. plantarum establishes stably within its niche through host-specific adhesins encoded by genes carried on a colonization island.

We report active-reset sensors by use of high-frequency oscillations to accelerate dissociation, which enables regeneration of the unbound form of the sensor within 1 minute.

We obtain designs with low picomolar affinity whose specificity can be completely switched to other family members using partial diffusion. Designs function as antagonists or as superagonists when presented at higher valency for OX40 and 4-1BB.

One of these RAD51 regulators is FIGNL1, that prevents persistent RAD51 foci without or after DNA damage and genotoxic chromatin association in cells. The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of FIGNL1 in complex with RAD51 reveals that FIGNL1 forms a non-planar hexamer and RAD51 N terminus enclosure in the FIGNL1 hexamer pore. Mutations in pore loop or catalytic residues of FIGNL1 render it defective in filament disassembly and are lethal in mouse embryonic stem cells.

          "abstract": "Ambidirectionality, which is the ability of structural elements to move beyond a reference state in two opposite directions, is common in nature. However, conventional soft materials are typically limited to a single, unidirectional deformation unless complex hybrid constructs are used. We exploited the combination of mesogen self-assembly, polymer chain elasticity, and polymerization-induced stress to design liquid crystalline elastomers that exhibit two mesophases: chevron smectic C (cSmC) and smectic A (SmA). Inducing the cSmC-SmA–isotropic phase transition led to an unusual inversion of the strain field in the microstructure, resulting in opposite deformation modes (e.g., consecutive shrinkage or expansion and right-handed or left-handed twisting and tilting in opposite directions) and high-frequency nonmonotonic oscillations. This ambidirectional movement is scalable and can be used to generate Gaussian transformations at the macroscale.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is expected to cause irreversible changes to biodiversity, but predicting those risks remains uncertain. I synthesized 485 studies and more than 5 million projections to produce a quantitative global assessment of climate change extinctions. With increased certainty, this meta-analysis suggests that extinctions will accelerate rapidly if global temperatures exceed 1.5°C. The highest-emission scenario would threaten approximately one-third of species, globally. Amphibians; species from mountain, island, and freshwater ecosystems; and species inhabiting South America, Australia, and New Zealand face the greatest threats. In line with predictions, climate change has contributed to an increasing proportion of observed global extinctions since 1970. Besides limiting greenhouse gases, pinpointing which species to protect first will be critical for preserving biodiversity until anthropogenic climate change is halted and reversed.",

Overfishing the largest species in nearshore and pelagic habitats risks loss of ecomorphotypes and a 5 to 22% erosion of functional diversity. Extinction risk is higher in countries with large human coastal populations but lower in nations with stronger governance, larger economies, and greater beneficial fisheries subsidies. Restricting fishing (including incidental catch) and trade to sustainable levels combined with prohibiting retention of highly threatened species can avert further depletion, widespread loss of population connectivity, and top-down predator control.",

Annual greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic system are projected to grow by 37% to 3.35 billion tonnes CO 2 equivalent (3.09 to 3.54) over the same period.

While neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions involved in social inference, it remains unknown whether performing social inference is an abstract computation that generalizes across different stimulus categories or is specific to certain stimulus domain. We recorded single-neuron activity from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in neurosurgical patients performing different types of inferences from images of faces, hands, and natural scenes. Our findings indicate distinct neuron populations in both regions encoding inference type for social (faces, hands) and nonsocial (scenes) stimuli, while stimulus category was itself represented in a task-general manner. Uniquely in the MTL, social inference type was represented by separate subsets of neurons for faces and hands, suggesting a domain-specific representation. These results reveal evidence for specialized social inference processes in the MTL, in which inference representations were entangled with stimulus type as expected from a domain-specific process.",

          "abstract": "Most homicides in the United States are committed using a handgun, but little research examines gun carrying over critical stages of the life course and changing contexts of violence. Notably, although most of the handgun homicides are committed by adults, most research on concealed gun carrying focuses on adolescents in single cohort studies. Using more than 25 years of longitudinal multicohort data from Chicago, 1994–2021, we show that pathways of concealed gun carrying are distinct between adolescence and adulthood. Adolescent carrying is often age-limited and responsive to direct exposure to gun violence (witnessing and victimization), while adult carrying is a persistent behavior that is less tied to direct exposure. The onset of concealed carry is also a strong predictor of later gun use (shooting or brandishing), and we find distinct patterns of gun use between individuals who first carry in adolescence versus adulthood. We discuss the implications of these dual pathways for research and policies on firearm use.",

Their large compositional space poses great design challenges for phase control and high strength-ductility synergy. The present research pioneers using integrated high-throughput machine learning with Monte Carlo simulations supplemented by ab initio calculations to effectively navigate phase selection and mechanical property predictions, developing single-phase ordered B2 aluminum-enriched RHEAs (Al-RHEAs) demonstrating high strength and ductility. These Al-RHEAs achieve remarkable mechanical properties, including compressive yield strengths up to 1.7 gigapascals, fracture strains exceeding 50%, and notable high-temperature strength retention. They also demonstrate a tensile yield strength of 1.0 gigapascals with a ductility of 9%, albeit with B2 ordering. Furthermore, we identify valence electron count domains for alloy ductility and brittleness with the explanation from density functional theory and provide crucial insights into elemental influence on atomic ordering and mechanical performance. The work sets forth a strategic blueprint for high-throughput alloy design and reveals fundamental principles governing the mechanical properties of advanced structural alloys.",

          "abstract": "Converting CO 2 to methanol is crucial for addressing fuel scarcity and mitigating the greenhouse effect. Cu-based catalysts, with their diverse surface states, offer the potential to control reaction pathways and generate reactive H* species. However, a major challenge lies in oxidizing active Cu 0 species by water generated during the catalytic process. While nonreducible metal oxides are beneficial in stabilizing metallic states, their limited capability to generate surface oxygen vacancies (O V ) hinders CO 2 activation. Herein, we present a strategy by doping Nd into a La 2 O 2 CO 3 (LOC) support, enhancing O V formation by disrupting its lattice dyadicity. This leads to higher Cu 0 concentration and improved CO 2 activation. The resulting Cu/LOC:Nd catalyst notably outperforms Cu/LOC and CuZnAl catalysts, achieving a methanol yield of 9.9 moles of methanol per hour per mole of Cu. Our approach opens up possibilities for enhancing Cu-based catalysts in CO 2 conversion.",

          "abstract": "Vector mosquito control is an integral part of malaria control. The global emergence of insecticide resistance in malaria-transmitting Anophelines has become an impediment and has created an urgent need for novel mosquito control approaches. Here, we show that a biopesticide derived from the soil-dwelling bacterium Chromobacterium sp. Panama ( Csp_P ) kills insecticide-resistant Anopheles mosquitoes, regardless of their resistance mechanisms. In addition, sublethal dose of Csp_P acts as a synergist to now used chemical insecticides across multiple classes. Moreover, Csp_P reduces host-seeking behavior and malaria parasite infection in vector mosquitoes in ways that further decrease transmission. Mosquito glutathione S -transferases are essential for Csp_P ’s mosquito-killing mechanism. Enclosed field trials in Burkina Faso, conducted in diverse ecological settings and supported by a mathematical model, have now demonstrated its potential for malaria control in settings with widespread insecticide resistance.",

While previous studies defined MP cells as a heterogeneous population that comprises T helper 1 (T H 1)/17–like subsets, functional significance of the T-bet − Rorγt − subpopulation remains unknown. Here we show that MP lymphocytes as a whole population can differentiate into T H 1/17/regulatory T (T reg ) cells to mediate mild and persistent inflammation in lymphopenic environments, whereas naïve cells exhibit strong, T H 1-dominated responses. Moreover, we demonstrate that MP lymphocytes comprise not only T H 1/17-differentiated subsets but a polyclonal, transcriptomically immature “undifferentiated” subpopulation at homeostasis. Furthermore, our data argue that while the T-bet + Rorγt − MP subset is terminally T H 1-differentiated, its undifferentiated counterpart retains the capacity to rapidly proliferate to differentiate into T H 1/17/T reg cells, with the latter response tonically constrained by preexisting T reg cells. Together, our results identify undifferentiated MP CD4 + T lymphocytes as a unique precursor that has a diverse differentiation potential to generate T H 1/17/T reg cells to contribute to pathogenesis of inflammation.",

However, it remains a daunting challenge to develop an artificial ion channel similar to biological ion channels due to ion-ion competitive transport and lack of ion-gating ability of channels. Here, we report a conductive MXene membrane with polydopamine-confined angstrom-scale channels and propose a voltage gating and ion charge comediation strategy to concurrently achieve gated and selective mono/monovalent cation separation. The membrane shows a highly switchable “on-off” ratio of ∼9.9 for K + transport and an excellent K + /Li + selectivity of 40.9, outperforming the ion selectivity of reported membranes with electrical gating (typically 1.5 to 6). Theoretical simulations reveal that the introduced high-charge cations such as Mg 2+ enable the preferential distribution of target K + over competing Li + at the channel entrance, and the surface potential reduces the ionic transport energy barrier for allowing K + to pass quickly through the channel.",

Halogenation with this [Fe]/H 2 O 2 oxidation protocol and halide (X − ) in the biological system is well established with the identification of heme-iron–dependent haloperoxidases. However, mimicking such halogenation process is rarely explored for practical use in organic synthesis. Here, we report the development of a nonheme iron catalyst that mimics the heme-iron–dependent haloperoxidases to catalyze the generation of HOBr from H 2 O 2 /Br − with high efficiency. We discovered that a tridentate terpyridine (TPY) ligand designed for Fenton chemistry was optimal for FeBr 3 to form a stable nonheme iron catalyst [Fe(TPY)Br 3 ], which catalyzed arene bromination, Hunsdiecker-type decarboxylative bromination, bromolactonization, and oxidation of sulfides and thiols. Mechanistic studies revealed that Fenton chemistry ([Fe]/H 2 O 2 ) might operate to generate hydroxyl radical (HO • ), which oxidize bromide ion [Br − ] into reactive HOBr.

Here, we use a time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy called PIE-FCCS to resolve EGFR and EphA2 interactions in live cells. We tested the role of ligands and found that EGF, but not ephrin A1 (EA1), stimulated heteromultimerization between the receptors. To determine the effect of anionic lipids, we targeted phospholipase C (PLC) activity to alter the abundance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ). We found that higher PIP 2 levels increased homomultimerization of both EGFR and EphA2, as well as heteromultimerization. This study provides a direct characterization of EGFR and EphA2 interactions in live cells and shows that PIP 2 can have a substantial effect on the spatial organization of RTKs.",

Damaging mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, such as SMARCA4 (BRG1), are associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. We found that SMARCA4 loss in OC models resulted in increased cancer cell–intrinsic immunogenicity, characterized by up-regulation of long-terminal RNA repeats, increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes, and up-regulation of antigen presentation machinery. Notably, this response was dependent on STING, MAVS, and IRF3 signaling but was independent of the type I interferon receptor. Mouse ovarian and melanoma tumors with SMARCA4 loss demonstrated increased infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. These results were recapitulated in BRG1 inhibitor–treated SMARCA4- proficient tumor models, suggesting that modulation of chromatin remodeling through targeting SMARCA4 may serve as a strategy to overcome cancer immune evasion.",

Using comparative fauna from this region and period, we find that mammoth was the largest contributor to Clovis diet, followed by elk and bison/camel, while the contribution of small mammals was negligible, broadly consistent with the Clovis zooarchaeological record. When compared with second-order consumers, the Anzick-1 maternal diet is closest to that of scimitar cat, a mammoth specialist.

We compile original and existing genomic, isotopic, and osteological canid data from archaeological, paleontological, and modern sites. Results show that in contrast to canids recovered in non-anthropic contexts, canids recovered in association with human occupations are markedly diverse. They include multiple species and intraspecific lineages, morphological variation, and diets ranging from terrestrial to marine. This variation is expressed along both geographic and temporal gradients, starting in the terminal Pleistocene with canids showing high marine dietary estimates.

This problem is perhaps most pressing at the lowest fields (e.g., 80-MHz 1 H frequency), with rapidly increasing access to NMR through benchtop systems, but also sometimes for higher-field NMR systems from 300 MHz to 1.2 GHz. Hyperpolarization by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) can address this sensitivity limitation. However, dDNP implies massive and complex cryogenic and high-field instrumentation, which cannot be installed on the bench. We introduce here a compact helium-free 1-T tabletop polarizer as a simple and low-cost alternative. After freezing and polarizing the frozen analyte solutions at 77 K, we demonstrate 1 H signal enhancement factors of 100, with rapid 1-s buildup times. The high polarization is subsequently transferred by 1 H→ 13 C cross polarization (CP) to 13 C spins. Such a simple benchtop polarizer, in combination with hyperpolarizing solid matrices (HYPSOs), may open the way to replenishable hyperpolarization throughout multiple liquid-state NMR experiments.",

These materials enable dynamic bond reconfiguration, allowing reversible bond breaking and formation, similar to natural systems. Leveraging their discrete nature, these materials can adaptively reconfigure their shape and respond dynamically to varying conditions. Our investigations reveal that these granular metamaterials can substantially alter their mechanical properties, like compression, shearing, and bending, offering tunable mechanical characteristics across different states. Furthermore, they exhibit collective behaviors like directional movement, object capture, transportation, and gap crossing, showcasing their potential for reprogrammable functionalities.

          "abstract": "Conserved type B histone acetyltransferases are recognized for their role in acetylating newly synthesized histones in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes. However, their involvement in regulating chromatin within the nucleus remains unclear. Our study shows that the Arabidopsis thaliana type B histone acetyltransferase HAG2 interacts with the histone chaperones MSI2, MSI3, and NASP, as well as the histones H3 and H4, forming a complex in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Within this complex, HAG2 and MSI2/3 constitute a histone acetylation module essential for acetylating histone H4 in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, this module works together with NASP to regulate histone acetylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene transcription in the nucleus. This complex enhances chromatin accessibility near transcription start sites while reducing accessibility near transcription termination sites. Our findings reveal a distinct role for the Arabidopsis type B histone acetyltransferase in the nucleus, shedding light on the coordination between cytoplasmic histone acetylation and nuclear chromatin regulation in plants.",

          "abstract": "Manta rays use wing-like pectoral fins for intriguing oscillatory swimming. It provides rich inspiration for designing potentially fast, efficient, and maneuverable soft swimming robots, which, however, have yet to be realized. It remains a grand challenge to combine fast speed, high efficiency, and high maneuverability in a single soft swimmer while using simple actuation and control. Here, we report leveraging spontaneous snapping stroke in the monostable flapping wing of a manta-like soft swimmer to address the challenge. The monostable wing is pneumatically actuated to instantaneously snap through to stroke down, and upon deflation, it will spontaneously stroke up by snapping back to its initial state, driven by elastic restoring force, without consuming additional energy. This largely simplifies designs, actuation, and control for achieving a record-high speed of 6.8 body length per second, high energy efficiency, and high maneuverability and collision resilience in navigating through underwater unstructured environments with obstacles by simply tuning single-input actuation frequencies.",

          "abstract": "High-speed logic modulation of terahertz (THz) waves is crucial for future communications, yet a technology gap persists. Here, we report a dual gate–controlled two-dimensional electronic gas logic modulation metasurface that enables symmetric and asymmetric electron distribution states through independent control of the two electron transport channels. The transition between these two states leads to various response modes in the metasurface and notably increases the diversity of the spectrum transformation, resulting in a multivalued relationship in which each output corresponds to more than one input signal, thus establishing the logical modulation. Our results demonstrate the common logical functions of AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, NOR, and NAND at different frequencies with a modulation speed faster than 250 picoseconds. This work offers a unique avenue for the high-speed, free-space logical operation of THz waves and increases the security of secure communication.",

          "abstract": "The Great Barrier Reef is the largest reef system in the modern ocean. To date, the influence of temperature on the origin and long-term evolution of the Great Barrier Reef remains enigmatic. Here, we present a 900–thousand year TEX 86 H -derived temperature proxy record from Ocean Drilling Program Site 820 in the Coral Sea. It demonstrates that the onset of reef growth on the outer shelf was preceded by a rise in summer temperature from ~26° to ~28°C at around 700 thousand years ago (marine isotope stage 17). This approximately 2°C rise in summer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) likely resulted in higher carbonate production rates, which were crucial for the formation of the Great Barrier Reef. Subsequently, reconstructed SSTs remained sufficiently warm for the Great Barrier Reef to thrive and evolve continuously. The evolution of the Great Barrier Reef, therefore, appears to be closely linked to SSTs.",

          "abstract": "Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a key protein involved in lipoprotein metabolism, has diverse effects. There is an association between Angptl4 and diabetic kidney disease; however, this association has not been well investigated. We show that both podocyte- and tubule-specific ANGPTL4 are crucial fibrogenic molecules in diabetes. Diabetes accelerates the fibrogenic phenotype in control mice but not in ANGPTL4 mutant mice. The protective effect observed in ANGPTL4 mutant mice is correlated with a reduction in stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, lessened mitochondrial damage, and increased fatty acid oxidation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that podocyte- or tubule-secreted Angptl4 interacts with Integrin β1 and influences the association between dipeptidyl-4 with Integrin β1. We demonstrate the utility of a targeted pharmacologic therapy that specifically inhibits Angptl4 gene expression in the kidneys and protects diabetic kidneys from proteinuria and fibrosis. Together, these data demonstrate that podocyte- and tubule-derived Angptl4 is fibrogenic in diabetic kidneys.",

Conventional direct faradaic detection based on electron transfers at solid electrode/solution interfaces has been proven ineffective due to the electrochemically inactive nature of Cl − . Here, we present an approach involving molecularly tailored liquid/liquid interfacial ultramicro iontronics (L/L-UIs) supported at ultramicropipettes filled with organic gel containing lipophilic bis-thioureas ionophores, which represents the first application of amperometric methodology based on electrochemical facilitated ion transfers reactions at a soft L/L ultramicrointerface to achieve in vivo sensing of electrochemically inactive ions, and dynamically tracking cerebral Cl − in vivo. Furthermore, evidence of dynamic neuronal Cl − regulation via KCC2 modulated through GABA B receptors was provided, further substantiating GABA B receptor–mediated Cl − -related neuronal inhibition. The proposed L/L-UIs have notable potential for in situ tracking of other crucial electrochemically inactive ions or ionized biomolecules in vivo, thereby facilitating the study of brain diseases and the diagnosis and treatment of related disorders.",

          "abstract": "HER2 and α V β 6 integrin are independent predictors of breast cancer survival and metastasis. We identify an α V β 6 /HER2 cross-talk mechanism driving invasion, which is dysregulated in drug-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cells. Proteomic analyses reveal ligand-bound α V β 6 recruits HER2 and a trafficking subnetwork, comprising guanosine triphosphatases RAB5 and RAB7A and the Rab regulator guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor 2 (GDI2). The RAB5/RAB7A/GDI2 functional module mediates direct cross-talk between α V β 6 and HER2, affecting receptor trafficking and signaling. Acute exposure to trastuzumab increases recruitment of the subnetwork to α V β 6 , but trastuzumab resistance decouples GDI2 recruitment. GDI2, RAB5, and RAB7A cooperate to regulate migration and transforming growth factor–β activation to promote invasion. However, these mechanisms are dysregulated in trastuzumab-resistant cells. In patients, RAB5A , RAB7A , and GDI2 expression correlates with patient survival and α V β 6 expression predicts relapse following trastuzumab treatment. Thus, the RAB5/RAB7A/GDI2 subnetwork regulates α V β 6 -HER2 cross-talk to drive breast cancer invasion but is subverted in trastuzumab-resistant cells to drive α V β 6 -independent and HER2-independent tumor progression.",

          "abstract": "Modeling sea surface wind-waves is crucial for both scientific research and engineering applications. Nowadays, the most accurate wave models are based on numerical methods, which primarily concern the wave spectrum evolution by solving wave action balance partial differential equations. These methods are computationally expensive and limited by incomplete physical representations of wave spectral evolution. Here, we present a deep learning–based wave model trained using observation-merged wave hindcasts. Guided by the physics knowledge that waves are either generated by local current winds or by remote historical winds, this method can directly model significant wave height, bypassing the need for wave spectral information. This feature engineering effectively reduces the complexity of model inputs and outputs. The resulting artificial intelligence method can model 1 year of global significant wave heights at a 0.5° × 0.5° × 1-hour resolution within half an hour on a personal computer, achieving higher accuracy than state-of-the-art numerical wave models.",
