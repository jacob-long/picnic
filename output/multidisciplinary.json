          "abstract": "N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission throughout the brain1. As obligate heterotetramers, their activation requires the binding of both glycine and glutamate2. Although recent structural studies have provided insights into endogenous receptors from select brain regions3, most previous work has relied on recombinant receptors and engineered constructs, which limits our understanding of native NMDARs across the whole brain. Here we identify and resolve ten distinct native NMDAR assemblies from the whole-brain tissue of female C57BL/6 mice using immunoaffinity purification, single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Analyses of the GluN1–GluN2A(S1), GluN1–GluN2A(S2), GluN1–GluN2A(S3), GluN1–GluN2B, GluN1–GluN2A–GluN2B(S1), GluN1–GluN2A–GluN2B(S2), GluN1–GluN2A–GluNX(S1), GluN1–GluN2A–GluNX(S2), GluN1–GluN2B–GluNX and GluN1–GluNX structures reveal that GluN2A is the most prevalent subunit across assemblies. Moreover, the substantial conformational flexibility observed in the GluN2A amino-terminal domain may explain its fast kinetics and dominant role in gating. Dynamic movements of S-ketamine were also captured at the channel vestibule, as was pore dilation in both the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of a native GluN1–GluN2B receptor. The latter observation represents a previously unknown fully open state of NMDAR. Our large collection of heterogeneous NMDAR structures from whole brain reveals previously unrecognized properties of conformational diversity and channel dilation.",

          "abstract": "The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in 229Th at around 148.4 nm (refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6) offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the realization of a nuclear clock7,8. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation of large ensembles of 229Th nuclei in transparent crystals6,9,10,11 and the development of pulsed vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lasers12,13,14, have enabled initial laser spectroscopy of this transition15,16,17. However, the lack of an intense, narrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation8,18. Here we introduce and report a continuous-wave (CW) laser at 148.4 nm, generated by means of four-wave mixing (FWM)19 in cadmium vapour. The source delivers more than 100 nW of power with a projected linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength tunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth over all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm (refs. 12,13,14,20). We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique that places a stringent upper bound on FWM-induced phase noise, thereby supporting the feasibility of sub-hertz VUV linewidths. Our work addresses the central challenge towards a 229Th-based nuclear clock and establishes a widely tunable, ultranarrow-linewidth laser platform for potential applications across quantum information science21,22,23,24, condensed-matter physics25 and high-resolution VUV spectroscopy26.",

          "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) makes use of the principles of quantum mechanics to enable provably secure communication1,2. One substantial challenge persists in building large-scale QKD networks with many clients over long communication distances3. Although quantum relays continue to pose practical difficulties4, existing trusted-node networks5,6,7,8,9, point-to-multipoint networks10,11 and wavelength-multiplexed entanglement networks12,13 encounter issues such as reliance on trusted intermediaries or limited distances. Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) provides a compelling architecture that can overcome those issues while enhancing communication distance14. Although long-distance point-to-point TF-QKD has been achieved15,16,17,18,19,20,21, realizing large-scale networks requires scalable quantum devices. Here we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of an integrated-photonics TF-QKD network with exceptional scalability and reliability. This network includes 20 independent client-side QKD transmitter chips with one server-side optical microcomb chip. The microcomb generates a broad range of ultralow-noise coherent frequency combs with Hz-level linewidths, which serve as seeds and references for all client chips. Each client chip regenerates ultralow-noise light phase-locked to microcombs and prepares quantum keys. We sequentially implement pairwise QKD across 20 client chips through ten wavelength-multiplexed channels, with each surpassing the repeaterless bound at 370 km in spooled fibre, achieving a networking capability (client pairs × communication distance) of 3,700 km. We further demonstrate the wafer-scale reproducibility of both server-side microcomb chips and client-side QKD transmitter chips, together establishing system-level scalability. Combining mass-manufacturability, cost-effectiveness and high scalability of integrated photonics with long-distance quantum communication represents a viable path to large-scale quantum networks.",

          "authors": "Bin Li, Ming-Chao Zhong, Cristian Camilo Galindo, Jiayu Dou, Jin Qian, Zhenghai Tang, Dominique Davidson, André Veillette",
          "abstract": "Inhibitory receptors like PD-1 and CTLA-4 contribute to T cell dysfunction in cancer1,2,3. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking the interactions in trans of these receptors with their ligands on cancer cells or in the tumour microenvironment lead to clinical responses in some but not all types of cancer. Signalling lymphocytic activation molecule 6 (SLAMF6, also known as Ly108) is a homotypic receptor preferentially expressed on progenitor or stem-like exhausted T (Tpex) cells, but not on terminally exhausted T (Tex) cells, as demonstrated in mouse models4,5,6,7,8,9. In contrast to Tex cells, Tpex cells retain the capacity for functional restoration after immune checkpoint blockade10,11,12. The role of SLAMF6 in T cells remains ambiguous, as it has both activating and inhibitory effects, complicating its evaluation as a therapeutic target. Here we find that SLAMF6 was triggered in cis by homotypic interactions at the T cell surface. These interactions elicited inhibitory effects that suppressed activation of T cells and limited anti-tumour immunity, independently of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells. mAbs against human SLAMF6 with a robust ability to disrupt the cis interactions strongly augmented T cell activation, reduced the proportions of exhausted T cells and inhibited tumour growth in vivo. Collectively, these findings show that SLAMF6 functions exclusively as a T cell inhibitory receptor, which is triggered by cis homotypic interactions. They also position SLAMF6 as a promising target for therapies aimed at enhancing anti-tumour immunity, regardless of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells.",

          "abstract": "Identifying a catalyst class to optimize the enantioselectivity of a new reaction, either involving a different combination of known substrate types or an entirely unfamiliar class of compounds, is a formidable challenge. Statistical models trained on a reported set of reactions can help predict out-of-sample transformations1–5 but often face two challenges: (1) only sparse data are available i.e., limited information on catalyst–substrate interactions, and (2) simple stereoelectronic parameters may fail to describe mechanistically complex transformations.6,7 Here we report a descriptor generation strategy that accounts for changes in the enantiodetermining step with catalyst or substrate identity, allowing us to model reactions involving distinct ligand and substrate types. As validating case studies, we collected data on enantioselective nickel-catalyzed C(sp3)-couplings8 and trained statistical models with features extracted from the transition states and intermediates proposed to be involved in asymmetric induction. These models allow for the optimization of poorly performing examples reported in a substrate scope and are applicable to unseen ligands and reaction partners. This approach offers the opportunity to streamline catalyst and reaction development, quantitatively transferring knowledge learned on sparse data to novel chemical spaces.",

Fear memory and extinction are underpinned by neural representations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) 1–7 , but the contribution of non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes, to these processes remains unresolved. Here, using in vivo calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging and causal astrocyte manipulations, we find that BLA astrocytes dynamically track fear state and support fear memory retrieval and extinction. By combining astrocyte manipulations with in vivo BLA neuronal Ca 2+ imaging and electrophysiological recordings, we show that astrocyte Ca 2+ signalling enables neuronal encoding of fear memory retrieval and extinction, and readout through a BLA–prefrontal circuit. Our findings reveal a key role for astrocytes in the generation and adaptation of fear-state-related neural representations, revising neurocentric models of critical amygdala-mediated adaptive functions.",

African rodents, especially squirrels, are suspected to be involved in MPXV emergence, but no evidence of a direct transmission to humans or non-human primates has been established 4–9 . Here we describe an outbreak of MPXV in a group of wild sooty mangabeys ( Cercocebus atys ) in Taï National Park (Côte d’Ivoire). The outbreak affected one-third of the group, killing four infants. To track its origin, we analysed rodents and wildlife carcasses from the region. We identified a MPXV-infected fire-footed rope squirrel ( Funisciurus pyrropus ), found dead 3 km from the mangabey territory 12 weeks before the outbreak. MPXV genomes from the squirrel and the mangabey were nearly identical. A video record from 2014 showed a mangabey from this group eating the same squirrel species and diet metabarcoding of faecal samples collected from mangabeys before the outbreak identified two samples containing fire-footed rope squirrel DNA. One of these samples was also the first positive for MPXV. This represents a rare case of direct detection of interspecies transmission. Our findings indicate that rope squirrels were the source of the MPXV outbreak in mangabeys. Because squirrels and non-human primates are hunted, traded and consumed by humans in West and Central Africa 10,11 , exposure to these animals probably represents risk for zoonotic transmission of MPXV.",

          "abstract": "Lymphoedema is a chronic debilitating disease caused by impaired lymphatic drainage and is characterized by tissue swelling, fat expansion, inflammation and fibrosis1,2. However, the exact mechanisms that drive lymphoedema are poorly understood. Although lymphatic vessels are known to transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the systemic circulation3, the importance of impaired lymphatic drainage for cholesterol clearance in humans and its relevance to lymphoedema remain unknown. Here we show that lymphatic drainage insufficiency in human lymphoedema leads to excessive cholesterol accumulation in the lymphoedematous dermal tissue and around lymphatic vessels. Cholesterol deposition resulted in dermal adipose tissue remodelling, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction, progressing to death and dermal fibrosis. Surgical intervention improved lymphatic drainage and reduced cholesterol deposition. Using two mouse models that reproduce features of human lymphoedema, we demonstrated that tissue swelling and dermal adipose tissue remodelling were ameliorated by the cholesterol-depleting agent cyclodextrin. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that cyclodextrin restored lymphatic drainage by promoting the regeneration of lymphatic vessels. This study unravels the role of impaired cholesterol clearance in driving lymphoedema and identifies tissue cholesterol as a promising therapeutic target for this currently incurable disease.",

          "abstract": "Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum computers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum information non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a shared fermionic state whose occupation—either even or odd—defines the fermionic parity that encodes the qubit1. Notably, this parity can only be accessed by a measurement that couples two Majoranas to each other. A promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain1, implemented in quantum dots coupled using superconductors2. Even the minimal two-site chain hosts a pair of Majorana modes, often called ‘poor man’s Majoranas’, which are spatially separated but offer limited protection compared with longer chains3,4,5. Here we introduce a measurement technique that reads out their parity through quantum capacitance. Our method couples two Majoranas and resolves their parity in real time, visible as random telegraph switching with lifetimes exceeding a millisecond. Simultaneous charge sensing confirms that the two parity states are charge neutral and remain indistinguishable to a probe that does not couple the modes. These results establish the essential readout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a long-standing experimental challenge.",

          "abstract": "Orthosteric inhibitors block enzyme active sites and prevent substrates from binding 1 . Enhancing their specificity through substrate dependence seems inherently unlikely, as their mechanism hinges on direct competition rather than selective recognition. Here we show that a molecular glue mechanism unexpectedly imparts substrate-dependent potency to CSN5i-3, an orthosteric inhibitor of the COP9 signalosome (CSN). We first confirm that CSN5i-3 inhibits CSN, which catalyses NEDD8 (N8) deconjugation from the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, by occupying the active site of its catalytic subunit, CSN5, and directly competing with the iso-peptide bond substrate. Notably, the orthosteric inhibitor binds free CSN with only micromolar affinity, yet achieves nanomolar potency in blocking its deneddylase activity. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the enzyme–substrate–inhibitor complex reveal that active site-engaged CSN5i-3 occludes the substrate iso-peptide linkage while simultaneously extending an N8-binding exosite of CSN5, acting as a molecular glue to cement the N8–CSN5 interaction. The cooperativity of this trimolecular CSN5i-3–N8–CSN5 assembly, in turn, sequesters CSN5i-3 at its binding site, conferring high potency to the orthosteric inhibitor despite its low affinity for the free enzyme. Together, our findings highlight the modest affinity requirements of molecule glues for individual target proteins and establish orthosteric molecular glue inhibitors as a new class of substrate-dependent enzyme antagonists.",

Although the tuning of neurons in other areas of this system is unstable—evidenced, for example, by the change in the spatial tuning of hippocampal place cells3 across days4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11—the stability of the neuronal code that underlies the sense of direction remains unclear. Here, by longitudinally tracking the activity of the same HD cells in the post-subiculum of freely moving mice, we show stability and plasticity at two levels. Although the population structure remained highly conserved across environments and over time, subtle shifts in population coherence encoded environment identity. In addition, the HD system established a distinct, environment-specific alignment between its internal representation and external landmarks, which persisted for weeks, even after a single exposure. These findings suggest that the HD system forms long-lasting orientation memories that are anchored to specific environments.",

Striatal dopamine release signals the reward-predictive value of cues1,2, probably contributing to motivation3,4, but it is unclear how dopamine incorporates an animal’s ongoing trajectory for effective behavioural guidance. Here we demonstrate that cue-evoked striatal dopamine release in mice encodes bidirectional trajectory errors reflecting the relationship between the speed and direction of ongoing movement relative to optimal goal trajectories. Trajectory error signals could be computed from locomotion or visual flow, and were independent from simultaneous dopamine increases reflecting learned cue value. Joint trajectory error and cue-value encoding were reproduced by the reward prediction error term in a standard reinforcement learning algorithm with mixed sensorimotor inputs. However, these two signals had distinct state space requirements, suggesting that they could arise from a common reinforcement learning algorithm with distinct neural inputs. Striatum-wide multifibre array measurements resolved overlapping, yet temporally and anatomically separable, representations of trajectory error and cue value, indicating how functionally distinct dopamine signals for motivation and guidance are multiplexed across striatal regions to facilitate goal-directed behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Aluminium comprises over 8% of Earth’s crust and is the most abundant metallic constituent1. Historically, aluminium catalysis has predominantly exploited the inherent Lewis acidity associated with its stable +III oxidation state2. Owing to its uniquely low electronegativity (1.61)—the lowest among p-block elements—and the absence of an inert-pair effect, aluminium presents formidable intrinsic challenges for engaging in catalytic redox transformations. Here we report the redox catalytic capability of a low-valent aluminium species, carbazolylaluminylene3, which carries out a complete Al(I)/Al(III) catalytic cycle encompassing oxidative addition, double insertion, intramolecular isomerization and reductive elimination—fundamental mechanistic steps conventionally exclusive to transition-metal catalysis. Leveraging this Al(I)/Al(III) redox cycle, we achieve highly efficient and regioselective Reppe cyclotrimerization of alkynes4,5, producing diverse benzene derivatives with a turnover number of up to 2,290. Through X-ray crystallographic and quantum chemical analyses, we elucidate how the dynamic nitrogen geometry within the carbazolyl ligand framework precisely modulates the aluminium coordination environment, thereby facilitating the catalytic cycle. This work fundamentally advances the conceptual understanding of main-group redox catalysis. It further sets a compelling precedent for future catalyst design and sustainable synthetic methodologies centred on aluminium redox transformations.",

          "abstract": "Volumetric additive manufacturing has emerged as a promising technique for the flexible production of complex structures, with diverse applications in engineering, photonics and biology1,2. However, present methods still face a trade-off between resolution and volumetric build rate, restricting efficient and flexible production of high-resolution 3D structures. Here we propose a method, called digital incoherent synthesis of holographic light fields (DISH), to generate high-resolution 3D light distributions through continuous multi-angle projections with a high-speed rotating periscope without the requirement of sample rotation. The iterative optimization of the holograms for different angles in DISH maintains 19-μm printing resolution across the 1-cm range that is far beyond the depth of field of the objective and enables high-resolution in situ 3D printing of millimetre-scale objects within only 0.6 s. Acrylate materials in a range of viscosities are used to demonstrate the general compatibility of DISH. Integrating DISH with a fluid channel, we achieved mass production of complex and diverse 3D structures within low-viscosity materials, demonstrating its potential for broad applications in diverse fields.",

However, PeLEDs still underperform compared with organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with an EQE of about 40% because of insufficient charge confinement and defect-caused non-radiative recombination on the film surface. Here we report a spontaneously formed 3D/2D vertically oriented perovskite heterojunction by means of a simple one-step spin-coating method, which could effectively confine the charge carriers and shift the radiation zone away from the defect-rich surface region. Notably, the 2D perovskite on top exhibits a wrinkled surface morphology, which offers up to 45.4% light extraction efficiency. The resulting PeLEDs achieved an EQE of 42.9% for the green emission (certified 42.3%). Our work sheds light on the strategies for fabricating high-efficiency PeLEDs in the future.",

          "abstract": "Caribbean reefs have experienced major human-driven changes to their coral and fish communities 1–4 , yet how these changes have affected trophic dynamics remains poorly understood owing to challenges in reconstructing the trophic structure of pre-human-impact reefs. Advances in fossil-bound protein nitrogen isotope ( 15 N/ 14 N) analysis now enable the reconstruction of ancient trophic dynamics 5,6 , as the 15 N to  14 N ratio reflects an animal’s trophic position 7 . Here we apply this method to modern and prehistoric (7,000-year-old) fish otoliths (ear stones) and corals from Caribbean Panama and the Dominican Republic, focusing on fishes occupying low to middle trophic levels. We find that although the trophic level typically declined in high-trophic-level fishes over time, it increased or remained unchanged in low-trophic-level fishes, indicating that modern food chains are 60–70% shorter than on the prehistoric reefs in both Panama and the Dominican Republic. Furthermore, across all trophic groups, we observed a marked reduction in dietary variation, with a 20–70% lower trophic range on the modern reefs compared to the prehistoric reefs. This pattern is best explained by less dietary specialization in modern reefs, consistent with less ecological complexity than in prehistoric reefs. These differences document and quantify the trophic simplification that has occurred on modern Caribbean reefs, a change that may increase their vulnerability to ecosystem collapse.",

          "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the first relativistic quantum field theory, describes light–matter interactions at a fundamental level and is one of the pillars of the Standard Model (SM). Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits 1 , making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius r p , constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of r p from recent measurements 2–7 of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen 8,9 . This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S–6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of r p and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result ν 2S–6P = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of r p = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far.",

          "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets and have been targeted mainly through their orthosteric site, where the endogenous agonist binds1. However, allosteric modulation has emerged as a promising and innovative strategy in the realm of GPCR drug discovery1. Here, drawing inspiration from the natural regulation of GPCRs by transmembrane proteins, we have developed GPCR exoframe modulators (GEMs), de novo designed proteins that specifically target the transmembrane domain of GPCRs. Utilizing a hallucination-like design approach, we crafted GEMs with three strategic structural prompts to achieve the desired binding modes. We selected the dopamine D1 receptor as a prototypical model and systematically investigated four GEMs. Structural studies and functional assays revealed that these GEMs bind to the transmembrane domains and function as diverse allosteric modulators, including agonist-positive allosteric modulator, negative allosteric modulator and biased allosteric modulator. The ago-PAM GEM restores the activity of various D1 receptor loss-of-function mutants, suggesting a promising therapeutic target for GPCR-related disorders. Our work introduces GEMs that target the transmembrane domain as potent agents for allosteric GPCR modulation and highlights the potential of deep learning-based approaches in the design of function-oriented membrane proteins.",

          "abstract": "The spin supersolid—a magnetic analogue of the supersolid that simultaneously exhibits solid and superfluid orders—has emerged as a promising sub-Kelvin refrigerant with strong low-energy fluctuations and associated entropic effects1. However, the stringent prerequisites have so far confined its presence to certain magnetic insulators. Here we report the discovery of a metallic spin supersolid in a rare-earth compound EuCo2Al9 (ECA), which is a good metal with excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. The high-spin Eu2+ ions form a three-dimensional lattice with stacked triangular layers, in which the spin-supersolid state is stabilized through a mechanism involving both Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) and dipolar couplings. Neutron diffraction shows microscopic evidence of spin supersolidity, demonstrating the coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane spin orders in this alloy. Our RKKY–dipolar model successfully captures the metallic spin-supersolid Y and V phases in ECA, along with the 1/3 magnetization plateau. The observed nonclassical magnetization behaviours within these phases point to significant quantum fluctuations, probably enhanced by the conduction electrons. The resistivity measurements provide a transport probe for the spin-supersolid transitions, because of scattering of conduction electrons from local moments. Through the adiabatic demagnetization process, ECA achieves ultralow cooling to 106 mK, exhibiting a giant magnetocaloric effect that manifests sharp anomalies in the magnetic Grüneisen ratio. ECA emerges as one of the first metallic spin supersolids, combining low cooling temperature, large magnetic entropy and ultrahigh thermal conductivity for high-performance sub-Kelvin refrigeration.",

          "abstract": "Ancient DNA studies revealed that, in Europe from 6500 to 4000 bce, descendants of western Anatolian farmers mixed with local hunter-gatherers resulting in 70–100% ancestry turnover1, then steppe ancestry spread with the Corded Ware complex 3000–2500 bce2. Here we document an exception in the wetland, riverine and coastal areas of the Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, using genome-wide data from 112 people 8500–1700 bce. A distinctive population with high (approximately 50%) hunter-gatherer ancestry persisted 3,000 years later than in most European regions, reflecting incorporation of female individuals of Early European Farmer ancestry into local communities. In the western Netherlands, the arrival of the Corded Ware complex was also exceptional: lowland individuals from settlements adopting Corded Ware pottery had hardly any steppe ancestry, despite a Y-chromosome characteristic of people associated with the early Corded Ware complex. These distinctive patterns may reflect the specific ecology that they inhabited, which was not amenable to full adoption of the early Neolithic type of farming introduced with Linearbandkeramik3, and resulted in distinct communities where transfer of ideas was accompanied by little gene flow. This changed with the formation of Lower Rhine–Meuse Bell Beaker users by fusion of local people (13–18%) and Corded Ware associated migrants of both sexes. Their subsequent expansion then had a disruptive impact across a much wider part of northwestern Europe, especially in Great Britain where they were the main source of a 90–100% replacement of local Neolithic ancestry.",

These structures, which generically arise from the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom afforded by polyatomic molecules, are a powerful feature to pursue diverse quantum science applications7. Linear triatomic molecules contain ℓ-type parity-doublet states in the vibrational bending mode, which are predicted to exhibit robust coherence properties. Here we report optically trapped CaOH molecules prepared in ℓ-type parity-doublet states and realize a bare qubit coherence time of \\({T}_{2}^{* }=0.8(2)\\,{\\rm{s}}\\), which is longer than the 0.36 s lifetime of the bending mode10,11. We suppress differential Stark shifts by cancelling ambient electric fields using molecular spectroscopy and characterize parity-dependent trap shifts, which are found to limit the coherence time. The parity-doublet coherence times achieved in this work are a defining milestone for the use of polyatomic molecules in quantum science.",

Here we identify a sleep function for peripheral macrophage-like cells (haemocytes) in the Drosophila circulation, showing that haemocytes track to the brain during sleep and take up lipids accumulated in cortex glia due to wake-associated oxidative damage. Through a screen of phagocytic receptors expressed in haemocytes, we discovered that knockdown of eater —a member of the Nimrod receptor family—reduces sleep. Loss of eater also disrupts haemocyte localization to the brain and lipid uptake, which results in increased brain levels of acetyl-CoA and acetylated proteins, including mitochondrial proteins PGC1α and DRP1. Dysregulation of mitochondria, reflected in high oxidation and reduced NAD + , is accompanied by impaired memory and lifespan. Thus, peripheral blood cells, which we suggest are precursors of mammalian microglia, perform a daily function of sleep to maintain brain function and fitness.",

After initial lesion recognition by XPC in global genome repair or by stalled RNA polymerases in transcription-coupled repair, a lesion and surrounding DNA duplex are unwound by TFIIH, which includes the ATPases XPB and XPD, and additional NER factors XPA, XPF, XPG and RPA, to form a DNA bubble2 comprising around 27 nucleotides. The double strand–single strand (ds-ss) junction-specific endonucleases XPF and XPG cleave DNA on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the lesion, respectively. Here we report the functional steps and atomic structures of the ATPase-driven and lesion-dependent DNA bubble formation and arrangement of the complete NER factors for dual incision. The unwinding of nearly 30 base pairs of DNA depends mainly on the double strand DNA translocase XPB and the duplex dividers XPA and XPF. XPD binds the lesion strand with XPF at the 5′ ds-ss junction. XPF cuts the lesion strand only after XPG binds the 3′ ds-ss junction. The ERCC1 subunit of XPF facilitates DNA strand separation and recruitment of RPA to the non-lesion strand.

          "abstract": "Human experience intertwines continuity, the seamless flow of events, with segmentation, the spontaneous partitioning of experience into discrete units. Despite their cognitive significance, it is unclear whether these processes operate independently or share a common mechanism. Here we explored this question by examining the link between serial dependence (SD)—the tendency to align perceptions with prior decisions—and the impact of event boundaries, prompted by contextual shifts, on memory. Considering a Bayesian perspective that associates SD with predictions, and segmentation with prediction errors, a common mechanism may govern both processes. Across three experiments (N = 816), we tested how contextual changes affect SD and segmentation-related memory effects. The results indicate that both processes are context-sensitive. Contextual boundaries can reduce SD even in the absence of sensory change, and boundaries modulate memory in ways consistent with event segmentation. Yet, across experiments we observed dissociable patterns of boundary effects on SD and memory, which are slightly more consistent with distinct contextual influences on perception and memory than with a single unified predictive system. Boundary effects on SD and memory did not covary across participants, but given the low within-participant reliability of these measures, this absence of correlation cannot be taken as strong evidence for independence. Overall, our findings show that both SD and memory are shaped by context, but clarifying whether they reflect a shared or partly distinct mechanism will require further research.",

          "abstract": "Abdominal ultrasound has emerged as a noninvasive modality with immunomodulatory potential. Although its anti-inflammatory effects have been demonstrated in various disease models, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies suggest that ultrasound promotes anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) signaling in the spleen. However, the upstream events initiating this response have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that abdominal ultrasound activates afferent vagal fibers and suppress systemic inflammation. In a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia, abdominal ultrasound significantly reduced plasma TNF-α levels. This anti-inflammatory effect was attenuated by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDVx) or afferent vagal blockade. Electrophysiological recordings revealed increased cervical vagus nerve activity during ultrasound stimulation, which was eliminated by intraperitoneal lidocaine, confirming activation of abdominal sensory afferents. Furthermore, abdominal ultrasound induced c-Fos expression in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), consistent with central activation via vagal afferent input. These findings provide direct mechanistic evidence that abdominal ultrasound stimulates afferent vagal pathways.",

          "abstract": "Plasma membrane (PM) phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P 2 ] regulates indispensable processes such as exocytosis, endocytosis, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in eukaryotic cells. Since phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] has long been regarded as the primary precursor of PI(4,5)P 2 , perturbing PM PI(4)P is expected to impact the dynamics of PM PI(4,5)P 2 . Yet, recent evidence suggests that PM PI(4)P has a limited role in the synthesis and function of PI(4,5)P 2 . In this paper, we address this puzzling discrepancy by studying the collective dynamics of PM PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P 2 . Leveraging live-cell imaging, we observed periodic traveling waves of PI(4)P on the PM of mast cells, challenging the notion that this precursor lipid is spatially homogeneous at the PM. We then found that a reduction in PM PI(4)P synthesis rate attenuated PI(4,5)P 2 oscillation amplitude while conserving the total PM density of PI(4,5)P 2 . We assessed the functional consequences of PI(4,5)P 2 oscillation amplitude by examining its interplay with Rho GTPase Cdc42, which cooperatively regulates the filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton with PI(4,5)P 2 . We showed that both PM PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P 2 oscillations are coupled to oscillations of membrane-bound active Cdc42. Finally, we demonstrated that lowering PM PI(4)P synthesis rate alone was sufficient to reversibly quench Cdc42 oscillations and to suppress F-actin oscillations. These results suggest that, beyond the steady-state regime, oscillations of PI(4,5)P 2 and its effector proteins require a critical threshold of PI(4)P flux.",

          "abstract": "In natural environments, bacteria often encounter low concentrations of nutrient mixtures that are continuously replenished by physical processes such as fluid flow. Studying bacterial physiology under such conditions is experimentally challenging because it is difficult to maintain steady, low nutrient concentrations with rapid renewal. Most studies on nutrient limitation have used approaches such as the chemostat, which rely on long renewal times to sustain low concentrations. We developed a Millifluidic Continuous Culture Device (MCCD), inspired by microfluidics, that enables bacterial cultivation in nutrient mixtures at low micromolar concentrations with rapid renewal driven by fluid flow. Unlike microfluidic systems, the MCCD retains sufficient culture volume to support batch-scale ‘omic analyses. Using the MCCD, we cultured Escherichia coli in a mixture of amino acids and nucleobases at three concentration ranges spanning a fivefold difference in growth rates. Surprisingly, at the lowest concentration range, cells exhibited proteomic signatures of iron limitation despite equal total ferrous iron across conditions. Uptake experiments with labeled iron–histidine and iron–cysteine complexes confirmed that amino acids facilitated ferrous iron acquisition. Under continuous flow, siderophores were washed out, rendering this pathway ineffective and revealing a previously unrecognized mechanism of iron acquisition via soluble ferrous iron–amino acid complexes. These findings highlight the importance of studying bacterial physiology at low nutrient concentrations and also suggest a broader role for other organic substrates capable of complexing iron as potential iron sources in environments with rapid renewal.",

          "authors": "Christopher J. Pierce, Tianyu Wang, Dmitri Kalinin, Andrew Zangwill, Daniel I. Goldman",
          "abstract": "The transport of deformable self-propelling objects like bacteria, worms, snakes, and robots through heterogeneous environments is poorly understood. Here we use experiment, simulation, and theory to study a snake-like robot as it undulates without sensory feedback through a linear array of boulder-like hemispherical obstacles. The profile of the boulder landscape approximates a one-dimensional potential for quantum waves introduced by Aubry and André (AA), who found that wave function localization occurs when this potential is sufficiently aperiodic. This behavior is related to the phenomenon of Anderson localization, where waves localize in the presence of a sufficiently random potential. When the boulder landscape is periodic, the robot passes through the array. But if the landscape is sufficiently aperiodic, the robot becomes trapped. The metrics we use to quantify this transition—including exponential distributions of robot position when localized—agree well with earlier experimental and theoretical work on a localization transition that occurs when quantum waves interact with the AA potential. A theoretical treatment of the robot’s motion using resistive force theory modified to include spatially varying drag forces reproduces the behavior we observe. Further, our results indicate that the transition is generated by large fluctuations in the driving torques required for self-propulsion. These results point to an unexpected connection between the Hamiltonian mechanics of quantum and classical wave systems and the highly dissipative, continuously driven, and far-from-equilibrium dynamics of active embodied waves in nonperiodic landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Lateralization of neuronal functions plays a critical role in regulating behavioral flexibility, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are challenging to establish at a single-neuron level. We previously showed that attraction of Caenorhabditis elegans to a medium-chain alcohol switches to avoidance in a uniform background of a second attractive odorant. This context-dependent behavioral plasticity is mediated by symmetric inversion of the odor-evoked response sign in the bilateral AWC olfactory neurons. Here, we show that this symmetric response plasticity is driven by asymmetric molecular mechanisms in the AWC neuron pair. Mutations in the gcy-12 receptor guanylyl cyclase abolish odor response plasticity only in AWC OFF ; the opposite odor-evoked response signs in AWC OFF and AWC ON in gcy-12 mutants result in these animals being behaviorally indifferent to this chemical. We find that gcy-12 is expressed, and required, in both AWC neurons to regulate odor response plasticity only in AWC OFF . We further show that disruption of AWC fate lateralization results in loss of asymmetry in the response plasticity in gcy-12 mutants. Our results indicate that symmetric neuronal response plasticity can arise from asymmetric underlying molecular mechanisms and suggest that lateralization of signaling pathways in defined conditions may enhance neuronal and behavioral flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Dissipation in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with elastic or electric fields. Materials with low mechanical or dielectric loss are urgently needed for applications in gravitational wave detection, high precision sensors, and quantum computing. Using atomistic modeling of amorphous silicon and titanium dioxide, we find that their energy landscape is better represented by a connected network of inherent structures than a collection of isolated TLS. Each connection is a single energy barrier between two minima, and a network is connected if all states (minima) can be reached from any given state. Motivated by this observation, we develop an analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We demonstrate that the connectivity of the network introduces new mechanisms that can both reduce low frequency dissipation through additional low energy relaxation pathways, and increase dissipation through a broad distribution of energy minima. As a result, the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct frequency profiles compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials.",

          "abstract": "Even though in vivo rodent studies have been instrumental in investigating sex-specific differences in cardiac health, function, and pathology, they fall short in providing a fast and flexible platform for investigating sex differences of cardiac anisotropic monolayer in isolation. In vitro platforms offer an accessible and more controlled alternative to dissect and study the mechanisms by which male and female cardiac tissue sheets differ from one another. Here, we have shown on an in vitro heart-on-a-chip platform, primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes can serve as a viable model showing sex chromosome-driven characteristics when presented with identical experimental conditions. With controlled experimental conditions, the self-assembly of isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in morphological differences in the structure of the contractile apparatus. More importantly, the assembly of cardiac cells into confluent monolayers had a sex chromosome-driven divergence in both structure and the corresponding function. This work reports the characterization of the difference between sex-specific neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in in vitro culture. Thus, this offers an avenue to investigate sex-based variations in cardiac function that are otherwise difficult to study.",

However, clinical translation is limited by poor cell survival and engraftment in a hostile injury microenvironment, where detachment-induced anoikis and insufficient extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion compromise their therapeutic efficacy. Here, we engineered MSCs with surface-anchored von Willebrand factor A3 domain (vWF A3), a natural collagen-binding domain with exceptional affinity for type I and III collagen, to simultaneously confer collagen-targeting and prosurvival functionalities. The vWF A3-modified MSCs (vWF A3-MSCs) exhibited enhanced collagen-binding capacity, improving retention in myocardial infarction (MI) and osteoarthritis (OA) lesions. Beyond adhesion, vWF A3-MSCs demonstrated improved reparative capacity and anoikis resistance, driven by the activation of ECM–receptor interaction and integrin β3 signaling. These modifications promoted proangiogenic effects via mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation while enhancing cell survival through Hippo pathway suppression. In vivo studies confirmed the superior therapeutic efficacy of vWF A3-MSCs in both MI and OA models, highlighting how the artificially constructed collagen-targeting receptors on cell and ECM-adhesion-targeted strategy reprogram cellular fate and enhance therapeutic efficacy in stem cell–based regenerative medicine.",

Loss of PTEN causes hyperactivation of both mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Recent studies have shown that this dual hyperactivation is required for the neuropathology observed in PTEN -deficient human stem cell–derived neural cells. However, the molecular effectors that integrate these synergistic signals remain unknown. Here, we identify the actin-regulating ARP2/3 complex as a critical point of convergence downstream of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We show that concurrent hyperactivation of both complexes drives increased filamentous actin and elevated levels of the ARP2/3 complex subunits in PTEN -deficient human neural precursors (NPs) and neurons. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ARP2/3 is sufficient to rescue multiple disease-relevant phenotypes, including NP hyperproliferation, neuronal hypertrophy, and electrical hyperactivity, without affecting the upstream mTORC1 or mTORC2 hyperactivation. Together, these findings reveal the PTEN –mTOR–ARP2/3 signaling axis as a core mechanism of neuropathology and highlight ARP2/3 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for PTEN -related neurodevelopmental disorders.",

          "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that shares clinical features with multiple sclerosis (MS) but typically manifests with more severe symptoms. The presence of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies targeting aquaporin-4 (AQP4) channels on astrocytes serves as a highly specific biomarker that distinguishes NMOSD from MS. Unlike MS, NMOSD is characterized by profound astrocytic destruction and exhibits a distinct response to therapies. Notably, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) effective in MS, including natalizumab, interferon-β, and fingolimod, not only fail to benefit NMOSD patients but may also exacerbate disease progression. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying this immunomodulator-induced exacerbation, however, remain not yet fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that natalizumab alleviated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) while exacerbating the autoimmune astrocytopathy in an “EAE-NMOSD” mouse model, a phenomenon associated with a reduction in actively proliferating astrocytes. Through molecular and signaling pathway analyses, we identify that endothelial-derived vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) activates astrocytes via integrin α4 signaling, thereby mitigating astrocytopathy in NMOSD-like mice. Furthermore, astrocyte-specific integrin α4 deficiency exacerbates astrocytopathy, and notably, natalizumab-induced disease exacerbation does not occur in integrin α4-conditional knockout (CKO) mice. Finally, pharmacological activation of astrocytes rescues natalizumab-induced damage and ameliorates demyelination in NMOSD-like mice. Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic gaps regarding the clinical phenomenon underlying natalizumab-induced NMOSD exacerbation and suggest astrocyte-targeted therapeutic strategies as a potential intervention for NMOSD.",

          "abstract": "Climate forecasts project rising temperatures for every land surface on Earth. Predicting the consequences of climate warming poses a challenge for science and society. Shifts in plant–microbial interactions can lead to significant changes in ecosystem-level functioning. In one of the world’s longest climate change experiments, we studied the effects of 29 y of warming on a native subalpine grassland in the Rocky Mountains of North America. Warming caused a transition from herbaceous to woody-dominated vegetation, with shrubs increasing by 150% in warmed plots and a concurrent ~28% decrease in both forbs and grasses. This shift was accompanied by functional traits changing by 20% toward more conservative values relative to acquisitive ones. Consequently, plant–symbiont associations decreased with root-associated fungi—arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal and septate root colonization—both declining by 17 to 20% under warming. In turn, soil saprotrophic fungi increased by 10% with warming. Strikingly, warming decoupled above- and belowground communities and their functions. This decoupling was evident as plant–available phosphorus increased and both individual plants and plant communities reduced their reliance on mycorrhizal fungi, while plant connectedness to decomposer fungi tightened. Our results suggest that, as the planet warms, subalpine grasslands will become more conservative and desert shrubland-like in both above- and belowground properties.",

We show that foliar dewdrops act as biochemical microreactors that trigger flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana , a small plant from the mustard family ( Brassicaceae ). These droplets generate reactive oxygen species that induce intracellular nitric oxide accumulation, initiating a redox cascade that suppresses the biosynthesis of abscisic acid, which contributes to the regulation of flowering time. This occurs via S-nitrosylation-mediated activation of histone deacetylase 19, which silences AAO3 and ABA2 . Analysis of over 12 million field records across the Brassicaceae family reveals a global correlation between dew point temperature and flowering time.

Biomolecular sequence combinatorics leads to a large variety of proteins and nucleic acids which can interact to form a diversity of dense liquid (“condensate”) phases. The relationship between sequence design and the diversity of the resultant phases is therefore of interest. Here, we explore this question using the DNA nanostar system which permits the creation of multiphase condensate droplets through sequence engineering of the sticky end bonds that drive particle–particle attraction. We explore the theoretical limits of nanostar phase diversity, then experimentally demonstrate the ability to create nine distinct, nonadhering nanostar phases that do not share components. We further study how different thermal histories affect the morphology and dynamics of such a highly diverse condensate system. We particularly show that a rapid temperature quench leads to the formation of a densely packed 2-D layer of droplets that is transiently stabilized by caging effects enabled by the phase diversity, leading to glassy dynamics such as slow coarsening and dynamic heterogeneity. Generally, our work provides experimental insight into the thermodynamics of phase separation of complex mixtures and demonstrates the rational engineering of complex, long-range, multiphase droplet structures.",

Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these spaces is relevant for coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure for dense populations. Here, we use simulations, theory, and experiments to study how adding stochasticity to agent motion can reduce traffic jams and help agents travel more quickly to prescribed goals. A computational approach reveals the collective behavior. Above a critical noise level, large jams do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the swarm’s goal attainment rate, which allows us to solve for the agent density and noise level that maximize the goals reached. Robotic experiments corroborate the behaviors observed in our simulated and theoretical results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally efficient than a planner, motivating further research into robust, decentralized navigation methods for crowded environments. By integrating ideas from physics and engineering using simulations, theory, and experiments, our work identifies new directions for emergent traffic research.",

In Caenorhabditis elegans , favorable conditions promote dispersal, while stressors like food scarcity trigger aggregation. Here, we describe a distinct self-organized swarming behavior, where C. elegans move and feed in groups driven by uncontrolled local increases in population density despite abundant food availability. While various environmental factors have been implicated in collective behaviors in C. elegans , the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a key role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors. This dysregulation, along with its associated mechanosensory and foraging defects, likely contributes to the swarming phenotype.

          "abstract": "Pathological progression in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (sAD) initiates with an early rise in soluble amyloid-β (Aβ), preceding plaque formation and neurodegeneration. However, the molecular event triggering this initial accumulation remains unknown. We report that phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), a consistent biomarker of prodromal sAD, drives Aβ production through a previously unrecognized RNA-binding function. Specifically, PHGDH binds the 3′UTR of EIF2AK1 mRNA, enabling the physical interaction between PHGDH and the EIF2AK1 protein. By facilitating the recruitment of EIF2AK1 to its substrate EIF2α, this complex drives EIF2α phosphorylation, thereby selectively promoting the translation of BACE1, the rate-limiting enzyme for Aβ generation. We demonstrate that PHGDH overexpression elevates BACE1 protein and intracellular Aβ in neurons and astrocytes across mouse models and human brain organoids, independent of its canonical enzymatic or transcriptional roles. Mechanistically, this process requires a specific RNA-binding surface within PHGDH and the EIF2AK1 3′UTR. These findings define a PHGDH–EIF2AK1–EIF2α–BACE1 axis as a key driver of the earliest amyloid pathology in sAD.",

          "abstract": "The presence of high levels of PM 2.5 pollution is a major health threat in India. We evaluate the benefits of reducing ambient PM 2.5 and household air pollution from a 2019 baseline, when over 70% of the population of India was exposed to annual average PM 2.5 of more than 40 μg/m 3 and 56% of households burned solid fuels for cooking. We estimate the health benefits from reduced mortality that arise when lowering ambient PM 2.5 to the India standard (40 μg/m 3 ) and to two World Health Organization (WHO) interim standards (25 μg/m 3 and 15 μg/m 3 ). The benefits of the ambient standards are moderated by the high levels of household air pollution to which people are exposed due to the concavity of the exposure–response function. We therefore examine the benefits of achieving each standard paired with a 50% reduction in the percentage of households burning solid fuels. Annual mortality reductions from the combined policies exceed 300,000 lives saved for the India standard, 500,000 lives saved for the WHO 25 μg/m 3 interim standard, and 675,000 lives saved for the WHO 15 μg/m 3 interim standard. The economic benefits of each of these joint policies equal 2.2%, 3.6%, and 4.9% of Indian gross domestic product (GDP), using a Value per Statistical Life of 100 times per capita GDP. Results underscore the importance of considering household air pollution when evaluating ambient standards and the synergistic benefits of combined policies when the exposure–response function is concave.",

          "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism. One common physical feature of FXS is macrocephaly, a condition typically associated with brain overgrowth and dysfunction; however, the mechanisms underlying its occurrence are unclear. Here, we uncover a role for the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) in regulating tissue growth through the Minibrain (Mnb) kinase, also known as DYRK1A, a gene up-regulated in Down syndrome and mutated in a specific form of autism. Using fly models of FXS, we find that Drosophila FMRP (dFmrp) suppresses the translation of Mnb. Loss of dFmrp leads to the up-regulation of Mnb in the developing brain, resulting in macrocephaly and brain enlargement. We find that brain overgrowth begins early in development and can be suppressed with DYRK1A inhibitors. At the cellular level, the Mnb/DYRK1A signaling pathway drives brain enlargement by inducing both neuronal hypertrophy and excessive proliferation of neural progenitors. We further demonstrate that Mnb up-regulates protein synthesis, and reducing Mnb activity or disrupting essential translational machinery restores brain size and improves locomotor coordination in the Drosophila FXS model. These data suggest that dysregulation of the Mnb/DYRK1A signaling pathway contributes to brain overgrowth and aberrant protein synthesis in FXS. More broadly, our findings highlight that neurodevelopmental disorders such as FXS, Down syndrome, and autism share disruptions in common molecular pathways.",

This pipeline called Pichia–Codon language model (Pichia-CLM) was applied to the industrial host organism, Komagataella phaffii. With this approach, production of heterologous proteins was enhanced up to threefold compared to their native sequences. Furthermore, Pichia-CLM consistently yielded constructs with enhanced productivity for proteins of varied complexity, compared to commercially available tools. Finally, we showed that Pichia-CLM generates sequences resembling the properties of codon usage found in the host’s intrinsic host cell proteins and learned features such as avoiding negative cis-regulatory and repeat elements based on patterns in the genome data. These results show the potential of language models to unbiasedly learn patterns and design robust sequences for improved protein production.",

          "abstract": "Insect sociality is a major evolutionary transition based on the suppression of worker reproduction in favor of a queen’s reproductive monopoly. Although sophisticated insect societies have arisen independently on multiple occasions in the Hymenoptera (bees, ants, and wasps), how worker sterility evolved through natural selection is not fully understood. In honey bees ( Apis mellifera ), dietary cues (royal or worker jelly) and social chemical signals (e.g., queen pheromones) promote caste differentiation by modulating the levels of juvenile hormone (JH), the key physiological orchestrator of caste determination in larvae and the maintenance of caste identity in adults. However, the precise molecular effects of JH on the ovaries of larvae and adult bees remain open questions. Here, we describe lncov1 , a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), whose expression correlates with sterility in the ovaries of larvae and adult honey bees. Mechanistically, the low JH levels in worker larvae promote high lncov1 expression in their ovaries, which subsequently show extensive programmed cell death. Moreover, lncov1 expression is tightly connected to a reduction in the reproductive capacity of adult queens and workers, as this lncRNA responds to key environmental cues that regulate fertility, including royal jelly and queen pheromone. The sequence conservation of the lncov1 gene across eusocial bees, especially the genus Apis , suggests the evolutionary stability of the JH/ lncov1 pathway. Therefore, by revealing how nutritional and social cues acting through JH and lncov1 shape queen and worker fertility in honey bees, these findings position lncRNAs as key components in the evolution of social complexity in insects.",

Given its physiological importance, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms of γ1 action. However, structural and functional studies have yielded conflicting conclusions regarding the modulation of BK channels by γ1. Here, using macroscopic, single-channel, and gating-current measurements, we demonstrate that at zero mV, γ1 increases 106-fold the equilibrium constant for the closed–open transition by destabilizing the channel’s closed state and enhancing coupling between the voltage sensor and the pore domain, without affecting voltage-sensor activation. These results suggest that γ1 not only increases the energetic coupling between the voltage sensors and the pore but also primarily enhances the channel-opening reaction.",

          "abstract": "The expansion of commodity agriculture into tropical forests leads to major social–ecological impacts. Yet little is known about where and how the capitalized actors driving this expansion interact with smallholders, particularly where smallholders live inside the forest. Two alternative outcomes of their interactions on deforestation are plausible: accelerated deforestation as all actors compete for land (i.e., land rush hypothesis) or, alternatively, slower deforestation as actors hinder each other’s expansion (i.e., competition hypothesis). We test these hypotheses for two global deforestation hotspots: the Dry Chaco and the Chiquitano Forests (together nearly 1 million km 2 ), using a land-systems representation that captures spatially overlapping land-use actors. We integrate satellite-based forest-loss time series with an independent reconstruction of land-system change from 2000 to 2023 in a Bayesian regression framework. This reveals three key findings: First, capitalized agriculture has expanded mainly over areas used by forest-dependent smallholders and Indigenous communities, indicating strongly intensifying land competition. Second, where forest-dwelling smallholders persist, their presence can mitigate deforestation pressure from expanding commodity frontiers. Third, the presence of either forest-dwelling smallholders or conservation areas maintains forest cover, but their combined presence does not amplify the protection effect. Overall, our findings show that interactions between agribusinesses and smallholders are key factors that shape the social–ecological outcomes of frontier expansion in the tropics. Accounting for land-system overlaps in research and policymaking on frontiers can therefore improve efforts to safeguard forests while supporting traditional livelihoods, especially in contested, rapidly changing landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Animals must balance behavioral goals with the energetic costs of movement. How such trade-offs are implemented algorithmically during natural behavior, and how they adapt to changing energetic constraints, remains poorly understood. Here we show that larval zebrafish adjust their motor strategies during prey hunting to minimize energy expenditure. Using high-speed video tracking and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we quantified the energy costs (in Joules) of different movement types across three developmental stages. While the structure of discrete movement types (“bouts”) remained stable with age, their selection probabilities changed depending on their energetic cost, such that more expensive bouts were always used less frequently. This relationship was conserved across development despite shifts in the relative costs of different bouts. A reinforcement learning model trained to catch prey while minimizing energy use reproduced this relationship, demonstrating that it is an energetically optimal strategy. Furthermore, when fish were reared in a high-viscosity environment that altered energetic costs, they readapted their movement probabilities to preserve the same energy-based control rule, demonstrating active optimization rather than a predetermined developmental program. These findings reveal how goal-directed animals can dynamically regulate movement selection to minimize energetic costs, even under changing environmental and biomechanical conditions. Our results provide a quantitative link between biomechanics, development, behavior, and computational control theory in a freely moving animal.",

In Brazil, improving dengue forecasting became a priority in response to the unprecedented increase in cases, which surpassed the total of the previous decade and expanded to new regions. The Infodengue-Mosqlimate consortium launched the Infodengue-Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge 2024 (IMDC24), or Dengue Forecast Sprint, bringing together six international teams provided with cases and climate covariates data to generate actionable forecasts for 2024 and 2025 seasons in five diverse Brazilian states, leveraging advanced machine learning and classical statistical models. This paper outlines the structure and findings of the IMDC24. The performance of the models varied between years and locations, and no single model consistently excelled, especially during 2024’s unprecedentedly large season. This performance variability highlighted the need for ensemble approaches. The ensemble models developed are presented as the main results of this collaborative development. As intended, the ensemble models have been adopted by Brazilian public health authorities to help with planning and response to the forecasted 2025 dengue epidemics across the country.",

Daily time series of CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes from 2000 to 2024 integrated surface properties related to vegetation productivity, flooding, and disturbance, and captured 80% and 91% of the variability in annual fluxes of CO 2 and CH 4 , respectively. Long-term (23-y) patterns in the fluxes of CH 4 , CO 2 , and their CO 2 -equivalent (CO 2 eq) are represented as Global Warming Potential 100 (GWP100) and were shown to vary spatially with wetland management, revealing higher carbon uptake in mangroves susceptible to hurricane damage and coastal hydrology, and greater carbon emissions in freshwater sawgrass marshes where freshwater hydrology is managed for restoration. Regional net annual CO 2 eq uptake in coastal and freshwater wetlands increased by 18% from −7.0 ± 3.3 MMT CO 2 eq y −1 in ~2003 to −8.4 ± 3.8 MMT CO 2 eq y −1 in ~2020 at an uptake rate of −0.06 ± 0.01 MMT CO 2 eq y −2 . Annually, roughly 43% of CO 2 uptake was offset by CH 4 emissions from all wetlands in the region (from 16% in mangroves to 82% in freshwater marshes).",

          "abstract": "Advances in global satellite-based remote sensing, big data, and machine learning are making large-scale geographic analysis increasingly accessible. Archaeology can benefit from multitemporal and multisensor satellite data even when direct archaeological site and feature detection is not possible by using these data to examine relationships between archaeological, ecological, and climactic variables across vast geographies. With this, archaeologists can ask questions about diverse landscape matrices and how these shaped the flow of past cultural processes. We demonstrate the value of thermal sensor data—common in satellite arrays—by developing an automated routine for analyzing Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor time series data. We fit a harmonic regression to extract amplitude and phase shift values for thousands of inland lakes in Michigan’s lower peninsula and computed perimeter-to-area ratios. Treating these thermal data not as absolute equivalents to past conditions but as relative indices, we compared lakes with and without Late Precontact (ca. 1200–1600 CE) burial mounds. Results show lakes with mounds warmed later in the spring, cooled later in the fall, and were more regularly shaped, suggesting Late Precontact communities placed mounds on lakes with specific resource benefits, including extended growing seasons. Considering our findings alongside emerging evidence for widespread precontact Indigenous agriculture in the Great Lakes region, it is important to reconsider maize’s subsistence and ceremonial significance. The analytic workflow—leveraging free, global Landsat data in Google Earth Engine—offers a replicable framework for archaeologists worldwide to integrate relative thermal patterns into cultural landscape studies.",

In neurons, GSK-3β coordinates the cytoskeleton by phosphorylating microtubule-binding proteins. In this study, we found that tight regulation of GSK-3β kinase activity is required for the maintenance of parallel microtubule bundles in Drosophila and rat axons. Up- or downregulation of GSK-3β led to axons forming pathological swellings in which microtubule bundles disintegrated into disorganized, curled microtubules. We identified the microtubule bundling proteins Shot and Tau as key GSK-3β targets and found that GSK-3β exerted its regulatory effect on microtubule bundling through them. GSK-3β regulates the ability of Shot and Tau to attach to microtubules and/or Eb1. Misregulation of GSK-3β leads to the loss of Eb1–Shot-mediated guidance of polymerizing microtubules into parallel bundles, thus causing disorganization. We propose that microtubule disorganization during both active and inactive states of GSK-3β links its hyperactivity to neurodegeneration and may explain why global GSK-3β inhibition has failed in clinical trials.",

          "abstract": "Turbulence, left unforced, evolves under its own dynamics, invading surrounding quiescent fluid as it decays. A ubiquitous and familiar phenomenon, this fundamental aspect of turbulence has resisted the marriage of principled theory and experiment with no universal law yet capturing its evolution. Conventional flow chamber experiments have been hampered by boundary effects or strong mean flows that obscure the intrinsic dynamics of relaxation to quiescence. To circumvent these limitations, we create a spatially localized blob of turbulence using eight converging vortex generators focused at the center of a water tank, and observe its decay and expansion over decades in time using particle image velocimetry with logarithmic time sampling. The blob initially expands and decays until it reaches the walls of the tank and eventually transitions to a second regime of approximately spatially uniform decay. We interpret the turbulent dynamics as an interplay of nonlinear diffusion with associated steep fronts separating the turbulent and quiescent regions, and nonlinear decay, as described by the Kolmogorov–Barenblatt equation. We find direct evidence for this model within the expansion phase and decay phases of our turbulent blob and use it to account for the detailed behavior we observe. Our work provides a detailed spatially resolved narrative for the behavior of turbulence once the forcing is removed, and demonstrates unexpectedly that the turbulent cascade leaves an indelible footprint far into the decay process.",

Analyses of kidney graft biopsies identified calcium signaling pathways and mTOR as a key regulator of MS-induced NK cell activation. Two experimental models were developed to mimic the pathological condition: in vitro cocultures of human NK cells with allogeneic microvascular endothelial cells and a murine heart transplantation model. These models showed that while calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) alone had a limited impact, combining CNI with mTOR inhibitors (mTORinh) synergistically reduced NK cell activation and endothelial damage. In a pilot clinical study involving 50 renal transplant recipients with MS-associated NK cell–mediated microvascular inflammation, patients who tolerated mTORinh introduced on top of CNI at diagnosis demonstrated reduced MVI lesions and improved graft survival compared to a historical cohort left on CNI and mycophenolate mofetil.

This relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing and no more. Here, we develop an axiomatization of quantum computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimization, including brute force computer search, to optimize quantum computations. The free model may be interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model, but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning.",

          "authors": "Stephen Chrisomalis",
          "abstract": "More than 100 historically, archaeologically and ethnographically attested numerical notations have been used over the past 5,000 y; however, because most of those systems are no longer used, experimental investigation is challenging. Prior research often assumes, rather than demonstrates, the inferiority of notations like Roman numerals. Gradience is a principle whereby the length of numeral phrases correlates with the magnitude of the numbers being represented. In general, but inconsistently, larger numbers require more signs, just as larger sets of abstract dot patterns occupy more space. This study compares the gradience of 13 numerical notations varying in phylogenetic family, linguistic family, and structural properties, using two indices, inversion (how often N + 1 requires fewer signs than N) and jitter (the mean length difference between successive numbers). Place value systems are highly gradient; i.e., their length indexes numerical magnitude more accurately than other systems. The relationship between the structural properties of notations and the two indices of jitter and inversion is complex. Next, a cultural-evolutionary analysis compares the older additive Roman numerals to the eventually predominant subtractive variant (e.g., XIX = 19). Subtractive Roman numerals are more concise and have a lower jitter than additive ones, but at the cost of a significantly higher inversion ratio. This analysis permits the evaluation of cultural-evolutionary hypotheses grounded in the representational properties of attested notations, even when cognitive tests are not feasible. Several avenues for future experimental investigation using attested or constructed notations of varying properties are proposed.",

Here, we report a universal strategy to dope electrolytes such that the ion transport can be unipolar by incorporating electroactive polymers within hydrogels that interact discriminately with one type of ion via redox and binding mechanisms, leaving the counterions mobile. This transforms the system into an active, selective conductor that directs ion flow with high precision. We demonstrate the generality of this strategy using a wide range of electroactive polymers and ions. Particularly, we use emeraldine base and leucoemeraldine base, derived from polyaniline to create both n-type and p-type conductors with high ion selectivity.

We report a spontaneous canine dysmyelinating leukodystrophy in English Cocker Spaniel puppies. The most severely affected male pup displayed pronounced generalized tremors, progressive motor dysfunction, and markedly impaired growth. Histopathology at 5 wk of age revealed profound central nervous system (CNS) dysmyelination with no evidence of peripheral nerve involvement. Western blotting confirmed markedly reduced expression of CNS myelin-associated proteins. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated a near absence of compact myelin, rare myelinated axons, and significant oligodendrocyte abnormalities, the majority of which had an immature cellular morphology. More mature, yet infrequent oligodendrocytes had distended rough endoplasmic reticula. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified a hemizygous c.92T&gt;A missense variant in the PLP1 gene predicted to cause a leucine-to-glutamine substitution in the first transmembrane domain, p.(L31Q). This variant was absent in over 1,600 public canine genomes and was predicted to be deleterious by multiple bioinformatic tools. Heterozygous females exhibited variable, transient clinical signs. We compared this canine leukodystrophy with the previously reported shaking pup and found that it represents a more severe phenotype recapitulating key clinical, pathological, and molecular features of severe connatal PMD in humans, including extreme CNS dysmyelination and associated neurological deficits. Interestingly, this genetic variant seems to cause a defect at the oligodendrocyte progenitor stage limiting subsequent oligodendrocyte maturation and preventing myelination. The identification of this naturally occurring model provides a potential resource for investigating the mechanisms and therapeutic targets for specific PLP1 genetic variants.",

Tregs progressively accumulated in diseased livers, adopting an activated, nonlymphoid-tissue phenotype marked by expression of the transcription factor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) as well as a reparative transcriptional program. Punctual ablation of Tregs during established MASH unleashed a catastrophic inflammatory cascade, including exaggerated T-helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 responses, expansion of a pathogenic CD8 + T cell population, and hepatocellular injury.

Yet, few studies have examined the processes shaping the evolution of the LES within species, in part, because most species occupy only a small portion of the LES. To address this gap, we took advantage of the distinct leaf economics strategies present in different ecotypes of the phenotypically diverse perennial grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) to generate a genetic mapping population, which we planted in common gardens at three sites spanning 12 degrees of latitude in the central United States. With this genetic mapping population, we evaluated two potentially interacting causes of LES evolution: 1) genetic architecture, where multiple traits are influenced by either the same gene (pleiotropy) or by genes in close physical proximity (genetic linkage), and 2) correlational selection, where selection acts on traits in combination rather than in isolation. We found that shared genetic architecture influenced covariation between photosynthetic rate ( A MASS ) and leaf nitrogen ( N MASS ) and between A MASS and leaf mass per area (LMA). We also found that correlational selection favored the trait combinations predicted by the LES (e.g., high LMA with low N MASS or low LMA with high N MASS ) and disfavored other, mismatched trait combinations at two of the three sites. Together, these results demonstrate how the evolution of an integrated LES within species can arise from multiple evolutionary causes.",

          "abstract": "In the central region of the human retina, the high-acuity foveola is notable for its dense packing of green (M) and red (L) cones and absence of blue (S) cones. To identify mechanisms that pattern cones in the foveola, we examined human fetal retinas and differentiated retinal organoids. During development, sparse S-opsin-expressing cones are initially observed in the foveola. Later in fetal development, the foveola contains a mix of cones that either coexpress S- and M/L-opsins or exclusively express M/L-opsin. In adults, only M/L cones are present. Two signaling pathway regulators are highly and continuously expressed in the central retina: Cytochrome P450 26 subfamily A member 1 (CYP26A1), which degrades retinoic acid (RA) and Deiodinase 2 (DIO2), which promotes thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. Both CYP26A1 mutant organoids and high RA conditions increased the number of S cones and reduced the number of M/L cones in retinal organoids. In contrast, sustained TH signaling promoted the generation of M/L-opsin-expressing cones and induced M/L-opsin expression in S-opsin-expressing cones, showing that cone fate is plastic. Our data suggest that CYP26A1 degrades RA to specify M/L cones and limit S cones and that continuous DIO2 expression sustains high levels of TH to transition S-opsin-expressing cones into M/L cone fate, resulting in the foveola containing only M/L cones. Given the vulnerability of the foveola in macular degeneration and other retinal disorders, these findings provide a mechanistic framework for engineering organoids for therapeutic applications.",

          "abstract": "Pluralistic ignorance—the systematic misperception of others’ attitudes—can entrench suboptimal norms, yet its dynamics remain poorly understood. We develop a mathematical model of the coevolution of actions, private attitudes, and beliefs about others, with societal tightness as a central parameter. Our framework integrates theories of spirals of silence, preference falsification, and cultural mismatch into a single dynamic system capturing the effects of material payoffs, cognitive forces, and social influence. The model shows that pluralistic ignorance can arise from lags between attitude change and belief updating, even without silence or deception. Dynamics unfold faster in loose cultures and slower in tight ones: loose societies display sharp but transient peaks of pluralistic ignorance, while tight societies sustain slower, persistent mismatches. Both can experience cultural evolutionary mismatch but through distinct pathways—internalized norm adherence in loose cultures vs. conformity pressure in tight ones. These mechanisms may help explain global patterns where private support exceeds perceived support, such as climate action, women’s rights, and abortion attitudes. Interventions must therefore be culturally tailored: accelerating attitude change through highlighting benefits is effective in loose cultures, whereas lowering expression costs (via anonymity or legal protections) empowers norm entrepreneurs in tight cultures. Our framework identifies policy levers and clarifies when apparent opinion stability conceals underlying shifts, offering insights for democratic societies navigating rapid social change.",

Previous observational searches for the formation boundary were hampered by the lack of large unified samples of wide-orbit giant planets and substellar companions. A combined analysis of radial velocity and astrometry mitigates this problem and has significantly enlarged the sample. Here, we present a rigorous statistical analysis of the sample of 55 giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions orbiting FGK stars. We quantitatively analyze the occurrence rates of brown dwarfs and identify a distinct brown dwarf desert at approximately 30 M J , with no evidence of disappearance up to 20 au. Unlike previous studies that predicted a declining planet occurrence rate beyond the water-ice line, we identify a population of giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs in this region. The metallicity and eccentricity trends in our sample suggest that these are the consequences of two different formation scenarios. Our combined population synthesis model successfully accounts for the observed brown dwarf desert, supporting the dual formation hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Function diversity, the range of tasks individuals perform, and specialization, the distribution of function abundances, are fundamental to complex adaptive systems. In the absence of overarching principles, these properties have appeared domain-specific. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification and specialization of functions across disparate systems, including bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. We find that the number of functions grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents from 0.35 to 0.57, consistent with Heaps’ law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic scaling. To explain these empirical findings, we generalize the Yule-Simon model by introducing two key parameters: a diversification parameter that characterizes how existing functions inhibit the creation of new ones and a specialization parameter that describes how a function’s attractiveness depends on its abundance. Our model enables cross-system comparisons, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas. The analysis suggests that what drives the creation of new functions depends on the system’s goals and structure: federal agencies tend to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary functions; cities tend to slow the creation of new occupations as existing ones expand; and cells occupy an intermediate position. Once functions are introduced, their growth follows a remarkably universal pattern across all systems.",

          "abstract": "Erythroid progenitors undergo dynamic morphological changes and robust heme biosynthesis during differentiation. Zinc is essential for erythropoiesis, yet the mechanisms linking zinc availability to heme biosynthesis and anemia risk remain unclear. This study aimed to define zinc-responsive pathways in differentiating erythroid progenitors and to evaluate the translational relevance of SLC39A10 ( ZIP10 ) genetic variants to hematological health. To elucidate the molecular basis of zinc’s role in erythropoiesis, we performed transcriptomic profiling of zinc-restricted G1E-ER4 cells during differentiation and compared it to iron chelation and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase inhibition. Zinc deficiency uniquely enriched genes involved in not only heme biosynthesis but cellular maintenance functions. Zinc restriction caused a marked suppression of Alad transcript abundance, impairing the first enzymatic step of cytosolic heme biosynthesis. Notably, Slc39a10 ( Zip10 ) was the only zinc transporter strongly induced by zinc deficiency, independent of iron status. Loss of ZIP10 exacerbated zinc depletion, further reduced Alad expression, and diminished heme output, highlighting its role as a compensatory importer during zinc scarcity. GWAS database analyses revealed that SLC39A10 variants are significantly associated with hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and iron deficiency anemia risk. Together, ZIP10 safeguards erythroid zinc homeostasis and heme synthesis under limiting zinc conditions. Genetic variation in SLC39A10 may heighten sensitivity to zinc deficiency, providing a potential nutrigenetic marker for anemia risk. These findings establish a mechanistic and translational basis for genotype-guided precision nutrition strategies to improve hematological health.",

Eutectic gallium–indium, a type of liquid metal, serves as both the deformable electrode for capacitive sensors and a low-resistance conductor for inductors. It is integrated into a thin-film, battery-free, inductive-capacitive wireless sensing platform. Scalable wireless sensor arrays are created through microfabrication for large-area pressure mapping. The wireless pressure sensor is also integrated with soft ferromagnetic and self-healing layers in cuff-type sensors to allow for autonomous folding in response to external magnets, eliminating the need for suturing. In addition, a miniaturized wearable readout system integrated into medical gloves enables wireless and real-time pressure monitoring.

          "abstract": "Mycolic acids (MAs) are the major component of the mycobacterial outer membrane, a key contributor to the intrinsic resistance of mycobacteria to external insults including multiple antibiotics. After being synthesized in the cytoplasm and before reaching the outer membrane, MAs are transported across the inner membrane in the form of an acylated sugar, generally believed to be trehalose monomycolates (TMMs). Whether trehalose is the only mycolate carrier during transport is under debate, and why this highly abundant disaccharide is essential for mycobacterial growth is unclear. To address these questions, we leveraged a trehalose auxotrophic Mycobacterium smegmatis strain to investigate the biosynthetic steps affording TMMs. We show that in addition to TMMs, mature MAs are also not produced in the absence of intracellular trehalose. This is likely due to a product inhibition mechanism where unreduced MA precursors accumulate on Pks13, the protein catalyzing the ligation of mycolic acids and the sugar head group. We establish that the unreduced mycolates could only be released by trehalose, revealing exquisite Pks13 specificity, and subsequently reduced by CmrA in vitro. Furthermore, only trehalose and its analogs can reactivate MA biosynthesis in cells. Finally, by replacing trehalose with a 6-deoxy analog in cells, we demonstrate that the cord factor trehalose dimycolate is dispensable for M. smegmatis growth in vitro. Our work gives a clear depiction of how TMMs are formed and provides a compelling reason for the essentiality of trehalose, shedding light on the development of future antimycobacterial strategies.",

          "abstract": "The ocean’s biological carbon pump exports atmospheric CO 2 to the deep ocean, where it can remain sequestered for decades to centuries, and attempts to artificially enhance this natural carbon sink by fertilizing portions of the open ocean could help mitigate the impacts of excessive anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. However, differences in the cycling rates of carbon and other nutrients may impact the long-term response to ocean fertilization. In this study, we use a steady-state global biogeochemical inverse model, optimized to match hydrographic observations, to examine how differential production, remineralization, and circulation-driven re-exposure timescales of organic carbon and phosphorus affect long-term carbon sequestration. We partition global organic matter production based on the time required for regenerated carbon and phosphorus to return to the ocean surface. We find that less than 15% of total organic carbon and 31% of total organic phosphorus production remains sequestered in the ocean interior for ≥ 1 y, with only 3.3% (1.8 Pg C y −1 ) and 8.3% (0.046 Pg P y −1 ), respectively, remaining for a century or longer. The C:P ratio of the sequestration flux declines with increasing residence time, from 255:1 for total production to 98:1 for material sequestered for 100+ years, indicating that carbon is recycled to the surface more rapidly than phosphorus. This decoupling between carbon and phosphorus sequestration timescales could result in a “productivity hangover,” where the slow recovery of surface phosphate leads to a long-term suppression of global productivity, reducing the net removal of atmospheric CO 2 .",

This study demonstrated both the stability of epigenetic inheritance across generations and demonstrated a generational increase incidence of disease pathology. Building on this research, the present study follows the same lineage of rats with ancestral vinclozolin exposure through twenty generations. The findings offer important insights into long-term mammalian models of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance. Observations demonstrate an increase in differential DNA methylated regions across multiple generations. This indicates a persistent and stable transmission of epigenetic alterations. Additionally, deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) transferase-mediated nick end labeling apoptosis assays revealed elevated levels of germline apoptosis in the male rats of the maternal and paternal lineages. This suggests a potential consequence of epigenetic dysregulation in spermatogenesis. Ancestrally exposed rats to vinclozolin showed significant parturition abnormalities in both the maternal and paternal lineages after 16 generations. This included maternal deaths during labor and stillbirths. Pathological assessments revealed abnormalities across multiple tissue types and an increased incidence of disease. This suggests the physiological consequences of the generational stability of epigenetic inheritance. Observations establish the generational stability of epigenetic inheritance over twenty generations in a mammalian model system; however, new pathology in later generations involving parturition abnormalities was also observed. The generational stability of transgenerational effects observed in this study has implications for human health, particularly regarding environmental toxicant exposures, reproductive health disorders, and disease susceptibility.",

          "abstract": "Hydrophobins are functional amyloids conserved in filamentous fungi. They act as a protective coat in the fibrous form, called rodlet. Rodlets further assemble to form dense films where they are bundled and densely aligned, contributing to the hydrophobicity of the mycelium surface. The mechanism of this dense film formation is completely unknown. Here, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to directly observe the structural dynamics of rodlet bundling and subsequent film formation by hydrophobin RolA from the industrial fungus Aspergillus oryzae at a single-fibril level, and we revealed the film-formation mechanism. Rodlet elongation occurred at both ends and was discontinuous, alternating between periods when rodlets could elongate (growth state) and could not elongate (pause state). This suggests an equilibrium of two distinct structural states at the rodlet ends. We also identified a pathway, termed “surface-catalyzed elongation,” in which elongation is promoted by lateral interactions between bundled rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation decreased the energy barrier of both structural switching between growth and pause states and elongation at rodlet ends, doubling the elongation rate in bundled rodlets. The rodlet surface could be considered as a catalyst for the elongation of neighboring rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation could contribute to rodlet bundling, whereby rodlets tend to form oriented domain structures; our Monte Carlo simulations confirmed this. The concept we propose here provides a clear explanation of the mechanism by which rodlets form a dense coat on the cell surface.",

Underlying this ability is our understanding of how radiation is produced: Whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates. Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here, we prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple (once one knows what to do), but its reasons are deep: It relies on the fact that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act on them, via the Aharonov–Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here is just the tip of an iceberg–it implies the need to reconsider the basic understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.",

Mechanistic studies show that homopentameric CorA is regulated through an intracellular [Mg 2+ ]-dependent negative feedback loop, involving the asymmetric participation of individual subunits. To understand the connection between asymmetry and activation, we used single-particle cryo-EM to solve sixteen structures of nanodisc-reconstituted CorA. We utilized conformation-specific synthetic antibodies to stabilize subtle but significant conformational differences in the cryo-EM structures. Our results demonstrate that CorA exists as a set of conformational ensembles, where population size inversely correlates with intracellular Mg 2+ concentration. These ensembles include channels with a variety of pore conformations, both constricted and dilated, suggesting a spectrum of active CorA functional states. The ensembles connect asymmetric structural transitions in the cytoplasmic domain with conformational changes in the permeation pathway via an electrostatic network, ultimately controlling channel-gating events.

Many studies represent this structure using static networks, where each link represents a permanent connection between two nodes. However, real interactions are generally not time-invariant and are often not pairwise. Recently, progress has been made in modeling higher-order interactions using hypergraphs, where a link may connect more than two individuals. Here, we study cooperation on temporal hypergraphs, capturing the time-varying, higher-order interactions seen in empirical systems. We find that temporal hypergraphs can promote cooperation compared with static networks, and the latter may even underestimate the cooperation-boosting effects of constrained, local interactions. We further show that cooperation can be facilitated by temporal hypergraphs with sparse components and higher-order interactions. Importantly, when the size of group interactions (hyperedges) is comparable to the population size, relatively small hyperedge sizes best facilitate cooperation. Synthetic and empirical hypergraphs alike affirm our findings, illuminating how temporal, higher-order interactions profoundly shape the evolution of cooperation.",

At this critical point in animal development, the larva stops feeding and proceeds to take on the adult form. The neuroendocrine circuits governing commitment to metamorphosis assess the growth and patterning programs, eventually triggering the production of systemic hormones that terminate growth and initiate metamorphosis. Previous studies of these circuits relied on relatively static genetic perturbations and starvation experiments. Here, we take advantage of optogenetic approaches in Drosophila to flexibly perturb a key signaling node within the endocrine gland in otherwise undisturbed larvae. We used this approach to infer parameters in a compact mathematical model and demonstrate that it makes accurate predictions of larval commitment to metamorphosis.

Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs.

          "abstract": "The potential role of haplodiploid sex determination in promoting the evolution of altruism and eusociality has been the subject of intense debate for over 50 y. Different theoretical models have suggested that haplodiploidy influences relatedness in a way that either does or does not make it easier for altruism to evolve. This debate over the “haplodiploidy hypothesis” can only be resolved with a decisive empirical test that controls for potential phylogenetic bias. Here we critically examine the current state of evidence for an adaptive link between haplodiploidy and eusociality, applying phylogenetically informed methods to ensure that statistical tests reflect independent evolutionary transitions. Using data from 5,678 species, across all major insect orders, we find no evidence that haplodiploidy favors an increased rate of eusocial evolution. We show that this result is robust to: a) different analytical approaches; b) alternative ways of defining both eusociality and haplodiploidy; and c) uncertainty in eusociality assignments. Our analyses suggest that previously reported associations between haplodiploidy and eusociality are likely to have been artifacts, false-positive results primarily driven by a high transition rate to eusociality within the Hymenoptera. This high transition rate could be explained by any factor associated with that group, such as parental care, monogamy, or the possession of a powerful sting.",

Here, we demonstrate that the stripe rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) deploys effector Hasp170 (one haustorial secreted protein) to subvert wheat immunity by directly disrupting host LLPS. Hasp170 targets the intrinsically disordered region (IDR1) of the wheat nuclear protein TaPSTE (phase separation protein targeted by effector), which forms LLPS-dependent biomolecular condensates. Within these condensates, TaPSTE recruits the transcription factor TaNF-YC, thereby activating the expression of genes driving reactive oxygen species burst and Ca 2+ influx, key components for disease resistance. By binding TaPSTE’s IDR1, Hasp170 impairs condensate formation and prevents TaNF-YC recruitment, consequently suppressing host immunity and facilitating fungal parasitism. This reveals a virulence strategy where pathogens directly manipulate host biomolecular condensates to evade immune responses.",

An extensive literature in welfare economics addresses the matter. Nevertheless, economists have often simplified policy analysis by assuming that individuals have homogeneous, consequentialist, and self-centered preferences. Individuals may hold heterogeneous private and distributional preferences. To enhance policy analysis, economists should specify social welfare functions that express the richness and variety of actual personal preferences. The possibilities are vast. I focus on preferences for equity. There has been much controversy regarding interpretation of equity, a term that public discourse has used in vague and conflicting ways. Specifying social welfare functions that formally express different interpretations of equity will not eliminate disagreements, but it should clarify concepts and reduce the inconsistencies that afflict verbal communication.",

We here engineer megakaryocytes encapsulating oncolytic adenovirus type 5 (M-Ad5) to produce oncolytic platelets in vivo by leveraging the thrombopoiesis process. Upon intravenous administration, M-Ad5 travels through the lungs, where it can release OVs-harbored therapeutic platelets into circulation under pulmonary turbulence microenvironments. Under the shelter of platelets, OVs resist inactivation by neutralizing antibodies and actively target widespread noninjectable cancer lesions. Intravenous infusion of M-Ad5 to mice with A549 lung cancer could significantly inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival. In multiple mouse tumor models, M-Ad5 induced a robust antitumor immune response by reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and potentiated the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors by recruiting more immune cells. We demonstrated that M-Ad5 in combination with PDL1 inhibitors activated tumor antigen-specific CD8 + T cells and memory T cells, thereby suppressing the growth of CT26 colorectal cancer metastasis, and preventing postsurgical B16F10 cancer recurrence and metastatic spread, as well as providing long-term immune protection against the rechallenged tumors.",

Wolves from more urbanized areas showed reduced fear at first exposure to an object but heightened caution when the object changed, indicating increased attention to environmental changes, rather than uniform fear reduction. By contrast, playbacks of human voices elicited strong fear responses (&gt;80%), regardless of urbanization. However, individuals habituated to both stimuli quickly and at a similar pace, highlighting their rapid learning abilities. Sociality buffered fear, with wolves in groups reacting less fearfully than wolves alone.

We use a combinatorial analysis of NMR and MS/MS with an updated bioinformatic pipeline to pair MSDIN genes to leaderless peptides in Amanita phalloides , a European species spreading in California. Leaderless MSDIN transcripts are expressed several orders of magnitude more than most canonical MSDINs, with significantly higher expression in invasive populations.

          "abstract": "Munc13-1 is a key protein involved in priming synaptic vesicles for rapid release at the presynaptic plasma membrane. It was previously revealed that Munc13-1 cycles between at least two alternate conformations, an upright (open) molecular conformation organized as a trimer and a lateral (closed) conformation organized as a hexagon. Munc13 binds PI(4,5)P 2 , a plasma membrane phospholipid essential for vesicle docking and fusion. We report that Munc13 is recruited to PI(4,5)P 2 domains induced by a Syntaxin-1A juxta-membrane peptide in supported bilayers. Statistical analysis of the copy numbers of Munc13 within the domains suggests that Munc13 exists in clusters of three molecules, i.e., it assembles into trimers. The trimeric clusters disappear with engineered interface mutations disrupting the upright trimers in cryo-EM as well as reconstituted vesicle priming suggesting the trimers observed on bilayers are identical to the upright trimer structures. These upright trimers can also be identified by cryo-electron tomography on vesicles containing PI(4,5)P 2 and Syntaxin-1A. Clusters of 3 or more Munc13 trimers forming on PI(4,5)P 2 domains efficiently capture phosphatidylserine-containing small unilamellar vesicles via their C 2 C domains, as shown by the effect of mutations that disrupt synaptic vesicle binding in synapses. We propose a two-step model for vesicle priming: i) synaptic vesicles are captured by clusters of upright trimers of Munc13 that self-assemble within PI(4,5)P 2 enriched domains; ii) these trimers transition into lateral hexamers when vesicles have bound and the transition would be promoted when the closed conformation of Munc13 is stabilized by diacylglycerol binding, resulting from Ca 2+ -dependent hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P 2 .",

          "abstract": "The island species−area relationship (ISAR) is known to be near-ubiquitous, but its properties across the fullest span of island areas globally and how island endemism shapes the ISAR remain poorly understood. We determine the global ISAR for native (Nat Rich ) and for single-island endemic richness (SIE Rich ) of vascular plants, employing data for 1,262 islands, spanning 60.7S to 80.7 N and ten orders of magnitude in area. Using logged species number and area, we compared the power model and four different breakpoint models. For Nat Rich , a simple power model (slope, z = 0.32, R 2 = 66%) was best supported. For SIE Rich , a flat-steep breakpoint model outperforms the power model, with the latter producing a steeper slope ( z = 0.48, R 2 = 0.47) than for Nat Rich . Rerunning the Nat Rich power model for subsets of islands of increasing endemism generates increased ISAR slope and improved prediction of continental richness values. Controlling for island area, Nat Rich declines with isolation, while endemism increases. Semilog analyses show that old, tropical, mountainous continental fragments and landbridge islands, rich in SIE, drive an accelerated increase in Nat Rich for islands &gt;10,000 km 2 in size. The global Nat Rich archipelago species–area relationship was best described by a power model ( z = 0.41, R 2 = 0.54), and there is also evidence of declining richness but higher endemism with increased archipelago isolation. Our findings provide no support for the existence of an upper asymptote in the global plants ISAR, while supporting the application of the power model at a global scale, and highlighting roles for island type, endemism, and isolation as influences on ISAR form.",

In this study, we analyze real-world pedestrian behavior at a route split within a busy train station using high-resolution trajectory data collected over a three-year time frame. We disclose a striking tendency for individuals to follow the same path as the person directly in front of them, even in the absence of social ties and even when such a choice leads to a longer travel time. This tendency leads to bursty dynamics, where sequences of pedestrians make identical decisions in succession, leading to strong patterns in collective movement. We employ a stochastic model that includes route costs, randomness, and social imitation to accurately reproduce the observed behavior, highlighting that local imitation behavior is the dominant driver of collective routing choices. These findings highlight how brief, low-level interactions between strangers can scale up to influence large-scale pedestrian movement, with strong implications for crowd management, urban design, and the broader understanding of social behavior in public spaces.",

These mechanisms are fundamental to plant sexual reproduction and offer valuable insight into the molecular basis of cell–cell communication and self-recognition more broadly. Here, we leverage an independent evolution of SI in the lineage containing Phlox (Polemoniaceae) to identify the gene causing self-pollen recognition which we name Phlox drummondii Pistil Identity Receptor Kinase ( PdPIRK ). Recognition of self-pollen associates with a single genomic region containing the Phlox S -locus. We generate predictions regarding how S -loci must function and evolve to identify a single candidate gene within this S -associated region. This gene, PdPIRK , is highly and specifically expressed in the pistil and has exceptionally high polymorphism maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, two hallmarks of self-pollen recognition genes. Functional validation with gene silencing confirms that PdPIRK is necessary for self-incompatibility, and we further demonstrate allele-specific activity, confirming its role in self-pollen recognition per se. PdPIRK encodes a G-type lectin receptor-like kinase, which is a member of the same gene family as SRK , the gene controlling self-pollen recognition in the distantly related Brassicaceae. Our findings suggest the presence of genetic constraints or paths of least resistance governing how S -loci evolve and add to our understanding of the diverse molecular mechanisms through which organisms achieve self-recognition.",

Locally, forests tend to buffer temperatures, cooling in warm conditions and warming in cold ones. In regions that naturally support dense forest cover, trees contribute to global cooling primarily through carbon uptake, with some offsetting from albedo-related warming. By enhancing rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, and cloud formation, forests also influence the hydrological cycle, lowering flood risks in humid regions but often reducing downstream water availability, especially in drier climates. Collectively, these interacting processes show that the greatest climate benefits occur where forests are native, highlighting their importance for both climate adaptation and mitigation.",

Increased neuronal activity during early demyelination exacerbates myelin damage, whereas reducing neuronal activity mitigates myelin swelling in both zebrafish and mice. In human multiple sclerosis tissue, myelin swelling is also dynamic and is prominent around active lesions.

          "abstract": "Understanding how protein binding sites evolve interactions with other proteins could hold clues to targeting “undruggable” surfaces. We used synthetic coevolution to engineer new interactions between naïve surfaces, simulating the de novo formation of protein complexes. We isolated seven distinct structural families of protein Z-domain complexes and found that synthetic complexes explore multiple shallow energy wells through ratchet-like docking modes, whereas complexes formed by natural binding sites converged in a deep energy well with a relatively fixed geometry. Epistasis analysis of a machine learning–estimated fitness landscape revealed “seed” contacts between binding partners that anchored the earliest stages of encounter complex formation. Our results suggest that “silent” surfaces have a shallower energy landscape than natural binding sites, disfavoring tight binding, likely owing to evolutionary counterselection.",

Mammalian whiskers are elongated keratin rods attached to tactile skin structures that extend the animal’s sensory volume. We investigated the whiskers that cover Asian elephant ( Elephas maximus ) trunks and found that they are geometrically and mechanically tailored to facilitate tactile perception by encoding contact location in the amplitude and frequency of the vibrotactile signal felt at the whisker base. Elephant whiskers emerge from armored trunk skin and shift from a thick, circular, porous, stiff base to a thin, ovular, dense, soft tip. These functional gradients of geometry, porosity, and stiffness independently tune the neuromechanics of elephant trunk touch to facilitate highly dexterous manipulation while ensuring whisker durability.",

In Arabidopsis , the polyamine thermospermine (tSpm) affects xylem cell fate. tSpm induces translation of SUPPRESSOR-OF-ACAULIS51 (SAC51) and SAC51-LIKEs (SACLs), which inhibit heterodimerization of the xylem development proteins LONESOME-HIGHWAY (LHW) and TARGET-OF-MONOPTEROS5. Here, we report a methyltransferase, OVERACHIEVER, that methylates the peptidyl transferase center of the 25 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Residue m 3 U2952 promotes functional tSpm binding to a specific site connecting the P-site transfer RNA (tRNA) with rRNA residues in the peptidyl transferase center. This interaction enhances the translation of SACLs but inhibits that of LHW.

We evaluate the effectiveness of this large-scale conservation action by assessing fish communities across mainstem habitats before and after the ban (2018 to 2023). The seven-decadal biodiversity loss was halted with improvements in fish biomass, body condition, species diversity, and initial recovery of threatened species. Eliminating fishing pressure was likely key to this recovery, in addition to actions targeting water quality improvement, hydrological and riparian habitat restoration, and vessel traffic reduction. Ambitious conservation actions can halt biodiversity loss in the Yangtze River, bringing hope for biodiversity recovery in other large rivers.",

Etv3 deficiency exacerbated TLR7-driven systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)–like disease, supporting the reported genetic association of human ETV3 with SLE. Etv3-deficient migDCs up-regulated multiple costimulatory molecules, including OX40 ligand (OX40L/TNFSF4), whose blockade partially rescued the T reg cell abnormalities.

These appressoria develop semipermeable cell walls and accumulate osmolytes internally to create turgor by osmosis. Although melanin is known to be important for turgor generation, the mechanism underlying wall semipermeability remains unclear. By using reverse genetics, we identified that the enzymes PKS2 and PBG13 are required for forming the semipermeable barrier in fungi causing anthracnose and rice blast diseases. These enzymes synthesize 3,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid polymers that are essential for pathogenicity. These polymers reduce cell wall permeability and generate turgor, independently of melanization. Our findings uncover a mechanism of fungal turgor generation, linking enzyme function to pathogen penetration and disease potential, presenting new targets for disease control.",

We identified a poxvirus effector, myxoma virus M3.1, which elicited an antiviral nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) response. NF-κB was unleashed by an ETI pathway that sensed M3.1 attack of two antiviral complexes: zinc finger antiviral protein and TBK1. NF-κΒ activation occurred because the proteins inhibited by M3.1—N4BP1, ZC3H12A, and TBK1—are negative regulators of NF-κB.

The SEI comprises stacked inorganic layers with low ion-binding affinity and high ion-conductivity functionalities that increase Li-ion flux by two orders of magnitude.

To accelerate resistance breeding, we conducted large-scale phenotyping and genotyping in hybrids of these species. Simulation and inoculation experiments suggest that significant resistance gains are possible through selectively breeding trees with an average of 70 to 85% American chestnut ancestry.

Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we uncover ILF3 as an RNA binding protein connecting cytoplasmic mRNA decay and transcription during TA and show that it is required for a range of TA substrates. ILF3 is enriched at adapting genes’ RNAs, and its artificial recruitment through dCas13 promotes gene expression. Using tiling oligonucleotide screens, we identify trigger RNA fragments that activate adapting genes when introduced into cells.

          "abstract": "Environmental adaptation often involves a shift in energy utilization toward mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, which requires carnitine. Besides dietary sources of animal origin, carnitine biosynthesis from trimethyllysine (TML) is essential, particularly for those who consume plant-based diets; however, its molecular regulation and physiological role remain elusive. Here, we identify SLC25A45 as a mitochondrial TML carrier that controls carnitine biosynthesis and fuel switching. SLC25A45 deficiency decreased the carnitine pool and impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, shifting reliance to carbohydrate metabolism. Slc25a45 -deficient mice were cold-intolerant and resistant to lipid mobilization by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), rendering them resistant to adipose tissue loss. Our study suggests that mitochondria serve as a regulatory checkpoint in fuel switching, with implications for metabolic adaptation and the efficacy of GLP-1RA–based anti-obesity therapy.",

          "abstract": "Optimizing organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance requires navigating the high-dimensional, interdependent processing parameters governing bulk heterojunction morphology. To address this, we have constructed a standardized database integrating donor/acceptor pairs, nine key fabrication parameters, and device efficiencies, consolidating over a decade of experimental results. Leveraging this resource, we developed a three-tiered machine learning framework using gradient boosting regression trees. The strategy progresses from single-parameter baseline models to stage-combined models that capture intraprocess synergies, culminating in a global nine-parameter optimization model. This final model achieves a Pearson correlation of &gt;0.9 and a success rate of &gt;80% in identifying optimal multiparameter configurations. Validation on 78 external systems, each containing a previously unseen donor or acceptor, demonstrates robust generalization with &gt;75% accuracy in predicting the optimal or secondary condition for individual parameters. This work establishes a practical, data-driven framework for accelerating the rational optimization of OPV photoactive layers.",

Presynaptic diacylglycerol (DAG), Ca 2+ , and Ca 2+ -calmodulin signaling converge on the essential synaptic vesicle (SV) priming protein Munc13-1 via its regulatory C 1 , C 2 B, and CaM-binding domains. Using brainstem-specific heterozygous mice expressing a DAG-binding-deficient Munc13-1 variant (Munc13-1 H567K ), we compared synaptic transmission in situ at glutamatergic calyx of Held synapses carrying either a single Munc13-1 H567K or a single Munc13-1 wt allele. Munc13-1 H567K/− synapses show enhanced initial strength but impaired steady-state release and slower recovery from depression. These deficits result from an increased initial abundance of fully primed SVs and a loss of activity-dependent acceleration of SV priming. Posttetanic potentiation (PTP) is strongly reduced in Munc13-1 H567K/− synapses and either increased or attenuated by C 2 B mutations that enhance or weaken Ca 2+ -phospholipid binding. Our data identify Munc13-1 as a target of presynaptic TrkB–phospholipase C–γ signaling and demonstrate that C 1 and C 2 B domain-dependent regulation of Munc13-1 determines synaptic strength and shapes short-term plasticity and PTP.",

          "abstract": "Biogenic amines are fundamental for physiological homeostasis and behavioral control in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Monoamine neurotransmitters released in target brain regions conjointly regulate adaptive learning and plasticity. However, our understanding of these multianalyte mechanisms remains nascent, in part due to limitations in measurement technology. Here, during associative conditioning in honey bees, we concurrently tracked subsecond fluctuations in octopamine, tyramine, dopamine, and serotonin in the antennal lobe, where plasticity influences odorant representations. By repeatedly pairing an odorant with subsequent sucrose delivery, we observed individual differences in the conditioned response to odor, which occurred after a variable number of pairings (learners) or not at all (non-learners). The distinction between learners and non-learners was reflected in neurotransmitter responses across experimental conditions. The speed of learning, the number of pairings prior to a proboscis extension reflex, could be predicted from monoamine opponent signaling (octopamine-tyramine), from both the first presentation of the odorant alone, prior to any pairing with sucrose, and the first conditioned response to the odorant, coming after a number of sucrose pairings. These results suggest that monoamine signaling phenotypes may relate directly to the now widely reported socially relevant genetic differences in honey bee learning.",

          "abstract": "Anode-free sodium batteries (AFSBs) with near-theoretical energy density hold great promise for next-generation sustainable energy storage systems. However, their practical implementation is impeded by the low operating rate threshold (&lt;1 milliampere per square centimeter) and poor cycling stability, owing to dendritic sodium (Na) growth. Here, a high-rate and durable AFSB is successfully realized via a spatially anion-confined electrolyte strategy. Specifically, positively charged nanoparticles are introduced into the electrolyte to selectively anchor anions, generating localized contact ion pair–dominated solvation to facilitate rapid Na + desolvation at electrode interface and form an anion-derived solid electrolyte interphase. Meanwhile, rapid ion transport in the bulk electrolyte is maintained by the solvent-separated ion pair solvation structure in the nanoparticle periphery. These factors conjointly enable flat and dense Na deposition at high current densities. Consequently, an energy-type Na(Ni 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 )O 2 ||Al full cell exhibits an energy density of 415.6 watt-hour per kilogram cathode+anode even at 1 C (2.1 milliamperes per square centimeter) with 70.2% capacity retention over 400 cycles. A power-type Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ||Al cell achieves a trebled operation current density compared to the state-of-the-art AFSBs, exhibiting an unprecedented 5-C rate (3.8 milliamperes per square centimeter) with 70.0% capacity retention over 1400 cycles. This strategy presents a potentially universal approach for high-rate alkali metal batteries.",

Furthermore, we report that deletion of vapBC36 or vapC36 enhances the susceptibility of M. tuberculosis upon exposure to copper in vitro. Compared to the wild-type strain, Δ BC36 was attenuated for growth in guinea pigs. However, deletion of either vapC36 or vapBC36 did not affect M. tuberculosis growth in mice.

          "abstract": "The genetic mechanisms of ~90% of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)–associated variants residing in noncoding DNA remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed a deep learning framework that integrates bulk histone modification data with single-cell open chromatin profiles to evaluate the regulatory potential of noncoding variants. This model identified 1457 silencer and 3084 enhancer AD-associated variants in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, classifying gene loci as silencer-only (SL), enhancer-only (EN), or dual-function (ENSL). EN loci predominantly regulate housekeeping metabolic processes, SL loci (including MS4A6A and HLA-D ) are linked to immune responses (with ~70% substantially up-regulated in AD microglia), while ENSL loci are implicated in neurofibrillary tangle assembly. Our model achieves robust power in assessing the impact of regulatory variants, with ~70% directional concordance with experimental results. It identified rs636317 as a putative causal silencer variant, distinguishing it from a neutral variant located 11 base pairs away. This study advances understanding of the AD-associated regulatory landscape and provides a framework for ascertaining noncoding variants in AD pathogenesis.",

Hainan gibbons ( Nomascus hainanus ) feature a mysterious rebound, from ~13 individuals in 2003 to 42 currently. Using reliable genomic data from the fecal samples of 18 gibbons, generated through a systematically established pipeline, and from four museum specimens, our analyses reveal that Hainan gibbons have the smallest effective population size and low genetic diversity but, unexpectedly, low inbreeding and genetic load among threatened primates assessed thus far. This results from a millennial expansion mitigating bottleneck effects and a high local recombination maintaining selection efficiency. Notably, we uncover two cryptic lineages, whose recent crosses led to new family groups with increased heterozygosity.

Here, we identify elongation of very-long-chain fatty acid protein 6 (Elovl6) as a critical regulator in CRC progression. Clinical data reveal significant down-regulation of Elovl6 in colon cancer tissues, with low expression levels correlating with unfavorable patient prognosis. We demonstrate that Elovl6 exerts potent tumor-suppressive effects, significantly inhibiting cellular proliferation in vitro and attenuating tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, it maintains intestinal microbial homeostasis by preventing the expansion of opportunistic pathogens while simultaneously orchestrating metabolic reprogramming through modulation of phospholipid biosynthesis pathways. Notably, we find that stearic acid, a key Elovl6-derived metabolite, promotes mitochondrial fusion by stabilizing mitofusin 1 protein. These findings not only position Elovl6 as a promising therapeutic target but also suggest that dietary supplementation with stearic acid could represent a viable strategy for CRC prevention and treatment.",

Using programmable optical ring vortices (Laguerre-Gaussian beams), we assemble and rotate colloidal clusters with certain particle numbers, whose induced hydrodynamic flows apply switchable in-plane and out-of-plane torques on target particles. Torque control is achieved via two mechanisms: (i) reversing the handedness of circular polarization to break rotational symmetry and (ii) displacing optical ring vortices and modulating cluster rotation speed. These complementary controls provide robust, high-resolution torques tuned in arbitrary directions. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate full three-dimensional orientation control of a single cell.

We establish a universal design rule: Periodic microcavities with diameter-to-height ratios of 1 to 1.33 generate centralized vortices that prolong molecular residence time by 85% and optimize mass transfer efficiency, as validated through computational fluid dynamics, fluorescence tracking, and Sherwood number analysis. This geometric principle enables metal oxide (ZnO, In 2 O 3 , Co 3 O 4 , and WO 3 ) sensors to achieve ultralow detection limits (0.8 to 30 parts per billion) while maintaining long-period stability. A four-channel microsensor array leveraging vortex-enhanced microstructures enables real-time profiling of human breath biomarkers.

We quantify the effects of more than 50,000 single and double amino acid substitutions on activity and abundance and use thermodynamic modeling to disentangle changes in fold stability and catalysis. The comprehensive energy landscape reveals that allostery across the kinase domain is extensive, directionally biased, and modulated by its regulatory domains. Inhibitory—but not activating—allosteric mutations show a strong distance-dependent decay away from the active site. Using the map, we identify multiple potentially druggable allosteric sites not previously reported in Src or other kinases.

These effects are durable and last beyond the predicted life span of differentiated myeloid cells such as macrophages. The present study investigated MBV-directed epigenetic modification in myeloid precursors as a potential explanation for their prolonged immunomodulatory effects. Flow cytometry and ATAC sequencing studies show that MBV are internalized by myeloid cell progenitors in the bone marrow and in macrophages after terminal differentiation. This internalization is coincident with epigenetic changes that are associated with modulation of macrophage responses to inflammatory stimuli. Furthermore, MBV treatment differentially alters chromatin accessibility as a function of cell differentiation state (i.e., myeloid progenitor versus macrophage). The present study shows the epigenetic effects of MBV on myeloid cells, representing a potential avenue to exploit the therapeutic potential of biologic scaffold materials.",

Spectroscopic analyses indicate that simple homopolymerization of 1,8-DHN does not adequately represent natural allomelanin structures. Instead, heterogeneous copolymerization of 1,8-DHN with catechol or tannic acid yields materials with physicochemical properties more consistent with natural extracts. This is also supported by their enhanced antioxidant and dye/metal adsorption properties.

To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of preexisting sarcomeres.

Here, we recorded neuronal activity from PreM-INs and CM cells in macaques during a precision grip task to compare their roles in generating hand muscle activity. Our results show that PreM-INs exert stronger facilitation across a broader set of muscles, promoting synergistic coactivation, whereas CM cells provide more selective facilitation, enabling control of relatively individual muscles. Decomposition analysis further revealed that these systems correspond to different control modes—synergy-based and individual-based control—balancing stability and flexibility.

In the firebug, the InR-Chico-PI3K-PDK1-Tsc1/2-TORC1 cascade redirects the switch from short to long wings by inactivating IIS, whereas in the planthopper, the InR-Chico-PI3K-Akt-FoxO cascade redirects this same switch by activating IIS. Activation or inactivation of IIS results in low ecdysteroid titers in both species by regulating different genes within the ecdysteroid biosynthesis pathway, which in turn induces long wing development.

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first committed step in this pathway and has long been viewed as a cytoplasmic enzyme. Here, we reveal that PAL responds to elevated flavonoid levels in Arabidopsis by undergoing phosphorylation and relocating to the nucleus. Nuclear sequestration of PAL reduces its cytoplasmic abundance and enzymatic activity, resulting in rapid suppression of phenylpropanoid metabolic flux. In parallel, nuclear-localized PAL interacts with the transcription factor TT8, disrupting MBW complex formation and down-regulating flavonoid biosynthetic genes. This dual mechanism enables PAL to act as a metabolic feedback regulator that dynamically adjusts flavonoid production in response to internal metabolic states. Our findings redefine PAL as both a biosynthetic enzyme and a responsive integrator of cellular metabolic status, establishing a previously unknown paradigm for feedback control in plant specialized metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Precise control over quantum dot (QD) position and size is critical for quantum electronics but typically requires complex nanofabrication. Here, we report a step-confined heteroprecursor supply (sc-HPS) strategy for growth of crystalline germanium (c-Ge) QDs at predefined step edges within planar ultrathin silicon nanowire (SiNW) channels, eliminating the need for high-resolution lithography. Unlike conventional in-plane solid-liquid-solid growth using a uniform amorphous silicon precursor, sc-HPS uses a spatially confined amorphous germanium (a-Ge) layer defined by oblique patterning of a SiO 2 /a-Ge stack. This restricts Ge supply to a narrow strip along the step edge, enabling nucleation and tunable QD diameters of ~25 to 150 nm, sandwiched between two epitaxially connected SiNWs. The SiNW/Ge-QD/SiNW heterostructure forms a Si/Ge interface that provides three-dimensional hole confinement. Single-hole transistors fabricated from these structures exhibit clear Coulomb oscillations and well-defined Coulomb diamonds up to 50 K, demonstrating single-hole charging behavior. This scalable and lithography-free approach enables previously unexplored opportunities in hole-based quantum devices and nanoelectronic architectures.",

All enhanced dendritic cell activation and CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity in primary human cells compared to peptide-CpG admixture; however, one variant, N-HSNA, elicited the strongest response, inducing ~8-fold higher interferon-γ secretion and ~2.5-fold greater cytotoxicity. In tumor-bearing AAD mice, N-HSNA reduced tumor burden by ~3.5-fold, prolonged survival, and expanded CD8 + T cells. Transcriptomic profiling revealed up-regulation of activation genes and suppression of exhaustion markers.

Through development, they either retain these rod-like cones (in Maurolicus mucronatus ) or transition to true rods expressing rod-specific genes and transcription factors (in Vinciguerria mabahiss and Benthosema pterotum ). Unlike most marine fish larvae, which inhabit brightly lit waters, deep-sea fish larvae experience deeper and dimmer environments. By combining rod-like morphology with cone-like molecular machinery, hybrid photoreceptors likely maximize visual performance under such conditions. Consistently, spectral maxima predictions and environmental light estimations suggest tuning to the prevailing light environment throughout life.

We, unexpectedly, found that CBX7 formed a methylation-dependent transcriptional complex, which induced gene transcription by binding to cytokine gene promoters. CBX7 translocated to the cytosol and formed a methylation-dependent signaling complex with c-Raf, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), and casein kinase-2 (CK2)–α to generate and sustain extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. CBX7 is an allergen-inducible gene. Genetic and pharmacologic interventions established an essential role for CBX7 for the production of cytokines by mouse and asthmatic patient lymphoid cells, and for the induction of allergic asthma in multiple mouse models. RNA sequencing demonstrated a large-scale loss and gain in gene transcription in Cbx7 −/− T cells. The top down-regulated pathways included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, asthma, and T helper cell differentiation. CBX7 induction of the transcriptional activation complex and methylation of the ERK1/2 signalosome was specific for lymphoid cells as they were absent in epithelial cells.

Central to programming these shape transformations is the spatial alignment of microscale liquid crystal mesogens. Existing 4D printing methods for LCEs are constrained by the alignment of mesogens within 2D planes, thereby limiting the range of achievable deformation. This work presents a robotic direct-ink-writing conformal 4D printing technology that enables deposition of LCEs onto complex, nonplanar 3D substrates. An algorithm is developed to generate printing paths, point normals, and control codes to guide the motion of a six-axis robotic arm. Conformal printing is demonstrated on various surfaces with different printing paths, and the resulting shape-changing behaviors are studied to highlight the unlocked design space. Integration with 3D scanning further allows printing onto substrates with unknown geometries, such as egg surfaces, which enables applications in on-demand protective coatings and structural repair.",

Our study used metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes as gate electrodes to shrink the gate length of molybdenum disulfide FeFET to 1 nanometer. This nanogate approach leads to an electric field concentration and enhanced ferroelectric–to–metal-oxide semiconductor capacitance coupling, resulting in a reduced operating voltage of 0.6 V, below the conventional ferroelectric coercive voltage.

Modifying the postbuckling configurations or their snapping transitions would greatly expand design possibilities, yet general principles for controlling elastic instabilities are lacking. Here, we show that adding a partial cut, or slit, to a flexible beam enables precise control of postbuckling behavior: Under compression, slit-beams first buckle and then snap, leading to tristability within the hysteretic regime. A truss model explains these phenomena by uncovering the interplay of geometric and slit-induced nonlinearities. Leveraging these insights, we realize multislit beams with programmable behavior, unlocking a vast design space featuring giant hysteresis, quadstability, multistep snapping, tristability at zero compression, and compression-induced snapping between left- and right-buckled states. Our strategy is general, simple to design and implement, and enables mechanical metamaterials and devices with advanced memory and sequential behavior.",

To tackle this question, we probe the non-equilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting non-equilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the nonlocal redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation—an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium liquid of plasmons.",

Subsequent automated synthesis and validation found a high-performance catalyst, TiFeNiZn-CoOOH, which exhibited an exceptional OER overpotential of 263 millivolts at 100 milliamperes per square centimeter. Feature importance and statistical analysis of more than 5 million structures confirmed that Zn consistently shows the highest active site occupation probability, and the [CoNiZn] coordination yields the lowest overpotential.

The neuronal membrane–associated periodic skeleton (MPS), an actin spectrin–based cytoskeletal lattice, is known to restrict clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in axons, but its broader role in other neuronal compartments and endocytic pathways remains unclear. Here, we show that all four major endocytic pathways—CME, caveolin-, flotillin-, and fast endophilin–mediated endocytosis—are spatially gated by the MPS and occur exclusively within MPS-free “clearing” zones throughout all neuronal compartments. Disrupting the MPS broadly enhances both basal and ligand-induced endocytosis. We also identify a previously unknown feedback loop in which ligand-triggered endocytosis activates extracellular signal–regulated kinase signaling, promoting protease-mediated spectrin cleavage and MPS disruption, which in turn facilitates further endocytosis. Furthermore, the MPS limits amyloid precursor protein endocytosis, thereby suppressing Aβ42 production and linking MPS integrity to neurodegeneration.

          "abstract": "Entangled quantum states are essential ingredients for many quantum technologies, but they must be validated before they are used. As a full characterization is prohibitively resource intensive, recent work has focused on developing methods to efficiently extract a few parameters of interest, in a so-called verification framework. Most existing approaches are based on preparing an ensemble of nominally identical and independently distributed (IID) quantum states and then measuring each copy of the ensemble. However, this leaves no states left for the intended quantum tasks and the IID assumptions do not always hold experimentally. To overcome these challenges, we experimentally implement quantum state certification (QSC), which measures only a subset of the ensemble, certifying the fidelity of multiple copies of the remaining states. We use active optical switches to randomly sample from sources of two-photon Bell states and three-photon GHZ (Greenberger-Horn-Zeilinger) states, reporting statistically sound fidelities in real time without destroying the entire ensemble. In addition, our QSC protocol removes the assumption that the states are identically distributed (but still assumes independent copies); can achieve close N −1 scaling, in the number of states measured N ; and can be implemented in a device-independent manner. Together, these benefits make our QSC protocol suitable for benchmarking large-scale quantum computing devices and deployed quantum communication setups relying on entanglement in both standard and adversarial situations.",

          "abstract": "The ability to generate efficient and coherent frequency combs using photonic integrated circuits offers tremendous potential for a range of applications. X-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is promising for developing next-generation microcomb-driven photonic systems, providing a diversity of functionalities through combined χ ( 3 ) and electro-optic effects. Normal-dispersion Kerr combs are critically needed because of their standout advantages, yet this dispersion regime remains unexplored on x-cut TFLN. Here, we design and demonstrate microresonators suitable for the robust generation of normal-dispersion Kerr combs. We show Kerr combs that substantially surpass state-of-the-art microcombs on x-cut TFLN in key performance metrics and an ultrabroad frequency comb whose existence is underpinned by both normal-dispersion Kerr dynamics and stimulated Raman scattering. Our work will unlock high-speed and low-energy-consumption photonic circuits for communications and signal processing enabled by a monolithic microcomb technology while also stimulating investigations of previously unknown nonlinear states that may synergize hybrid material nonlinearities.",

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by α-synuclein accumulation and dopaminergic neuron degeneration, with dopamine (DA) oxidation emerging as a key pathological driver. However, the mechanisms underlying this neurotoxic process remain unclear. Using PD patient-derived and CRISPR-engineered induced pluripotent stem cell midbrain dopaminergic neurons lacking DJ-1, we identified defective sequestration of cytosolic DA into synaptic vesicles, which culminated in DA oxidation and α-synuclein pathology. In-depth proteomics, state-of-the-art imaging, and ultrasensitive DA probes uncovered that decreased vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) protein and function impaired vesicular DA uptake, resulting in reduced vesicle availability and abnormal vesicle morphology. Furthermore, VMAT2 activity and vesicle endocytosis are processes dependent on adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), which is notably reduced in DJ-1–deficient dopaminergic neurons. ATP supplementation restored vesicular function and alleviated DA-related pathologies in mutant dopaminergic neurons. This study reveals an ATP-sensitive mechanism that regulates DA homeostasis through VMAT2 and vesicle dynamics in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, highlighting enhanced DA sequestration as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD.",

Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of opioid receptors (ORs) offer a promising approach to enhance opioid efficacy while reducing risks of overdose. In this study, we unveil the selective mechanism of PAM modulation of the OR family through structure elucidation of the δ-opioid receptor and μ-opioid receptor (μOR) bound to orthosteric agonists and PAMs BMS986187 (BMS187) and BMS986122 (BMS122). In addition, we uncovered an unexpected but conserved allosteric site across the transmembrane helices TM2 to TM4 of ORs, occupied by BMS187 but not BMS122. Leveraging these structural insights, we designed 9-(5-(4-chlorophenyl)furan-2-yl)-3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-3,4,5,6,7,9-hexahydro-1 H -xanthene-1,8(2 H )-dione (MPAM-15), whose αβ cooperativity factor is 33-fold higher than BMS122 and threefold higher than BMS187, indicating markedly stronger positive allosterism. Animal studies demonstrate that MPAM-15 shows excellent brain penetration and enhances morphine-induced antinociception without exacerbating respiratory depression or constipation. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that MPAM-15 promotes and stabilizes the conformational equilibrium of μOR toward the canonical active state, providing a mechanistic basis for its enhanced allosteric potency. These discoveries substantially advance our understanding of OR allosteric mechanism and pave the way for the structure-based development of allosteric opioid analgesics.",

We developed a functional screening workflow in which we screen panels of TCRs for reactivity to individual viral genomes or to ~1000 viral reference strains and then sort out the immunogenic peptides by labeling antigen-presenting cells that are in proximity to activated T cells. Using this workflow, we identified the target specificities of T cells that are circulating in up to 14% of individuals, including a pre–COVID-19 seasonal coronavirus-reactive TCR that cross-reacts with peptides within pandemic coronaviruses; an influenza B–reactive TCR that targets a highly conserved epitope; and TCRs targeting Herpesviridae family viruses that cause long-term latent infections.

This study reveals a reciprocal regulatory relationship between TOPPs and ethylene insensitive 2 (EIN2)–mediated ethylene signaling. We identified that ethylene can induce TOPPs ’ expression, and topp1/4/5 mutants exhibited partial ethylene insensitivity with reduced EIN3 protein. Mechanistically, TOPPs function upstream of EIN2 and interact with its carboxyl-terminal domain (CEND) to dephosphorylate the S655 residue. This site-specific dephosphorylation promotes EIN2 stability and EIN2 CEND nuclear accumulation, thereby activating ethylene responses. Notably, EIN2 S655A -YFP/ein2-5 plants displayed constitutive ethylene responses and improved salt tolerance. Further investigation showed that EIN3/EIN3 like 1 (EIL1) activates TOPPs ’ expression by binding to their promoters, amplifying ethylene signaling accordingly. Together, our finding establishes TOPPs as key regulators in ethylene signaling and reveal a dephosphorylation switch mechanism governing EIN2 function, providing critical insight into how EIN2 posttranslational modifications mediate plant stress adaptation.",

Prominent examples include the one-dimensional (1D) chiral edge and 2D chiral surface states found in 2D and 3D quantum Hall materials under magnetic fields, respectively. However, these boundary states are restricted to specific fixed dimensions, so they hardly facilitate cross-dimensional energy and information transport. Here, we fabricate a unique 3D photonic antiferromagnetic topological insulator with net zero magnetization that can simultaneously support different-dimensional hinge states and unpaired surface Dirac cones on neighboring facets. Owing to the chiral anomaly present in a finite-size sample, the gapless surface Dirac cone, neighbored by facets with surface Dirac masses of opposite signs, is further converted, exhibiting 2D planar one-way propagation. In conjunction with 1D hinge states, we experimentally observe a closed chiral loop for nonreciprocal hinge–surface transport across dimensions in topological photonics, similar to that theoretically proposed in 3D quantum anomalous Hall materials. Our findings enrich the chiral boundary features of 3D magnetic topological insulators and offer a topological strategy for exploring ideal cross-dimensional devices.",

Here, we report a one-step vacuum synthesis deposition of copper(I) iodide clusters with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields by engineering the stereohindrance of the organic ligand. When codeposited copper(I) iodide and 3,5-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)pyridine (35DCzPPy) with minimal steric hindrance near the pyridine group, [35DCzPPy] 4 Cu 2 I 2 clusters are uniformly assembled without copper-copper aggregation. Consequently, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on clusters show a peak external quantum efficiency of 19.4%, a maximum luminance of 34,232 candelas per square meter, and a record operating T 50 lifetime of 4186 hours at 100 candelas per square meter. Moreover, we integrated the LEDs onto backplane drivers for active-matrix (AM) cluster LED (CLED) display panels, which enables the prototype of a high–dynamic-range pico-projector.

Although chemical gradients are known to drive diffusiophoretic migration of colloids, these nonequilibrium forces have largely been ignored in porous media flows. Under typical subsurface conditions, flow velocities within preferential pathways exceed phoretic velocities by orders of magnitude, suggesting that diffusiophoresis would be limited to stagnant pockets. Here, using microfluidic experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling, we show that even moderate solute gradients, typical of natural mixing, can markedly alter colloid transport. We uncover a previously overlooked effect: cross-streamline phoretic migration within preferential flow pathways, which changes macroscopic dispersion by orders of magnitude and suppresses the impact of geometric disorder on transport. Our findings challenge classical models of colloid transport, highlighting the broad implications of solute gradients for technological, biomedical, and environmental applications.",

Here, we investigated how circHomer1 , a brain-enriched circular RNA derived from the Homer1 gene, affects hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Our results demonstrate that circHomer1 plays a vital role in mediating the dendritic targeting of messenger RNAs that encode postsynaptic proteins by acting as a molecular bridge between the motor protein Kinesin 1 and core components of neuronal ribonucleoprotein granules, including Fused in Sarcoma and Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, at dendrites. This interaction influences synaptic function, the structural morphology of dendritic spines, and hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory.

Moreover, T cell defects were recently involved in the age-related loss of tissue integrity and function. Mechanistically, thymic involution is driven by several factors, including hormonal modifications and chronic inflammation, leading to functional changes in the hematopoietic and stromal compartments. These progressive changes alter the cross-talk between developing T cells and thymic epithelial cells, which is pivotal for thymic function. Promising strategies to counteract thymic involution and rejuvenate immune T cell function have been recently identified. This review summarizes key insights into the underlying mechanisms of thymic involution and discusses current and emerging rejuvenation strategies to restore thymic function.

Electrophysiology shows that ivermectin activates GlyR even with strychnine present. Structures with both ligands reveal intermediate states featuring a desensitized TMD and an ECD between closed and desensitized conformations, providing insights into domain cooperativity and ligand efficacy. Molecular dynamics simulations show how ivermectin affects strychnine dynamics. These data support a model where ivermectin activates GlyRs through a concerted and near-symmetric TMD mechanism, whereas allosteric ECD motions are graded and spatially heterogeneous.
