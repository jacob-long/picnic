          "abstract": "Two decades of genetic studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have identified more than 100 genes harbouring rare risk mutations 1–13 . Despite this substantial heterogeneity, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses have identified convergent patterns of dysregulation across the ASD postmortem brain 14,15–17 . To identify shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD-linked mutations, we assembled a large patient collection of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells, consisting of 70 hiPS cell lines after stringent quality control representing 8 ASD-associated mutations, idiopathic ASD, and 20 lines from non-affected control individuals. Here we used these hiPS cell lines to generate human cortical organoids, profiling by RNA sequencing at four distinct time points up to 100 days after in vitro differentiation. Early time points harboured the largest mutation-specific changes, but different mutations converged on shared transcriptional changes as development progressed. We identified a shared RNA and protein interaction network, which was enriched in ASD risk genes and predicted to drive the observed downstream changes in gene expression. CRISPR–Cas9 screening of these candidate transcriptional regulators in induced human neural progenitors validated their downstream convergent molecular effects. These data illustrate how risk associated with genetically defined forms of ASD can propagate by means of transcriptional regulation to affect convergently dysregulated pathways, providing new insight into the convergent impact of ASD genetic risk on human neurodevelopment.",

          "abstract": "Optical amplifiers are fundamental to modern photonics, enabling long-distance communications1, precision sensing2,3 and quantum information processing4,5. Erbium-doped amplifiers dominate telecommunications but are restricted to specific wavelength bands1,6, whereas semiconductor amplifiers offer broader coverage but suffer from high noise and nonlinear distortions7. Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) promise broadband, quantum-limited amplification across arbitrary wavelengths8. However, their miniaturization and deployment have been hampered by watt-level power requirements. Here we demonstrate an integrated OPA on thin-film lithium niobate that achieves >17 dB gain with <200 mW input power—an order of magnitude improvement over previous demonstrations. Our second-harmonic-resonant design enhances both pump generation efficiency (95% conversion) and pump power utilization through recirculation, without sacrificing bandwidth. The resonant architecture increases the effective pump power by nearly an order of magnitude compared with conventional single-pass designs, while also multiplexing the signal and pump. We demonstrate flat near-quantum-limited noise performance over 110 nm. Our low-power architecture enables practical on-chip OPAs for next-generation quantum and classical photonics.",

          "abstract": "Ultralight axion particles are candidates for dark matter1, conjectured to form stable, macroscopic field configurations in three-dimensional space, resulting in the possible formation of topological defect dark matter2,3,4 (TDM). Exploring their possible existence through a realistic parameter space requires considering interactions that extend beyond the constraints imposed by astrophysical observations of stellar cooling processes5. Here we report the outcome of an experiment that monitors possible transient rotations of polarized spins, which could be induced by the interaction with topological defects, carried out by correlating five noble-gas laboratory set-ups located in two cities. Amplification and optimal noise filtering in hyperpolarized noble-gas spins greatly enhance the sensitivity to TDM-induced spin rotations, reaching approximately 10−6 rad. Through this, we set constraints on the axion–nucleon coupling across an axion mass range from 10 peV to 0.2 μeV, achieving 4.1 × 1010 GeV at 84 peV. These values exceed known constraints imposed by astrophysical observations, although these are obtained under different model assumptions. Our approach could further stimulate broad beyond-Standard Model physics searches, such as transient axion waves, axion stars, axion strings and Q-balls.",

          "abstract": "Integrated circuits for communications play an enabling role when it comes to outer-space exploration thanks to their small footprint and low weight1,2,3. However, owing to the severe irradiation effects of space energetic particles, the implementation of radiation-tolerant electronic circuits remains a challenge4,5,6. Here we report the observation of the space radiation effect on a satellite-based device and find that atomically thin materials are expected to accumulate minimal radiation-induced damage in principle. Accordingly, on the basis of a 4-inch wafer-scale monolayer 2D MoS2 process, we implement an atomic-layer transistor-based radiation-tolerant radio frequency (RF, 12–18 GHz) system with both transmitters and receivers for spaceborne communication. For on-orbit experiments, the 2D communication system was successfully launched to the approximately 517 km low Earth orbit. Notably, the system maintains a bit error rate (BER) of less than 10−8 in the transmitted data after 9 months of on-orbit operation, indicating substantial radiation tolerance and long stability. The lifespan of the 2D communication system is predicted to be about 271 years even on the geosynchronous orbit with a much harsher radiation environment. This work showcases the unique prospects of 2D electronics for spaceborne applications.",

          "abstract": "Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, 100–200 nm) light sources are crucial for advanced spectroscopy, quantum research and semiconductor lithography1,2,3. Compared with conventional large-scale VUV generation technologies4,5,6,7, second-harmonic generation (SHG) through nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals8,9,10 is the simplest and most efficient method. However, the scarcity of suitable NLO crystals has constrained the production of VUV light through SHG: existing materials fail to meet phase-matching requirements, suffer from low conversion efficiency or have severe growth limitations11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. In this study, we report the development of the fluorooxoborate crystal NH4B4O6F (abbreviated as ABF) as a promising material for VUV light generation. VUV devices with specific phase-matching angles were constructed, achieving a record 158.9-nm light through phase-matching SHG and a maximum nanosecond pulse energy of 4.8 mJ at 177.3 nm with a conversion efficiency of 5.9%. The enhanced NLO performance is attributed to optimized arrangements of fluorine-based units creating asymmetric sublattices. This work provides further material in the NLO field, with potential for applications in compact, high-power VUV lasers using ABF.",

          "abstract": "Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is an interesting topic with broad scientific and technological impact1,2,3,4. Twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2) is a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI)5,6,7,8,9,10, exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall effect11,12,13,14. As the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization15,16, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the Chern insulator (CI)/FCI states. Here we demonstrate control of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states, by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe2. At low excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, that is, electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states under helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature17,18. Both optical training and direct switching are most effective near CI and FCI states, which we attribute to a gap-enhanced valley polarization of optically pumped holes. The magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of ferromagnetic, and thus CI (or FCI) domains. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological spintronics, quantum memories and creation of exotic edge states by programmable patterning of integer and fractionally quantized anomalous Hall domains4,19.",

          "abstract": "Time-dependent drives hold promise for realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems1,2,3. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems4,5, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives6,7. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Here, using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by n-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is ‘doubly tunable’: one way by driving frequency, the other way by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent 2n + 1. Using quantum-state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a two-dimensional configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.",

Pesticide residues were detected in 70% of sites and emerged as the second strongest driver of soil biodiversity patterns after soil properties. Our analysis further revealed organism- and function-specific patterns, emphasizing complex and widespread non-target effects on soil biodiversity. Pesticides altered microbial functions, including phosphorus and nitrogen cycling, and suppressed beneficial taxa, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacterivore nematodes. Our findings highlight the need to integrate functional and taxonomic characteristics into future risk assessment methodology to safeguard soil biodiversity, a cornerstone of ecosystem functioning.",

          "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that Parkinson’s disease (PD) may have its origin in the enteric nervous system (ENS), from where α-synuclein (αS) pathology spreads to the brain1,2,3,4. Decades before the onset of motor symptoms, patients with PD suffer from constipation and present with circulating T cells responsive to αS, suggesting that peripheral immune responses initiated in the ENS may be involved in the early stages of PD1,5,6,7. However, cellular mechanisms that trigger αS pathology in the ENS and its spread along the gut–brain axis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that muscularis macrophages (ME-Macs), housekeepers of ENS integrity and intestinal homeostasis, modulate αS pathology and neurodegeneration in models of PD8,9. ME-Macs contain misfolded αS, adopt a signature reflecting endolysosomal dysfunction and modulate the expansion of T cells that travel from the ENS to the brain through the dura mater as αS pathology progresses. Directed ME-Mac depletion leads to reduced αS pathology in the ENS and central nervous system, prevents T cell expansion and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction, suggesting a role for ME-Macs as early cellular initiators of αS pathology along the gut–brain axis. Understanding these mechanisms could pave the way for early-stage biomarkers in PD.",

          "abstract": "Most bacterial pathogens are polylysogens, harbouring multiple vertically transmitted prophages1,2,3. These prophages enhance bacterial pathogenicity and survival by encoding virulence factors and anti-phage defence systems while retaining the capacity for horizontal transfer. Thus, prophage-encoded anti-phage defences must block propagation of external phages without inhibiting the spread of the prophages that encode them. Here we identify HepS—an abortive infection system encoded on the Gifsy-1 prophage constituted of a single HEPN domain protein—which restricts phages of the Siphoviridae family. We demonstrate that in its native host context of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, HepS both senses phage infection and enacts abortive infection. Structures of HepS reveal a tetrameric nuclease complex that undergoes allosteric activation upon recognition of Siphoviridae tail tip proteins during production of new phage particles. Once activated, HepS cleaves specific transfer RNA anticodon loops and arrests phage replication. Gifsy-1, a Siphoviridae itself, evades self-targeting by expressing a tail tip variant that does not trigger HepS, as do co-resident Siphoviridae prophages Gifsy-2 and Gifsy-3. This evasion permits Gifsy-1 to spread despite encoding HepS. These findings reveal a mechanism by which a prophage defends the host while maintaining its propagation abilities.",

          "abstract": "Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve more than 90% accuracy on popular benchmarks such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding1, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. Here, in response, we introduce Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be an expert-level closed-ended academic benchmark with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 2,500 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable but cannot be quickly answered by internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a marked gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.",

          "abstract": "Cambrian Burgess Shale-type (BST) fossil biotas document nearly complete snapshots of the oldest Phanerozoic marine ecosystems1,2,3,4. However, the rarity of deposits bearing high-diversity BST biotas5 has restricted our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of the Cambrian explosion. Here we report the Huayuan biota—a lower Cambrian (Stage 4, approximately 512 million years ago) BST Lagerstätte from an outer shelf, deep-water setting of the Yangtze Block in Hunan, South China. The Huayuan biota yields remarkable taxonomic richness, comprising 153 animal species of 16 phylum-level clades dominated by arthropods, poriferans and cnidarians, among which 59% of species are new. The biota is comprised overwhelmingly of soft-bodied forms that include preserved cellular tissues. The complex ecosystem contained diverse radiodonts and pelagic tunicates, filling a gap of high-diversity BST biotas from the Cambrian Stage 4. Critically, multivariate ordination based on a global dataset of Cambrian BST biotas places the Huayuan biota within a main transition of marine animal ecosystems between Cambrian Age 3 and Age 4. Network analysis reveals close faunal connections between the Huayuan and Burgess Shale biotas, indicating transoceanic dispersal. Dated shortly after the Sinsk event6,7,8, the Huayuan biota illuminates differences in the impacts of this extinction in shallow- versus deep-water settings during the first Phanerozoic mass extinction and offers critical insights into the transformation of global ecosystems in the early Cambrian.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotic genome replication is surveyed by the S-phase checkpoint, which coordinates sequential origin activation to prevent the exhaustion of poorly defined, rate-limiting replisome components 1–3 . Here we show that excessive origin firing saturates chromatin-bound proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)—a sliding clamp for DNA polymerase processivity and Okazaki fragment processing 4 —thereby restricting further PCNA loading and lagging-strand synthesis when checkpoint control is lost. PCNA-associated factor 15 (PAF15) emerges as a dosage-sensitive regulator of this process 5–9 . During unperturbed S phase, the entire soluble PAF15 pool binds to chromatin, leaving no reserve to stabilize PCNA under conditions of excessive origin activation. PAF15 binds to PCNA specifically on the lagging strand through a high-affinity PIP motif and occupies the DNA-encircling channel, protecting the clamp and associated enzymes from premature unloading by the ATAD5–RFC complex. Conversely, overexpression of PAF15 or forced redistribution to the leading strand disrupts replisome progression and induces cell death. These detrimental effects are mitigated by Timeless–Claspin, which blocks PAF15–PCNA binding on the leading strand. E2F4-mediated repression fine-tunes PAF15 expression to ensure optimal dosage and strand specificity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized replisome constraint: when PAF15–PCNA assemblies are exhausted, the S-phase checkpoint globally restricts origin activation, linking a strand-specific rate-limiting mechanism to global replication dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The Stoner–Wohlfarth antiferromagnet (AFM), an extension of the classical Stoner–Wohlfarth model originally describing the magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic nanoparticles1,2, refers to a single-domain AFM whose Néel vector can be coherently switched by the magnetic field. These AFMs not only retain the inherent advantages of antiferromagnetism but also feature controllable Néel vector and a perfect switching ratio, thus emerging as promising building blocks for ultradense magnetic memories and high-throughput computing systems3,4. However, bulk AFMs are not the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs owing to the hard-to-switch Néel vector and inevitable multidomain structure3,5,6,7. Here we report that CrPS4, a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) A-type AFM, exhibits ideal characteristics of the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs, because of the dominance of antiferromagnetic exchange over the magnetic anisotropy and high quality of vdW interfaces. The antiferromagnetic order undergoes a ferromagnet (FM)-like binary switching with the magnetic field rather than the layer-by-layer flipping observed in other 2D A-type AFMs. Moreover, we deduce the characteristic exchange length of several vdW A-type AFMs and propose a criterion for judging the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs. Our work therefore establishes a universal framework for understanding the magnetization reversal in layered AFMs and promotes the effective use of 2D AFMs in advanced spintronic devices.",

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters, the Universe’s largest halo structures, are filled with an X-ray-emitting gas with a temperature between 10 million and 100 million degrees. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures1,2,3. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematics remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of energy conversion within clusters4. High-resolution spectral mapping with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observatory5 offers a way forward6,7. Here we present XRISM kinematic measurements of the Perseus cluster, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner approximately 60 kpc, probably associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, SMBH feedback drives gas motions, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could have a substantial role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources to robustly characterize the velocity fields and their role in the evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for SMBH feedback models.",

Current hard X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities 1–5 overcome this by amplifying shot noise from a high-peak-current electron bunch via self-amplified spontaneous emission 6 in a single pass through long undulators, delivering very high brightness but with a noisy, multi-spiked temporal and spectral profile. Cavity-based XFELs (CBXFELs) 7–9 were proposed to close this gap by recirculating spectrally filtered X-ray pulses in a Bragg-reflecting cavity synchronized to a high-repetition-rate electron beam. Here we show lasing with multi-pass gain at 6.952 keV in a 132.8-m round-trip diamond-based Bragg cavity 10 at the European XFEL, matched to the 2.23-MHz bunch spacing of the superconducting accelerator 5 . Under stringent length and angular stability requirements, a ring-up in the cavity across successive bunches was observed, producing spectrally pure, microjoule-level pulses. This establishes the feasibility of CBXFELs in an accelerator environment and validates diamond Bragg optics for X-ray resonators. The demonstrated spectral purity opens a path to next-generation X-ray science, which demands highly coherent, stable sources.",

However, the precise mechanisms by which these drugs bring about benefits and the potential clinical risks are not yet fully understood. The serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) was reported to be a Gq-coupled receptor and the primary interoceptive target of psychedelics4,5. Here we compared psychedelics and their non-hallucinogenic analogues (nHAs) using in vitro and in vivo approaches, finding that 5-HT2AR-mediated non-canonical Gi signalling is essential for hallucinogenic effect. We further presented five cryo-electron microscopy structures of 5-HT2AR–Gi/Gq in complex with psychedelics or nHAs. Structural analysis and pharmacological investigation revealed that a special contact between nHAs with 5-HT2AR mediated the signalling bias. Building on this insight, we identified a 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine derivative, DOI-NBOMe, which exhibits potent and selective Gq-biased activity, and demonstrates promising therapeutic effects in mouse models without hallucinogenic effect. Our finding uncovers the functional mechanisms underlying the Gi signalling mediated by 5-HT2AR and provides valuable insights for designing psychedelic-based drugs with minimized risk from hallucinogenic effects.",

          "abstract": "During infection, many RNA viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), form specialized biomolecular condensates, viral factories (VFs), where viral transcription and replication occur1,2. Paradoxically, high protein concentrations are typically required for condensate nucleation3, yet attaining sufficient protein levels in infection is thought to require VFs for viral transcription and replication. Here, to uncover how viruses solve this paradox to establish VFs, we visualized early infection of RSV in real time with single genomic viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) resolution. Our results reveal that VFs are nucleated from infecting vRNPs rather than de novo in the cytoplasm. VF nucleation further requires in-virion pre-assembly of viral protein–protein interaction networks on vRNPs to form ‘pre-replication centres’ (PRCs). PRCs are potent condensate nucleation seeds due to their efficient recruitment and retention of viral proteins. The high affinity of PRCs also results in increased association of the viral polymerase and its co-factors, allowing efficient viral transcription even in the absence of VFs. Together, these activities create a feed-forward loop that drives rapid VF formation. PRC assembly depends on in-virion viral protein levels and is highly heterogeneous among virions, explaining cell-to-cell heterogeneity in infection progression, and identifying heterogeneous virions as an important origin of infection heterogeneity. Together, our results show that in-virion pre-assembly of PRCs kick-starts viral condensate nucleation upon host-cell entry and explains cell-to-cell heterogeneity in RSV infection.",

Here we introduce a universal 3D microfabrication/nanofabrication strategy compatible with a broad range of materials by precisely manipulating optofluidic interactions within a confined 3D space, enabling the creation of volumetric, free-form 3D microstructures/nanostructures. A femtosecond-laser-induced heating spot generates a localized thermal gradient, providing precise spatiotemporal control over optofluidic interactions of the nanoparticle-laden dispersions. This enables the rapid and highly localized assembly of nanoparticles with diverse shapes and compositions—including metals, metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials and quantum dots—into complex 3D microstructures. To demonstrate its versatility, we fabricate multifunctional microdevices, such as 3D microfluidic valves with size-selective sieving functionality, achieving fast separation of microparticles/nanoparticles with distinct dimensions, as well as microrobots integrated with four distinct functional materials, achieving multimodal locomotion powered by different external stimuli.

Although primary infection is often subclinical, persistent EBV infection can drive immune dysregulation and long-term complications. Despite the ubiquity of infection, the determinants of EBV persistence following primary exposure remain poorly understood, although human genetic variation partially contributes to this phenotypic spectrum 1–3 . Here we demonstrate that existing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of human populations can be used to quantify persistent EBV DNA. Using WGS and health record data from the UK Biobank ( n = 490,560) and All of Us ( n = 245,394), we uncover reproducible associations between blood-derived EBV DNA quantifications and respiratory, autoimmune, neurological and cardiovascular diseases. We evaluate genetic determinants of persistent EBV DNA via genome association studies, revealing heritability enrichment in immune-associated regulatory regions and protein-altering variants in 148 genes. Single-cell and pathway level analyses of these loci implicate variable antigen processing as a primary determinant of EBV DNA persistence. Further, relevant gene programs were enriched in B cells and antigen-presenting cells, consistent with their roles in viral reservoir and clearance. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping and predicted viral epitope presentation affinities implicate major histocompatibility complex class II variation as a key modulator of EBV persistence. Together, our analyses demonstrate how re-analysis of human population-scale WGS data can elucidate the genetic architecture of viral DNA persistence, a framework generalizable to the broader human virome 4 .",

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure1. Studying their progenitors, protoclusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. However, detecting protoclusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization2,3,4. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations located several protocluster candidates by identifying overdensities of z ≳ 5 galaxies5,6,7,8,9. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a protocluster, JADES-ID1, at z ≈ 5.68, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of \\({L}_{{\\rm{bol}}}=(1.{5}_{-0.6}^{+0.5})\\times 1{0}^{44}\\,{\\rm{erg}}\\,{{\\rm{s}}}^{-1}\\) and infer a total gravitating mass of \\({M}_{500}=(1.{8}_{-0.7}^{+0.6})\\times 1{0}^{13}\\,{M}_{\\odot }\\), making this system a progenitor of today’s most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as z ≈ 5.7. Also, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely10, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.",

Here we functionally examined how the cortical song premotor region HVC, which is necessary for zebra finch song1, controls the sequential production of learned song syllables. We found that HVC could generate the complete sequence of learned song syllables independently of its main synaptic input pathways. Thalamic input to HVC was needed for song initiation, but it was not required for transitions between syllables or for song completion. We showed that excitation of HVC neurons during song reliably caused vocalizations to skip back to the beginning of the song, in a manner reminiscent of a skipping record. This restarting of syllable sequences could be induced at any moment of the song and relied on local circuits within HVC. We identified and computationally modelled a synaptic network, including intratelencephalic premotor and corticostriatal neurons within HVC that are essential for completing song syllable sequences. Together, our results show that the learned zebra finch song is controlled by a cortical sequence-generating network in HVC that, once started, can sustain production of all song syllables independent of major extrinsic input pathways. Thus, sequential neuronal activity can be organized to fuse well-learned vocal motor sequences, ultimately achieving holistic control of this naturally learned behaviour.",

However, how HSPGs mechanistically mediate signalling at the cell surface—particularly in the context of cell surface RNA—remain poorly understood. During developmental and disease processes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), a heparan sulfate-binding factor, regulates endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis3. The regulatory paradigm for endothelial cell-mediated selectively of VEGF-A binding and activity has largely been focused on understanding the selective sulfation of the anionic heparan sulfate chains4,5,6,7,8. Here we examine the organizational rules of a new class of anionic cell surface conjugates, glycoRNAs9,10, and cell surface RNA-binding proteins (csRBPs11,12). Leveraging genome-scale knockout screens, we discovered that heparan sulfate biosynthesis and specifically the 6-O-sulfated forms of heparan sulfate chains are critical for the assembly of clusters of glycoRNAs and csRBPs (cell surface ribonucleoproteins (csRNPs)). Mechanistically, we show that these clusters antagonize heparan sulfate-mediated activation of ERK signalling downstream of VEGF-A. We demonstrate that the heparan sulfate-binding domain of VEGF-A165 is responsible for binding RNA, and that disrupting this interaction enhances ERK signalling and impairs vascular development both in vitro and in vivo and is conserved across species. Our study thus uncovers a previously unrecognized regulatory axis by which csRNPs negatively modulate heparan sulfate-mediated signalling in the context of angiogenesis driven by VEGF-A.",

The superfluid phase has been observed in wide-ranging bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems1,2,3,4. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid—termed a supersolid5,6,7,8. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained unknown9,10,11. Here we report observation of a superfluid-to-insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons. Mapping the transport behaviour of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid on increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low-temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase.",

Many studies focus on parasite and vector ecology in isolation, neglecting the interactions between climate, malaria control and the socioeconomic environment, including disruption from extreme weather3,4. Here we integrate 25 years of African data on climate, malaria burden and control, socioeconomic factors, and extreme weather. Using a geotemporal model linked to an ensemble of climate projections under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 (SSP 2-4.5) scenario5, we estimate the future impact of climate change on malaria burden in Africa, including both ecological and disruptive effects. Our findings indicate that climate change could lead to 123 million (projection range 49.5 million to 203 million) additional malaria cases and 532,000 (195,000–912,000) additional deaths in Africa between 2024 and 2050 under current control levels. Contrary to the prevailing focus on ecological mechanisms, extreme weather events emerge as the primary driver of increased risk, accounting for 79% (50–94%) of additional cases and 93% (70–100%) of additional deaths. Most increases stem from intensification in existing endemic areas rather than range expansion, with significant regional variation in impact. These results highlight the urgent need for climate-resilient malaria control strategies and robust emergency response systems to safeguard progress towards malaria eradication.",

Here we use genetic tools in mice to identify a small group of neurons that are acutely sensitive to circulating blood volume and initiate a reflex that compensates for decreased filling of the heart in an upright posture and haemorrhage. Vagal PIEZO2 neurons form characteristic end-net endings in the heart, lower blood pressure in response to optogenetic stimulation and display blood-volume-dependent responses with every heartbeat that are time-locked to atrial and ventricular systole. Knockout of Piezo2 and/or ablation of PIEZO2 neurons in vagal ganglia eliminates this heartbeat-coupled nerve activity, causes orthostatic hypotension and compromises cardiovascular stability during trauma-induced blood loss. Together, these findings demonstrate that vagal mechanoreceptors monitor the cardiac cycle and initiate a blood-volume-dependent reflex that defends the constancy of circulation.",

Yet the absence of periodicity fundamentally limits determination of their three-dimensional (3D) structure at atomic resolution. Despite major theoretical, experimental, and computational advances in characterizing short- and medium-range order9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24, quantitative determination of complete 3D atomic arrangements in amorphous materials remains experimentally demanding. Atomic electron tomography (AET) now provides a pathway to direct 3D atomic mapping in these materials25,26,27. Here we present a quantitative analysis of AET, showing how robust image preprocessing, denoising, projection alignment and normalization, advanced tomographic reconstruction, atom tracing, elemental classification and atomic position refinement collectively enable reliable determination of 3D atomic coordinates and elemental identities in amorphous materials. Using multislice-simulated datasets of amorphous Si, SiGeSn and CoPdPt nanoparticles under varying noise levels, our workflow outperforms an alternative approach28 in both positional precision and classification accuracy. For CoPdPt, we identify 95.1% of Co, 99.0% of Pd and 100% of Pt atoms, with corresponding 3D positional precisions of 29 pm, 12 pm and 6 pm, respectively, under realistic dose conditions. These results establish practical guidelines and quantitative benchmarks for achieving accurate AET of non-crystalline materials, and the underlying framework can be broadly applied to other tomographic imaging modalities for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.",

Pathogenic mutations in OSTα/β have been associated with cholestasis7,8.

Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human OSTα/β in complex with cholesterols and an endogenous substrate, elucidating the structural basis for the function of OSTα/β. OSTα/β is assembled in a novel dimer-of-heterodimers manner: two OSTα units form the homodimeric core, with two OSTβ units bound to the periphery. OSTα adopts the G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) fold and contains a unique cysteine-rich loop with seven palmitoylation sites; these cooperate with transmembrane helices 5 and 6, constituting a BA recognition site. A positive cavity in OSTα connects the BA site and facilitates the transmembrane translocation of BAs through OSTα/β.

Taking advantage of inherent low sensitivity of a nuclear transition to its environment9, orders of magnitude more emitters can be hosted in a solid-state crystal compared with current optical lattice atomic clocks10. Furthermore, solid-state systems needing only simple thermal control11 are key to the development of field-deployable compact clocks. Here we explore and characterize the frequency reproducibility of the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock transition, a key performance metric for all clocks. We measure the transition linewidth and centre frequency as a function of the doping concentration, temperature and time. We report the concentration-dependent inhomogeneous linewidth of the nuclear transition, limited by the intrinsic host crystal12 properties. We determine an optimal working temperature for the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock at 196(5) K, at which the first-order thermal sensitivity vanishes. This would enable in situ temperature co-sensing using different quadrupole-split lines, reducing the temperature-induced systematic shift below the 10−18 fractional frequency uncertainty level. At 195 K, the reproducibility of the nuclear transition frequency is 220 Hz (fractionally 1.1 × 10−13) for two differently doped 229Th:CaF2 crystals over 7 months.

High- T c materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model—a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice—is believed to capture the essential physics of high- T c materials 1–5 , obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging 6 . The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moiré WSe 2 (refs. 7,8 ), in which low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable 9–11 , presents a new platform for studying the high- T c problem. Here we tune moiré WSe 2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moiré unit cell ( ν = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high- T c phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at ν = 1, superconducting domes on electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states such as strange metals 12–14 . Twist-angle dependence studies further show that the highest T c always occurs adjacent to the Mott transition 3,15 .

          "abstract": "Early development across vertebrates and insects critically relies on robustly reorganizing the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs into individualized cells 1,2 . This intricate process is orchestrated by large microtubule structures that traverse the embryo, partitioning the cytoplasm into physically distinct and stable compartments 3,4 . Here, despite the robustness of embryonic development, we uncover an intrinsic instability in cytoplasmic partitioning driven by the microtubule cytoskeleton. By combining experiments in cytoplasmic extract and in vivo, we reveal that embryos circumvent this instability through two distinct mechanisms: either by matching the cell-cycle duration to the time needed for the instability to unfold or by limiting microtubule nucleation. These regulatory mechanisms give rise to two possible strategies to fill the cytoplasm, which we experimentally demonstrate in zebrafish and Drosophila embryos, respectively. In zebrafish embryos, unstable microtubule waves fill the geometry of the entire embryo from the first division. Conversely, in Drosophila embryos, stable microtubule asters resulting from reduced microtubule nucleation gradually fill the cytoplasm throughout multiple divisions. Our results indicate that the temporal control of microtubule dynamics could have driven the evolutionary emergence of species-specific mechanisms for effective cytoplasmic organization. Furthermore, our study unveils a fundamental synergy between physical instabilities and biological clocks, uncovering universal strategies for rapid, robust and efficient spatial ordering in biological systems.",

Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements26,27, and instead uses a free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses28,29 to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micrometre-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom-array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom–cavity coupling and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fibre array as a proof of principle for networking applications30. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10-fold improvement in finesse.

In this context, a recent report describing the three-dimensional structure determination of an amorphous solid using atomic-resolution electron tomography (AET) is truly remarkable3. If validated, such an analysis would be groundbreaking. Here we address this issue and investigate whether and when AET can identify all or most atoms in an amorphous nanoparticle. By simulating AET, we reveal limitations on the structural and chemical information AET can determine from noisy electron images. For monoatomic nanoparticles, the structure can be determined with an atomic-position accuracy of tens of picometres under stringent fluence, sampling and projection requirements. For multi-element amorphous nanoparticles, chemical identification resolution is determined by noise and experimental sampling. Heavier atoms are more easily resolved than lighter ones, and large chemical analysis uncertainties emerge when atomic peak and background intensities overlap. Using these insights, we delineate nanoparticle size, composition, electron fluence and image sampling requirements for AET. The results serve as a benchmark for future experiment design and demonstrate a viable approach for amorphous structure determination validation using AET.",

The allergic state is typified by the presence of allergen-reactive immunoglobulin E (IgE), which triggers mast cell degranulation upon allergen encounter, manifesting in pruritis, oedema and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis. Over the past century, the prevalence of allergic diseases has increased markedly, suggesting that environmental rather than genetic factors are mediating this change 2 . Although many hypotheses connecting environment to allergy exist 3–6 , the biological mechanisms that underpin environmentally mediated protection from allergy are unknown. Here we show, using a mouse model of allergic disease, that exposure to immunostimulatory environments generated cross-reactive adaptive immune memory, which tracked with obstructed type II immune responses upon allergen exposure. We found that engagement of cross-reactive adaptive immunity protected against future allergic sensitization and suppressed established allergic responses. Cross-reactivity in a tolerogenic context also prevented allergy, with the effect extending across antigenically complex exposures even at low protein sequence similarity. Our findings demonstrate a mechanistic relationship between environment and allergy, with general implications for adaptive immune function in natural settings.",

Here we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human Ostα/β in apo and substrate-bound states at 2.6–3.1 Å resolution, revealing a distinctive membrane protein architecture that defines a new transporter class. Ostα/β forms a symmetric tetramer of heterodimers, with each Ostα subunit showing a new seven-transmembrane fold, augmented by a single transmembrane helix of Ostβ. This architecture is stabilized by extensive lipid modifications, including a palmitoylated cysteine-rich motif that forms a lateral substrate-binding groove. The structures uncover a unique transport pathway featuring two substrate-binding sites connected by an amphipathic helix-gated conduit. This design, conserved in the evolutionarily related TMEM184 family, suggests an ancient mechanism for substrate translocation. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate voltage-sensitive, bidirectional transport driven by electrochemical gradients, elucidating the efflux role of Ostα/β in vivo. Lipid interactions, notably palmitoylation-dependent trafficking, emerge as critical for stability and function.

          "abstract": "Deep learning models that predict functional genomic measurements from DNA sequences are powerful tools for deciphering the genetic regulatory code. Existing methods involve a trade-off between input sequence length and prediction resolution, thereby limiting their modality scope and performance 1–5 . We present AlphaGenome, a unified DNA sequence model, which takes as input 1 Mb of DNA sequence and predicts thousands of functional genomic tracks up to single-base-pair resolution across diverse modalities. The modalities include gene expression, transcription initiation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, chromatin contact maps, splice site usage and splice junction coordinates and strength. Trained on human and mouse genomes, AlphaGenome matches or exceeds the strongest available external models in 25 of 26 evaluations of variant effect prediction. The ability of AlphaGenome to simultaneously score variant effects across all modalities accurately recapitulates the mechanisms of clinically relevant variants near the TAL1 oncogene 6 . To facilitate broader use, we provide tools for making genome track and variant effect predictions from sequence.",

          "abstract": "Effort is costly: given a choice, we tend to avoid it1. However, in many cases, effort adds value to the ensuing rewards2. From ants3 to humans4, individuals prefer rewards that had been harder to achieve. This counterintuitive process may promote reward seeking even in resource-poor environments, thus enhancing evolutionary fitness5. Despite its ubiquity, the neural mechanisms supporting this behavioural effect are poorly understood. Here we show that effort amplifies the dopamine response to an otherwise identical reward, and this amplification depends on local modulation of dopamine axons by acetylcholine. High-effort rewards evoke rapid acetylcholine release from local interneurons in the nucleus accumbens. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on dopamine axon terminals to augment dopamine release when reward is delivered. Blocking the cholinergic modulation blunts dopamine release selectively in high-effort contexts, impairing effortful behaviour while leaving low-effort reward consumption intact. These results reconcile in vitro studies, which have long demonstrated that acetylcholine can trigger dopamine release directly through dopamine axons6,7,8,9,10,11, with in vivo studies that failed to observe such modulation12,13,14, but did not examine high-effort contexts. Our findings uncover a mechanism that drives effortful behaviour through context-dependent local interactions between acetylcholine and dopamine axons.",

          "abstract": "Our experiences contain countless details that may be important in the future, yet we rarely know which will matter and which will not. This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision-making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet, whether and how this ability supports adaptive behaviour is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory system’s ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision-making task in which participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across 5 experiments (total n = 535), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision-making under uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Although the distinction between episodic and semantic memory is supported by numerous neuropsychological studies, neuroimaging data have shown considerable overlap between regions that are activated during semantic and episodic remembering. This might indicate similar or shared mechanisms but might also result from inadequate task designs or poor functional magnetic resonance imaging signal coverage. Here we compared neural activations and representations associated with successful retrieval of episodic and semantic memories, using tasks that are more closely matched. A total of n = 40 participants recalled pairings between logos and brand names, where the pairings corresponded to real-world knowledge (semantic task) or were learned in an initial study phase (episodic task). Neither a priori-defined networks nor clusters generally activated by our task provided evidence for any difference between successful semantic and episodic retrieval, with the Bayes factor for the a priori networks supporting the null hypothesis of no difference.

We show that breakdown of information integration is a convergent effect of diverse anaesthetics across mammalian species. As the system disintegrates, brain dynamics become more difficult to control. Both effects are reversed upon re-awakening induced by thalamic deep-brain stimulation in the macaque. Regional breakdown of integrated information coincides with the species-specific spatial topography of PVALB/Pvalb gene expression. To provide mechanistic insight beyond correlation, we develop computational models for humans, macaques and mice that integrate species-specific connectivity and transcriptomic gradients, demonstrating their respective roles for controlling brain dynamics and information integration. We reveal evolutionarily conserved controllers of information integration in the mammalian brain.",

          "abstract": "In light of continued foreign interference in the US presidential elections, where undisclosed digital voter suppression advertising has been deployed, this study addresses the questions of who is exposed to these ads and whether and how such exposure influences voter turnout. Using a sample that resembles the US voting-age population, the study directly measures each individual’s ad exposure through a user-level real-time ad tracking tool, which is merged with the same individual’s survey responses to identify voter suppression content and its targeting patterns. By further matching individual-level exposure to voter suppression ads with the same individual’s verified voter turnout records, the study estimates the effects of voter suppression on actual turnout. The study findings from the 2016 US Presidential Election reveal clear geo-racial targeting patterns in voter suppression: non-Whites residing in the racial minority counties of battleground states were exposed to substantially more voter suppression ads than their counterparts. Moreover, exposure to voter suppression ads was associated with decreases in voter turnout at the population level, albeit small. The sharpest declines were observed among non-Whites residing in minority counties of battleground states, suggesting that the intensified turnout suppression among the targeted segments of the electorate may have played a role in shaping turnout.",

          "abstract": "Civil society has long been a catalyst for social change by reshaping structures, influencing values, and challenging power dynamics; however, its role in driving transformative change for biodiversity remains underexplored. To address this gap, we analyze 2,801 socio-environmental mobilizations documented in the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas). These mobilizations produce diverse outcomes that reveal distinct spatial, temporal, and sectoral patterns and proactively and reactively respond to environmental impacts across the globe. Notably, about 40% of these mobilizations occur within the top 30% of global priority lands for species conservation and their actions contribute to the achievement of key Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework targets focused on ecosystem protection, restoration, sustainable use, and inclusive spatial planning. Yet, one-third of mobilizations face repression, criminalization, or violence—pressures that are even more common in high-priority conservation areas. Moreover, mobilizations facing repressive outcomes contest environmental threats relevant for the KMGBF targets more extensively than those with progressive outcomes, underscoring the risks faced by movements driving biodiversity protection in critical regions. To amplify the transformative potential of socio-environmental mobilizations, we emphasize the importance of recognizing, strengthening, and protecting them through coordinated action among diverse social actors. By fostering collaboration and targeted resource allocation, these efforts can empower socio-environmental mobilizations to catalyze meaningful and lasting change for biodiversity conservation.",

          "abstract": "After widespread extirpation, conservation efforts have restored large carnivores to portions of their former range. Substantial research has since focused on their ability to alter ecological communities through effects on herbivores and mesocarnivores, but the principles governing competition among multiple apex carnivores remain unclear. While mesocarnivore scavenging of apex carnivore kills drive “enemies with benefits” dynamics, subordinate apex carnivores seldom rely on scavenging. Instead, they proficiently hunt prey themselves that dominant apex carnivores can steal, fundamentally altering the dynamics of their interactions. We used 9 y of contemporaneous GPS telemetry and 3,929 potential kill site investigations from a reconstituted community of sympatric wolves and cougars in Yellowstone National Park to test whether such apex–apex dynamics instead follow an “enemies without benefits” framework. Wolf movement and resource selection were strongly linked to cougar kills, resulting in carcass theft (i.e., kleptoparasitism) that drove their interactions and led to cougar mortalities. In contrast, cougars avoided wolf kills, were tied to escape terrain, and did not kill wolves, producing an asymmetric dynamic that persisted across distinct seasonal contexts. However, as elk (the shared primary prey) declined longitudinally, cougars shifted their diets to smaller-bodied deer that were kleptoparasitized by wolves at one-sixth the rate of elk kills. Our findings demonstrate that prey diversity and landscape structure are critical for subordinate apex carnivores who experience severe interference competition from their dominant counterparts. This dynamic extends trophic theory and provides a framework for predicting the coexistence outcomes of carnivore restoration and the ongoing recolonization of wolves.",

          "abstract": "In mammalian sperm, high HCO 3 − concentrations in semen and the oviduct activate soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), which synthesizes cyclic AMP to regulate sperm motility. Here, we demonstrate that sAC orthologs in echinoderms and fish, species whose sperm fertilize eggs in aquatic environments with low HCO 3 − , are activated by alkaline pH rather than HCO 3 − . In human sAC, two charged residues coordinate HCO 3 − and are essential for HCO 3 − -mediated activation. In contrast, pH-regulated sACs and orthologs from 13 phyla have these residues replaced by neutral ones. These substitutions abolish the enzyme’s responsiveness to HCO 3 − and suggest that pH regulation of sAC is widespread in nonmammalian metazoans. Furthermore, we show that in sea urchin sperm, a rise of pH during spawning stimulates cAMP synthesis, a key step in the activation of motility. An evolutionarily significant pattern is emerging: Across phyla, sAC regulation by pH or HCO 3 − represents an adaptation to environments with low or high HCO 3 − , respectively.",

          "abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by a variety of specific genetic alterations that impact signaling pathway dependencies and therapeutic outcomes. Among the recurrently mutated genes, we identified RHOA , a member of the small GTPase family, as a selective dependency in DLBCL. Here, we show that RHOA function is essential for the survival of ABC DLBCL cells because it sustains oncogenic B cell receptor (BCR) signaling through maintaining a signaling-permissive conformation of the cortical actin network. This enables the formation of active BCR microclusters at the cell surface, ultimately resulting in constitutive, BCR-driven NF-κB survival signaling. Moreover, we found that RHOA controlled endocytosis of the BCR and thereby the assembly of the endolysosomal My–T–BCR multiprotein complex, a central activator of NF-κB consisting of MYD88, Toll-like receptor 9, and the internalized BCR. The recurrent DLBCL-associated RHOA R5W mutation rendered RHOA constitutively active in its GTP-bound state and changed the conformation of the actin network from primarily filamentous actin to globular actin. This altered actin state led to an increase in BCR microcluster formation, amplification of NF-κB signaling, and resistance to inhibitors targeting chronic active BCR signaling. Hence, our study establishes RHOA and its mutant isoforms as critical regulators of oncogenic BCR signaling in DLBCL.",

          "abstract": "The global transition to sustainable energy demands efficient lithium extraction from brines. While electrochemical lithium extraction using LiMn 2 O 4 (LMO) holds great promise, its practical application is hindered by mechanical degradation caused by anisotropic volume changes and stress accumulation during cycling. Herein, we present an entropy-driven amphiphilic self-assembly strategy that engineers stress-homogenized multilayer core–shell architectures, which innovatively mitigates stress accumulation by tuning the internal geometric structure to optimize stress–strain behavior, thereby synergistically enhancing ion distribution, transport kinetics, and electrochemical stability. This hierarchical interlayer architecture ensures uniform Li + distribution and redistributes internal stresses, mitigating localized stress concentrations and lattice expansion to preserve structural integrity throughout cycling. The optimized LMO establishes a dual benchmark for both capacity and cycling stability in hybrid capacitive deionization, achieving a remarkable lithium extraction capacity of 4.78 mmol g −1 with 96% retention over 100 cycles, outperforming both its unoptimized counterpart and other reported materials of the same type. Finite element simulations further elucidate a 48% reduction in maximum stress compared to disordered counterparts, underscoring the critical coupling between ion diffusion and stress evolution. This paradigm provides a pathway for developing advanced materials with intrinsically stable architectures for sustainable lithium extraction.",

          "abstract": "Studying dopamine signaling in nonmodel organisms is crucial for understanding the broad range of behaviors not represented in traditional model systems. However, exploring new species is often hindered by a scarcity of tools suitable for nongenetic models. In this work, we introduce near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) to investigate dopamine dynamics in meadow voles, a rodent species that exhibits distinct changes in social behavior and neurobiology across photoperiods. We observe increased dopamine release and release site density in voles housed in short photoperiods (which induce a social phenotype), suggesting adaptations linked to environmental changes. Moreover, pharmacological and extracellular manipulations demonstrate that short photoperiod/social voles exhibit heightened responsiveness to dopamine-increasing interventions and resilience against suppressive conditions. These findings highlight a significant association between dopamine signaling and photoperiod-driven changes in social behavior and establish nIRCats as an effective tool for expanding our understanding of dopamine dynamics across nonmodel organisms.",

          "abstract": "The spatial coordination between cellular organelles and metabolic enzyme assemblies represents a fundamental mechanism for maintaining metabolic efficiency under stress. While previous work has shown that membrane-bound organelles regulate metabolic activities and that membrane-less condensates conduct metabolic reactions, the coordination between these two organizations remains unaddressed. By using a combination of proximity labeling, superresolution fluorescence microscopy, and metabolite analyses using isotopic tracing, we investigated the relationships between these metabolic hotspots. Here, we show that nutrient deficiency elongates mitochondria and transforms the ER from a tubular to sheet-like morphology, coinciding with increased mitochondrial respiration and inosine 5′-monophosphate levels. These structural changes promote the colocalization of purinosomes with these organelles, enhancing metabolic channeling. Disruption of ER sheet formation via MTM1 knockout destabilizes purinosomes, impairs substrate channeling, and reduces intracellular purine nucleotide pools without altering enzyme expression. Our findings reveal that organelle morphology and interorganelle contacts dynamically regulate the assembly and function of metabolic condensates, providing a structural basis for coordinated metabolic control in response to nutrient availability.",

However, how the high diversity of bumblebees in the QTP evolved and contributed to their diversification in adjacent and far-reaching regions remains unclear. Here, we explored this question using a widespread bumblebee species, Bombus pyrosoma . Phylogenomic analysis revealed a history of dispersal out of the QTP and distinct lineage divergence along elevations within the species. Four major chromosomal inversion variants were identified, and shifts in their frequency with altitude were consistent with patterns of lineage divergence. The highland bumblebees showed stronger metabolic robustness and better flight performance under cold environments, whereas lowland ones excelled under warm conditions. Forty-one percent of the positively selected genes were located in the inversion regions and were mostly associated with fatty acid metabolism and information processing. Mutation with a strong candidate gene, elovl6 , possibly modulated long-chain fatty acid elongation, which facilitated bumblebee flight under thermal stress. Finally, genomic inversion analyses across 22 bumblebee species–17 native to the QTP–corroborate the widespread involvement of inversions in the elevational diversification of bumblebees. Overall, our findings revealed that chromosomal inversions play a pivotal role in facilitating local adaptation and dispersal out of the QTP in a bumblebee, providing insights into the genomic underpinnings of bumblebees’ diversification.",

During the maturation process, specific regions of the FUS-LC sequence-core-1, core-2, and core-3-become structured, giving rise to nonpolymorphic fibrils. Coarse-grained simulations predict that kinetically the least stable fibril-like core-3 forms first while the most stable core-1 appears last, in accord with Ostwald’s rule of stages. The fibril structure of the C-terminal core-3, predicted using AlphaFold, shows that a β -strand appears in this region early during droplet formation and triggers FUS-LC assembly. Multichain simulations, which ensure the equality of the chemical potentials between the phases, show that the dense phase forms through nucleation and coarsening, resembling Ostwald ripening.

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages have applications in biotechnology, including human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety, and biosecurity. One example of resurging importance is phage therapy, the use of phages to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Phage therapy currently requires screening of environmental phages against the infecting strains for each individual patient, a laborious process that limits the development of standardized treatments. To overcome limitations of narrow host range inherent to many native phages, a robust genomic engineering platform is required which permits rapid and dependable genome production and engineering for nonmodel phage. Here, we describe an engineering platform for a phiKMV-like Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage, 41S1 that builds on previous work in the rapid assembly of small genomes through one-pot, High Complexity Golden Gate assembly (HC-GGA). This system divides the 41S1 genome into DNA fragments small enough to be conveniently synthesized and to avoid toxicity during DNA propagation, with all but one maintained in Escherichia coli . These fragments are readily assembled in a high accuracy, one-pot reaction; phages can be rescued by direct transformation into P. aeruginosa PAO1 or E. coli 10-beta cells. We demonstrate the precise generation of point mutations, DNA insertions, deletions, and the addition of fluorescence reporter genes that are expressed during phage replication. All viable genotypes could be generated with near 100% success rate with minimal screening. This system demonstrates the potential of HC-GGA for the rapid production and engineering of phages and provides a chassis for the development of phages that broadly target the opportunistic human pathogen P. aeruginosa .",

          "abstract": "Understanding how animal behavior evolves remains a major challenge, with few studies linking genetic changes to differences in neural function and behavior across species. Here, we identify specific sensory adaptations associated with the emergence of predatory feeding behaviors in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus. While Caenorhabditis elegans uses contact-dependent sensing primarily to avoid threats, P. pacificus has co-opted this modality to support both avoidance and prey detection, enabling context-dependent predatory behavior. To uncover a potential mechanism underlying the evolution of P. pacificus prey perception, we mutated 27 canonical mechanosensory genes and assessed their function using behavioral assays, automated behavioral tracking, and a machine learning analysis of behavioral states. While several mutants showed mechanosensory defects, Ppa-mec-6 mutants specifically also impaired prey detection, indicating the emergence of a mechanosensory module linked to predatory behavior. Furthermore, disrupting both mechanosensation alongside chemosensation revealed a synergistic influence for these modalities. Crucially, Ppa-mec-6 is expressed in the environmentally exposed IL2 neurons that represent the first point of predator–prey contact. Moreover, silencing Ppa-mec-6 expressing cells induced severe predation defects validating their importance for prey sensing. Thus, predation evolved through the co-option of mechanosensory and chemosensory systems that act together to shape the evolution of complex behavioral traits.",

          "abstract": "Two major mechanisms of axon degeneration have been identified. The first, a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, is a major mediator of developmental axon degeneration triggered by loss of trophic support. The second, a caspase-independent pathway mediated by the sterile alpha and HEAT/Armadillo motif containing 1 (SARM1) NADase, was found in studies of injury-induced Wallerian degeneration; it is also implicated in degeneration associated with traumatic brain injury, as well as some neurodegenerative diseases and neuropathies. Recent studies suggest that SARM1 functions as a metabolic sensor for the cellular nicotinamide mononucleotide/NAD+ ratio through its autoinhibitory armadillo repeats (ARM) domain. Here, we show a tight link between apoptotic and SARM1-dependent degeneration by demonstrating that SARM1 is activated during and contributes to apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, macrophages, and T cells. Mechanistically, the key apoptotic protease caspase-3 cleaves SARM1 within its ARM domain, relieving its autoinhibition and activating its NAD+ hydrolase activity. Using a knock-in (KI) mouse model with a SARM1 mutation that prevents caspase-3 cleavage, we show that apoptosis promotion by SARM1 in macrophages and T cells requires its cleavage, whereas in neurons deprived of trophic support, activation of SARM1 occurs both with and without cleavage. Our study identifies a central role for SARM1 in apoptosis in some cells that is mediated by SARM1 activation through caspase-3 cleavage; it provides a model for dissecting the contributions of the two modes of SARM1 activation in different cellular contexts; and it has implications for the selection of ortho- versus allosteric SARM1 inhibitors for treating neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Liquid water can be supercooled up to about 50 K below the melting point before undergoing homogeneous ice nucleation. Based on experimental thermodynamic observations and computer simulations, it was hypothesized that below this temperature and at pressures of several kbar, water undergoes a liquid–liquid phase transition (LLPT) and the transition line ends at a second critical point. However, challenges in experiments and simulations at such deep cooling leave doubts about the nature of the LLPT and the existence of the critical point. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations with a highly accurate and computationally efficient polarizable water model to establish the character of the LLPT and identify the location of the second critical point. Our microsecond-long simulations provide direct evidence of a well-defined moving interface between low-density and high-density water at conditions near the phase boundary. This provides decisive proof of a first-order transition between two liquid phases with distinct free energy basins separated by a barrier, taking a major step toward resolving this long-standing debate. These results offer new perspectives on supercooled water under pressure simulated with an accurate and realistic model suitable for studies of water in confined geological and biological environments.",

          "abstract": "Granular materials densify under repeated mechanical perturbations, nonequilibrium dynamics that underlies many natural and industrial processes. Because granular relaxation is governed by frictional contacts and energy dissipation, this aging behavior fundamentally differs from that of thermal glasses despite their apparent similarities. Here, we uncover how friction controls the compaction dynamics of granular packings subjected to quasistatic cyclic shear. Using discrete element simulations, we construct a dynamic state diagram as a function of strain amplitude and friction, revealing a rich interplay among jamming marginality, stabilization, and fluidization. We identify a friction-dependent crossover strain that separates aging and fluidized regimes, showing reentrant, nonmonotonic behavior: Increasing friction first suppresses fluidization but then promotes it through smooth, creep-like rearrangements. This transition is marked by a shift from intermittent, avalanche-like rearrangements to continuous, diffusive motion. Our findings demonstrate that friction exerts a dual role in granular aging—both stabilizing and fluidizing—thereby uncovering the fundamental nonequilibrium mechanisms that govern compaction, rheology, and aging in athermal disordered systems. More broadly, our results reveal a general principle for how friction governs metastability and flow in athermal matter—from granular and frictional colloids to soils and seismic faults—linking microscopic contact mechanics to macroscopic dynamics.",

Here, we show that the genomes of several brown algae encode only a single AGO protein, containing the conserved functional domains characteristic of the family. Using the model brown alga Ectocarpus and a combination of cell biology, genetic, and transcriptomic approaches, we demonstrate that AGO is essential for the transition from vegetative growth to sexual reproductive development and for germline establishment. Our results further suggest that AGO functions in concert with microRNAs to regulate target genes primarily at the posttranscriptional level, likely through translational repression. Ectocarpus thus represents a rare example of a complex multicellular organism that relies on a single AGO protein to regulate key developmental processes, pointing to a minimalistic model of RNA-based regulation in brown algae.",

Experimental evolution for lack of aggregation selected for fimbrial mutations and we found that fimbriae are required on both interacting S. maltophilia cells for aggregation.

Further, in coculture with P. aeruginosa , wild-type S. maltophilia formed aggregates, resulting in up to 75-fold increased survival from P. aeruginosa competition compared to fimbrial mutants. Finally, multiple other bacterial species similarly aggregated upon exposure to P. aeruginosa PQS, indicating a more general response.

To decouple subcellular distributions from dorsal–ventral axis cues, we perturbed patterning by ultraviolet ventralization. These results establish microprobe CE–MS for deep subcellular proteomics in intact embryos and reveal spatially distinct protein distributions during early fate specification.

Despite some promising preclinical evidence, this combination therapy has shown limited efficacy in patients with homologous recombination (HR)–proficient tumors. To investigate this discrepancy between preclinical and clinical results, we profiled the effects of PARP inhibition in prostate cancer models in the presence or absence of AR inhibition. Surprisingly, AR inhibition impaired response to PARP inhibitors in castration-sensitive cells and had no effect on response in castration-resistant cells.

Although intracellular crowding is known to strongly alter macromolecule mobility, how cytoplasmic structures physically modulate diffusion remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic crowding controls diffusivity using live-cell experiments and porous media modeling approaches. Confocal microscopy combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements revealed an anticorrelation between free-green fluorescent protein diffusivity and the heterogeneous cytoplasmic structure abundance in live mammalian cells. This motivated the development of a multiscale model, where the cytoplasm is treated as a hierarchical porous medium with nanometric and micrometric obstacles. Numerically solving the model allowed us to predict the effective cytoplasmic diffusion coefficient for various obstacle volume fractions, and to identify tortuous and porous hydrodynamic hindrances as key diffusion reduction mechanisms. Comparison with our experimental results highlighted the importance of hydrodynamic interactions between diffusing molecules and nanometric obstacles. Importantly, we found that the effective cytoplasmic diffusivity was not dependent on specific intracellular regions but rather on the local intracellular obstacle volume fraction. Finally, the model was extended to predict the diffusivity of larger macromolecules, showing excellent agreement with literature data for several macromolecules and cell lines. This study provides insights into the physical mechanisms impeding intracellular diffusion, demonstrating the potential of porous media modeling approaches to predict transport mechanisms in dynamic or heterogeneous intracellular structures, as in cell motility, blebbing, and apoptosis.",

In legumes, high nitrate concentrations suppress symbiotic nitrogen fixation, a process mediated by MtNLP1 (NIN-like protein1). Although nitrate minimally affects NLP transcript levels, it strongly controls their nuclear localization. How posttranslational modifications regulate MtNLP1 function, however, has remained unclear. Here, we show that nitrate induces SUMOylation of MtNLP1 at lysine 589 and 795 and that this modification is essential for its biological activity. Loss of these SUMO sites compromises nitrate-mediated inhibition of nodulation and weakens MtNLP1 interactions with MtNIN and itself. Components of the SUMOylation machinery in Medicago truncatula physically interact and are essential for both nodulation and nitrate responsiveness, indicating broader roles for SUMOylation in symbiosis.

          "abstract": "Viral 2A sequences trigger a cotranslational peptide bond formation “skipping” event, termed “StopGo,” to generate two separate proteins from a single open reading frame without classical termination. To investigate the mechanism of StopGo, we determined the cryo-EM structure of a mammalian ribosome positioned at the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A (F2A) site. The structure shows how interactions between the F2A nascent chain (NC) and the ribosomal exit tunnel induce a conformational change in the peptidyl transferase center that precludes further translation elongation but instead pre-exposes the P-tRNA:F2A-NC ester bond for hydrolysis and NC release. Additionally, we bioinformatically characterized variation and host association across nearly 10,000 StopGo sequences identified in virus genomes. We expanded the canonical core motif to (D/G/C/N)(V/I)ExNPGP and identified additional rare but functional variants. We also revealed several distinct upstream motifs that we showed biochemically to be important for StopGo activity. Interestingly, although StopGo is known to be functionally active in plants, we found no evidence for natural utilization of StopGo by plant viruses. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into a unique translation recoding mechanism, and lay foundations for further optimization of multigene expression in biotechnology.",

Despite this, direct evidence for early wooden tool use remains exceptionally rare. Here, we present the earliest handheld wooden tools, identified from secure contexts at the site of Marathousa 1, Greece, dated to ca. 430 ka (MIS12). Through a systematic morphological, microscopic, taphonomic, and taxonomic analysis of the sampled wood macroremains, two specimens were securely identified as modified by hominins: one small alder ( Alnus sp.) trunk fragment bears clear working and use-wear traces consistent with a multifunctional stick likely used in digging at the paleolakeshore; and one very small willow/poplar ( Salix sp./ Populus sp.) artifact exhibits signs of shaping and potential use-wear. A third specimen, a large alder trunk segment, shows deep, nonanthropogenic striations interpreted here as claw marks from a large carnivoran. The wooden tools were excavated together with butchered elephant remains, small lithic artifacts and debitage, and worked bone, underscoring the diversity of engagement with a variety of different raw materials for technological purposes at Marathousa 1. These finds extend the temporal range of early wooden tools. They represent both the use of expedient larger handheld tools as well as a much smaller, likely finger-held wooden tool, which is uniquely small for the Pleistocene, expanding known functional purposes of early wood technologies. Moreover, they highlight the Megalopolis Basin’s exceptional preservation conditions and its role in understanding the evolution of hominin behavior.",

Here, we investigated the role of single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) in stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in modulating immune evasion and pathogenicity spectrum of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV). The ISKNV-encoded protein VP012R targets mandarin fish STING ( sc STING) for ubiquitination at residues C196 and K315, promoting its degradation to suppress interferon responses. Importantly, the K315/R315 polymorphism acts as a molecular switch: Susceptible species with the K315 residue exhibit STING degradation and viral immune evasion, whereas resistant species with the R315 residue maintain STING stability and antiviral defenses. Phylogenetic analysis linked K315 to high-mortality hosts (≥50% lethality) vs. R315 in resistant species (≤25% lethality). These findings suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying the viral pathogenicity spectrum may be modulated by host protein SAPs, thereby enhancing our understanding of host–virus coevolution in terms of biological diversity.",

Here, we unravel a specific Per1 inducer, Mic-628, enabling abrupt phase advance in mouse behavioral rhythms, regardless of the timing of oral administration. Mic-628-treated mice re-entrain to phase-advanced light–dark cycles significantly faster. The direct interaction between Mic-628 and CRYPTOCHROME1 (CRY1) does not simply inhibit CRY1 repressor activity. Instead, the interaction facilitates the CLOCK-BMAL1 assembly, ensuring highly specific induction via a tandem E-box motif upstream of the Per1 promoter. Importantly, Mic-628-driven Per1 induction is repressed by PER1 itself. Mathematical modeling indicates that both the CRY1- and PER1-mediated transcriptional regulation fix the phase of Per1 induction irrespective of intake time, thereby predominantly advancing the clock phase.

To clarify the origin, evolutionary history, and biogeography of Japan’s Pleistocene felids, we analyzed 26 ancient specimens previously assumed to be tigers. Using mitochondrial and nuclear genome hybridization capture and sequencing, paleoproteomics, Bayesian molecular dating, and radiocarbon dating, we found that all ancient Japanese “tiger” remains yielding molecular data were, unexpectedly, cave lions ( Panthera spelaea ). One specimen from Yamaguchi Prefecture, western Japan, was radiocarbon dated to 36,000-34,891 cal. BP. These cave lions likely dispersed to the Japanese Archipelago between ~72.7 and 37.5 thousand years ago (ka), when a land bridge connected northern Japan to the mainland during the Last Glacial Period. Our findings challenge the long-held view that tigers once took refuge in Japan, showing instead that cave lions were widespread in northeast Asia during this period and were the Panthera lineage that colonized Japan, reaching even its southwestern regions despite habitats previously thought to favor tigers.",

          "abstract": "For proper segregation of chromosomes and successful cytokinesis, chromosomes must first “congress”—gather in a tight plate near the spindle equator. Molecular mechanism(s) of congression are not fully understood. Here we combine live-cell microscopy, perturbations of microtubule motor activities, correlative light/electron microscopy, and computational modeling, to quantitatively characterize the early-prometaphase movements that bring the scattered chromosomes to the equator in human RPE1 cells. We find that the early-prometaphase movements are directed toward the center of the spindle axis and not the spindle poles. Centromere velocity of the centripetal movements is not constant, with centromeres moving faster at larger distances from the spindle center. We also detect that numerous short microtubules appear at kinetochores at the earliest stages of spindle assembly and prior to chromosome congression. Computational modeling reveals that a mechanism based on brief, stochastic, minus-end directed interactions between the short microtubules protruding from the kinetochores and long appropriately curved microtubules within the spindle accurately predicts the observed distance-velocity function. Further, the model predicts that insufficient numbers of microtubules protruding from the kinetochores decreases the velocity and randomizes directionality of congression movements. These predictions match changes in the chromosome behavior observed in cells with suppressed nucleation of microtubules at the kinetochore corona (RPE1 Rod Δ/Δ ). In contrast, predictions of computational models based on continuous pulling forces at kinetochores differ significantly from the experimental observations. Together, live-cell observations and modeling reveal a mechanism that enables the efficient and synchronized arrival of chromosomes to the spindle equator.",

          "abstract": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) can be either temporary or permanent, depending on the intensity and duration of noise exposure. Excessive noise exposure activates various cellular mechanisms in the cochlea, including oxidative stress, immune responses, and apoptosis. Still, the mechanisms underlying hearing recovery after transient threshold shift (TTS) and lack of recovery after permanent threshold shift (PTS), as well as their therapeutic implications for NIHL, remain unknown. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of longitudinal changes in the cochlear transcriptome of TTS and PTS mouse models. Our analysis revealed that noise-induced ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). Notably, the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) branch of the UPR returned to baseline levels following TTS but showed sustained activation following PTS. In addition, the proapoptotic factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was selectively induced in hair cells following PTS. Administering a PERK inhibitor prior to and following noise exposure hindered hearing restoration after TTS, indicating a requirement for PERK activation in hearing recovery. Inhibition of sustained PERK activation via a PERK inhibitor or reduction of CHOP expression via pharmacological chaperones facilitated partial hearing recovery following PTS. Together, these findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying NIHL and its prevention, highlighting UPR modulation as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

          "abstract": "Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death, is characterized by massive cell swelling and plasma membrane rupture. Although swelling was recently shown to occur in two steps, the molecular and biophysical mechanisms driving this process remained unclear. Using fast quantitative microscopy, we reveal that between the two swelling phases, cell volume transiently stabilizes despite sustained plasma membrane permeability to ions and small molecules. From a biophysical perspective, the existence of such a plateau is puzzling, as ion pumps should not be able to regulate cell volume under these conditions. To address this, we developed a physical model based on an ion pump and leak framework that incorporates the dynamics of nonselective pore formation. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the plateau phase is controlled by the dynamics of the gasdermin D (GSDMD) pore enlargement, which is modulated by ninjurin-1 (Ninj1) activation, possibly through intracellular calcium. Ninj1-mediated lesions are also required for the second swelling phase. We further show that fully opened GSDMD pores display an effective hydrodynamic radius slightly above 1.9 nm, providing an in situ upper bound for pore size. Together, our findings demonstrate that pyroptotic volume dysregulation emerges from the successive and interdependent actions of GSDMD and Ninj1, each imparting distinct permeability regimes associated with increased water filtration and decreased ion selectivity due to pore opening. These insights bridge molecular and biophysical perspectives on lytic cell death and may inform the broader understanding of membrane rupture in inflammatory and pathological contexts.",

In the current conceptual framework, the initial stone nidus is thought to include the aggregation of inorganic crystallites, the formation of which is favored by elevated concentrations of dissolved constituents. Here, we show that this highly prevalent stone type comprises a form of organic–inorganic polycrystalline biocomposite with integrated bacterial biofilms. Evidence from electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy reveal the unanticipated internal structure of kidney stones from human patients, where bacterial biofilms are intercalated between polycrystalline mineral layers, even in stones identified as “noninfectious” clinically, including those in patients without underlying urinary tract infections. We observe similar bacterial biofilm architectures on the surfaces of stone fragments obtained due to lithotripsy, suggesting that bacteria are intrinsic to the process of nephrolithiasis. Crystallites proximal to biofilm layers exhibit significantly smaller grain sizes, which indicate a larger local concentration of nucleation sites. Staining reveals that biofilm areas of these stones are enriched with bacterial DNA. That bacteria are now observed so broadly in kidney stones (including even in less prevalent struvite stones) may be conceptually salient: Based on the evidence adduced here, we propose a model in which the urine-rich environment of the kidney can impinge on bacterial calcium homeostasis and amplify bacterial production of nucleation templates such as extracellular DNA. The resultant counterion condensation intrinsic to polyelectrolytes charged beyond the Manning criterion (such as DNA) drastically enhances the probability of heterogeneous nucleation, thereby amplifying calcium oxalate stone formation.",

          "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (αS) plays a central role in several neurodegenerative diseases. Although predominantly neuronal, αS is also present in peripheral fluids such as serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it may contribute to disease propagation. However, its extracellular interactions remain poorly understood. By combining in situ NMR spectroscopy and bottom–up MS proteomics, we reveal that monomeric αS exhibits distinct interactomes in serum versus CSF. Both N- and C-terminal αS regions bind to serum components, while in CSF, αS remains largely unbound. The N- and C-terminal interactions are mechanistically diverse: C-terminal binding is electrostatic, whereas N-terminal interactions persist under high ionic strength, implicating hydrophobic interactions. Deletion of the first ten N-terminal residues, which include several hydrophobic side chains, abolishes these interactions, highlighting their functional importance. Proteomic profiling and NMR validation identify key αS serum partners, including albumin, γ-globulins, and lipoproteins, which, together, are sufficient to recapitulate the serum αS interactome and elicit redundant interactions with the αS N-terminal region. Despite such redundancy, αS methionine oxidation selectively disrupts N-terminal binding, suggesting a redox-sensitive mechanism regulating the αS extracellular interactome. Notably, C-terminal interactions are preserved when the N-terminal binding is detuned, indicating that the N- and C-termini elicit independent interactions with the extracellular matrix, a marked difference from the intracellular milieu. These findings uncover dynamic and fluid-specific αS interaction signatures, offering new molecular insights into its peripheral roles and identifying potential new epitopes as synucleinopathy biomarkers. These results are also relevant for other amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), for which αS serves as a prototype.",

          "abstract": "Compacting chromatin within the cellular nucleus presents a significant challenge for biology. Chromosomes must be both condensed and spatially organized to enable essential processes such as transcription and replication. Chromosome conformation capture experiments (e.g., Hi-C) provide valuable information about the spatial organization and, therefore, the connectivity between different genomic regions. These experiments inspired polymer models that describe the physical mechanism of the chromosomal energy landscape. The Full-Inversion Chromatin model (FI-Chrom), a data-driven approach for modeling genome organization, uses Hi-C contact maps to infer pairwise interaction potentials between all chromosomal loci. It combines Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-accelerated simulations with efficient training of tens of millions of parameters derived from the maximum-entropy principle to determine 3D structures of chromosomes that accurately reproduce Hi-C-like data. FI-Chrom does not make any a priori assumptions regarding chromosome architecture, making it applicable to any chromosome conformation capture experiment. Its derived structural ensembles capture all essential features from the short- and long-range interactions of typical chromosome organization, such as segregated compartments, chromosome territories, and fully or partially formed loops. Although Hi-C contains only structural information, FI-Chrom extends these data by revealing an emergent dynamical mechanism encoded in the inferred energy landscape. For example, simulations show that chromatin loops are not static architectural features but rather transient structural elements. Statistical analyses further indicate that loops confined within a single compartment occur more frequently than those spanning multiple compartments, highlighting the dynamic and compartment-dependent nature of chromatin organization.",

          "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation induces pyrimidine dimers in DNA, which block replication, but are efficiently removed by excision, allowing replication restart. Interestingly, soon after restart, the cells become capable of inducible stable DNA replication (iSDR) without new origin-initiations—suggesting unusual replication topology. The original idea was that the preexisting forks remain dormant even after UV-lesion removal, and when the new origin-initiated forks arrive, they rear-end the dormant forks, creating potential for iSDR. While there is origin-overinitiation after UV, the current idea is that preexisting forks are restarted—making the iSDR potential unclear. We used replication profiling of post-UV cells to investigate reactivation of UV-blocked forks. To compare profile time-sequences, we developed indexation procedure generating nested profile sets. Wild type nested set shows: 1) no replication during the first 30 min post-UV; 2) overinitiation from the origin combined with restart of preexisting forks during the next 30 min post-UV. The restart required RecBCD enzyme to repair double-strand breaks, confirming that the UV-stalled forks disintegrate and need recombinational repair to restart. Preexisting fork restart is separate from new origin-initiations by DnaA, as the dnaA (Ts) mutant at 42 °C restarts preexisting forks normally. Remarkably, the absence of powerful replication wave from origin-initiations in the dnaA mutant reveals a restart-initiated replication wave toward the origin, indicating that the restart mechanism causes fork triplication—potentially explaining the SDR phenomenon. There is no post-UV replication in the dnaA recBC double mutant, consistent with only two pathways of replication resumption in post-UV cells: restart or new origin-initiation.",

Here, we demonstrate an optical CV technique called opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter [ ( 100 nm ) 3 ]. This technique uses electric-double-layer modulation and lock-in detection to sensitively probe ion dynamics during cyclic voltammetry in nanoholes that are under total internal reflection illumination. We applied this method to study electric double layer (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol [Fc(MeOH) 2 ] redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson–Nernst–Planck–Butler–Volmer model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast. This work opens up opportunities for high-sensitivity, label-free analysis of electrochemical reactions in nanoconfined environments, with potential applications in pure nanocrystal growth and monitoring.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions in land plant fertilization from zooidogamy to siphonogamy were characterized by transformations of male reproductive cells. Basal land plants such as bryophytes and pteridophytes have motile sperm, whereas most seed plants have nonmotile sperm, delivered by a pollen tube. Despite being seed plants, gymnosperm cycads and ginkgo uniquely form highly multiflagellated and large motile sperm within pollen tubes. However, the evolutionary state of these male reproductive cells remains unknown. We clarified the gene expression profiles of Cycas revoluta pollen tubes and motile sperm swimming toward female reproductive cells. Male cycad cells expressed fewer genes associated with transcription, translation, and related processes, which is consistent across land plants. We compared the distinctive orthologous groups (OGs) of the genes specifically expressed in sperm and pollen tubes with those in other plants. Cycad pollen tubes shared several OGs with angiosperms but possessed significantly fewer gene copies and lacked cell wall remodeling and plasma membrane-localized receptor genes that contribute to rapid and guided growth. The growth mechanism of cycad pollen tubes might be largely different from angiosperm pollen tubes. In contrast, despite their morphological uniqueness, cycad sperm shared representative OGs with angiosperm sperm cells to the same extent as egg cells. In addition, a sperm-specific histone variant may contribute to transcriptional regulation via chromatin condensation like other male gametes. As an extant gymnosperm that retains zooidogamy with pollen tubes, the cycad represents a molecular intermediate state in the transition from zooidogamy to siphonogamy, providing insight into the evolution of land plant fertilization.",

Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual “pseudogap” metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi–Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi–Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of dopings and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multipoint correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a universal scaling behavior in magnetic and higher-order spin–charge correlations characterized by a doping-dependent temperature scale. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this temperature scale is comparable to the pseudogap temperature T ∗ . Our quantitative findings reveal a qualitative behavior of magnetic properties and spin–charge correlations in an emergent pseudogap and pave the way toward the exploration of charge pairing and collective phenomena expected at lower temperatures.",

LEPROTs localize to cis and medial Golgi in a coat protein complex I (COPI)-dependent manner. LEPROTs interact directly with COPI coats and simultaneously engage a variety of integral membrane proteins with relatively long TM domains at acidic pH. Deletion of LEPROTs in cells causes expedited release of TM receptors transiting through the Golgi. Loss of LEPROTs dysregulates receptor signaling activity, including that of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and transferrin receptor (TFRC), due to defective modification.

A single intranasal dose of cb1 vaccine elicits remarkably broad and potent immunity that overcomes existing parenteral vaccine’s limitations. cb1 induced robust neutralizing antibody and T cell responses that translated into complete protection in animal models, including prevention of viral transmission to unvaccinated contacts. Notably, cb1 provided cross-protection not only against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern but also against more divergent SARS-CoV-1 and hCoV-OC43, a breadth of immunity unparalleled by current vaccines.

          "abstract": "Machine learning holds great promise for classifying and identifying fossils, and has recently been marshaled to identify trackmakers of dinosaur footprints and address long-standing debates over whether some dinosaur tracks are the oldest birds or ornithopods (duck-billed herbivores and kin) in the fossil record, or alternatively were made by nonavian theropods. Existing methods in paleontology, however, require supervision and a priori labeling of training data by researchers, which can lead to bias. We employ an unsupervised machine learning technique for recognizing inherent patterns in shape data, using a disentangled variational autoencoder network, to a database of 1,974 footprints, spanning a diversity of dinosaurs across their evolutionary history, including modern birds. Our neural network identified eight features of shape variation that most differentiate these tracks: overall load and shape (amount of ground contact area), digit spread, digit attachment, heel load, digit and heel emphasis, loading position, heel position, and left–right load. With the unsupervised process finished, we a posteriori labeled each track based on published expert judgments, plotted them into morphospace, and applied distance metrics to group means and nearest neighbors, which showed 80 to 93% agreement with expert identifications. Controversial Late Triassic-Early Jurassic bird-like tracks group with fossil and modern birds and some Middle Jurassic three-toed tracks with ornithopods, supporting an older origin for these groups than recorded by body fossils. We provide an app, DinoTracker, to make this process accessible, and source code that can be adapted to other cases where paleontologists or biologists are studying patterns of shape variation.",

While numerous studies have explored the mechanisms and functions of body coloration as a sexual signal, the role of another essential property of light—polarization—remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the question of whether and how polarization signals achieve high conspicuousness under sexual selection, including their visibility and associated behavioral and morphological adaptations, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we identified a strikingly conspicuous polarization signal used specifically during courtship in the cuttlefish Doratosepion andreanum and investigated the underlying optical mechanism. The signal consists of a pattern of adjacent horizontally and vertically polarized areas, optimizing signal detectability for cephalopod polarization vision. This pattern is generated by reflective cells called iridophores and transparent muscle: light becomes horizontally polarized when reflected by iridophores, and its angle of polarization is then rotated to vertical when transmitted through a birefringent muscle layer. Our findings show the significant contribution of polarization of light to animal communication and reveal that polarization signals—like colorful sexual ornaments—can achieve high conspicuousness through fundamentally different optical mechanisms.",

However, how best to quantify these alternative processes impacting phenotypic variation remains unclear. Here, we examined trait evolution in two sister genera of endangered Asian primates, Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus . By assembling a de novo genome of the Trachypithecus pileatus group, which is geographically located in a transitional zone between these two genera, our integrated phylogenomic analyses clarified the evolutionary relationship of the T. pileatus group with other Trachypithecus species. We also identified that morphological similarities shared between this species group and Semnopithecus are the result of ILS, rather than gene flow or hybrid speciation. Across all chromosomes of the T. pileatus group, ILS contributed 8.9% of whole genome segments. Across these segments, we distinguished 77 genes such as FGFBP1 and FOXO1 that are involved in pathways of bone development and osteoblast differentiation. Functional experiments indicate that FGFBP1 genotypes shared by species of the T. pileatus group and Semnopithecus appear to enhance osteogenic capability and mineralization, possibly resulting in larger body size and similarities in skull morphology compared with other species of Trachypithecus . The study reveals that ILS has shaped the evolution of mixed traits within gene-regulatory networks, driving phenotypic diversity during periods of rapid species divergence in this highly successful primate radiation. ILS appears to be more common than previously thought and represents a critical step in accurately assessing the phylogeny of closely related taxa.",

Using polysynaptic viral tracing, we show that AgRP and POMC neurons receive indirect input from partially overlapping but distinct areas of the olfactory cortex, indicating that they process different sets of olfactory information. We also identify different complements of neurons more directly upstream of AgRP and POMC neurons that could relay olfactory cortical signals to the appetite neurons. Single-cell transcriptomics shows heterogeneous expression of neuromodulator receptors among AgRP neurons, suggesting variations in the signals they receive. Integrated viral tracing and RNA localization further reveals selected brain areas where upstream neurons express cognate receptor ligands.

          "abstract": "Whiteflies pose a major threat to crops worldwide, primarily because they transmit begomoviruses with which they have evolved intricate mutualistic relationships. The mutualisms are known to exacerbate whitefly invasions and drive widespread plant virus pandemics. Yet, certain plant genotypes are able to resist both the whiteflies and the viruses and a good understanding of the underlying mechanisms could help to develop more resistant varieties. Here, we show that the viruliferous whitefly Bemisia tabaci induces an early and strong release of the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene in cultivated tomato plants. This volatile functions as an airborne signal that primes neighboring conspecifics for enhanced resistance to begomoviruses, including Tomato yellow leaf curl virus and Papaya leaf curl China virus. These results challenge the view that whitefly-induced volatile emissions primarily benefit the insect vector, suggesting instead that the plant prioritizes antiviral defense over antiherbivore resistance. β-Caryophyllene exposure was also found to enhance the emission of β-Caryophyllene, methyl salicylate and β-myrcene upon whitefly attack, increasing plant attractiveness to the parasitoid Encarsia formosa . Using a β-caryophyllene overproducing transgenic tomato line and synthetic β-caryophyllene dispensers, we confirmed that β-caryophyllene exposure primes antipathogen defenses in tomato plants and confers improved plant fitness under sustained infestation by viruliferous whiteflies. Importantly, this defense priming is genotype-specific and limited to certain tomato cultivars, suggesting that β-caryophyllene-mediated resistance can be harnessed through selective breeding. Our findings reveal a volatile-based mechanism by which tomato plants may counteract the virus–vector mutualism, offering promising avenues for integrated pest and disease management.",

We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated subanatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs.

Structure–activity relationship–guided chemical proteomics identified the eukaryotic translation termination factor 1 (ETF1) as a target of the photo-stereoprobes, and this interaction was recapitulated with recombinant purified ETF1. We found that the photo-stereoprobes modulate programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanisms essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection without causing ETF1 degradation, thus distinguishing the photo-stereoprobes from other known ETF1-directed small molecules. We finally show that the photo-stereoprobes also inhibit the replication of additional viruses with noncanonical ribosomal frameshifting mechanisms.

Our findings reveal that HearNPV triggers a calcium response in enteroendocrine cells, leading to the release of midgut-derived tachykinin (TK). Released TK activates its receptor (TKR) in the brain, thereby promoting phototaxis and climbing behavior. Additionally, HaTTD14 functions as a downstream regulator of the TK–TKR signaling pathway.

However, the dynamics of nesprins within physiological forces and loading rates remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ magnetic-tweezers-based single-molecule manipulation alongside molecular dynamic simulations and AlphaFold structural predictions to comprehensively investigate the dynamics of force-bearing spectrin repeat (SR) domains of the giant nesprin-2 protein. Through direct quantification, we unveil that the numerous SRs undergo mechanical unfolding and refolding dynamics with distinct transition rates within several pN scale. Furthermore, we show that the giant nesprin-2 could act as an effective molecular absorber adeptly maintaining forces on the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton linkage within a few pN across displacement spans exceeding one μm. Notably, our findings imply that subtle pN-level mechanical forces intricately modulate nesprin–protein interactions via the dynamics of domain folding and unfolding.

Current protein deep learning models are predominantly trained on sequence and/or static structure data, which often fail to capture the dynamic nature of proteins. To address this, we introduce SeqDance and ESMDance, two protein language models trained on dynamic biophysical properties derived from molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses of over 64,000 proteins. Both models can be directly applied to predict dynamic properties of unseen ordered and disordered proteins. SeqDance, trained from scratch, has attentions that capture dynamic interaction and comovement between residues, and its embeddings encode rich representations of protein dynamics that can be further utilized to predict conformational properties beyond the training tasks via transfer learning. SeqDance predicted dynamic property changes reflect mutation effect on protein folding stability.

          "abstract": "Biological polymers often face a trade-off between stiffness, strength, and extensibility: Materials that are strong and stiff tend to be brittle, while those that are elastic and extensible usually lack strength. Here, we show that netcasting spiders (Deinopidae) overcome this trade-off by forming mixed-silk metastructures, which enable both high elastic deformation and load resistance. These spiders have evolved a unique predatory strategy, casting a sticky silk web over prey, which subjects the web radii to extreme strains far exceeding those sustained by typical spider silk fibers. The radii consist of a compound filament with an elastomeric core surrounded by looped bundles of thin fibers. This architecture results in an unusual mechanical profile: The threads are initially compliant and highly extensible, but they stiffen as the fiber loops straighten, enhancing load-bearing capacity. Notably, spiders control this compound architecture through a reel-spinning technique, controlling loop formation and fiber mixture to establish an elasticity gradient across the web—stiff and strong in the main frame lines, yet soft and hyperelastic in the lower radii that undergo the greatest deformation during prey capture. These findings represent a unique case of behavioral modulation of silk processing to circumvent biomaterial trade-offs, enabling extraordinary dynamics and specialization of web architecture. The herein described principle of looped fiber-reinforced elastomers may also be transferred to the design of artificial materials for applications that require both high elasticity and strength.",

          "abstract": "The quadratic bound (QB) principle proposed by Böhning and Lindsay in 1988 is an important special case of the majorization–minimization or minorization-maximization optimization principle. The quadratic upper-bound (QUB) principle is pertinent to minimization; the analogous quadratic lower-bound principle is pertinent to maximization. Unfortunately, in minimizing a loss f ( θ ) , the QUB principle is limited by the difficulty of finding a constant positive definite matrix B such that B − d 2 f ( θ ) is positive semidefinite for all θ . This paper proposes a generalization of the QB principle that avoids this limitation. In particular, we construct QUB algorithms by replacing the matrix B by a continuous matrix-valued function B n ( θ ) that dominates the Hessian d 2 f ( θ ) and depends on the both the current iterate θ n and the next potential iterate θ . In practice, we require B n ( θ ) to be diagonal with its diagonal entries separated in θ . In other words, the i th diagonal entry of B n ( θ ) depends on θ only through its i th entry θ i . Theoretical analysis confirms that this class of generalized QB algorithms enjoys global convergence in favorable circumstances. For the scalar case, the tangency condition that the second derivative equals the bound function at the current point promotes superlinear convergence. Several numerical experiments implemented in Julia illustrate the power of the generalized QB principle.",

          "abstract": "The ocean is thought to be the terminal sink for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), persistent organofluorine chemicals used widely in modern commerce for decades. Industry and stewardship programs phased out the most abundantly produced legacy PFAS in the early 2000s due to toxicity concerns. However, they have since been replaced by shorter carbon chain and “novel” chemistries, and past work hypothesized likely increases in these replacement PFAS that were not previously quantifiable. To address this gap, we measured bulk extractable organofluorine (EOF) in archived liver and muscle tissues from pelagic Subarctic pilot whales over the last several decades. Results show EOF concentrations peaked in 2011 and declined by over 60% by 2023. Among a broad suite of targeted and suspect PFAS measured using high-resolution mass spectrometry, only one was consistently increasing through 2023. Tissue concentrations of four main legacy PFAS that accounted for over 75% of EOF were all decreasing by 2023. The timing of peak concentrations depended primarily on whether they were transported to the subarctic by ocean circulation or atmospheric deposition, with the latter declining much faster. Oceanic transport and bioaccumulation modeling suggests that decadal-scale lags between production and food web bioaccumulation are primarily driven by marine transport processes. Large declines in tissue concentrations in this study reinforce the effectiveness of phase-outs in chemical production. However, other work showing stable or increasing EOF in human serum suggests many emerging PFAS with more neutral physicochemical properties may be preferentially accumulating in terrestrial and nearshore environments compared to legacy PFAS.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging and a key contributor to age-related diseases including cardiovascular disease. However, molecular pathways that safeguard mitochondrial homeostasis in the aging heart remain poorly understood. Here, we identify MTFR1L as a regulator of mitophagy that binds p-S65-Ub, a key signal amplifying the PINK1/Parkin axis. We find that MTFR1L is enriched in metabolically active tissues, particularly in the heart, where it regulates Parkin signaling. Genetic deletion of Mtfr1l in mice impairs stress-induced mitophagy and Parkin activation, leading to accumulation of damaged mitochondria, increased inflammation and senescence, and accelerated age-related cardiac dysfunction. Strikingly, cardiac expression of MTFR1L progressively decreases along with aging in mice, primates, and humans, coinciding with cardiomyocyte senescence and lipofuscin accumulation. Together, these findings uncover a role for MTFR1L in regulation of the p-S65-Ub/Parkin mitophagy axis and maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis during cardiac aging and suggest that age-associated loss of MTFR1L may contribute to age-related cardiac dysfunction. Based on these findings, we propose a therapeutic paradigm for the prevention of heart aging by restoring MTFR1L function.",

          "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which sustain lifelong blood cell production, emerge from hemogenic endothelium during embryonic development through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways. However, generating functional HSCs in vitro remains challenging, underscoring gaps in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, we identify GPR171, a P2Y-family G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), as a critical regulator of vertebrate embryonic HSC specification. Gpr171 is highly expressed in hemogenic endothelium and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. A deficiency in Gpr171 results in severe embryonic HSC deficits but does not impair vasculogenesis and primitive hematopoiesis. We further find that its endogenous ligand, coded by pcsk1nl , cooperates with Gpr171 to enhance HSC generation. Mechanistically, Gpr171 activates ERK1/2 and Notch signaling pathways independently and synergistically to promote HSC generation. Pharmacological treatment of zebrafish embryos with the human GPR171 ligand BigLEN significantly increases HSC numbers. Moreover, GPR171 signaling is evolutionarily conserved, as GPR171-deficient murine embryos also exhibit a significant reduction in functional HSCs. Overall, our findings reveal GPR171 as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of embryonic HSC specification and suggest its potential for translational applications in stem cell–based therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "The myosin superfamily encompasses over 70 classes, each with multiple subclasses, and exhibits substantial diversity in properties such as velocity, ATPase activity, duty ratio, and directionality. This functional diversity enables the specialized roles of each myosin in various organisms, organs, and cell types. Beyond these well-characterized parameters, a newly recognized property has recently come into focus: Certain myosins drive actin filaments along chiral curved trajectories. However, this newly identified property remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated this chiral motion in vitro using Chara corallina myosin XI ( Cc XI), which drives fast clockwise (CW) movement of actin filaments. This chiral motion arises from asymmetric displacement at the filament’s leading tip, and its curvature depends on the myosin density. Surprisingly, at elevated actin concentrations, filaments exhibiting chiral curved motion undergo collective dynamics, spontaneously forming a ring-shaped structure—termed the actin chiral ring (ACR)—that exhibits persistent CW rotation. ACRs display remarkable stability, continuing to rotate at their formation site until ATP is depleted, while maintaining their structure even after rotation ceases. This stability has not been reported among reported collective motions of cytoskeletal proteins driven by various motors. Our findings demonstrate that myosins with chiral activity can autonomously organize actin filaments into stable, chiral structures through collective motion, providing insights into actin self-organization by unconventional myosins. This paradigm offers a mechanistic basis for how motor-driven molecular asymmetry can give rise to coherent structural chirality at the cellular scale—an essential step in the emergence of cell chirality and asymmetry during development.",

          "abstract": "In mammals, passive acquisition of maternal immunoglobulins is essential for neonatal immune development and defense against infections. IgG, a central mediator of humoral immunity, is maternally transferred via distinct mechanisms depending on placental structure in placental mammals. In humans (hemochorial placenta), IgG is prenatally transported across the placenta, whereas in large domestic animals such as pigs and cows (epitheliochorial/connective chorionic placenta), IgG is exclusively transferred postnatally via colostrum and absorbed in the neonatal intestine. Rodents (allantoic chorionic placenta) employ both pathways. Critically, IgG must traverse multiple tissue barriers-including the placenta, mammary gland, and neonatal intestine-to reach the circulation of newborns. While FcRn is known to facilitate IgG transport in the placenta and neonatal intestine, the mechanisms underlying IgG secretion into milk remain unclear. Here, we identify FcγRIIB as the key transporter mediating maternal IgG transfer across the mammary gland in mammals. Using constitutive and conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that FcγRIIB deficiency impairs mammary IgG transfer, whereas its overexpression enhances milk IgG levels. Strikingly, in pigs, FcγRIIB is highly upregulated in mammary tissue prepartum, and its disruption abolishes IgG accumulation in colostrum. Our work opens avenues for improving neonatal immunity through targeted modulation of FcγRIIB-mediated IgG transport.",

In this study, we systematically analyzed the entire human surfaceome, identifying approximately 4,500 targetable sites and introducing potential binding seeds for initiating protein design applications. To validate these seeds, we implemented two experimental approaches (protein scaffolding and peptide cyclization) on three representative targets (FGFR2, IFNAR2, and HER3). Our results revealed a high success rate, showing that seeds provide valuable starting points for binder design against our identified targetable sites, as well as the need for constant improvements of computational protein design pipelines utilizing machine learning and physics-based methods. Additionally, we present SURFACE-Bind, an interactive database offering open access to all generated data.

However, aging is also associated with diminished tissue oxygenation. Here, we report that erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) from aged mice exhibit reduced responsiveness to low oxygen tension (PO 2 ) and release O 2 slower than those from young mice. In vivo, sensory stimulation evoked a smaller and delayed capillary RBC flow in aged mice. Although activity-evoked PO 2 dips were diminished in aged mice; experimentally reducing PO 2 to comparable levels did not restore capillary flow in aged mice, consistent with diminished RBC O 2 responsiveness observed ex vivo. Notably, RBCs from aged mice in heterochronic parabiosis pairs (young-aged) displayed faster responses to low PO 2 compared to those from aged mice in isochronic pairs (aged-aged). Together, these findings across multiple levels of analysis demonstrate that aging impairs RBC responsiveness to O 2 and suggest that improved RBC-mediated O 2 delivery contributes to the rejuvenating effects of parabiosis.",

          "abstract": "Agile and efficient modern flyers like birds and insects rely on complex aerodynamics to increase performance such as leading edge vortices, tip vortices, rapid pitch rotations as well as wing–wake and wing–wing interactions. However, their evolutionary origins are poorly understood. Early birds and their closest relatives like Microraptor had a multiwinged configuration featuring long pennaceous feathers on their arms, legs, and tail, a configuration not seen today. The skill of these early flyers has been debated, centering around what was driving the evolution of this multiwing configuration and its loss in favor of the modern two-winged configuration. In this context, the aerodynamics and wing–wing interactions of Microraptor during gliding flight are investigated. The gliding flight mechanics of Microraptor exhibit flow patterns consistent with those observed and quantitatively assessed in volant living animal species. We analyze leading edge vortices on the forewing and hindwing including beneficial wake interactions between them as well as tip vortices on the distinct distally flared hindwing. The latter is unique in Microraptor as the hindwing’s characteristic outer span flare provides the necessary surface for the tip vortex to be bound to and thus contribute additional lift. These findings suggest that Microraptor evolved toward utilizing leading edge and tip vortices and their aerodynamic interactions. This implies that such utilization was also being exploited by other early multiwinged theropods to differing extents as part of a crucial milestone in early flight evolution.",

          "abstract": "Classic models associate goal-directed upper limb movements with cortical motor areas and balance control with the brainstem. However, recent rodent studies suggest that medullary regions and local spinal circuits also contribute to forelimb execution, leaving it uncertain if these findings apply to humans. Critically, the dynamic interactions among medullary motor regions, intersegmental spinal networks, and cortical sensorimotor areas during hand movement control remain poorly understood. Here, through functional MRI (fMRI) studies in humans and mice during forelimb movement tasks, we reveal topographically organized corticomedullary networks, comprising the lateral rostral medulla (Lat-RM) and caudal medulla (CauM), that regulate forelimb movement. In mice, the corticomedullary coupling in both CauM and Lat-RM increased systematically along a ventro-medio-dorsal gradient, with the strongest links to primary motor and premotor cortices. In humans, higher‐order sensorimotor regions drove the strongest connectivity with CauM and Lat-RM, while the more medially located medial rostral medulla remained weakly engaged. Furthermore, simultaneous brain-spinal fMRI revealed distinct functional territories within the human C3–C4 cervical spinal cord, with ventral regions exhibiting strong connectivity to the medulla and dorsal regions to lower cervical segments. Together, our findings identify a conserved corticomedullary network underlying forelimb movement control across species, while also uncovering variation in cortical involvement. They indicate the presence of an indirect pathway involving both the reticulospinal pathway and the C3–C4 propriospinal system, which contributes to fine hand motor control in the mammalian brain.",

Studies on Shaker channels in Arabidopsis have provided a paradigmatic framework, but the rice genome encodes an additional member, OsKAT1, whose function remians poorly defined. OsKAT1-type channels are characterized by an innately short cytosolic C terminus, forming a unique clade of monocot-specific short Shakers that is prevalent in Poaceae species. In rice, OsKAT1 is predominantly expressed in the root stele. Disruption of OsKAT1 (KO mutation) leads to a significant reduction in K + secretion into the xylem sap delivered to the shoot. Patch-clamp experiments on root stele protoplasts of WT and KO plants indicate that OsKAT1 functions as an inward channel. Functional analyses in Xenopus oocytes reveal that despite activating at weakly negative voltages, OsKAT1 is intrinsically incapable of mediating substantial outward currents—a property attributed to its truncated C terminus. Together with outward K + channel activity, this feature enables stelar cells to remain significantly permeable to K + around the K + equilibrium potential. When expressed in Arabidopsis , OsKAT1 contributes to K + transport in the xylem sap, but only in wild-type plants that express SKOR, a Shaker channel specialized for this role. These results demonstrate that OsKAT1 constitutes a component of K + translocation to shoots and shed light on the energization and regulation underlying this function. Moreover, OsKAT1 is shown to improve rice adaptation to environmental conditions and enhance grain yield under field conditions through its facilitating root-to-shoot ion translocation.",

One of the crucial factors turns out to be the cushioning effect of the gas surrounding the droplet. This fact, together with the observation that almost all of the relevant literature was done in air, triggers the question what would happen when the liquid was a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid in thermal equilibrium with its own vapor, as is the case during transport of cryogenic liquids such as liquid hydrogen. To investigate precisely this question, we experimentally generate droplets in thermodynamical equilibrium with their own vapor, even before impact, such that minute energy exchanges of the droplet with its surroundings can trigger phase change. Using a frustrated total internal reflection setup, we make the exciting observation that depending on the impact speed and vapor conditions, the entrapment of vapor can be completely suppressed under boiling liquid conditions. We create a simplified model based on scaling arguments and perform numerical simulations considering both the compressible and condensable properties of the vapor layer that are in very good agreement with our experimental findings. Our results can be of great consequence to the pressures exerted during droplet impact and on an industrial scale may help better understand the loads experienced during sloshing wave impact inside cryogenic liquid containers.",

          "abstract": "Canopy shade environments can negatively impact plant growth and survival. Phytochrome A (phyA) is essential for seedling adaptation to deep shade, yet its role under moderate natural canopy conditions remains unclear. By expressing a phyA-nanoLUC reporter in Arabidopsis thaliana , we quantify diurnal fluctuations in phyA and its induction by low red to far-red (R:FR) ratio, simulating canopy shade. We uncover a key regulatory function for phyB, which increases phyA stability postdawn in unshaded conditions and modulates expression of PHYA in low R:FR. Further, we demonstrate that beyond its role as a deep shade sensor, phyA is an adept sensor of canopy shade, capable of detecting a range of R:FR ratios across light intensities. Mathematical modeling demonstrates that this property arises from the dynamic features of the phyA High Irradiance Response (HIR) mode of action. Interestingly, phyA synthesis is strongly induced by subtle reductions in R:FR ratio, and is robust to light perturbation, suggesting the phyA-sensory module is configured to detect modest shade. Spectral data from natural shade habitats provide ecological context for our laboratory findings. Physiological analysis indicates that under canopy shade phyA promotes seedling de-etiolation, organizes resource management, and accelerates reproductive development. We propose that this suite of responses, termed the “canopy adaptation strategy,” enhances survival chances under conditions where shade avoidance strategies are maladaptive.",

          "abstract": "Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor has transformed the treatment of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and the predominant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) variant F508del by delivering the faulty channel to the plasma membrane and potentiating its activity. However, the action of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on the molecular behavior of F508del-CFTR is unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on individual human F508del-CFTR Cl − channels using the patch-clamp technique and cells heterologously expressing F508del-CFTR. Chronic treatment of F508del-CFTR-expressing cells with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, but not pairs of CFTR modulators, stabilized F508del-CFTR, preventing channel deactivation in cell-free membrane patches and conferring upon it the current amplitude of wild-type CFTR with channel activity sustained at a level one-third that of wild-type CFTR. By incubating cells with different drug concentrations, we demonstrated that elexacaftor stabilizes the open-channel conformation of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR, while acute treatment of wild-type CFTR with elexacaftor increased current flow through the channel and potentiated channel gating. Of note, acute treatment of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR Cl − channels with elexacaftor and ivacaftor restored wild-type levels of channel activity to the CFTR variant, albeit its gating pattern was distinct from that of wild-type CFTR and characterized by infrequent prolonged bursts of channel openings. In conclusion, chronic treatment with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor plus acute treatment with elexacaftor and ivacaftor robustly corrects the processing, stability, and gating defects of F508del-CFTR. Our results reveal that elexacaftor is a triple-acting CFTR modulator with corrector, potentiator, and conduction activities, making it a valuable therapeutic to rescue CFTR variants with distinct molecular mechanisms of CFTR dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Type III secretion systems (T3SS) are critical virulence machines in many Gram-negative bacteria, enabling hierarchical secretion of translocases followed by effectors. In the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS, the regulatory protein InvE (SctW) enforces this order. Here, we show that InvE assembles into tetramers and higher-order oligomers and that oligomerization is essential for function. A 2.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals a tetramer built as a dimer of antiparallel dimers. Photocrosslinking maps one set of residues to the interdimer seams in this tetramer, while crosslinks from additional sites suggest lateral docking between dimers in alternative registries in vivo. Blue-native electrophoresis and SEC–MALS detect native high-molecular-weight species consistent with such assemblies. DNA-PAINT superresolution microscopy confirms the presence of higher-order InvE oligomers in vivo. Charge-reversal mutations that disrupt oligomerization collapse InvE to monomers and abolish secretion, effector translocation, invasion, and virulence. Together, these data define an oligomerization-based switch in which InvE reuses the dimeric face to form higher-order contacts that govern the transition from translocase to effector secretion.",

However, how working memory content evolves and is transmitted across cortical regions remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the flow of working memory information across the cortex using time-resolved fMRI decoding. Across multiple regions in visual and parietal cortex, we found that decoded working memory content drifted over time from the memoranda toward the later errors in memory reports, consistent with the dynamics of memory drift predicted by attractor models. These behaviorally predictive neural memory errors emerged earliest in higher-order dorsal visual area (V3AB) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS0) and then later in early visual cortex (V1), suggesting a propagation of mnemonic information originated in higher-level visual area. Interareal correlation analyses revealed that during memory maintenance, information flowed predominantly in a top–down manner—from higher to lower visual areas, whereas during passive viewing, feedforward dynamics prevailed. Together, our findings demonstrate that working memory maintenance involves temporally structured drift dynamics and feedback-dominated information flow across the cortical hierarchy, providing a mechanistic link between neural population dynamics and the formation of memory errors.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive changes in organ size and function occur in most animals, but how these changes are regulated is not well understood. Previous research found that mating in Drosophila females promotes intestinal stem cell proliferation and increases the overall size of the endodermal portion of the intestine (the “midgut”). Other studies reported mating-dependent changes in feeding behavior, midgut gene expression, and whole-body lipid storage, suggesting altered metabolism. Here, we show that mating dramatically alters female midgut metabolism and digestive function. Mating increased relative levels of TCA cycle intermediates, fatty acids, and ceramides in the gut, increased total midgut lipids and protein, and reduced relative carbohydrate levels. Mating also enhanced the efficiency of protein digestion relative to carbohydrate digestion. Corroborating a previous report [M. A. White, A. Bonfini, M. F. Wolfner, N. Buchon, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118 , e2018112118 (2021)], we found that the expression of genes that mediate protein and carbohydrate and metabolism was similarly altered. In addition, we noted a mating-dependent downregulation of oxidative stress response and autophagy genes. Mating-dependent increases in ecdysone receptor (EcR) signaling were important for increasing TCA cycle intermediates, protein, and ceramides in the female midgut, but had minimal effects on bulk lipid accumulation. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the physiological changes that occur during adaptive intestinal growth, and how they are regulated.",

          "abstract": "Topoisomerase enzymes are essential for the regulation of DNA topology. Human topoisomerase IIIα is a Type 1A topoisomerase that exists as a complex with RMI1 and RMI2, known as TRR. The TRR complex can unlink entwined DNA strands and is known to be important for resolving DNA replication and recombination intermediates. It has recently been proposed that TRR can also relax transient negatively supercoiled loops of DNA generated by the translocase PICH and that this activity may help to facilitate the resolution of ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs) between segregating sister chromatids. However, the mechanism by which TRR interacts with, and processes, negatively supercoiled DNA is not well understood. Here, we establish a single-molecule strategy to simultaneously measure real-time changes in supercoiling density and visualize the interactions of TRR with underwound DNA using a combination of optical tweezers and fluorescence imaging. We demonstrate that TRR relaxes highly negatively supercoiled DNA in a processive manner and that the timescale for relaxation is less than the expected lifetime of the negatively supercoiled loops generated by PICH. We also show that in the absence of free protein in solution, TRR remains bound to the DNA for long time periods after the torsional stress has been released. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for how TRR can relax negative supercoils, consistent with its proposed role in UFB resolution. Moreover, our assay could also be widely applied to study the interactions of other families of topoisomerases with negatively supercoiled DNA.",

          "abstract": "Some mammals develop amyloid plaques and type 2 diabetes, much like humans, depending on the sequence of their islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). In humans, IAPP forms a toxic oligomer with a parallel β-sheet across residues 23 FGAIL 28 S. Using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we monitor the structure of IAPP from seven different mammals, five of which are from species that can develop type 2 diabetes (ferret, raccoon, cat, baboon, and human) and three from those that do not (hamster, rat, and pig). G24 is isotope labeled to monitor for the presence of the oligomeric β-sheet previously found in human IAPP. For the species that develop type 2 diabetes, their IAPP is cytotoxic, and a β-sheet at G24 is observed during the lag phase prior to fibril formation. In contrast, the species that do not develop type 2 diabetes have nontoxic IAPP, and their IAPP does not form this β-sheet structure. Pig IAPP forms oligomers, but with a different structure that is nontoxic. Thus, an oligomer with a parallel β-sheet at G24 that resembles that of the known human IAPP oligomer correlates with cytotoxicity and propensity for type 2 diabetes. These results indicate that the sequence within the 20 to 29 region of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), long known to correlate with type 2 diabetes in mammals, determines the structure and toxicity of an oligomer, supporting the oligomer hypothesis for type 2 diabetes and providing an explanation other than plaque formation for why some mammals develop insulin deficiency in late-stage type 2 diabetes, and others do not.",

We performed integrated whole-genome, whole-exome, and transcriptome sequencing on 80 ESS tumors, comprising 32 low-grade (LG) and 48 high-grade (HG) tumors, to characterize their genetic landscape. The overall mutation burden was modest, with no significant difference between grades; however, we identified six hypermutated cases (7.5%) harboring POLE or mismatch repair mutations, genomic features predictive of immunotherapy response. We identified focal RAD54B amplifications in 15 tumors (18.8%), leading to elevated RAD54B expression and significantly shorter survival. This establishes RAD54B as an oncogenic driver in ESS. Known tumor suppressors (PTEN, TP53) were frequently mutated in HG-ESS but rare in LG-ESS, highlighting distinct grade-specific drivers of malignancy. HG-ESS exhibited widespread chromosomal gains, frequent loss of cell-cycle regulators (RB1, CDKN2A), and numerous private gene fusions arising from complex DNA rearrangements. In contrast, LG-ESS were defined by canonical fusions (e.g., JAZF1–SUZ12 ) and co-occurring deletions in metabolic regulator genes (TSC2, STK11). Finally, in an activating NRAS-mutant (p.Q61R) HG-ESS xenograft, the combination of MEK and FAK inhibition dramatically suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival, highlighting a promising targeted treatment strategy. Overall, our comprehensive analysis defines the molecular basis of ESS and provides a strong preclinical rationale for precision therapies in this aggressive cancer.",

This finding reconciles both views: While local constraints reparameterize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparameterization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparameterization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.",

At birth, cerebellar Purkinje cells receive inputs with similar synaptic strengths from multiple climbing fibers (CFs).

Here, we report that deleting metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) or protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ) in mice disrupts this selective strengthening and territory expansion of “winner” CFs during early development. This impairment leads to weaker synaptic transmission and diminished dendritic innervation territory of “winner” CFs at later stages. Notably, “winner” CF synapses in these mutants exhibit impaired long-term potentiation, reduced AMPA receptor expression, and simpler postsynaptic organizations. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for mGluR1–PKCγ signaling, besides its established role in eliminating “loser” CFs, in promoting the functional and structural maturation of “winner” CF synapses.",

Incorporating predesigned interface reaction–free NTE particles into Bi 2 Te 3 -based, Mg 3 Sb 2 -based, and PbTe-based materials effectively improves thermoelectric performance, alleviates thermal stress, and enhances interfacial stability across a broad temperature range (300 to 800 kelvin).

Here, we present a 2.5-Å cryogenic electron microscopy structure of NEP bound to the IAV polymerase and demonstrate that NEP alone is sufficient to promote vRNP export, with the viral matrix protein 1 enhancing export efficiency. NEP forms a four-helix bundle that binds at the interface of the PA C-terminal domain and PB1 N terminus of the polymerase. The NEP binding site at this interface overlaps with those for the host ANP32 and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, indicating that it functions as a regulatory hotspot coordinating transitions of the viral polymerase between RNA synthesis and nuclear export, revealing a critical layer of control in the IAV replication cycle.",

Using stable isotope-assisted metabolomics in patients with glioblastoma, we showed that nicotinamide conversion into N 1 -methylnicotinamide exceeds that into NAD + , leading to a ~7-fold accumulation of N 1 -methylnicotinamide in tumor compared to surrounding brain tissue. In orthotopic models, NNMT activity was enhanced by dexamethasone selectively in glioblastoma tumors but not in contralateral brain. Leveraging the tumor-specific activity of NNMT, we developed a novel 11 C-nicotinamide–based positron emission tomography (PET) approach to visualizing glioblastoma tumors. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the dexamethasone-induced methionine-dependent nicotinamide methylation becomes detrimental for glioblastoma when combined with a methionine-restricted diet.

          "abstract": "Optical image processing techniques like edge detection demonstrate unique superiority in various applications. Synergistically combined with heralded quantum imaging, they have notable potential for identifying light-sensitive samples under minimal illumination. However, present schemes usually lack the capability to control the quantum imaging function dynamically. Here, we introduce versatile liquid crystals to realize heralded single-photon imaging and electrically tunable multimode switching. On the basis of the bichiral cholesteric liquid crystal modulator, different morphology information of the target can be extracted with a high signal-to-noise ratio, including the entire shape and its fine outline. The nematic liquid crystal, leveraging its electrically tunable properties, is explored to select specific polarizations of heralded single photons, enabling dynamic remote switching in trimode quantum imaging. To further improve the time efficiency, an ultrafast remote switching is presented on the basis of the appealing ferroelectric liquid crystals. This work supplies a unique imaging platform for photon-limited scenarios and reveals the unprecedented possibilities of soft matters in quantum information processing.",

Here, we demonstrate an elaborate design of two-dimensional hexagonal zinc-containing metal-organic framework anchored on conductive titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) MXene sheets (MX/2D-Zn-MOF) as a three-dimensional lightweight host for anode-less 5 V–class LMBs. The abundant nitrogen/fluorine/zinc-rich lithiophilic sites effectively decrease lithium nucleation energy barriers, ensure uniform lithium deposition, and stabilize solid electrolyte interphase. The interconnected three-dimensional framework further guides uniform lithium deposition by spatially homogenizing lithium ion flux and reducing local current density as well as offers sufficient space to alleviate structural change, thus affording structural integrity against pulverization. As a result, the MX/2D-Zn-MOF host demonstrates uniform lithium deposition, reversible lithium plating and stripping behavior, and stable cycling performance (~1800 hours at 1.0 milliamperes per square centimeter and 5.0 milliampere hours per square centimeter). Impressively, the assembled anode-less 5 V–class lithium metal pouch cell delivers stable cycling performance and high energy density.",

However, the 2023 release of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI) found that RWC contributes ~28% of total wintertime fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) emissions, suggesting that ambient PM 2.5 concentrations could be substantially reduced if RWC were curtailed. Despite its contribution to PM 2.5 emissions, an assessment of the air quality, health, and distributional impacts of RWC using the updated NEI has not been performed. Here, we use a high-resolution (4 kilometers) air quality model and the updated NEI to evaluate wintertime RWC impacts over the contiguous United States. We find that RWC contributes 2.43 micrograms per cubic meter (21.9%) of winter population-weighted mean PM 2.5 concentrations, leading to ~8600 (confidence interval: 6500 to 9600) premature deaths annually. Moreover, nonwhite communities are disproportionately affected by RWC-related PM 2.5 and associated mortality, especially in urban areas.

The molecules of good solvents screen off interchain interactions for hyperelasticity. The long dangling chains disentangle and adsorb to substrate for strong adhesion. We synthesized such gels by controlling the polymerization kinetics. When a monomer solution is partially cured, some monomers form a network and others form the solvent. The resulting gel, termed homogel, consists of a polymer network with enormous dangling chains and solvent of identical chemistries. An interval exists where the dangling chains are long and disentangled substantially, and the homogel exhibits both hyperelasticity and omniadhesion. We demonstrated such a gel with a hysteresis of 4.1% (stretch = 10) and adhesion energy of ~510 joules per square meter. The principle is generic and applicable to gels of different types.",

Coherent wavefront shaping enables precise energy delivery but typically requires full knowledge of the medium. Here, we introduce a universal statistical framework for targeted mode transport (TMT) that circumvents this limitation and validate it on various platforms including microwave networks, two-dimensional chaotic cavities, and three-dimensional reverberation chambers. TMT quantifies the efficiency of transferring energy between specified input and output channels in multimode wave-chaotic systems. We develop a diagrammatic theory that predicts the eigenvalue distribution of the TMT operator and identifies the macroscopic parameters—coupling strength, absorption, and channel control—that govern performance. The theory provides explicit bounds for optimal TMT wavefronts and captures phenomena like statistical transmission gaps and reflectionless states. These findings establish design principles for energy delivery and information transfer in complex environments, with broad implications for adaptive signal processing and wave-based technologies.",

We introduce μFluidicGenius (μFG), an open-access, machine learning (ML)–augmented design tool that enables nonexpert users to rapidly create functional microfluidic circuits. Users simply define the spatial placement of reservoirs, specify the channel connections between them, and assign desired flow rates through this layout. Leveraging a hybrid algorithmic framework that integrates ML models with mathematical modeling, μFG automatically generates spatially coded maze structures that implement the precise fluidic resistances needed to meet the target flow distribution. These resistive elements are optimized to fit within the available geometry and can reproduce complex flow profiles, such as physiologically relevant flow rates in multi-organ-on-chip platforms. The resulting microfluidic designs are directly exportable for three-dimensional printing. Experimental validation demonstrates that μFG-generated circuits reproduce target flow distributions with 90% accuracy. By streamlining and automating microfluidic circuit creation, μFG not only lowers the barrier to entry for nonexperts but also showcases a principled and efficient application of ML to fluidic system design, enabling rapid and customizable development of complex microfluidic architectures.",

Here, selective expression of CD318 on a subset of activated human CD8 + T cells, but not CD4 + T cells, is shown, defining suppressor function of this cell population. CD318 + CD8 T cells exhibited reduced PD-1 and KLRG-1 expression, diminished interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor–α production, and potent suppression of autologous CD4 and CD8 T cell activation in vitro. Notably, CD8 T cells from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) showed reduced CD318 induction compared with controls.

Through biomechanical modeling validated by ocular magnetic resonance imaging simulations, we establish a prior correlation between eyelid deformation and eye movements. The Eyelectronics, powered by our physiology knowledge-driven end-to-end AI algorithm, achieves simultaneous measurement of strabismus angle and identification of paretic muscle. It delivers a 96.6% four-direction classification accuracy and a 1.2° measurement accuracy in ocular motility examinations. Clinical benchmarking against the clinical standard (Hess screen test) confirmed diagnostic agreement (intraclass correlation = 0.978).

The ubiquitous trans-translation system and several alternative rescue factors rescue the stalled ribosomes caused by truncated mRNAs lacking the stop codons. On the other hand, protein release factor homolog (PrfH) is the only known factor to rescue the stalled ribosome damaged by ribotoxins. Here, we show that a subfamily of PrfH, exemplified by PrfH from Capnocytophaga gingivalis ( Cg PrfH), rescues both types of stalled ribosomes. Biochemical assays demonstrate that Cg PrfH hydrolyzes the peptides attached to P-site transfer RNAs when in complex with both the damaged and intact ribosomes. Cryo-EM structures revealed that Cg PrfH uses distinct regions to recognize two stalled ribosomes to orient the GGQ motif for peptide hydrolysis.

Using paleographically constrained global mantle convection models, we reproduce the present-day location of the Hawaiian hot spot and the associated spatiotemporal geochemical evolution. The composition of the plume conduit shows conventional concentric zoning prior to the Hawaiian-Emperor Bend and gradually evolves to a north-south bilateral zoning pattern afterward, corresponding to the subparallel Loa-Kea trends. Further analysis suggests that the plume originates from ridges of large low-velocity province (LLVP) induced by the push of slabs. Upwelling at the intersections of ridges is more energetic than at the middle of the ridge, causing bottom-up splitting of plume conduit in the lower mantle that propagates upward, forming bilateral zoning and eventually two independent plumes. This process suggests that bilateral zoning is transient and more common in the Pacific than Africa due to the circum-Pacific subduction.",

Here, we show that phage- and phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI)–mediated lateral transduction (LT), a highly efficient horizontal gene transfer mechanism, facilitates the transfer of these defense genes between bacteria. Using several bacterial models, we demonstrate that defense systems are often positioned near phage or PICI attachment sites, allowing them to exploit LT for their mobility. In addition, LT diversifies defense genes carried by prophages and PICIs, driving immune system evolution and turnover. These processes provide phage resistance to new bacterial hosts and profoundly affect population genomics.

Here, we report that extracellular domains (ECDs) of CATSPERε are essential for canopy and holo-complex assembly and modulate channel activity during sperm capacitation. CATSPERε-deficient males are sterile due to the absence of the entire channel and defective sperm hyperactivation. Expressing ECD-truncated CATSPERε during spermatogenesis does not rescue the knockout because it fails to incorporate into the native complex. In contrast, addition of a CATSPERε ECD fragment during sperm capacitation significantly reduces sperm hyperactivation.

Mice with brain-specific Gpr75 deletion using Nestin-Cre were resistant to diet-induced obesity, primarily through suppressed food intake and modest increases in energy expenditure. In contrast, adipocyte-specific deletion of Gpr75 had minimal effects on systemic metabolism but modestly enhanced mitochondrial oxygen consumption in brown adipose tissue under cold exposure. Gpr75 expression was up-regulated in key brain regions and down-regulated in white adipose tissue under high-fat diet conditions, supporting a predominant central role in metabolic adaptation. Histological and transcriptomic analyses further revealed depot-specific effects on adipocyte morphology and hepatic lipid accumulation in global knockouts.

          "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a major pregnancy complication characterized by hypertension and multiple end-organ dysfunctions; however, its detailed pathogenesis remains unclear. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play diverse and critical roles in intercellular communication, and we have demonstrated interaction between EVs and vascular endothelial cells. Through serum proteomic analysis, we identified LIM and calponin homology domain–containing protein 1 (LIMCH1) as a PE-associated EV protein that is highly expressed in PE placentas, particularly in syncytiotrophoblasts, which release EVs into the maternal circulation. LIMCH1-enriched EVs (LIMCH1-EVs) increased endothelial permeability in vitro. Transcriptome analysis revealed that LIMCH1-EVs disrupted endothelial cell-cell junction assembly by suppressing the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1. Furthermore, administration of LIMCH1-EVs promoted pulmonary vascular permeability in vivo. These findings suggest a role of LIMCH1-EVs in EV-associated vascular endothelial dysfunction, a central pathology of PE. In addition, this study provides insights into mechanisms that may contribute to PE-associated pulmonary edema, which have not yet been clarified.",

In mice performing skilled locomotion, we recorded from dMSNs, iMSNs, and their cortical and thalamic inputs identified by monosynaptic rabies tracing. A recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier and clustering analysis revealed functionally heterogeneous subpopulations in each population, with dMSNs preferentially activated at movement onset and offset, and iMSNs during execution. Cortical and thalamic inputs were preferentially activated during onset/offset and execution, respectively, though dMSN- and iMSN-projecting neurons in each region showed similar patterns. Locomotion phase-specific rhythmic activity was found in a subset of thalamic dMSN-projecting neurons and dMSNs. Cortex or thalamus inactivation reduced MSN activity.

Here, we uncover a post–entry mechanism of efflux pumps, revealing their function deep into intracellular drug-target interactions. Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we monitored the activity of major efflux systems in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Hoechst 33342 (HCT), a DNA binding inhibitor. We found that inactivation of efflux (Δ tolC in E. coli and Δ6 in P. aeruginosa ) increased the apparent HCT-DNA affinity, mediated by a decreased apparent unbinding rate, whereas the intrinsic rate remained unchanged. Statistical physics modeling and experimental testing show that, unlike under dilute in vitro conditions, drug molecules that unbind from their targets in intracellular environments undergo successive rebinding, prolonging the total lifetime of the drug bound to the target. However, efflux pumps counteract this effect by suppressing rebinding, thereby kinetically destabilizing drug-target interactions. This biophysical mechanism acts multiplicatively with the canonical gatekeeping effect to broaden and amplify drug resistance.",

However, the increasing severity of fungicide resistance necessitates urgent clarification of its evolutionary mechanisms to optimize disease management and delay resistance development. The DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs)–mediated base editing in oomycetes confirmed that the PsCytb S33L mutation is sufficient to confer ametoctradin resistance in Phytophthora sojae . We clarified that low-resistant and medium-resistant mutants serve as transitional populations during the resistance evolution process, with high-resistant mutants eventually becoming the dominant population. We revealed the dynamic changes in mitochondrial heterogeneity under fungicide selection, proving that the gradual increase of mutated mitochondria drives resistance evolution. There is a trade-off between ametoctradin resistance and fitness. While the PsCytb S33L mutation confers this resistance, it impairs mitochondrial function and thereby reduces fitness. Up-regulation of TFAM1 , however, can partially offset this fitness cost. Resistance evolution in plant pathogens involves not only standing variation but also de novo mutations, providing unique insights into the “chicken-and-egg” dilemma.",

RIN3 has been shown to bind BIN1, and we previously reported that this interaction modulates amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) trafficking and Aβ generation in vitro. To extend these findings, we used Rin3 constitutive knockout ( Rin3-CKO ) mice and CRISPR-Cas9–edited human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons carrying either BIN1 knockout or rare familial AD RIN3 missense mutations within the BIN1-binding domain. We found that disruption of BIN1-RIN3 binding, through either genetic deletion or pathogenic RIN3 variants, resulted in RIN3-mediated RAB5 hyperactivation and enlargement of neuronal endosomes, a hallmark of early AD pathology. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed dysregulated expression of AD-related genes.

Here, we found that Set2-mediated H3K36me3 deposition occurs on the nucleosome reassembling behind the EC. The histone chaperone FACT suppresses H3K36me3 deposition on the downstream nucleosome, thereby ensuring that Set2 targets specifically on the reassembling upstream nucleosome. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of the nucleosome-transcribing EC complexed with Set2 revealed that Set2 is anchored by the Spt6 subunit of the EC to capture both of the H3 N-terminal tails in a stepwise manner during the nucleosome reassembly process. Abrogation of the Set2-EC interaction leads to defective transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition. These insights elucidate the structure-based mechanism of transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition in chromatin.",

In contrast, we report that αSyn is the major modulator of substantia nigra somatodendritic dopamine release, a little-understood form of neurotransmission that is central to sensorimotor and basal ganglia circuitry. This regulation is due to a previously unknown role for αSyn in controlling the activity of the L-type calcium ion channels (LTCC), which are also implicated in Parkinson’s pathogenesis. αSyn-deficient neurons further display decreased spike frequency adaptation, hippocampal LTCC-dependent long-term potentiation, and immediate early gene induction, functions that are essential for synaptic adaptation and neuronal plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Mantle plumes beneath major oceanic hot spots appear to be rooted in unusually large structures near the core-mantle boundary, which have markedly reduced seismic wave speeds. The origin of these large ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs), referred to as mega-ULVZs, remains uncertain partly because of lack of constraints on the relative reduction in shear versus compressional wave speeds ( R S/P ). This ratio can give clues into the compositional makeup of the mega-ULVZs. Through joint seismic analysis of core-diffracted P and S waves beneath Hawai’i, we constrain the R S/P of its mega-ULVZ to 1 to 1.3. Mineralogical modeling reveals that iron enrichment via solid iron-rich magnesiowüstite [(Mg,Fe)O] matches this seismic constraint, independent of modeled ULVZ thickness. Enrichment of metallic iron-rich magnesiowüstite likely enhances the thermal conductivity of mega-ULVZs and provides a mechanism to drive localized plume upwelling. Higher reported R S/P values for smaller ULVZs near subduction zones may therefore indicate different processes at play controlling ULVZ formation across the diverse core-mantle boundary landscape.",

However, the impact of disrupting antiferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1 /Aifm2 ) is critically required for regulatory T cell (T reg cell) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4 and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or T reg cells specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting T reg cell immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses. These results reveal an opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells but also simultaneously enhance anticancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity.",

Using ab initio and deep learning potential molecular dynamics simulations, we discovered a doubly superionic transition in δ-AlOOH, characterized by the highly diffusive behavior of both hydrogen and aluminum ions within the oxygen sublattice. These highly diffusive elements contribute external entropy to the system, stabilizing the structure at 140 GPa and 3800 K. Our free-energy calculations reveal that water tends to freeze under deep lower mantle conditions, so dehydration becomes energetically and kinetically unfavorable even under core-mantle boundary (CMB) conditions.

This enhances resistance to failure, achieving about 3.8-fold increase in corrosion resistance and a 1.35-fold increase in hydrogen embrittlement resistance compared to commercial 316L. The steel exhibits very low hydrogen diffusivity (~7.8 × 10 −17  square meters per second), mitigating hydrogen embrittlement at ambient temperature, an advantage over conventional steels. In addition, formation of a dense passive film improves corrosion resistance in environments such as dilute hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda.

PM 2.5 component–attributable CVD deaths declined from 42,200 (28,200,57,600) in 2001 to 23,500 (15,700,32,100) in 2020, driven by ammonium (NH 4 + ) and sulfate (SO 4 2− ) reductions. In 2020, high-attributable-mortality regions remained and regional disparities in PM 2.5 composition pronounced, with NH 4 + dominant in California and the East North Central, SO 4 2− in the South, and black carbon and SO 4 2− in the Middle Atlantic. Racial/ethnic disparities persisted, with non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing slower attributable-mortality declines compared with non-Hispanic whites. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions based on components to address disparities in PM 2.5 -attributable burden.",

          "abstract": "Predicting floating ice dynamics remains a challenging problem with implications for Earth’s climate. While gigantic icebergs have garnered worldwide attention, small ice bodies have been overlooked, and we still lack their mechanistic models. Aided by a real-time tracking, we unravel the transient processes of freely floating ice in calm waters—including the kinematics, phase transition, and surrounding fluid dynamics—that govern melting. Combining the heat transfer model and our experimental results, we develop and validate a theoretical model for the melt rate, identifying ice geometry and convective regime as key controls. Furthermore, the ice-driven convective volume flux is found to exceed the meltwater flux by orders of magnitude, underscoring the ecological relevance of floating ice; it not only supplies freshwater but also acts as a destabilizing buoyancy source that redistributes mass macroscopically. Our study provides a foundation for developing mechanistic parameterizations of icebergs and ice floes melting in climate models.",

We show that deep-projecting retinal ganglion cells serve as the first synaptic relay to the brain, requiring Lrrn2 and Lrrn3a for precise axonal targeting within the optic tectum. Using a new reporter line, we achieved high-resolution mapping of this previously undercharacterized vertebrate visual circuit. Genetic disruption of Lrrn CAMs leads to disorganization of the circuit and impairments in brightness and contrast sensitivity, resulting in deficits in visually guided behavior. Additionally, ultrastructural circuit reconstruction and functional imaging analysis identified both its synaptic partners and revealed its critical role in luminance processing.

          "abstract": "Virus-induced inflammation and programmed cell death (PCD) are critical antiviral defenses, prompting viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to develop PCD regulation mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that RSV orchestrates the temporal and sequential regulation of distinct PCD pathways in human macrophages to optimize replication and dissemination. During early stages of infection, RSV activates the PI3K-Akt pathway to induce cFLIP expression, effectively suppressing TNF-driven extrinsic apoptosis. Simultaneously, viral degradation of ZDHHC9 prevents GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis downstream of NLRP3 activation, thereby sustaining an intracellular environment permissive to viral propagation. In contrast, following the completion of replication, RSV subverts caspase-1 signaling to trigger the intrinsic apoptotic cascade via the Casp-1–BID–APAF1–Casp-9 axis, and subsequently promotes GSDME-mediated secondary pyroptosis. This late-stage PCD reprogramming enables synchronized release of virions and pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating pulmonary pathology. These findings delineate a temporally resolved strategy by which RSV balances early immune evasion with subsequent viral dissemination and immunopathology, and identify discrete stage-specific molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in RSV-induced lung disease.",

In this study, we demonstrate that mice with T reg -specific deletion of Tdrd3 exhibit severely impaired iT reg , but not thymic T reg , differentiation. Moreover, iT regs , but not thymic T regs , derived from these mice fail to suppress colitis in adoptive transfer models, indicating compromised inhibitory capacity. Aged Tdrd3 -deficient mice also show spontaneous autoinflammation. Mechanistically, TDRD3 is recruited by the transcription factor FOXO1, presumably in a methylation-dependent manner, to activate Klf2 expression, which is essential for T reg differentiation. Notably, the enforced expression of Klf2 in Tdrd3 -deficient CD4 + T cells rescue both iT reg development and suppressive function.

We overcome this barrier by reviving and sustaining light signal transmission in human retinas recovered up to 4 hours after death and stored for up to 48 hours.

However, the contribution of inflammatory forms of cell death in lung carcinogenesis and their effects on the composition of the tumor-immune microenvironment remain unclear. Our multi-omics analyses of samples from patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma revealed that necrosome signaling is repressed because of reduced expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 ( RIPK3 ). Distinct methylation signatures, both in the RIPK3 promoter and nonpromoter regions, correlated with lower transcription levels of RIPK3 . This resulted in limited expression of inflammatory genes, advanced histologic features, reduced immune cell invasion, and decreased patient survival. Mechanistically, we confirmed the tumor-suppressive role of necrosome signaling through the genetic deletion of Ripk3 in two independent, clinically relevant mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. Functionally, RIPK3 shaped a diverse immune environment by promoting the invasion of innate and adaptive immune cells in patient samples and experimental mice. Thus, RIPK3-mediated inflammatory signaling enhances a diverse immune microenvironment and hinders progression in lung adenocarcinoma.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce COBRA-k, a framework integrating nonlinear kinetic rate laws into COBRA models to consistently constrain metabolic fluxes, enzyme abundances, and metabolite concentrations. COBRA-k enables flexible exploration of metabolic steady states with optimization techniques, even with incomplete parametrization. COBRA-k models require solving computationally demanding mixed-integer nonlinear programs. We therefore developed a dedicated iterative algorithm, implemented in an open-source Python package. We applied COBRA-k to a large-scale Escherichia coli model, demonstrating its effectiveness and revealing holistic metabolic insights. For example, it accurately predicts and explains the phenomenon of high intracellular glutamate concentration. COBRA-k combines the flexibility of COBRA with kinetic precision, offering a powerful tool for predictive metabolic modeling and engineering.",

Operating at shorter wavelengths than EM waves, it offers a compact footprint and encodes tunable neural network parameters via nonvolatile programmability and the acoustoelectric effect.

We found that transcription stress sites are shaped by the superenhancer regulatory landscape. Notably, γH2AX is enriched at transcription stress sites; however, not all DSB-enriched genes show similar γH2AX marking. Instead, genes with DSBs tied to transcription stress are distinctly marked. Genes with high DSBs marked by γH2AX exhibited substantially higher DSB turnover and repair than those with low γH2AX, and are associated with vulnerability to mutagenesis.

Genome-wide RNA interference screens identified genes (encoding for stabilizers) responsible for mutant EGFR stability, with P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2) emerging as a bona fide stabilizer. Mechanistically, high extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels transactivate EGFR mutants via P2Y2 activation, previously shown to signal through Src kinase–dependent EGFR phosphorylation. Our study reveals that ATP-driven P2Y2 activation stabilizes EGFR mutants by forming a P2Y2-integrin β1-EGFR complex enriched in endosomes. Targeting this axis destabilizes EGFR mutants and offers a strategy against drug resistance. Elevated P2Y2 and integrin β1 expression in patients with NSCLC implies clinical relevance.

An additional challenge of real-world vision is that it is dynamic, causing the appearance of objects (e.g., their size and orientation) to change as we move. Notably, however, these changes are predictable from the three-dimensional structure of the surrounding scene. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we find that the visual cortex dynamically updates object representations using this predictive contextual information. First, visual cortical representations of objects were enhanced when they rotated congruently (versus incongruently) with the surrounding scene. Second, the inferred orientation of the object could be decoded from visual cortex activity even when the object was fully occluded. These findings indicate that predictive processes in the visual cortex follow the geometric structure of the environment, providing a mechanism to support object perception in dynamic natural vision.",

Our data reveal that hybrid EwS cells are induced and maintained by a transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling positive feedback loop. Hybrid cells derepress TGFBR2 and up-regulate expression and secretion of TGFβ2 to sustain pathway activation and ECM deposition. Although TGFβ ligands can potently induce growth arrest in cells of epithelial origin, we show that TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 promote cell invasion of EwS cells without affecting proliferation.

          "authors": "Simon A. Parfitt, Silvia M. Bello",
          "abstract": "Organic knapping tools made from bone, antler, and wood were essential to early human toolkits but are rarely preserved in the archeological record. The earliest known soft hammers, dating to ~480,000 years ago, come from Boxgrove (UK), where modified antlers and large mammal bones were used alongside flint hard hammers. These tools facilitated complex knapping techniques, such as platform preparation and tranchet flake removal, contributing to the production of finely worked ovate handaxes typical of the Boxgrove Acheulean industry. This study presents a cortical bone fragment from an elephant, deliberately shaped into a percussor for resharpening flint tools. It represents the earliest known use of elephant bone in Europe and the first documented case of its use as a knapping hammer. Reconstructing its life history offers further insights into Middle Pleistocene hominin technological adaptations, resourcefulness, and survival strategies that enabled humans to endure harsh northern environments.",

          "abstract": "Holonomies are of great interest to quantum computation and simulation. The geometrical nature of holonomies offers increased stability to quantum gates. Furthermore, symmetries of particle physics are naturally reflected in holonomies, making them ideally suited for quantum simulation of quantum chromodynamics and grand unified theories. Yet, practically designing quantum holonomies with the required properties and scale is challenging. Here, we construct a new class of holonomies by increasing the particle number. We show that multiparticle holonomies can even exist in systems devoid of any single-particle holonomies. We present a comprehensive framework for multiparticle quantum holonomies and experimentally realize various two-particle holonomies in integrated photonics. Our results enable the number of particles to be harnessed as a design parameter, offering increased freedom in constructing holonomic systems.",

          "abstract": "Graptolites were abundant and cosmopolitan zooplankton in Early Paleozoic oceans, but a prominent change in species occurred across the Late Ordovician mass extinction. We use ocean redox, iron isotope (δ 56 Fe), and phosphorus phase partitioning records from shelf and deep-ocean settings to evaluate the drivers behind this major reshaping of the pelagic marine ecosystem. A marked decrease in mesopelagic graptolites coincided with a stepwise negative δ 56 Fe shift on the shelf, driven by partial seawater Fe drawdown resulting from episodic intensification of mid-depth euxinia. Subsequently, a positive δ 56 Fe shift in both deep-ocean and shelf sediments reflects extensive seawater Fe removal during the development of more widespread euxinia. This led to enhanced sedimentary phosphorus recycling from sediments, which ultimately fueled the radiation of epipelagic graptolites. Thus, wide-scale changes in Fe cycling, linking the global oceanic redox state to phosphorus cycling, were ultimately responsible for the initial demise and subsequent radiation of select graptolite species.",

          "abstract": "Previous evidence suggests that higher prepubertal adiposity protects against breast cancer risk. Whether this protection extends into early adulthood remains uncertain. We conducted genome-wide association studies on body mass index (BMI) in nulliparous women from menarche to &lt;40 years across five cohorts, with additional analyses in three subintervals of this life stage. Results were meta-analyzed, and two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization was applied within a lifecourse framework to assess the effect of BMI on breast cancer risk. Between menarche and &lt;40 years, we observed heterogeneity in genetic effects. Genome-wide correlations further suggest that BMI during this early adult period may be partly influenced by distinct genetic factors compared with adiposity at other life stages. Higher genetically proxied BMI between menarche and 40 years reduced breast cancer risk. This protective effect attenuated after adjusting for prepubertal adiposity. These findings refine our understanding of adiposity’s role in breast cancer and highlight earlier life stages as critical windows for risk modulation.",

However, its systematic affinity has been debated for over 165 years. There are now two remaining viable hypotheses: Prototaxites was either a fungus, or a member of an entirely extinct lineage. Here, we investigate the affinity of Prototaxites by contrasting its organization and molecular composition with that of Fungi. We report that fossils of Prototaxites taiti from the 407-million-year-old Rhynie chert were chemically distinct from contemporaneous Fungi and structurally distinct from all known Fungi. This finding casts doubt upon the fungal affinity of Prototaxites , instead suggesting that this enigmatic organism is best assigned to an entirely extinct eukaryotic lineage.",

          "abstract": "Mycobacterial granulomas lie at the center of tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis and represent a unique niche where infecting bacteria survive under nutrient-restricted conditions and in the face of a host immune response. The granuloma’s necrotic core, where bacteria reside extracellularly in humans, is difficult to assess in many experimentally tractable models. Here, using necrotic mycobacterial granulomas in adult zebrafish, we develop dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) across different host genotypes to identify the transcriptional alterations that enable bacteria to survive within this key microenvironment. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we find that neutrophils within mature, necrotic granulomas promote bacterial growth, in part through up-regulation of the bacterial devR regulon. We identify conserved suites of bacterial transcriptional programs induced only in the context of this unique necrotic extracellular niche, including bacterial modules related to K + transport and rpf genes. Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains across diverse lineages and human populations suggests that granuloma-specific transcriptional modules are targets for bacterial genetic adaptation in the context of human infection.",

          "abstract": "Marine habitability for complex life on Earth and Earth-like planets requires bioavailable nutrients and dissolved oxygen. The cycling of nutrients and oxygen is controlled by physical ocean circulation. However, our understanding of how circulation has varied through time and space is incomplete for Earth and unconstrained for Earth-like exoplanets. Earth’s rotation has slowed over time, affecting ocean circulation by modifying the Coriolis effect. We use a three-dimensional Earth system model to explore how slowing planetary rotation influences ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. We show that slower rotation enhances wind-driven upwelling and global circulation. Nutrient recycling is consequently more efficient, increasing photosynthetic productivity. Additionally, enhanced ocean oxygenation improves habitability for aerobic life under a well-oxygenated atmosphere. However, under a poorly oxygenated atmosphere, slowing rotation increases oxygen fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere. Therefore, Earth’s rotational history may have been a long-term background control on surface oxygenation and the evolution of animals.",

Here, we present a solution-processed photovoltaic nanoassembly comprising a ZnO nanowire array sensitized with AgBiS 2 nanocrystals that enables efficient near-infrared (NIR) neural stimulation through capacitive photocurrents. By optimizing nanowire morphology and nanocrystal interdigitation, the platform achieves high charge injection densities (tens of microcoulombs per square centimeter) at low NIR intensities (&lt;1 milliwatt per square millimeter). The nanoassembly was subretinally placed in an ex vivo blind rat retina, where it elicited repeatable and robust responses in retinal ganglion cells under NIR pulses. Notably, these responses were achieved at light intensities substantially below established ocular safety limits. The nexus of neuronal systems and nanoassemblies offers potential for enabling unconventional visual prosthetics and advanced neuromodulation therapies.",

However, with nanostructures becoming increasingly larger and more intricate, they have become more difficult to obtain in high yields and quality. Expanding the alphabet beyond the canonical base pairs can therefore be the key to push the technology to the next level. Here, we describe examples of DNA nanostructures built from an “anthropogenic evolvable genetic information system (AEGIS).” Because AEGIS uses the same backbone as DNA, the existing rules for designing DNA nanostructures can be readily applied to AEGIS nanostructures, which also show greater stability, both thermal and enzymatic, greater control over autonomous assembly, and good phase separation. AEGIS can have as many as 12 different units and six different pairs with Watson-Crick-Franklin geometry. Thus, if further developed, then these nanostructures may represent a previously unexplored frontier in DNA nanoscience and nanotechnology, expanding the space of “soft” biomaterial design.",
