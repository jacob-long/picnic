          "abstract": "As the body’s primary source of energy, the maintenance of blood glucose is indispensable for overall health and metabolic homeostasis. It is predominantly regulated by the glucagon receptor family which is highly conserved in vertebrates1–4. Compared to other vertebrates, avian blood glucose levels are relatively high5,6, yet its regulatory mechanisms have remained obscure for more than a century. We show that high hepatic expression of the avian glucagon receptor (GCGR) in association with constitutively active Gs signaling was dependent upon the interaction of different domains. In vivo experiments focusing on the regulation of constitutively active GCGR expression in hepatic cells led to correspondingly high blood glucose, rapid hepatic lipid utilization and high metabolic rates via downstream signaling pathway activation in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Furthermore, we identified a point mutation in chicken at the proximal gene region that resulted in GCGR mRNA reduction and weight increase. Overexpressing a natural human GCGR mutation (hsGCGRH339R) with modest constitutive activity in mice, demonstrated that high level expression of this variant augmented high blood glucose, while reducing body weight. The combination of high expression and constitutive activity of the glucagon receptor may have contributed to the evolution of flight in the ancestors of birds.",

          "abstract": "Pan-genomics and genome-editing technologies are revolutionizing breeding of global crops 1,2 . A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area) 3–5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops 6,7 . Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum 8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars 9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 ( CLV3 ) 10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralogue diversifications over short timescales are underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability. Exposing and navigating these contingencies is crucial for translating genotype-to-phenotype relationships across species.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian behaviour and physiology undergo major changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their needs and start showing nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions at weaning and puberty, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviours develop during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioural control have been identified 1–6 . These data show a marked diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioural or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including early diversification, perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and refinement of signalling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide new insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviours and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.",

          "abstract": "Tropical forest canopies are the biosphere’s most concentrated atmospheric interface for carbon, water and energy 1,2 . However, in most Earth System Models, the diverse and heterogeneous tropical forest biome is represented as a largely uniform ecosystem with either a singular or a small number of fixed canopy ecophysiological properties 3 . This situation arises, in part, from a lack of understanding about how and why the functional properties of tropical forest canopies vary geographically 4 . Here, by combining field-collected data from more than 1,800 vegetation plots and tree traits with satellite remote-sensing, terrain, climate and soil data, we predict variation across 13 morphological, structural and chemical functional traits of trees, and use this to compute and map the functional diversity of tropical forests. Our findings reveal that the tropical Americas, Africa and Asia tend to occupy different portions of the total functional trait space available across tropical forests. Tropical American forests are predicted to have 40% greater functional richness than tropical African and Asian forests. Meanwhile, African forests have the highest functional divergence—32% and 7% higher than that of tropical American and Asian forests, respectively. An uncertainty analysis highlights priority regions for further data collection, which would refine and improve these maps. Our predictions represent a ground-based and remotely enabled global analysis of how and why the functional traits of tropical forest canopies vary across space.",

          "abstract": "Tropical deforestation was found to cause large reductions in precipitation using a range of observation-based datasets1. However, the limitations of satellite-based space-for-time statistical analysis have hindered understanding of the roles of reshaped mesoscale atmospheric circulation and regional precipitation recycling at different scales. These effects are considered nonlocal effects, which are distinct from the local effects governed by deforestation-induced reductions in evapotranspiration (ET). Here we show reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation across wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, deforested grids experienced a noteworthy increase in precipitation (0.96 mm month−1 per percentage point forest loss), primarily attributed to enhanced mesoscale atmospheric circulation (that is, nonlocal effect). These nonlocal increases weaken with distance from deforested grids, leading to significant precipitation reductions in buffers beyond 60 km. Conversely, during the dry season, precipitation decreases in deforested grids and throughout all analysis buffers, with local effects from reduced ET dominating. Our findings highlight the intricate balance between local effects and nonlocal effects in driving deforestation–precipitation responses across different seasons and scales and emphasize the urgent need to address the rapid and extensive loss of forest in the Amazon region.",

          "abstract": "Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrates, yet their resilience to rising temperatures remains poorly understood 1,2 . This is primarily because knowledge of thermal tolerance is taxonomically and geographically biased 3 , compromising global climate vulnerability assessments. Here we used a phylogenetically informed data-imputation approach to predict the heat tolerance of 60% of amphibian species and assessed their vulnerability to daily temperature variations in thermal refugia. We found that 104 out of 5,203 species (2%) are currently exposed to overheating events in shaded terrestrial conditions. Despite accounting for heat-tolerance plasticity, a 4 °C global temperature increase would create a step change in impact severity, pushing 7.5% of species beyond their physiological limits. In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical species encounter disproportionally more overheating events, while non-tropical species are more susceptible in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings challenge evidence for a general latitudinal gradient in overheating risk 4–6 and underscore the importance of considering climatic variability in vulnerability assessments. We provide conservative estimates assuming access to cool shaded microenvironments. Thus, the impacts of global warming will probably exceed our projections. Our microclimate-explicit analyses demonstrate that vegetation and water bodies are critical in buffering amphibians during heat waves. Immediate action is needed to preserve and manage these microhabitat features.",

Moreover, MPC is a key target for drugs aimed at managing diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and neurodegenerative diseases4,5,6. However, despite MPC’s critical roles in both physiology and medicine, the molecular mechanisms underlying its transport function and how it is inhibited by drugs have remained largely unclear. Here our structural findings on human MPC define the architecture of this vital transporter, delineate its substrate-binding site and translocation pathway, and reveal its major conformational states. Furthermore, we explain the binding and inhibition mechanisms of MPC inhibitors. Our findings provide the molecular basis for understanding MPC’s function and pave the way for the development of more-effective therapeutic reagents that target MPC.",

          "abstract": "Seawater electrolysis powered by renewable electricity provides an attractive strategy for producing green hydrogen1,2,3,4,5. However, direct seawater electrolysis faces many challenges, primarily arising from corrosion and competing reactions at the anode caused by the abundance of halide ions (Cl−, Br−) in seawater6. Previous studies3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 on seawater electrolysis have mainly focused on the anode development, because the cathode operates at reducing potentials, which is not subject to electrode dissolution or chloride corrosion reactions during seawater electrolysis11,15. However, renewable energy sources are intermittent, variable and random, which cause frequent start–shutdown operations if renewable electricity is used to drive seawater electrolysis. Here we first unveil dynamic evolution and degradation of seawater splitting cathode in intermittent electrolysis and, accordingly, propose construction of a catalyst’s passivation layer to maintain the hydrogen evolution performance during operation. An in situ-formed phosphate passivation layer on the surface of NiCoP–Cr2O3 cathode can effectively protect metal active sites against oxidation during frequent discharge processes and repel halide ion adsorption on the cathode during shutdown conditions. We demonstrate that electrodes optimized using this design strategy can withstand fluctuating operation at 0.5 A cm−2 for 10,000 h in alkaline seawater, with a voltage increase rate of only 0.5% khr−1. The newly discovered challenge and our proposed strategy herein offer new insights to facilitate the development of practical seawater splitting technologies powered by renewable electricity.",

          "abstract": "A supersolid is a counter-intuitive phase of matter in which its constituent particles are arranged into a crystalline structure, yet they are free to flow without friction. This requires the particles to share a global macroscopic phase while being able to reduce their total energy by spontaneous, spatial self-organization. The existence of the supersolid phase of matter was speculated more than 50 years ago1,2,3,4. However, only recently has there been convincing experimental evidence, mainly using ultracold atomic Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) coupled to electromagnetic fields. There, various guises of the supersolid were created using atoms coupled to high-finesse cavities5,6, with large magnetic dipole moments7,8,9,10,11,12,13, and spin–orbit-coupled, two-component systems showing stripe phases14,15,16. Here we provide experimental evidence of a new implementation of the supersolid phase in a driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium context based on exciton–polaritons condensed in a topologically non-trivial, bound state in the continuum (BiC) with exceptionally low losses, realized in a photonic-crystal waveguide. We measure the density modulation of the polaritonic state indicating the breaking of translational symmetry with a precision of several parts in a thousand. Direct access to the phase of the wavefunction allows us to also measure the local coherence of the supersolid. We demonstrate the potential of our synthetic photonic material to host phonon dynamics and a multimode excitation spectrum.",

          "abstract": "Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally 1,2 . Metastasizing cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, as they are initially deprived of the immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours 3 . There is interest in therapeutically exploiting this immune vulnerability to prevent recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of metastasis. Here we show that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), including aspirin, enhance immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 acts on T cells to trigger an immunosuppressive pathway that is dependent on the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases. Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA 2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner that is dependent on T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA 2 in vivo. These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway that limits T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.",

          "abstract": "Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is widespread across eukaryotes and can promote adaptive evolution1,2,3,4. However, given the instability of newly formed polyploid genomes5,6,7, understanding how WGDs arise in a population, persist, and underpin adaptations remains a challenge. Here, using our ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE)8, we show that diploid snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under selection for larger multicellular size rapidly evolve to be tetraploid. From their origin within the first 50 days of the experiment, tetraploids persisted for the next 950 days (nearly 5,000 generations, the current leading edge of our experiment) in 10 replicate populations, despite being genomically unstable. Using synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modelling and counter-selection, we found that tetraploidy evolved because it confers immediate fitness benefits under this selection, by producing larger, longer cells that yield larger clusters. The same selective benefit also maintained tetraploidy over long evolutionary timescales, inhibiting the reversion to diploidy that is typically seen in laboratory evolution experiments. Once established, tetraploidy facilitated novel genetic routes for adaptation, having a key role in the evolution of macroscopic multicellular size via the origin of evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy. These results provide unique empirical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and impacts of WGD, showing how it can initially arise due to its immediate adaptive benefits, be maintained by selection and fuel long-term innovations by creating additional dimensions of heritable genetic variation.",

          "abstract": "The phytohormone auxin (Aux) is a principal endogenous developmental signal in plants. It mediates transcriptional reprogramming by a well-established canonical signalling mechanism. TIR1/AFB auxin receptors are F-box subunits of an ubiquitin ligase complex; after auxin perception, they associate with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and ubiquitinate them for degradation, thus enabling the activation of auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors 1–3 . Here we revise this paradigm by showing that without TIR1 adenylate cyclase (AC) activity 4 , auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs is not sufficient to mediate the transcriptional auxin response. Abolishing the TIR1 AC activity does not affect auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs but renders TIR1 non-functional in mediating transcriptional reprogramming and auxin-regulated development, including shoot, root, root hair growth and lateral root formation. Transgenic plants show that local cAMP production in the vicinity of the Aux/IAA–ARF complex by unrelated AC enzymes bypasses the need for auxin perception and is sufficient to induce ARF-mediated transcription. These discoveries revise the canonical model of auxin signalling and establish TIR1/AFB-produced cAMP as a second messenger essential for transcriptional reprograming.",

The function of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell plasticity in tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution is poorly understood. Here we clarify the contribution of EMT to malignant progression in pancreatic cancer. We used somatic mosaic genome engineering technologies to trace and ablate malignant mesenchymal lineages along the EMT continuum. The experimental evidence clarifies the essential contribution of mesenchymal lineages to pancreatic cancer evolution. Spatial genomic analysis, single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of EMT clarifies its contribution to the emergence of genomic instability, including events of chromothripsis. Genetic ablation of mesenchymal lineages robustly abolished these mutational processes and evolutionary patterns, as confirmed by cross-species analysis of pancreatic and other human solid tumours. Mechanistically, we identified that malignant cells with mesenchymal features display increased chromatin accessibility, particularly in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions, in turn resulting in delayed mitosis and catastrophic cell division. Thus, EMT favours the emergence of genomic-unstable, highly fit tumour cells, which strongly supports the concept of cell-state-restricted patterns of evolution, whereby cancer cell speciation is propagated to progeny within restricted functional compartments. Restraining the evolutionary routes through ablation of clones capable of mesenchymal plasticity, and extinction of the derived lineages, halts the malignant potential of one of the most aggressive forms of human cancer.",

          "abstract": "The preference for a particular thermal range is a key determinant of the distribution of animal species. However, we know little on how temperature preference behaviour evolves during the colonization of new environments. Here we show that at least two distinct neurobiological mechanisms drive the evolution of temperature preference in flies of the genus Drosophila. Fly species from mild climates (D. melanogaster and D. persimilis) avoid both innocuous and noxious heat, and we show that the thermal activation threshold of the molecular heat receptor Gr28b.d precisely matches species-specific thresholds of behavioural heat avoidance. We find that desert-dwelling D. mojavensis are instead actively attracted to innocuous heat. Notably, heat attraction is also mediated by Gr28b.d (and by the antennal neurons that express it) and matches its threshold of heat activation. Rather, the switch in valence from heat aversion to attraction correlates with specific changes in thermosensory input to the lateral horn, the main target of central thermosensory pathways and a region of the fly brain implicated in the processing of innate valence1,2,3,4,5. Together, our results demonstrate that, in Drosophila, the adaptation to different thermal niches involves changes in thermal preference behaviour, and that this can be accomplished using distinct neurobiological solutions, ranging from shifts in the activation threshold of peripheral thermosensory receptor proteins to a substantial change in the way temperature valence is processed in the brain.",

Ecofriendly ZnSeTe QDs are an ideal alternative to cadmium-based blue QDs1,2, but face issues with colour impurity and inferior stability caused by the aggregated tellurium (Ten≥2) that dominates compositional inhomogeneity3,4. Here we developed an isoelectronic control strategy using congeneric sulfur coordinated with triphenyl phosphite (TPP-S) to construct homogeneous ZnSeTeS QDs with pure-blue emissions and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. TPP with low electron-donating capability promotes the reactivity balance among anionic precursors, favouring the growth of QDs with uniform composition. The acceptor-like S with high electronegativity weakens the hole localization of the Te atoms by interfering with their surrounding carriers, thereby suppressing the formation of Ten≥2 isoelectronic centres. Furthermore, the congeneric S increases the configurational entropy of the QDs and eliminates the stacking faults and oxygen defects, leading to improved structural stability and reduced non-radiative carrier density. Consequently, the resulting pure-blue QLEDs based on core–shell ZnSeTeS/ZnSe/ZnS QDs emitting at 460 nm show a high external quantum efficiency of 24.7%, a narrow linewidth of 17 nm, and long operational half-lifetime (T50) close to 30,000 hours at 100 cd cm−2, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue QLEDs.",

The analysis uses satellite observations together with single-model and multi-model ensemble simulations to identify and quantify the month–height Antarctic ozone recovery ‘fingerprint’12. We demonstrate that the data and simulations show compelling agreement in the fingerprint pattern of the ozone response to decreasing ODSs since 2005. We also show that ODS forcing has enhanced ozone internal variability during the austral spring, influencing detection of forced responses and their time of emergence.

What the craft finds could have big ramifications for NASA’s plans to send astronauts to this part of the Moon in the coming years.\n\nMoon mission failure: why is it so hard to pull off a lunar landing?\n\nOne of the missions is a commercial lander; it aims to touch down closer to the Moon’s south pole than any previous mission, carrying NASA instruments including an ice-hunting robot drill. The other spacecraft, NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer, is an orbiter with the goal of producing the highest-resolution maps of water on the Moon.\n\nLunar water could provide a resource for expanded lunar exploration, such as by supplying the raw ingredients for rocket fuel at Moon bases. Scientists have known since 2009 that such water exists, but they want to know much more about where it is and how much there is. The two new spacecraft “are going after really important pieces of that puzzle”, says Parvathy Prem, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, who is not affiliated with either mission.\n\nThe lander is expected to touch down on 6 March. It is the second attempt by Intuitive Machines, a company based in Houston, Texas, whose first lunar spacecraft tipped over on landing last year.\n\nLunar Trailblazer will follow a leisurely trajectory and reach the Moon in several months. If all goes well, it will enter its final science-mapping orbit around August.\n\nSearching for water\n\nMany space agencies and scientists are keen to learn more about water at the lunar poles, which hold a geological record of the Solar System’s early history. The Indian mission Chandrayaan-2 is currently orbiting the Moon and building up its own data on where water might exist, as is a Korean probe that carries a NASA instrument to peer into shadowed, potentially ice-rich craters.\n\nIntuitive Machines’ new lander, named Athena, is headed for the Mons Mouton region of the Moon. Researchers think there is water in the lunar soil there, perhaps bound up in minerals or in pores in the soil.\n\nThese six countries are about to go to the Moon — here’s why\n\nAthena will search for water in several ways, including the use of NASA’s ice-mining drill, TRIDENT. If Athena lands successfully, operators will command TRIDENT to penetrate the lunar soil, drilling up to one metre deep to pull up the soil and leave it in a crumbly pile on the surface. A mass spectrometer on board will analyse the pile for signs of water and other volatile substances that might be escaping as gases. That ability to drill and analyse simultaneously provides “critical data on how lunar soils behave”, says Jackie Quinn, the drill’s project manager at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida.",

          "abstract": "Visitors to an interactive AI exhibition at the German Museum of Technology in Berlin use virtual-reality glasses to view an image of the brain.Credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/Alamy\n\nFollowing a surge of excitement after the launch of the artificial-intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022, governments worldwide have been striving to craft policies that will foster AI development while ensuring the technology remains safe and trustworthy. In February, several provisions of the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act — the world’s first comprehensive AI regulation — took effect, prohibiting the deployment of certain applications, such as automated systems that claim to predict crime or infer emotions from facial features.\n\nMost AI systems won’t face an outright ban, but will instead be regulated using a risk-based scale, from high to low. Fierce debates are expected over the act’s classification of ‘high-risk’ systems, which will have the strictest oversight. Clearer guidance from the EU will begin emerging in August, but many AI-driven clinical solutions are likely to attract scrutiny owing to the potential harm associated with biased or faulty predictions in a medical setting.\n\nHow to harness AI’s potential in research — responsibly and ethically\n\nClinical AI — if deployed with caution — could improve health-care access and outcomes by streamlining hospital management processes (such as patient scheduling and doctors’ note-taking), supporting diagnostics (such as identifying abnormalities in X-rays) and tailoring treatment plans to individual patients. But these benefits come with risks — for instance, the decisions of an AI-driven system cannot always be easily explained, limiting the scope for real-time human oversight.\n\nThis matters, because such oversight is explicitly mandated under the act. High-risk systems are required to be transparent and designed so that an overseer can understand their limitations and decide when they should be used (see go.nature.com/3dtgh4x).\n\nBy default, compliance will be evaluated using a set of harmonized AI standards, but these are still under development. (Meeting these standards will not be mandatory, but is expected to be the preferred way for most organizations to demonstrate compliance.) However, as yet, there are few established technological ways to fulfil these forthcoming legal requirements.\n\nHere, we propose that new approaches to AI development — based on the standard practices of multidisciplinary medical teams, which communicate across disciplinary boundaries using broad, shared concepts — could support oversight. This dynamic offers a useful blueprint for the next generation of health-focused AI systems that are trusted by health professionals and meet the EU’s regulatory expectations.\n\nCollaborating with AI\n\nClinical decisions, particularly those concerning the management of people with complex conditions, typically take various sources of information into account — from electronic health records and lifestyle factors to blood tests, radiology scans and pathology results. Clinical training, by contrast, is highly specialized, and few individuals can accurately interpret multiple types of specialist medical data (such as both radiology and pathology). Treatment of individuals with complex conditions, such as cancer, is therefore typically managed through multidisciplinary team meetings (known as tumour boards in the United States) at which all of the relevant clinical fields are represented.\n\nCan AI shake-up translational research?\n\nBecause they involve clinicians from different specialities, multidisciplinary team meetings do not focus on the raw characteristics of each data type, because this knowledge is not shared by the full team. Instead, team members communicate with reference to intermediate ‘concepts’, which are widely understood. For example, when justifying a proposed treatment course for a tumour, team members are likely to refer to aspects of the disease, such as the tumour site, the cancer stage or grade and the presence of specific patterns of molecular markers. They will also discuss patient-associated features, including age, the presence of other diseases or conditions, body mass index and frailty.\n\nThese concepts, which represent interpretable, high-level summaries of the raw data, are the building blocks of human reasoning — the language of clinical debate. They also typically feature in national clinical guidelines for selecting treatments for patients.\n\nNotably, this process of debate using the language of shared concepts is designed to facilitate transparency and collective oversight in a way that parallels the intentions of the EU AI Act. For clinical AI to comply with the act and gain the trust of clinicians, we think that it should mirror these established clinical decision-making processes. Clinical AI — much like clinicians in multidisciplinary teams — should make use of well-defined concepts to justify predictions, instead of just indicating their likelihood.\n\nExplainability crisis\n\nThere are two typical approaches to explainable AI1 — a system that explains its decision-making process. One involves designing the model so it has built-in rules, ensuring transparency from the start. For example, a tool for detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays could assess lung opacity, assign a severity score and classify the case on the basis of predefined thresholds, making its reasoning clear to physicians. The second approach involves analysing the model’s decision after it has been made (‘post hoc’). This can be done through techniques such as saliency mapping, which highlights the regions of the X-ray that influenced the model’s prediction.\n\nHowever, both approaches have serious limitations2. To see why, consider an AI tool that has been trained to help dermatologists to decide whether a mole on the skin is benign or malignant. For each new patient, a post-hoc explainability approach might highlight pixels in the image of the mole that were most important for the model’s prediction. This can identify reasoning that is obviously incorrect — for instance, by highlighting pixels in the image that are not related to the mole (such as pen marks or other annotations by clinicians)3.\n\nThe European Parliament in Brussels adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act last March.Credit: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nWhen the mole is highlighted, however, it might be difficult2,4 for an overseeing clinician — even a highly experienced one — to know whether the set of highlighted pixels is clinically meaningful, or simply spuriously associated with diagnosis. In this case, use of the AI tool might place an extra cognitive burden on the clinician.\n\nA rules-based design, however, constrains an AI model’s learning to conform rigidly to known principles or causal mechanisms. Yet the tasks for which AI is most likely to be clinically useful do not always conform to simple decision-making processes, or might involve causal mechanisms that combine in inherently complex or counter-intuitive ways. Such rules-based models will not perform well in precisely the cases in which a physician might need the most assistance.\n\nIn contrast to these approaches, when a dermatologist explains their diagnosis to a colleague or patient, they tend not to speak about pixels or causal structures. Instead, they make use of easily understood high-level concepts, such as mole asymmetry, border irregularity and colour, to support their diagnosis. Clinicians using AI tools that present such high-level concepts have reported increased trust in the tools’ recommendations5.\n\nIn recent years, approaches to explainable AI have been developed that could encode such conceptual reasoning and help to support group decisions. Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are a promising example6. These are trained not only to learn outcomes of interest (such as prognosis or treatment course), but also to include important intermediate concepts (such as tumour stage or grade) that are meaningful to human overseers. These models can thereby provide both an overall prediction and a set of understandable concepts, learnt from the data, that justify model recommendations and support debate among decision makers.\n\nAI assistance for planning cancer treatment\n\nThis kind of explainable AI could be particularly useful when addressing complex problems that require harmonization of distinct data types. Moreover, they are well suited to regulatory compliance under the EU AI Act, because they provide transparency in a way that is specifically designed to facilitate human oversight. For example, if a CBM incorrectly assigns an important clinical concept to a given patient (such as predicting an incorrect tumour stage), then the overseeing clinical team immediately knows not to rely on the AI prediction.\n\nMoreover, because of how CBMs are trained, such concept-level mistakes can also immediately be corrected by the clinical team, allowing the model to ‘receive help’7 and revise its overall prediction and justification with the aid of clinician input. Indeed, CBMs can be trained to expect such human interventions and use them to improve model performance over time.",

She had not trained to be an activist, yet now she was on her way to deliver a speech at a rally about proposed cuts to US research funding. When she arrived in Washington, she picked up a blank poster provided by rally organizers. “I would rather be in lab!” she wrote on it in big block letters.\n\nAcross the United States, researchers are navigating uncomfortable territory. Repeated threats to research funding and the mass firings of federal workers have pushed some scientists to take on unfamiliar roles as activists, speaking at rallies, calling legislators and forming new pressure groups. “Historically, scientists have done a really bad job of advocating for their own activities,” says David Meyer, a sociologist at the University of California, Irvine. “So this is a new challenge.”\n\nUnaccustomed role\n\nThe events of the past six weeks have compelled many scientists to embrace that challenge. Soon after the second inauguration of US President Donald Trump on 20 January, the new administration attempted to freeze payments on federal grants; announced that it would review and potentially cancel any grant that mentioned terms it deemed indicative of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes; and issued dramatic cuts to the overhead, or ‘indirect costs’, paid on projects funded by the US National Institutes of Health.\n\nUS universities curtail PhD admissions amid Trump science funding cuts\n\n“All of the bad news and the chaos made it hard to know what the best action to take was,” says Melissa Varga, science network senior manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington DC. “Folks just shut down.” Fear of retribution for speaking out also played a part, she adds.\n\nThe courts temporarily halted some of the Trump administration’s orders, but a coherent message has broken through: federal support for science is in danger. Gradually, scientists began to stir, Varga says: “They’re realizing now that doing any one thing is better than doing nothing.”\n\nThat activism is taking many forms. On 3 March, the Union of Concerned Scientists and 48 scientific societies released a joint letter to Congress calling for legislators to protect taxpayer-funded research. “The actions of this administration have already caused significant harm to American science and are risking the health and safety of our communities”, they said.\n\nUS researchers in planetary science are talking about creating a new professional society to strengthen their voice in policy matters. Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, says he has been thinking about such a society for several years. “But the recent attacks, because that’s what they are, on science in the US have catalysed the need for it,” he says. “The more organized the planetary-science community, the more effectively we can stand up and push back against these actions.” Byrne and others will lead a discussion at an upcoming planetary-science conference about whether to launch such a society.\n\nIndividual researchers also have a bounty of petitions to sign, including statements against censorship of science, indirect-cost reductions, and cuts to space science and biomedical research. And professional societies have circulated tip sheets to guide researchers who want to call their elected representatives.\n\nTaking action\n\nFor many scientists, the big event is coming up on 7 March, at ‘Stand Up for Science’ rallies slated to take place in 32 cities around the country. The main event, in Washington DC, is spearheaded by a group of five researchers, most of them graduate students, who came together to combat their own initial feelings of powerlessness. “It’s been inspiring, as this has grown, to see how many people were feeling the same way and to take action,” says Emma Courtney, a graduate student in biology at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.\n\nAre the Trump team’s actions affecting your research? How to contact Nature\n\nAnother goal is for each rally to spark local news outlets into covering the impact of science on that community, says Sam Goldstein, who studies women’s health at the University of Florida in Gainesville and is also co-organizing the Washington rally. Goldstein says that when she was interviewed by a Maryland newspaper, she researched the leading cause of death for the region, then came prepared with examples of how biomedical research could improve quality of life there.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Getty/Shutterstock\n\nDo you ever feel that agreeing to review an academic paper guarantees a wasted workday? You’re not alone. Many researchers spend hours marking up a manuscript, only to realize that they need even more time to let everything sink in before they can write coherent feedback. Not surprisingly, they’ve started turning down review invitations — it’s the only way they can safeguard their time and energy.\n\nBut science is a community endeavour, and we all know that many editors struggle to find qualified reviewers who can deliver quality feedback to tight deadlines. We also know that when the most knowledgeable people keep declining editors’ requests, science suffers.\n\nTo find out more, I conducted an informal poll over social media. In posts on Facebook and LinkedIn in January, I asked how much time academic colleagues spend reviewing papers. Close to 900 academics responded, with more than 40% saying they typically spend two to four hours on a single review, over 25% indicating that they spend more than four hours on the task, and a remarkable 14% admitting that they put in significantly more than four hours — sometimes a full eight-hour day or even more (see ‘Lengthy reviews’). Some respondents were stunned by those numbers, especially considering how fragmented or shallow reviewer feedback can seem to authors trying to make sense of it.\n\nWhat if there were a more efficient way to review a paper — without jeopardizing the quality and integrity of the process? Over the years, I’ve fine-tuned a method that has helped me to drastically cut the amount of time I spend on each review, while still providing thorough, constructive critiques. Here’s how it works.\n\nScan, dictate, refine\n\nI break the review process down into three simple steps:\n\nScan. Quickly browse the abstract, introduction, methods and results, focusing on the big picture. If the analysis looks solid, read the rest of the paper. If you detect glaring flaws, however, you’ll know it’s probably one to reject — no need to line-edit the entire manuscript.\n\nDictate. Use dictation in the text-editing tool of your choice (for example, Voice Access in Windows or Voice Control on the Mac) to capture real-time thoughts as you read. This way, you avoid having to scribble notes or needing to recall and type up your feedback later — a major time-saver.\n\nRefine. Feed your dictated notes into an offline large language model (LLM) to clarify and organize your feedback. A simple prompt such as “Write a critical reviewer letter based on the following notes. Maintain a professional tone throughout” will do. Don’t know how to code? No problem. Tools such as GPT4ALL (see ‘How to set up and run a local LLM’) allow you to load and run LLMs locally and offline, so there’s no need to upload sensitive manuscripts to the cloud. Confidentiality is non-negotiable when it comes to unpublished research, and uploading content externally can invite ethical or even legal trouble.\n\nHow to set up and run a local LLM\n\nWhen confidentiality is key, using an offline and ‘no-coding’ set-up such as GPT4ALL is a no-brainer for safeguarding sensitive or unpublished work. Here’s how to get started.\n\n1. Install GPT4ALL (available for Windows, macOS and Ubuntu Linux).\n\n2. Choose your large language model (LLM). Open GPT4ALL, click ‘Models’ in the left-hand panel and download a suitable LLM. Aim for a balance between output quality and hardware demands — bigger isn’t always better if it leaves your system gasping for air. Check each model’s computational requirements and licence before downloading, especially if you’re in a commercial or specialized setting. If your system’s random-access memory (RAM) is limited, try a smaller model with fewer computational requirements. And be wary of commercial models that route data to the cloud, breaking confidentiality — if a model’s indicated system requirements are suspiciously minimal, it is probably using external resources. Remember, the core advantage of GPT4ALL is local use, ensuring your confidential work stays where it belongs — on your device.\n\n3. Chat. Start a conversation by clicking ‘Chats’. After a brief pause to load the model, you should see a chat-like interface into which you can type or paste your text and notes. Request suggestions for clarification, rephrasing or structural improvements. Always review the model’s output carefully before incorporating it into your final review.\n\nBut let’s be clear: LLMs aren’t there to crank out a full review on your behalf. Although survey data published on the arXiv preprint server in January suggest that automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) can help to speed up evaluations and sharpen structure, ASPR tools still struggle with domain-specific expertise, bias and data-security issues1. Instead, use the LLM to spot redundancy, refine phrasing and organize suggestions (for prompts, see my previous column). You — the reviewer — must make the final judgement on the paper’s methodology, findings and overall contribution to the field.\n\nBy the end of this process, you should have a set of structured, section-by-section comments that can be quickly refined into a coherent reviewer report. But be sure to check the publisher’s policy on generative artificial intelligence (AI) before you get started. Some are fine with reviewers using generative AI tools to tidy up written feedback. But uploading a manuscript or review text to the cloud is usually a hard ‘no’ — confidentiality is on the line. Running an LLM offline locally keeps you within policy restrictions and safeguards the authors’ anonymity. Plus, it prevents their work from being scooped up for training future LLMs.\n\nOutcomes and lessons\n\nThis workflow has helped me to reclaim countless hours in my schedule: I used to spend half a day on one manuscript; now 30–40 minutes suffice if the paper’s methods are sound. If there are serious flaws, it’s even faster — there’s no need to polish an unpublishable paper.\n\nThe comments I do make are generally more thorough than before: dictating comments in real time forces me to ‘talk through’ the paper rather than scribble notes, and to articulate critiques on the spot, often exposing logical gaps I would otherwise have missed. It also deepens my engagement with the paper, resulting in clearer, more focused feedback.",

          "title": "How much energy will AI really consume? The good, the bad and the unknown",
          "authors": "Sophia Chen",
          "abstract": "The aroma of hay and manure hangs over Culpeper County, Virginia, where there’s a cow for every three humans. “We’ve got big farms, most still family-owned, and a lot of forests,” says Sarah Parmelee, one of the county’s 55,000 residents. “It’s very charming small-town USA,” she adds.\n\nBut this pastoral idyll is in the middle of a twenty-first-century shift. Over the past few years, the county has approved the construction of seven large data-centre projects, which will support technology firms in their expansive plans for generative artificial intelligence (AI). Inside these giant structures, rows of computer servers will help to train the AI models behind chatbots such as ChatGPT, and deliver their answers to what might be billions of daily queries from around the world.\n\nIn Virginia, the construction will have profound effects. Each facility is likely to consume the same amount of electrical power as tens of thousands of residential homes, potentially driving up costs for residents and straining the area’s power infrastructure beyond its capacity. Parmelee and others in the community are wary of the data centres’ appetite for electricity — particularly because Virginia is already known as the data-centre capital of the world. A state-commissioned review, published in December 2024, noted that although data centres bring economic benefits, their growth could double electricity demand in Virginia within ten years1.\n\nLight bulbs have energy ratings — so why can’t AI chatbots?\n\n“Where is power going to come from?” asks Parmelee, who is mapping the rise of data centres in the state and works for the Piedmont Environmental Council, a non-profit organization headquartered in Warrenton, Virginia. “They’re all saying, ‘We’ll buy power from the next district over.’ But that district is planning to buy power from you.”\n\nSimilar conflicts about AI and energy are brewing in many places around the globe where data centres are sprouting up at a record pace. Big tech firms are betting hard on generative AI, which requires much more energy to operate compared with older AI models that extract patterns from data but don’t generate fresh text and images. That is driving companies to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new data centres and servers to expand their capacity.\n\nFrom a global perspective, AI’s impact on future electricity demand is actually projected to be relatively small. But data centres are concentrated in dense clusters, where they can have profound local impacts. They are much more spatially concentrated than are other energy-intensive facilities, such as steel mills and coal mines. Companies tend to build data-centre buildings close together so that they can share power grids and cooling systems and transfer information efficiently, both among themselves and to users. Virginia, in particular, has attracted data-centre firms by providing tax breaks, leading to even more clustering.\n\n“If you have one, you’re likely to have more,” says Parmelee. Virginia already has 340 such facilities, and Parmelee has mapped 159 proposed data centres or expansions of existing ones in Virginia, where they account for more than one-quarter of the state’s electricity use, according to a report by EPRI, a research institute in Palo Alto, California2. In Ireland, data centres account for more than 20% of the country’s electricity consumption — with most of them situated on the edge of Dublin. And the facilities’ electricity consumption has surpassed 10% in at least 5 US states.\n\nComplicating matters further is a lack of transparency from firms about their AI systems’ electricity demands. “The real problem is that we’re operating with very little detailed data and knowledge of what’s happening,” says Jonathan Koomey, an independent researcher who has studied the energy use of computing for more than 30 years and who runs an analytics firm in Burlingame, California.\n\n“I think every researcher on this topic is going crazy because we’re not getting the stuff we need,” says Alex de Vries, a researcher at the Free University of Amsterdam and the founder of Digiconomist, a Dutch company that explores the unintended consequences of digital trends. “We’re just doing our best, trying all kinds of tricks to come up with some kind of numbers.”\n\nWorking out AI’s energy demands\n\nLacking detailed figures from firms, researchers have explored AI’s energy demand in two ways. In 2023, de Vries used a supply-chain (or market-based) method3. He examined the power draw of one of the NVIDIA servers that dominates the generative AI market and extrapolated that to the energy required over a year. He then multiplied that figure by estimates of the total number of such servers that are being shipped, or that might be required for a particular task.\n\nGenerative AI’s environmental costs are soaring — and mostly secret\n\nDe Vries used this method to estimate the energy needed if Google searches used generative AI. Two energy-analyst firms had estimated that implementing ChatGPT-like AI into every Google search would require between 400,000 and 500,000 NVIDIA A100 servers, which, based on the power demand of those servers, would amount to 23–29 terawatt hours (TWh) annually. Then, estimating that Google was processing up to 9 billion searches daily (a ballpark figure from various analysts), de Vries calculated that each request through an AI server requires 7–9 watt hours (Wh) of energy. That is 23–30 times the energy of a normal search, going by figures Google reported in a 2009 blogpost (see go.nature.com/3d8sd4t). When asked to comment on de Vries’ estimate, Google did not respond.\n\nThis energy calculation felt like “grasping at straws”, de Vries says, because he had to rely on third-party estimates that he could not replicate. And his numbers quickly became obsolete. The number of servers required for an AI-integrated Google search is likely to be lower now, because today’s AI models can match the accuracy of 2023 models at a fraction of the computational cost, as US energy-analyst firm SemiAnalysis (whose estimates de Vries had relied on) wrote in an e-mail to Nature.\n\nEven so, the firm says that the best way of assessing generative AI’s energy footprint is still to monitor server shipments and their power requirements, which is broadly the method used by many analysts. However, it is difficult for analysts to isolate the energy used solely by generative AI, because data centres generally perform non-AI tasks as well.\n\nBottom-up estimates\n\nThe other way to examine AI’s energy demand is ‘bottom-up’: researchers measure the energy demand of one AI-related request in a specific data centre. However, independent researchers can perform the measurements using only open-source AI models that are expected to resemble proprietary ones.\n\nThe concept behind these tests is that a user submits a prompt — such as a request to generate an image, or a text-based chat — and a Python software package called CodeCarbon then allows the user’s computer to access technical specifications of the chips that execute the model in the data centre. “At the end of the run, it’ll give you an estimate of how much energy was consumed by the hardware that you were using,” says Sasha Luccioni, an AI researcher who helped to develop CodeCarbon, and who works at Hugging Face, a firm based in New York City that hosts an open-source platform for AI models and data sets.\n\nLuccioni and others found that different tasks require varying amounts of energy. On average, according to their latest results, generating an image from a text prompt consumes about 0.5 Wh of energy, while generating text uses a little less. For comparison, a modern smartphone might need 22 Wh for a full charge. But there is wide variation: larger models require more energy (see ‘How much energy does AI use?’). De Vries says that the numbers are lower than those in his paper, but that might be because the models used by Luccioni and others are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the model underlying ChatGPT — and because AI is becoming more efficient.\n\nSource: HuggingFace AI Energy Score Leaderboard\n\nThe numbers are a lower bound, according to Emma Strubell, a computer scientist and collaborator of Luccioni’s at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Otherwise, “companies would be coming out and correcting us”, she says. “They’re not doing that.”\n\nWhat’s more, firms generally withhold the information the software needs to estimate the energy used for data-centre cooling. CodeCarbon also cannot access the energy consumption of some types of chip. This includes Google’s proprietary TPU chips, says Benoît Courty, a data scientist in France who maintains CodeCarbon.\n\nWill AI accelerate or delay the race to net-zero emissions?\n\nLuccioni has also studied how much energy it takes to train generative AI models — when a model extracts statistical patterns from massive amounts of data. But if models are receiving billions of queries daily, as de Vries assumed for his Google estimates, then the energy used to answer those queries — amounting to terawatt hours of electricity — will dominate AI’s annual energy demands. Training something the size of GPT-3, the model behind the first version of ChatGPT, requires energy in the order of a gigawatt hour.\n\nLast month, Luccioni and other researchers launched the AI Energy Score project, a public initiative to compare the energy efficiency of AI models on different tasks, which gives each model a star rating. Developers of proprietary, closed models are also able to upload test results, although only the US software firm Salesforce has participated so far, Luccioni says.\n\nCompanies are becoming increasingly close-mouthed about the energy requirements of their up-to-date industry models, Strubell says. As competition has heated up, “there has been a closing down of information shared outside of the company”, she says. But firms such as Google and Microsoft have reported that their carbon emissions are increasing, which they have ascribed to data-centre construction in support of AI. (Companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon didn’t address criticisms about a lack of transparency when asked by Nature; instead they emphasized that they were working with local authorities to ensure that new data centres don’t affect local utility supplies.)\n\nSome governments now require more transparency from companies. In 2023, the European Union adopted an Energy Efficiency Directive, which requires operators of data centres that are rated for at least 500 kilowatts of power to report their energy consumption each year.\n\nGlobal projections\n\nOn the basis of supply-chain estimation methods, analysts say that data centres currently use just a small proportion of the world’s electricity demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates4 that the electricity used by such facilities in 2022 was 240–340 TWh, or 1–1.3% of world demand (if cryptocurrency mining and data-transmission infrastructure are included, this raises the proportion to 2%).\n\nThe AI boom will increase this, but with world electricity consumption expected to grow by more than 80% by 2050 owing to the electrification of many industries, the rise of electric cars and greater demand for air conditioning, data centres “account for a relatively small share of overall electricity demand growth”, the IEA reports4 (see ‘World electricity growth’).\n\nSource: Ref. 4\n\nEven with approximations of AI’s current energy demands, it’s difficult to project future trends, warns Koomey. “Nobody has any idea what data centres, either AI or conventional, will use even a few years from now,” he says.\n\nThe main problem is disagreements about the number of servers and data centres that will be needed, and it’s an area where utilities and tech companies have financial incentives to inflate numbers, he says. Many of their predictions are based on “simple-minded assumptions” he adds. “They extrapolate recent trends out 10 or 15 years into the future.”\n\nLate last year, Koomey co-authored a report funded by the US Department of Energy5, which estimated that US data centres currently use 176 TWh (4.4%) of the country’s electricity, and that this might double or triple by 2028 to between 7% and 12%.",

          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "By the time her comprehensive exams rolled around in August 2024, Adriana Ivich had done nearly everything she could to prepare herself. To officially become a PhD student in biomedical informatics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Ivich needed to present her proposed research project and then meet with her committee for a closed-door grilling.\n\n“It’s definitely one of the hardest times to be a PhD student,” Ivich says. “I spent months — years really — preparing, but you still don’t know what they’re going to ask you.”\n\n‘Arms race with automation’: professors fret about AI-generated coursework\n\nShe could make an informed guess, however. Months before, she’d poured the biographies and publications of her five committee members into ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, and used it to create digital simulacrums of each person. She then fed the mimics her research proposal and asked the program to respond as her committee might, asking detailed questions and identifying gaps in her knowledge. The actual meeting “went pretty much like ChatGPT said it would,” says Ivich, who passed with flying colours.\n\nHer experience highlights just one of the many imaginative ways in which students are using generative AI. Unlike the ‘early days’ of two years ago, when using AI meant summarizing a paper or outlining an essay, students are now leaning into the tools’ ability to emulate human connection, turning chatbots into podcast hosts, language tutors, professors and even personal trainers.\n\n“I want professors to work with students assuming they’ll be using these models,” says Lily Lee, who is studying manufacturing and design engineering and music at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and is co-creator of the newsletter AI × Education. Although some educators worry about the erosion of critical-thinking skills, she says, “another way to look at it is that AI can help students learn more creatively, which helps them build their critical thinking as well.”\n\nA back-and-forth conversation\n\nWhen ChatGPT first appeared in November 2022, many educators and academic institutions responded with blanket bans, unsure whether these tools were more likely to spark innovation or cheating. The jury is still out on that, but administrators have started to relax some policies and give teachers greater freedom to direct when they can be used. How these tools are used, however, is often driven by students.\n\n“I’m pleasantly surprised at some of their creative uses,” says Victor Lee, a learning-sciences researcher at Stanford University in California who focuses on the intersections between AI and education.\n\nSix tips for better coding with ChatGPT\n\nLike Ivich, many students seem drawn to applications that showcase the ‘human’ side of programs such as ChatGPT and NotebookLM, an AI-powered interface from Google in Mountain View, California, for interpreting documents. Although early iterations of these tools required users to key in queries, newer versions allow people to speak into a microphone, enabling more-natural, organic conversations.\n\nSami Melhem, who is studying computer science at Texas A&M University in College Station, created his own chatbot, Class Primer, to tutor him. Built atop ChatGPT-4, the program begins by asking for details about a class, including a course description, learning outcomes, required textbooks and a syllabus. Then, it breaks down the course into ‘priming sessions’ spread out over the semester.\n\nMelhem now spends his Sunday afternoons familiarizing himself with a few weeks’ worth of material before the concepts are introduced in class. The bot lets Melhem engage with his lectures in different ways, such as by creating playful analogies or visual maps that link concepts and show how they connect over the semester. As a visual learner, Melhem says that the diagrams especially “help with understanding the subject as a whole”.\n\nOther students, such as Jan Bartkowiak, who is studying economics at Minerva University in San Francisco, California, have made chatbots that emulate famous historical figures to interrogate their thinking. In 2024, Bartkowiak wrote an essay on the Vietnam War and used this exercise to probe how historians or contemporary political figures, such as Henry Kissinger, who served as the United States national security adviser and secretary of state during the conflict, might have framed certain events.\n\n“You might want to quickly identify which book or philosopher supports your point, so instead of starting your research by digging deeply into those books, you can start with ChatGPT,” he says. “You can have back-and-forth conversations and ask clarifying questions, and that’s been very useful.”\n\nThree ways ChatGPT helps me in my academic writing\n\nThis ability to speak to chatbots has proven particularly helpful for students taking courses outside their main specialism — for instance, to attain skills that they need or want.\n\nElda Bengu is a psychology student at Arizona State University in Tempe, an institution that has embraced AI tools through an AI Innovation Challenge in partnership with OpenAI. As part of that effort, Bengu’s lecturer Christiane Reves created a chatbot called Language Buddy that Bengu has used to practise speaking German. Research shows that engaging in conversation is among the quickest ways to improve language skills, but students aren’t always able to say things in the clearest way or ramp up the complexity of their speaking. Language Buddy can.\n\nInitially sceptical, Bengu says that after testing how the app handled her first language, Turkish, she was pleasantly surprised with its performance. “I was able to have a conversation and even ask it to speak in a certain dialect or accent, which would be especially useful if you’re learning to live somewhere new.”\n\nMastering the calendar\n\nAnother space in which students have successfully channelled the usefulness of generative AI is in streamlining their workflows. By using AI as a type of personal assistant, tools can quickly pull together information, prepare schedules and free up precious time.",

          "authors": "Georgina Ferry",
          "abstract": "Against the Odds: Women Pioneers of Science John Gribbin and Mary Gribbin Icon Books (2025)\n\nWhat is it with toilets? In domestic households, men and women use the same ones without a fuss, but at some point in history it became etiquette for toilets in workplaces to be segregated. And in supposedly male environments, it meant that there simply weren’t any for women. It then became absurdly easy to use the lack of appropriate toilets as an excuse to deny women a role in those environments or, if they did take a job there, to make their lives difficult.\n\n‘Male-dominated campuses belong to the past’: the University of Tokyo tackles the gender gap\n\nToilets come up in several of the 12 stories selected for John and Mary Gribbin’s gallery of female pioneers in science, Against the Odds. In the opening years of the twentieth century, physicist Lise Meitner, banished to a basement because she wasn’t allowed to work in the chemistry laboratories of what was then the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin, had to use the toilets in a neighbouring restaurant. During the 1950s, computer pioneer Lucy Slater, while developing the operating system for an early computer at the University of Cambridge, UK, smashed the sanitary equivalent of a glass ceiling by simply using the men’s toilet (singing loudly to signal her presence). And in 1964, Vera Rubin became the first female astronomer who was officially allowed to use the big telescopes at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories in California, overturning a ban that had been partly, but explicitly, based on the lack of a women’s toilet.\n\nScience trailblazers\n\nCompared with unequal pay for the same work, the reality of men with fewer qualifications being promoted ahead of them and the frank refusal to recognize that a married woman with children might be capable of a career, the toilet issue was probably a trivial annoyance to these women. But it symbolizes how, for centuries, women have been considered unsuitable as scientists for reasons that have nothing to do with their ability or commitment.\n\nThe Gribbins’ aim is to “highlight the achievements of women who overcame the odds and achieved scientific success ... as society changed over about 150 years”. They don’t justify their selection, other than to note that the women featured (ordered by year of birth) collectively cover the period. But it is startling that physicist Chien-Shiung Wu is the only scientist who is not white or born in a Western country (and she spent most of her career in the United States). The ‘hidden figures’ — African American women who calculated trajectories for early NASA space missions — remain hidden. Many girls won’t find a role model who looks like them in the book.\n\nPhysicist Chien-Shiung Wu made instrumental contributions to the field of nuclear physics.Credit: IanDagnall Computing/Alamy\n\nWith that caveat, the Gribbins tell the stories with an adroit mix of anecdote and exposition. There is a bias towards physical sciences, perhaps reflecting John Gribbin’s background in astrophysics. Some of those featured (such as crystallographer Rosalind Franklin) are close to being household names, others (geophysicists Eunice Newton Foote and Inge Lehmann) are much less familiar. Three of the women (chemists Irène Joliot-Curie and Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin and geneticist Barbara McClintock) won Nobel prizes; two (Meitner and Wu) should have done.\n\nSome of the women were less celebrated during their lifetimes. It took 100 years for historians to uncover the work done by Foote, as a wealthy ‘lady amateur’ working in her home lab in New York state. She demonstrated that water vapour and carbon dioxide absorbed energy from sunlight and so could increase global temperatures. Her 1856 paper included the statement that if “the air had mixed with it a larger proportion [of CO2] than at present, an increased temperature ... would have necessarily resulted”. Three years later, John Tyndall, unaware of Foote’s work, performed the experiments that are generally credited with establishing the nature of the ‘greenhouse effect’.\n\nEqual partners?",

          "abstract": "The administration of US President Donald Trump has already laid off thousands of government workers.Credit: Tierney L. Cross/Getty\n\nAgencies across the US government have been ordered to initiate another punishing round of lay-offs as Congress moves forwards with a plan to slash their budgets — a potential blow to science.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next\n\nOn Wednesday, Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), sent a memo directing agency heads to submit two-step plans for significant ‘reductions in force’ (RIFs), with the first step due by 13 March and the second by 14 April. The memo does not provide absolute numbers but calls for “maximum elimination of functions that are not statutorily mandated”.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump “has targeted every single federal worker and does not seem to care how much turmoil they cause for either the employees or the American public”, the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing about 800,000 workers, said in a 26 February statement. “The chaos is the point.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on this and other statements in this story.\n\nStarving the government\n\nThe OMB memo is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce, which it has said is corrupt, inefficient and overreaching in business regulations. Agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) — two major funders of US academic science — have already endured sizable lay-offs. Over the past few weeks, the Trump administration has purged hundreds of people who worked on the federal government’s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it calls “illegal and immoral discrimination programs”. Agencies have also fired thousands of ‘probationary’ employees, who were newly hired or had recently transferred into new positions, although a federal judge ruled on 27 February that some of the firings were illegal. And on 3 March, NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan sent all staff members at the agency an e-mail stating that the NSF would reinstate more than 80 full-time probationary employees who were fired.\n\nRussell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, sent a memo earlier this week calling for significant reductions in force across government agencies.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nFiring permanent employees en masse, as called for in the latest memo, would be a significant escalation that could face legal challenges. RIFs at government agencies require a valid reason, such as budgetary constraints, says Nick Bednar, a legal scholar at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. But the administration might soon have the justification it needs: Trump’s Republican allies in Congress are working to pass a budget bill that seeks to cut at least US$1.5 trillion–2 trillion from the federal budget over the next ten years. By comparison, last year’s entire discretionary budget — the portion that Congress allocates each year and includes funding for science agencies — was less than $1.7 trillion.\n\nVought has long advocated for slashing government budgets. In a 2023 report making federal budget suggestions, Vought, then-president of a right-wing organization based in Washington DC called the Center for Renewing America, used war-like terms to describe the coming battle to dismantle a “woke and weaponized” federal government, including a “small scientific elite”, that feeds on taxpayer resources. “That is the central and immediate threat facing the country — the one that all our statesmen must rise tall to vanquish,” he wrote, advocating that the government can be “starved in order to dismantle it”.\n\nDisappearing programmes\n\nThe sheer scale of the Trump administration’s effort to downsize the US government has no modern precedent. In the 1990s, then-US-president Bill Clinton ordered comparatively mild reductions: at least 4% of the workforce was cut over 3 years, mainly accomplished through attrition strategies, such as leaving positions vacant when people retired.\n\n‘Targeted and belittled’: scientists at US environmental agency speak out as layoffs begin\n\nSince Clinton, some agencies have seen even larger swings in their workforce over the years. During Trump’s first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, for example, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) culled around 1,100 people, or 7% of its staff members, despite congressional efforts to block budget cuts.\n\nIf the latest RIFs are carried out at the planned scale, they could permanently weaken science agencies, policy specialists say.\n\nAt the NSF, a reduction as high as 50% of the workforce — about 800 of some 1,600 people — was suggested by several NSF sources on the basis of projected budget cuts for next year. “We are concerned that entire programmes and divisions will disappear,” says an NSF employee who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nThese extreme cuts mirror the scale of Vought’s 2023 proposal to reduce the agency’s budget by more than half, from about $9 billion to less than $4 billion. The agency wouldn’t be “able to fulfil its statutory mission — it can’t do that with $4 billion”, says Kenny Evans, a science-policy researcher at Rice University in Houston, Texas. “NSF as we know it could cease to exist.” (The NSF awards about $8.5 billion in research grants each year.)",

It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nDuring his PhD in the United States, computer scientist Vukosi Marivate discovered both the power of inclusive spaces and the sense of isolation created by non-diverse gatherings. Since then, Marivate, now a data scientist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, has been building a critical mass of African data scientists — so that their voices can be part of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nIn 2016, Marivate and his fellow researchers established the Deep Learning Indaba conference (in Bantu languages, indaba means a consultation or an important discussion) to help to build a local community around machine learning and AI. The 2023 conference, held in Accra, Ghana, attracted 800 researchers from more than 62 countries, half of which were in Africa.\n\nTrekking across Nepal to bridge its gender gap in the sciences\nMarivate also co-founded Masakhane, a grass-roots community of more than 1,000 researchers, software developers and language specialists from 30 African countries, which aims to galvanize research in natural language processing in African languages, for and by Africans. Natural language processing uses machine-learning techniques to process text and speech, for purposes such as translation and transcription. Historically, Africa’s 2,000 languages have been neglected in digital products. One of Masakhane’s projects createdbespoke scientific terms for African languages, and the community continues to generate African-led AI research groups and companies on the continent.\n\nWhen did you realize that you wanted to tackle the lack of diversity in science?\n\nDuring my PhD at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, I remember going to the International Conference on Machine Learning, one of the world’s top meetings on the subject. I walked into a room filled with people and on the other side of the giant hall was the only other Black person there. It messes with your mind and you start asking, “What's happening here? Why are there only two of us?” You feel as if you do not belong.\n\nThat’s why I need to ensure that I open doors to others. It’s about access. How do we make sure that the people who are applying for international funding or fellowships better represent the African continent, and help them to realize that they can be excellent, like anybody else?\n\nI also learnt that it doesn’t necessarily need to be me who helps them: it’s about using the network, asking who else is working in these subject areas — in the same country or on the continent — and then asking how I can connect students who are in those spaces. The Deep Learning Indaba and Masakhane are networks that are much, much bigger than any individual.\n\nWhy is diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work important?\n\n'Anyone engaging in scientific practice shouldn’t be excluded’: the United Kingdom’s only Black chemistry professor, on diversity\nOnce you start engaging with science in a societal way, you see that the people who are really pushing for innovation to come into their communities tend to be very different from those who are chasing the highest levels of prestige of science.\n\nI think the best of us are still to come. Young people on the African continent are going to do so much more than us, older scientists. They have better networks; they have more global recognition of the work that they do. We’re going to have amazing work come from these young people and others who are not typically represented in these spaces.\n\nWhat obstacles do Africans face in global AI and computing spaces?\n\nThe AI researcher archetype tends to be male, white and from the global north. We’re trying to say that your race, disability, gender and even your geographical area shouldn’t matter. We want people to feel comfortable, so that they can be themselves and bring their full selves into AI and computing spaces, without changing themselves to fit into the system.\n\nThe other barriers include funding and the pressures on students. For example, many South African students are likely to be breadwinners at home and are often pushed towards non-research industry jobs. How do we make sure that the ones that have that spark find places in the discipline and have options?\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor?\n\nOne is Tshilidzi Marwala, a South African AI engineer and rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo. Back in 2006, I was studying engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) in Johannesburg, and wanted to work for a big engineering company and make money. Marwala said, “There are more interesting things out there in the world that you might want to look at.” His laboratory was at Wits at the time, and there I saw people who looked like me, who had backgrounds similar to mine. That experience changes you. He was also so generous with everyone, asking, “How do we open opportunities for you?” That was a major turning point in my scientific life.",

Although the disruption does not seem to have been deliberate, and the service has since been restored, the episode highlights scientists’ reliance on the website and left many anguished about its future.\n\nPubMed “is one of the primary platforms that health-care providers, researchers and students rely on to access peer-reviewed medical literature”, says Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious-diseases physician who studies global health in Dallas, Texas. The database, which indexes more than 37 million articles, is maintained by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), based in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nThe NIH told Nature in an e-mail that, on 1 March “some of NIH public-web services experienced service disruptions” but all services were restored on 2 March. “NIH is committed to resilient and open access to PubMed and other NIH web services,” the team wrote.\n\nBut Kuppalli says any disruption — even if temporary — raises concerns about how researchers access essential scientific information. “It also serves as a reminder of the need for contingency plans, such as alternative repositories or offline access to critical research, to ensure that health-care providers and researchers are not left without crucial information when they need it most,” she says.\n\nAlthough alternative databases exist, “PubMed stands out because it is a freely accessible, comprehensive and government-supported database that aggregates a vast amount of biomedical literature”, says Kuppalli.\n\nGone dark\n\nOn 1 March, some researchers noticed the site had stopped working. “Omg, did Pubmed go dark???” wrote Thanh Neville, a physician and pulmonology researcher at UCLA Health in Los Angeles, California, on the social-media platform Bluesky. “I hope and pray it comes back soon!” wrote Madhu Pai, a public-health researcher at McGill University in Canada.\n\nSome researchers worried that the site had been taken down by US President Donald Trump’s administration. Over the past few weeks, content on several federal government websites has been withdrawn or modified in response to executive orders issued by the Trump administration.\n\nBut people in some locations could still access the site, says Bert Hubert, a software developer and co-founder of the software firm Power DNS, leading him to conclude that the site had not been intentionally shut down. “Then it would be really gone for everyone,” he says, as had happened with the US Agency for International Development website.\n\nIt’s still not clear what caused the problem, says Hubert. “There should be a very serious investigation into how this could have happened and why it took two days because this is worldwide critical infrastructure.”\n\nAlternative databases",

          "authors": "Lynn Hendricks, Raeka Aiyar, Uma Palanisamy, Nyasha Phanisa Sithole",
          "abstract": "In the past few weeks, global health research programmes have been shaken by events in the United States. These include the country’s intention to withdraw from the World Health Organization, a freeze on foreign aid from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. HIV programmes are closing down, trials of malaria drugs have ceased and academic societies and universities have scrubbed their websites of mentions of DEI.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, continued efforts to reduce health inequities remain crucial. In the United States, for example, Black women are more likely to die of breast cancer than are white women1. Globally, most clinical trials and biomedical studies focus on men of European ancestry, hindering efforts to improve the health of other communities. Under-represented groups struggle to access health care that meets their needs.\n\nHere, four experts share insights into how to win the trust of under-represented communities to conduct research that can help to achieve health equity.\n\nLYNN HENDRICKS: Embrace unconventional methods\nHealth researcher Lynn Hendricks uses creative arts to engage with communities that might not otherwise wish to be involved in research.Credit: Stefan Els, Stellenbosch University\n\nInclusivity in health research means embracing research styles that best meet a population’s needs and priorities. Sometimes that might mean adopting approaches that don’t look much like typical scientific experiments.\n\nAs a public-health researcher, I’ve found that the creative arts are a great way to connect with communities that might otherwise be disenfranchised from science. Art can cross language and cultural boundaries and can be harnessed to discuss emotions, experiences and challenges. For instance, I’ve used craft and digital storytelling to explore the lives of people who grew up on the streets in South Africa, who do not usually trust anyone easily.\n\nYoung people are crucial to research — how can they be paid fairly?\n\nArt can enable participants to be co-researchers. Part of one study I conducted set out to fill in evidence gaps about the barriers that prevent young women living with perinatal HIV from taking daily antiretrovirals, with the participants driving the project2. Together, we used photographs and videos to study their lives; drawing and collage to identify the key challenges they face; and dance and documentary-making to decide what we wanted to share with others (see go.nature.com/4t6zh5j).\n\nSome might say that these approaches cannot provide the same concrete findings as conventional methods. A more-typical study might have explored the barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence. By contrast, our work revealed a complex net of intersecting environmental factors that had not previously been considered — such as sounds and objects in the women’s surroundings, the tolls taken by hazardous trips to the clinic and the unpleasant sensation of taking the medicine.\n\nEthics boards should be more receptive to participant-led research. The HIV project was questioned by the ethics committee, which wanted specific objectives and methodologies — the typical route for getting ethical clearance. But truly inclusive research requires a fundamental shift in power dynamics, recognizing the importance of participant comfort and agency to dictate the course of the research.\n\nResearchers and institutions should embrace the fact that unconventional research can lead to unconventional research outputs. As well as academic publications, our project produced videos, art exhibitions and photo essays. These outputs should be accepted as valuable products of research. Indeed, they can be more useful than papers when it comes to engaging stakeholders outside science — such as policymakers and local governments — because they are easily understandable by all.\n\nRAEKA AIYAR: Rebuild trust with empathy\nRaeka Aiyar (left) hears from a patient advocate at a panel discussion on health equity.Credit: The New York Stem Cell Foundation\n\nMany minoritized communities share a justifiable distrust of science, because of the long history of exploitation and harm by researchers and physicians. The onus is on scientists to rebuild the trust in these relationships, so that we can engage these communities as partners — not subjects.\n\nI learnt the hard way how even well-intentioned science can amplify mistrust. In 2013, I co-authored the first reported genome sequence of a HeLa cell line3, one of the most widely used cell lines in biomedical science. The scientific community initially shared our excitement about the value of these data for genetic research. But we failed to anticipate the views of the family of Henrietta Lacks, the Black woman whose tumour sample was used to create HeLa cells in the 1950s without her knowledge.\n\nWhat Gives You Hope for Health Equity?\n\nThe Lacks family responded with frustration and concern about how the genome data could affect their privacy, so we pulled the data down from the public domain. Ultimately, the US National Institutes of Health — which had funded a separate study of the HeLa genome — engaged with the family over several months, and we reached an agreement to restore the data under controlled access.\n\nThere are many lessons to be learnt from our oversight. Before beginning a study, scientists should always ask: how will the communities that are affected by the research perceive it? Could the way in which the data are presented amplify a fear or harmful narrative? Can the research design be improved to bring more benefits to the communities?\n\nFinding the answers starts with empathy. Scientists and science communicators should listen to the stories of the people behind the data. Understanding our own privileges and biases in the light of diverse perspectives makes us better, more objective scientists.\n\nCommunities that might be affected by research should be asked for input respectfully, early and often. We as researchers should share our hopes for what our research will achieve; listen and respond to concerns; continue the dialogue if communities are willing; and desist if they are not — even if that means stopping a project.\n\nFor some communities, letting scientists continue to benefit more from their data than the communities do will be a non-starter. An Indigenous community whose land was stolen, for example, might be understandably reticent to openly share their genome data. Given the current upheaval in US funding, it is urgent that funders and institutions train and incentivize scientists to learn from these communities and build more effective research programmes, together.\n\nBelieving that everyone deserves to benefit from research is not sufficient to rebuild trust with communities that have been abused in the name of science. Open-hearted engagement with diverse communities and responsible communication of science — including honest reckoning with systemic discrimination — are crucial, now more than ever.\n\nUMA PALANISAMY: Centre communities throughout projects\nUma Palanisamy helped to develop an app that uses real-time sign language interpretation services through video conferencing to improve health-care access for Deaf Malaysians.\n\nAs researchers, it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that because we are trained in scientific processes and well acquainted with the literature in our field, we are ideally placed to design experiments and interventions. But what we think will work best is not as important as the stakeholders we want to help. Scientists must be willing to listen, adapt and alter research plans, to suit a community’s needs.\n\nThe Deaf community in Malaysia has a unique language and cultural identity. This causes problems for Deaf people when it comes to accessing health-care services — with sign-language interpreters in short supply, Deaf people can find themselves trying to explain a complex medical condition to a physician who can’t understand them, and whom they cannot hear. I’ve been involved in developing an app, called Deaf In Touch Everywhere (DITE), to improve health-care access for Deaf Malaysians by providing real-time sign language interpretation services through video conferencing, among other support services.\n\nHealth of people who are displaced in their own countries is a neglected global crisis",

          "authors": "Emma Marris",
          "abstract": "Sadie has spent years hiding her problem from her family. In her day job, she works as a purchasing agent for a scientific firm, which requires placing large orders for everything from chemical reagents to US$8-million worth of glass vials. But in her personal time, Sadie goes on buying sprees for herself. She has ordered cameras, camera accessories, scrapbooking supplies, metal-detecting equipment, lasers, board games, planners, fountain pens, tech gadgets, nail polish, computer keyboard parts and yarn. She bought everything online.\n\nBefore she knew it, she was $20,000 in debt. “I couldn’t believe it,” she says. “I never told my husband how bad it was.” She has been paying the debt off, but she can’t say exactly where the total stands today. “I’m so ashamed I won’t even check the balance,” she says. Sadie asked to remain anonymous so her family would not find out that she’s a compulsive shopper.\n\nSadie’s struggle is not a new phenomenon. German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin described krankhafte Kauflust — the pathological desire to buy — as early as 1899. But many specialists worry that the problem is getting much worse now — in part because of the rise of e-commerce companies such as Amazon, Chinese fast-fashion firm Shein and online marketplace Temu, some of which use game-like strategies to sell items. Last year, the European Commission announced it was investigating several aspects of Temu’s business, including “the risks linked to the addictive design of the service”.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nAs more and more shopping has moved online, retailers are increasingly using powerful psychological techniques to keep shoppers spending money. The Internet has, in effect, turned “mundane behaviours” such as shopping into “something that resembles a drug”, in the view of Anna Lembke, a psychiatrist at Stanford University in California, and the author of popular books about addiction. As a result, she says, “it suddenly becomes a problem for the masses”.\n\nAnd that problem extends across the globe. Researchers have studied compulsive shopping in many countries, including the United States, Turkey, Poland, Germany, India, Brazil, South Korea and Pakistan — where almost one-third of university students were classified as compulsive buyers in both physical stores and online1.\n\nThere is particular concern about the problem in China, which might have the highest prevalence of the condition ever recorded. Heping He, a marketing researcher at Shenzhen University in China, conducted a survey that found around 29.1% of the general population of China shopped compulsively2.\n\nHe is one of many researchers around the globe who are investigating the prevalence of the problem as well as the brain pathways involved and how compulsive shopping relates to similar types of condition. But researchers studying these issues face a problem: there is no official diagnosis of shopping addiction or compulsive shopping, which could help to stimulate further research and aid with demands for regulation.\n\nConsumer culture\n\nAlthough compulsive shopping has probably existed for as long as money and markets have, the Internet has made it much easier for people to make purchases. “Before the rise of online shopping in China, few people paid attention to compulsive-buying behaviour,” says He. Today, China is “one of the most developed regions globally in terms of Internet commerce”, he says. Add that to what he describes as “a materialistic consumer culture” and you’ve got an epidemic of shopping addiction.\n\nCompulsive shopping was once seen as problem that affected mostly women. But not all studies have found differences between genders, especially among younger shoppers3. In China, He says “the gender gap in compulsive buying appears to be narrowing, as men increasingly embrace online shopping amid the boom in Internet retailing”.\n\nBrain scans indicate that shopping can activate the dopamine reward system.Credit: Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty\n\nAlthough data suggest that the problem is surging, there’s no official entry for shopping addiction or compulsive shopping in the two main references that are used to help make diagnoses: the International Classification of Diseases — which is maintained by the World Health Organization — and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Many clinicians and researchers say that the time has come to make the condition official. This is necessary, they say, to help people who are facing the problem to gain access to care.\n\nOne reason compulsive shopping is not yet a recognized disorder is a lack of consensus on its cause. Researchers debate whether it is brought about by a pathological level of impulsivity, a compulsion resembling obsessive–compulsive disorder or a behavioural addiction, activating reward pathways similar to those linked to drugs and alcohol. Although many researchers who have looked into the issue would like to see more studies completed, the addiction model for compulsive shopping seems to be ascendant among specialists, as the broader category of behavioural addictions is increasingly accepted. Gambling disorder, which is in many ways similar to compulsive shopping, was added to the fifth edition of the DSM in 2013 and was grouped with addictions to substances.\n\nAccording to Lembke, the phenomenology of shopping addiction also follows the classic addiction pattern: “People do it at the beginning either to have fun or to solve a problem, from managing anxiety or depression to loneliness to boredom.” If the behaviour works for them, they keep repeating it until “it changes their brains” and they can’t stop, even as they descend into debt and, in some cases, destroy relationships with close family, she says.\n\nIs the Internet bad for you? Huge study reveals surprise effect on well-being\n\nThere are some brain-imaging studies that support the addiction theory for shopping. Patrick Trotzke, a psychologist at Charlotte Fresenius University in Cologne, Germany, scanned the brains of 18 people who were seeking treatment for buying–shopping disorder and 18 control participants while showing them pictures of shopping centres and shopping bags, as well as desirable objects, such as handbags and consumer electronics. In individuals with a shopping problem, these images activated the dopamine reward system in the striatum — the same system implicated in drug addiction4. “They get thrilled when you show them these pictures,” Trotzke says. “The dopaminergic reward system is on fire.” This tends to weaken the control system in the prefrontal cortex, Trotzke adds, until affected individuals “no longer have control” over their purchasing behaviour.\n\nFurther evidence that compulsive shopping is connected to this dopamine reward system comes from people who are taking excessive amounts of medicine that alters this system — and who then develop uncontrolled shopping behaviours5. In one case report of a person with Parkinson’s disease who took more dopaminergic medication than prescribed6, the individual “presented dressed in colourful clothes and was wearing three gold necklaces”. It emerged that they had purchased “over 5,000 pocket watches and 42 old and unusable cars”.\n\nIn 2021, 138 specialists from 35 countries were asked to weigh in on diagnostic criteria for buying–shopping disorder. The group used the Delphi method, which is an iterative and anonymous way of collecting opinions from a group that prevents leading researchers from exerting undue influence7. The group agreed that the condition was a distinct entity that was “due to addictive behaviours” and settled on the name “compulsive buying disorder”. The study’s authors derived a proposed list of criteria for the disorder, which includes intrusive urges to buy; lack of control over buying; buying items without using them; chasing the high of buying and using buying to feel better about bad feelings; and experiencing negative consequences because of buying.\n\nOnline marketplaces, such as Temu, often use game-like strategies on their platforms.Credit: Timon Schneider/Alamy\n\nHowever, the idea that people either have or do not have compulsive buying disorder might be simplistic. “It’s a spectrum disorder, just like drugs and alcohol,” Lembke says. “Some people have a bit of a shopping problem and other people end up with very severe addictions where they go into huge financial debt and they lose their primary relationship.”\n\nA 2020 study of more than 1,000 people in Switzerland grouped participants into categories of shoppers, including ‘risky’ and ‘addicted’. The researchers estimated that around 3% of the people in their sample were truly addicted to online shopping, with a further 11% at risk, because they agreed with the statements “I think about shopping/buying things all the time” and “I shop/buy things in order to change my mood”8.\n\nBrain-imaging studies such as Trotzke’s can’t be used to neatly diagnose compulsive buying disorder, because shopping is at least somewhat rewarding for most people. “I like shopping, and when you show me shopping-related things, my brain reward system is also turning on,” he explains.",

          "title": "US universities curtail PhD admissions amid Trump science funding cuts",
          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Some universities across the United States are reducing or halting their PhD admissions because of federal-funding uncertainties stemming from actions taken by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Few universities have released public statements about their strategies, so prospective graduate students have remained mostly in the dark about which institutions are cutting back. Nature spoke to several young scientists caught up in the confusion. Some have received e-mails from universities indicating that they would have been accepted if not for funding uncertainties; others have been told that programmes are completely paused.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, some prospective students even received informal offers to join the graduate programme, only to later have them rescinded, according to the institution’s newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian.\n\n“The whole thing is horrendous,” says a professor at the university, who requested anonymity because they are involved in admissions. “They’re cutting the heart of the intellectual mission of the university.” The university did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the centre of most of the turmoil is the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), which, with an annual budget of US$47 billion, is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research. Funding of NIH research grants has mostly been frozen for the past month, owing to actions taken by the Trump administration to reduce federal spending. The freeze has persisted despite a federal judge’s order to release the money. Separately, under Trump, the NIH has attempted to slash the rate paid to US research institutions for the ‘overhead costs’ that, for instance, keep electricity on and pay the rent in researchers’ workspaces. The agency proposed cutting the rate from between 40% and 70% to a flat 15% — a potential loss of billions of dollars for universities. A coalition of universities, as well as the attorneys-general of 22 states sued to halt the policy, which they say is illegal, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it from taking effect.\n\nBecause of the dearth of information from universities curtailing their admissions, researchers have crowdsourced information about affected institutions on social media. Nature contacted nearly 30 universities from one list of programmes, posted to the platform Bluesky, to verify the information. Some, such as the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, confirmed they had paused admissions. Others, including Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, said that their cuts were not made in response to the current federal-funding situation. More than 60% did not reply.\n\nUncertain futures\n\nAlthough many of the affected programmes are in the biomedical sciences, as reporting in STAT has detailed, uncertainty about federal funds exists across a number of disciplines. A prospective PhD student who applied to the physics programme at the University of Arizona in Tucson received a temporary rejection e-mail, which they shared with Nature. “We are truly impressed by your outstanding academic record,” the correspondence states, but “recent uncertainties in U.S. federal funding policies have significantly impacted our admissions process. At this time, we are unable to extend an offer to you, despite your strong ranking in our applicant pool”. The University of Arizona did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPostdocs and PhD students hit hard by Trump’s crackdown on science\n\n“It’s awfully demoralizing,” says the prospective student who, along with others interviewed for this story, requested anonymity out of fear for their admissions opportunities. “I feel terrible for the departments, too, whose professors spent so much time reading applications and picking out their new students only to find out they cannot be funded. I think everyone has had the rug completely pulled out from under them.” The student says they are thankful to have got into other programmes.\n\nBut not every student has been so lucky. One who applied to a social-sciences programme at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, received an informal offer of acceptance in January. Three weeks later, they received a letter from the school stating that admissions for the programme had been paused for the year. “Right now I don’t have any offers, and I’m not sure if I want to stay in research or not,” they say. Vanderbilt did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome universities have also stopped and restarted admissions in the past few weeks, creating more confusion. For instance, a student working in the post-baccalaureate programme at the NIH had applied to be a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh. They received a letter from the university on 24 February that said it was suspending admission of all graduate students. One day later, the university told Nature that the pause has now been lifted. “Our goal is to properly support existing community members while also responsibly adding new members to the community,” a spokesperson says.",

          "authors": "Kara Hanson",
          "abstract": "Selecting the venue for a global academic conference brings both opportunities and challenges. There are competing pressures: minimizing costs and travel distances for attendees while ensuring access to high-quality facilities and a reputable local university partner. However, one issue has become increasingly important: ease of access to travel visas.\n\nBecause immigration policies have tightened in some countries, particularly in North America and Europe, waiting times for visas have increased. For example, it can take Canadian visa authorities up to 18 months to process an application from someone in South Africa, according to the government’s immigration services website.\n\nTear down visa barriers that block scholarship\n\nSuch visa-related difficulties impede global scientific dialogue and the free exchange of ideas. I’ve become keenly aware of these issues as the president of the International Health Economics Association (IHEA) and tasked with planning a congress for July.\n\nOrganizing a global gathering of academics involves many months of planning. In 2023, we had selected Calgary, Canada, as the venue for the 2025 congress, after assessing submissions from several potential hosts. However, in April 2024, an IHEA committee member alerted us to the difficulties that researchers were encountering in obtaining visitor visas.\n\nWe explored workarounds, such as expediting the abstract submission and selection process and registering with the Canadian immigration department’s Special Events Liaison Unit. But these steps were insufficient. In May 2024, the IHEA board took the difficult decision to shift the conference to Bali, Indonesia. While looking for a new location, our main concern was finding a country with a more permissive visa regime than Canada’s. However, we also needed support from a strong local organizing committee and a venue big enough to accommodate our group.\n\nWe have been thinking more carefully about geographical equity and the convenience of our members, who are distributed around the globe. In the past, the meeting mainly alternated between Europe and North America, although we have held it once in China and once in Australia, and the last congress was held in South Africa — attracting participants from 106 countries.\n\n‘Exhausted and insulted’: how harsh visa-application policies are hobbling global research\n\nWe’ve now learnt that we need to consider visa equity, too. Meaningful academic discourse is not possible if important conferences are a venue only for those who can travel with relative ease. An informed global dialogue on crucial issues, such as health economics and policy, requires contributions from a diverse group of participants.\n\nTo our relief, there was no backlash from our membership when the decision to shift the venue was announced. On the contrary, we received e-mails from colleagues all over the world thanking the IHEA for its action, and for recognizing the challenges faced by researchers from low- and middle-income countries, who tend to have the greatest problems obtaining a visa.\n\nBut this is not just a problem of rich nations versus poorer ones — although visa constraints in Europe, Canada and the United States are widely recognized as onerous, some low- and middle-income countries also impose restrictions. For instance, visa denials affecting many participants at the Health Systems Research symposium in Bogotá in 2022 led some researchers to boycott the event.\n\nVisa discrimination — unfair or differential treatment of individuals based on nationality or other characteristics — is clearly at the root of the problem. But conference organizers are not always sensitive to such discrimination.",

          "authors": "Nicola Jones",
          "abstract": "An artificial-intelligence chip. Such chips have powered the rise of generative AI systems.Credit: Sergio Flores/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems with human-level reasoning are unlikely to be achieved through the approach and technology that have dominated the current boom in AI, according to a survey of hundreds of people working in the field.\n\nMore than three-quarters of respondents said that enlarging current AI systems ― an approach that has been hugely successful in enhancing their performance over the past few years ― is unlikely to lead to what is known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). An even higher proportion said that neural networks, the fundamental technology behind generative AI, alone probably cannot match or surpass human intelligence. And the very pursuit of these capabilities also provokes scepticism: less than one-quarter of respondents said that achieving AGI should be the core mission of the AI research community.\n\n\"I don’t know if reaching human-level intelligence is the right goal,” says Francesca Rossi, an AI researcher at IBM in Yorktown Heights, New York, who spearheaded the survey in her role as president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) in Washington DC. “AI should support human growth, learning and improvement, not replace us.”\n\nThe survey results were unveiled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Saturday at the annual meeting of the AAAI. They include responses from more than 475 AAAI members, 67% of them academics.\n\nGenerally smart\n\nGenerative-AI systems, which underlie tools including chatbots and image generators, are based on neural networks, computer systems that learn from vast amounts of data in a way inspired by the human brain. Over the past decade, developers seeking to improve these systems’ performance have made huge gains by scaling up their size ― for example, by increasing the amount of training data and a model’s number of ‘parameters’, the settings that an AI learns to adjust during training.\n\nHowever, 84% of respondents said that neural networks alone are insufficient to achieve AGI. The survey, which is part of an AAAI report on the future of AI research, defines AGI as a system that is “capable of matching or exceeding human performance across the full range of cognitive tasks”, but researchers haven’t yet settled on a benchmark for determining when AGI has been achieved.\n\nChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI\n\nThe AAAI report emphasizes that there are many kinds of AI beyond neural networks that deserve to be researched, and calls for more active support of these techniques. These approaches include symbolic AI, sometimes called ‘good old-fashioned AI’, which codes logical rules into an AI system rather than emphasizing statistical analysis of reams of training data. More than 60% of respondents felt that human-level reasoning will be reached only by incorporating a large dose of symbolic AI into neural-network-based systems. The neural approach is here to stay, Rossi says, but “to evolve in the right way, it needs to be combined with other techniques”.\n\nThe survey reveals concerns about unfettered AGI development. More than 75% of respondents said that pursuing AI systems with “an acceptable risk–benefit profile” should be a higher priority than achieving AGI; only 23% said that AGI should be the top priority. And about 30% of respondents agreed that research and development targeting AGI should be halted until we have a way to fully control these systems, ensuring that they operate safely and for the benefit of humanity.\n\nBut most community members oppose such a halt, and some point out that it would be difficult to enforce if implemented. “I don’t think it’s practical to do this ― companies will do this even if research agencies stopped funding it,” says Anthony Cohn, an AI researcher at the University of Leeds, UK, and an AAAI member. Besides, he adds, “I don’t think AGI is as imminent as many think,” giving researchers time to work on safety measures.",

          "authors": "Ewen Callaway",
          "abstract": "A company that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to ‘de-extinct’ woolly mammoths and other animals has claimed a breakthrough in its quest: the creation of hairier mice.\n\nThe gene-edited ‘woolly mice’ harbour a mix of mutations modelled on those of woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), as well as changes known to alter hair growth in mice, Colossal Biosciences announced in a 4 March press release and accompanying preprint1.\n\nColossal, which is based in Dallas, Texas, and is worth more than US$10 billion according to its latest valuation, says the woolly mouse represents an important step towards its goal of engineering Asian elephants — the mammoth’s closest living relative — with genetic changes for key mammoth traits. “The Colossal Woolly Mouse marks a watershed moment in our de-extinction mission,” said Ben Lamm, Colossal’s co-founder and chief executive, in the press release.\n\nBut some experts in mammoth genetics and genome editing question whether the mice represent a significant advance in either area, let alone a milestone on the way to bringing back woolly mammoths, which last roamed Earth some 4,000 years ago.\n\n“It’s far away from making a mammoth or a ‘mammoth mouse’,” says Stephan Riesenberg, a genome engineer at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. “It’s just a mouse that has some special genes.”\n\nShaggy-hair gene\n\nAs part of its effort to engineer mammoth-like elephants, Colossal and its collaborators are working to find gene variants that contributed to key mammoth traits, such as shaggy hair, cold tolerance and extra fat stores. To do this, they compare genomes extracted from the remains of dozens of mammoths and from other living and extinct relatives of the creatures, in search of protein-altering changes that evolved on the mammoth lineage.\n\nThe woolly mice tended to have tawny-toned shaggy hair.Credit: Colossal Biosciences\n\nTo test the accuracy of these comparisons, a team led by Beth Shapiro, Colossal’s chief scientist, used gene editing to create mice with mutations similar — but in most cases not identical — to those found in mammoths. Shapiro says the group also tested several gene mutations known to affect the hair of mice but not found in mammoths.\n\nThe researchers used different gene-editing tools to create mice with up to eight genetic alterations spread across seven genes. These mice tended to have long, shaggy hair that, owing to a mutation known to affect hair colour in mice, humans and mammoths, was tawny-toned instead of the usual dark grey. “Adorability was one of the unintended consequences that we did not expect,” Lamm says. Mice with a mammoth-inspired change to a gene involved in fat metabolism were no heavier than were mice with unedited genes.\n\nThe mice are only a few months old, and the researchers have not had much time to investigate how the mutations might affect their long-term health, including their fertility and propensity to develop cancers. The researchers plan to test whether the mice are any better at handling the cold than other mice, and to study their hair development.\n\nLamm says the company has no plans to breed or sell the mice commercially. But for about $3,500, scientists can purchase a shaggy-haired mouse strain known as ‘wooly’ from the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, which first bred the mice more than two decades ago. Researchers later showed that the strain carries a mutation in a gene called Fam83g — one of the genes inactivated in Colossal’s woolly mice.\n\nWoolly mammoths share many genes with Asian elephants.Credit: Darryl Brooks/Alamy\n\nShowing that changes found in mammoth genomes can affect mouse biology is a useful proof of principle, says Alfred Roca, a population geneticist at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, who sees the experiments as a step towards engineering elephants with mammoth traits. “It’s a very nice visualization of where you want to end up in the mammoth.”\n\nMammoth genomics",

          "title": "Ukraine’s research sector is struggling — can Europe help?",
          "authors": "Elisabeth Sweetman",
          "abstract": "Ukrainian researchers hope that research-funding reforms will revitalize the innovation sector.Credit: Ukrinform/Shutterstock\n\nUndaunted by the turmoil of the Russian invasion, the European Union has scaled up its presence in the Ukrainian research sector, establishing funding channels and offices in Kyiv. Scientists hope that these moves will drive reforms in Ukraine’s research-funding system and breathe new life into its struggling innovation sector.\n\nSince a Horizon Europe office was opened in Kyiv in late 2023, some norms have been beginning to shift, but the pace is slow because of the ongoing war. In 2024, for the first time, applications for grants at Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science took into account European values such as gender balance, open science and the impact of results on society, says Ganna Tolstanova, vice-rector for research at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. If these developments gain momentum, a new era of Ukrainian research could be in sight.\n\nEU support for Ukrainian research includes three initiatives, launched in December 2023: a Kyiv-based office for Horizon Europe, the EU’s research and innovation (R&I) programme; a commitment to award funding to at least 200 Ukrainian ‘deep-tech’ start-up companies; and a technology and innovation hub in Kyiv. The hub is one of 16 such initiatives that have been opened across central, eastern and southern Europe to boost connections between local businesses, education authorities and researchers.\n\nIn addition to the almost €59 million (US$62 million) in funding that Ukrainian research has so far received through Horizon Europe, the EU says it intends to increase its presence in the country to drive wide-ranging cultural changes in the research sector. “Ukraine’s successful integration into the EU R&I ecosystem will require large-scale policy reforms,” a Council of the European Union memorandum announced in 2023.\n\nFor Tolstanova, the opportunity for Ukraine to emulate the relative transparency and efficiency of the EU’s research-funding system would would be a game-changer. The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has announced plans for a comprehensive review of the country’s research infrastructure, including auditing all research institutions to determine the current state of their research practices.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nThese audits have not yet started, and nor has the wider review, owing to the continuing conflict with Russia. As of late 2023, almost 20% of Ukraine’s scientists had left the country1. Power outages occur for several hours each day — often without warning — and at least 35% of the research infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. According to Peter Berczik, who runs the Department of Physics of Stars and Galaxies at the Main Astronomical Observatory of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU) in Kyiv, the entire antenna system of the Radio Astronomy Institute in Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, was destroyed during the Russian occupation in 2022.\n\nBerczik says Horizon Europe is much more than a fund; its support could help to revitalize Ukrainian R&I by promoting competitiveness and fairness in how grants are allocated. But this will be no small feat. Ukrainians themselves will have to untangle the ageing roots of the research system to make a lasting difference, says Berczik. “Horizon Europe can be a first step, but it will not solve our problems. These are deep and go back more than 30 years.”\n\nDigging up old roots\n\nBerczik’s institution, NASU, is foremost in the minds of Ukrainian researchers who want to see changes in funding allocation. As Ukraine’s premier national research organization, NASU is the target of much criticism, and some scientists see it as antiquated and ineffective.\n\nNASU lacks transparency in how it handles grant applications, and information is sometimes obscured from researchers who might want to apply, one scientist who requested anonymity told Nature Index. The problem, they say, is that funding decisions are made by the directors of individual NASU centres, without involving the wider departments. Information about funding competitions often takes a long time to reach departments, says the scientist, so there is often no time left to submit an application. They note that some of the people who had key roles in allocating funding and managing grant applications have left Ukraine.\n\nBerczik, too, is concerned by what he sees as a lack of accountability and objectivity in funding decisions at NASU, and a stubborn culture of closed networks that makes it difficult for young researchers to progress. NASU did not respond to Nature Index’s requests for comment.\n\nLow salaries for researchers make the funding issue particularly contentious. NASU data show that the gross monthly salaries of PhD staff at NASU institutions amount to around €460, before tax and pension deductions. Researchers have to save their own money to cover the costs of publishing in top research journals. According to Berczik, some of these publications charge around £2,500 (US$3,100) per paper. Funding for scientists who win foreign grants from bilateral projects with EU countries, such as Poland, Lithuania and Austria, pays mainly for research done in the collaborating country. Moreover, the funding excludes accommodation, equipment and food.\n\nUkraine seeks to resume its role in cancer clinical trials\n\nSome Ukrainian research organizations are improving the competitiveness of the grant-application process, according to Tolstanova. She says the National Research Foundation of Ukraine (NRF) in Kyiv, a state budgetary institution established in 2018, is a good example of this. However, the bureaucracy in Ukraine can be oppressive, Tolstanova adds, which means that any improvements will take time. “There’s a lot of paperwork and restrictions.”\n\nFor example, researchers in Ukraine must justify each unit of chemical reagent or other consumables in agreements for research grants from the NRF, says Tolstanova. Any subsequent requirements trigger extra individual requests, creating further administrative burdens. By contrast, Tolstanova cites typical research-procurement processes at EU universities, which require the principal investigator to calculate costs across broad categories, such as equipment, travel expenses and event organization.\n\nThat said, the rigour of the process under the supervision of principal investigators at the NRF maximizes accountability for research, says Tolstanova. “I am confident that every penny of the NRF funding spent on science is spent for the intended purpose, and that the pricing is justified.” One advantage of the current system at the NRF is that government officials — rather than senior academics, as is the case at NASU — assess and award grant proposals. This brings more objectivity to the process, says Tolstanova.",

This area is a volcanic peninsula, and although there’s a lot of precipitation, most of the water passes through the rocks and flows underground to the sea. So the places where fresh water is available, such as the lake in Sandgerði, attract a lot of birds.\n\nOur project is to screen for strains of avian influenza (bird flu) to study how they spread. We focus on certain species of gull with migration paths that overlap here.\n\nLesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus) breed in Iceland during the summertime, and in the winter they migrate to Europe or West Africa. By contrast, the Iceland gull (Larus glaucoides) breeds farther north, in Greenland or Canada, but returns to Iceland for winter. Then there are the local ones, such as the great black-backed gull (Larus marinus) and the glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), that are here all year round.\n\nAll of that mixing means that Iceland is a key location for avian influenza viruses from Europe to move into North America, and vice versa.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Cambricon's Cambrian-1 chip uses a computing architecture specially designed for an artificial-intelligence technique known as deep learning.Credit: Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nChina is now producing most of the basic research that could underpin future computing hardware, an analysis has found. If that work develops into commercial applications, the United States might soon find it impossible to use export controls to retain its competitive advantage in high-performance microchip design and production, the authors say.\n\nAlthough the study’s findings do not mean that China is currently leading this field, “arguably, it’s showing us where things are headed”, says Zachary Arnold, a lead analyst at the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO) at Georgetown University in Washington DC, which performed the analysis.\n\nThe study, published on 3 March, finds that between 2018 and 2023, research papers on chip design and fabrication included authors affiliated with Chinese institutions more than twice as often as they did US ones. And it wasn’t just a matter of quantity: China also excelled when it came to highly cited papers. Chinese-affiliated authors co-authored 50% of papers that were in the top 10% most cited for their publication year. That compared with 22% for US-affiliated authors and 17% for those associated with European institutions.\n\nSuch research spans a wide range of academic disciplines, and encompasses everything from conventional computer chips and fast graphics-processing units optimized for artificial intelligence (AI) to completely new architectures. To find and collate relevant papers for their study, analysts at the ETO had to train a machine-learning algorithm. Their analysis captures mainly emerging chip technology, rather than commercial advances, which are often incremental and proprietary, says Arnold.\n\nThe study included only papers with English-language abstracts; for Chinese-authored papers, these are more likely to be those with international reach. China has been boosting its research output in many fields, Arnold says. “But I don’t know if we’ve seen a field where there is quite this difference,” he adds. “When you see so much activity, it’s hard to imagine that [won’t] have an effect on China’s technological capability and ultimately manufacturing capability in the coming years.”\n\nAcademic impact\n\nThe findings chime with what Yunji Chen sees on the ground in China. Chen, who heads up the State Key Laboratory of Processors in Beijing and is a co-founder of Cambricon, a company that designs chips optimized for AI, says that the country’s manufacturing ability lags behind its chip design, partly as a result of US export controls.\n\nStarting in October 2022, the US Department of Commerce began to prohibit the sale to China of certain advanced chips and manufacturing equipment. The US government said it was acting, in part, because China was using AI capabilities to “monitor, track, and surveil their own citizens, and fuel its military modernization”.",

          "abstract": "After earning degrees in mathematics and physics, Ewan Kirk pivoted into entrepreneurship.Credit: Isaac Raymond\n\nIn 2023, technology entrepreneur and early-stage investor Ewan Kirk joined the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge, UK, as its first Royal Society entrepreneur in residence.\n\nKirk helps staff and students to better understand business and entrepreneurship, offering them practical advice and support in launching companies, attracting funding and investment and collaborating with industry partners.\n\nHe talks about the role, the history of his entrepreneurial career and why the United Kingdom needs to do more to retain talent in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) if it is to remain a science superpower.\n\nTell us about your entrepreneur-in-residence role.\n\nOne of the first things I did after being appointed was to plan and deliver a lecture series that included practical advice on how to turn an idea into a business, give a presentation pitch and fund and grow a new enterprise.\n\nI also ran a series of drop-in sessions, during which people could discuss their ideas, ask for career or interview advice or talk about their next steps after earning their PhD.\n\nSometimes, faculty members will connect me with a postdoc who wants to talk about a piece of technology they have developed, and whether there is a commercial angle. They might be an international specialist in an incredibly complex area of mathematics or physics. These conversations are always intellectually demanding for me — but the real challenge is in working out how to turn an interesting technology into a commercial enterprise.\n\nWhat types of question do you get asked by budding maths entrepreneurs?\n\nSome things are relatively simple, such as, “How do you start a company?” Some aspects of entrepreneurship are domain-specific, but there’s also a lot of commonality — forecasting your cash flows, hiring employees, understanding your customers, forward planning, raising money and selling your product to a customer or to an investor.\n\nI advise people to refine their message. The fundamental question for every potential investor is, “How and when do you expect to make money?”\n\nA big challenge for early-stage entrepreneurs is raising money. I see an enormous number of company pitch decks — slide-format presentations made to pitch ideas to investors — both in my entrepreneur-in-residence role and through DeepTech Labs, which I started in 2020 in conjunction with Cambridge Innovation Capital, a venture-capital company, and the university.\n\nWhy postdocs need entrepreneurship training\n\nDeepTech Labs invests in early-stage technology companies and runs a 10-week programme to help them bridge the gap between early-stage pre-seed funding (which gets the company off the ground) and a larger series A funding round. We select five or six at a time, and the programme includes sessions on developing a strategic roadmap, value proposition and fundraising strategies, and building high-performing teams.\n\nPeople generally don’t think about how to pitch their business. They’re often excited about their own technology, but an investor has to see some kind of exit, or an opportunity to realize a return on their investment.\n\nWhat specific skills do mathematicians have that can help to nurture entrepreneurial instincts?\n\nMathematics is fundamental to absolutely everything, from particle physics to economics. The current interest in artificial intelligence (AI) — which is fundamentally just a branch of statistics — ensures that maths is at the cutting edge of the economy. Not only is maths a fundamental part of science, but mathematical training produces smart thinkers who have a lot to offer academia, businesses and society in general.\n\nI explain to mathematicians, statisticians and theoretical physicists that being able to control, program and understand computer networks is an incredibly valuable skill. ‘Data are the new oil’ is a cliché, but it’s true. And in most commercial jobs, you have to weigh up uncertainty or find ways to prove things, which is precisely what mathematicians and statisticians are trained to do.\n\nPresenting your ideas and convincing the audience of your conclusions are crucial skills. One of the most common mistakes made by people transitioning from academia to the commercial world is to present their work as if they are presenting an academic paper.\n\nIn fact, most people, including investors and customers, just want to hear the conclusion. Presenting is an essential skill that start-up candidates need.\n\nTell us about your own entrepreneurial career journey.\n\nI grew up in Cumbernauld, a town in west Scotland. I couldn’t play football, so my only option was to go down the academic route.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor’s degree in natural philosophy and astronomy at the University of Glasgow, UK, I was admitted to the University of Cambridge to do Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, a one-year master’s-level taught course, followed by a PhD in general relativity at the University of Southampton, UK.\n\nThe business of science\n\nI was always very interested in learning to program, and while earning my PhD, a friend and I created a software package, called MicroDraft, for Amstrad, which was a UK consumer-electronics company. To commercialize it, we formed a company called DaLEK Software.\n\nBack then, there was little to no support for entrepreneurs, so we pretty much had to work out everything ourselves, such as company formation, accounting and marketing.\n\nIt was a good but frustrating experience. We finally sold the rights to the software, and I think that experience really sparked my interest in entrepreneurship.\n\nI’d realized after earning my PhD that academic research wasn’t for me: I was good, but definitely not good enough to make a career as a researcher in the general theory of relativity.\n\nIn 1989, I went to work for a consultancy called Scientific Generics in Cambridge, as its director of innovation. The company, now called Sagentia Innovation, provided a great introduction to entrepreneurship and technology in a commercial environment.\n\nThree years later, I got a call from the investment bank Goldman Sachs, inviting me to interview for a position. During my interview, I was asked about programming for quantitative analysis, which involves using complex mathematical and statistical modelling to analyse financial markets. They offered me a job as a strategist on the commodities desk, based in London, despite my lack of knowledge about the industry.\n\nAfter a discussion with a colleague in the London currencies department, I started building software and creating models to price commodity derivatives, financial tools that allow an investor to profit from a commodity without owning it.\n\nAfter a few years there was a group of nearly 30 mathematicians and programmers who were writing the software and the models for the commodity-trading group, and eventually we gained a dominant position in that market. I was promoted to partner at Goldman in 2000; in 2005, I retired from the firm and I travelled around the world with my family.\n\nI then started a systematic hedge fund, which uses algorithms to trade financial instruments on the basis of quantitative data, called Cantab Capital Partners.\n\nThe company initially employed just a few people in a small office in Cambridge. We wanted to be the geekiest, most technologically advanced trading firm we could be — and five years later, we were managing US$5 billion.",

          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "Credit: photos777/Getty\n\nChina’s highest court has called for a crack down on the activities of paper mills, businesses that churn out fraudulent or poor-quality manuscripts and sell authorships. Some researchers are cautiously optimistic that the court’s guidance will help curb the use of these services, while others think the impact will be minimal.\n\n“This is the first time the supreme court has issued guidance on paper mills and on scientific fraud,” says Wang Fei, who studies research-integrity policy at Dalian University of Technology in China.\n\nPaper mills sell suspect research and authorships to researchers who want journal articles to burnish their CVs. They are a significant contributor to overall research misconduct, particularly in China.\n\nLast month, the the Supreme People’s Court published a set of guiding opinions on technology innovation. Among the list of 25 articles, one called for lower courts to crack down on ‘paper industry chains’, and for research fraud to be severely punished.\n\nOver the past decade, the Chinese government has issued regulations and policies to deter researchers from committing misconduct, including the use of paper mills, and has directed research institutions to investigate and punish researchers involved. But paper mills have largely continued, says Yin Bo, a lawyer and criminal-justice researcher at China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing.\n\n“Paper mills are very popular in China and there is a very huge business” involving them, says Gengyan Tang, who studies research integrity in China at the University of Calgary, Canada.\n\nThe guidelines issued by the supreme court are very important and signal that the courts will contribute to creating a fairer research ecosystem, says Yin, who also runs an online course on research integrity at Beijing Normal University.\n\nGrowing caseload\n\nThere have been an increasing number of cases involving paper mills in lower courts. In a search of a public database of court judgments, Tang identified 41 cases involving ghostwriting services between 2013 and 2024. The reports, shared with Nature, include some civil cases involving contract disputes, such as researchers who paid for writing and other academic publishing services from paper mills or individuals who didn’t fulfil their contracts.\n\nIn response to the government’s goal of reducing research misconduct, the way in which the lower courts adjudicate cases involving paper mills has changed over the past decade, says Yin. Some six or seven years ago, the courts would have considered contracts signed with paper mills as valid and warranting protection, he says. But courts now deem them invalid, recognizing that these contracts violate standards of research integrity and a fair system of evaluation and promotion, as described in several government policies.\n\nIn one case from 2023, a salesperson for a media company contacted an academic on the Chinese social-media platform, WeChat to offer academic ghostwriting services. The salesperson wrote that the cost of getting an article published in an established Chinese journal within two months was 16,200 yuan (US$2,200), paid in three instalments. The salesperson guaranteed a ’plagiarism score’ of less than 10%, and a full refund if the article couldn’t be published.\n\nBut after receipt of the first instalment, the salesperson went silent. More than a year later, the academic took the company to court, where a judge deemed that since writing and distributing papers on behalf of someone else “violates the principles of academic integrity and public order and good morals”, the contract between the two parties was invalid. Therefore, the media company had to return the 6,000 yuan instalment it had received.\n\n“In most instances, paper mills were simply required to refund the fees paid by researchers,” says Tang.\n\nBut in cases that were considered criminal because they involved fraud, public prosecutors took individuals offering academic writing and publishing services, with no intention of delivering, to court for scamming or deceiving researchers. In cases where fraud was involved, penalties were more severe and included fines or even prison sentences.\n\nMore severe punishments\n\nSome of the harshest language in the supreme court’s guidance was reserved for paper mills, says Wang. As a result, she expects that “paper mills in China will be punished more severely”.",

          "abstract": "Mentoring is a key component of scientific achievements, contributing to overall measures of career success for mentees and mentors. Within the scientific community, possessing a large research group is often perceived as an indicator of exceptional mentorship and high-quality research. However, such large, competitive groups may also escalate dropout rates, particularly among early-career researchers. Overly high dropout rates of young researchers may lead to severe postdoc shortage and loss of top-tier academics in contemporary academia. In this context, we collect longitudinal genealogical data on mentor–mentee relations and their publications, and analyse the influence of a mentor’s group size on the future academic longevity and performance of their mentees. Our findings indicate that mentees trained in larger groups tend to exhibit superior academic performance compared with those from smaller groups, provided they remain in academia post graduation. However, we also observe two surprising patterns: academic survival rate is significantly lower for (1) mentees from larger groups and for (2) mentees with more productive mentors. The trend is verified in institutions of different prestige levels. These findings highlight a negative correlation between a mentor’s success and the academic survival rate of their mentees, prompting a rethinking of effective mentorship and offering actionable insights for career advancement.",

This is of great interest given the postponement of first births in almost all developed countries during the twentieth century. Here we use an instrumental variable approach (Mendelian randomization) using maternal and paternal polygenic indices (PGIs) for age at first birth—while conditioning on the child’s PGI for age at first birth—to identify the causal effects of maternal and paternal age at first birth on children’s test scores based on data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort study. We do not find evidence of positive causal effects of both maternal and paternal age at first birth on children’s test scores at age 10 years once the children’s PGI and correlations among different PGIs are controlled for. We therefore conclude that our results do not provide evidence in favour of sociological theories that predict positive causal effects of parental age on children’s educational attainment.",

The cognitive and neural mechanisms of speech inhibition are not well understood. Here we have recorded direct high-density cortical activity while participants engaged in continuous speech production and were visually cued to stop speaking. Neural recordings revealed distinct activity in the premotor frontal cortex correlated with stopping speech. This activity was found in largely separate cortical sites from regions encoding vocal tract articulatory movements. Moreover, this activity primarily occurred with abrupt stopping in the middle of an utterance, rather than naturally completing a phrase. Electrocortical stimulation at many premotor sites with inhibitory stop activity caused involuntary speech arrest, which contradicts previous clinical interpretations of this effect as evidence for critical centres of speech production. Together, these results suggest a previously unknown premotor cortical network that supports the inhibitory control of speech, providing implications for understanding both natural and altered speech production.",

Studies have suggested that DA may transdiagnostically contribute to mental disorders. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, aiming to estimate the relationship between DA and distress or symptoms of mental disorders. The included studies reported the correlation between DA and distress or symptoms of mental disorders, across general population and clinical samples, using previously validated measures for all outcomes. PsychInfo and the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection (via EBSCO), Embase, and Medline (via PubMed) were systematically searched up to 30 October 2023. Study quality was evaluated with the Study Quality Assessment Tools (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute). A total of 129 studies were included, reporting on 158 independent samples, for a total of 34,147 participants. Most studies were rated as poor quality. The findings indicated consistently positive associations between DA and distress outcomes (general anxiety: r = 0.42, P < 0.001; depression: r = 0.41, P < 0.001; distress: r = 0.36, P < 0.001). Heterogeneity was substantial, and prediction intervals crossed zero for all outcomes, except for anxiety and distress. We found no moderation by DA measure, sample type or the proportion of women in the sample. However, the association was stronger (t(35.37) = −2.055, P = 0.047) when medical conditions were present (r = 0.48, P < 0.001) than when they were absent (r = 0.37, P < 0.001).

          "abstract": "Urban highways are common, especially in the United States, making cities more car-centric. They promise the annihilation of distance but obstruct pedestrian mobility, thus playing a key role in limiting social interactions locally. Although this limiting role is widely acknowledged in urban studies, the quantitative relationship between urban highways and social ties is barely tested. Here, we define a Barrier Score that relates massive, geolocated online social network data to highways in the 50 largest US cities. At the granularity of individual social ties, we show that urban highways are associated with decreased social connectivity. This barrier effect is especially strong for short distances and consistent with historical cases of highways that were built to purposefully disrupt or isolate Black neighborhoods. By combining spatial infrastructure with social tie data, our method adds a dimension to demographic studies of social segregation. Our study can inform reparative planning for an evidence-based reduction of spatial inequality, and more generally, support a better integration of the social fabric in urban planning.",

Here, we study the properties of the resulting Nash equilibria, in which no member of the population can gain an advantage by unilaterally adopting different behavior. We leverage an analytic solution that yields fully time-dependent rational population behavior to obtain, 1) a simple relationship between rational social distancing behavior and the current number of infections; 2) scaling results for how the infection peak and number of total cases depend on the cost of contracting the disease; 3) characteristic infection costs that divide regimes of strong and weak behavioral response; 4) a closed form expression for the value of the utility. We discuss how these analytic results provide a deep and intuitive understanding of the disease dynamics, useful for both individuals and policymakers. In particular, the relationship between social distancing and infections represents a heuristic that could be communicated to the population to encourage, or “bootstrap,” rational behavior.",

          "abstract": "Recent research, focused mostly on the United States and Western Europe, shows that marginalized communities often face greater environmental degradation. However, the ethnoracial categories used in these studies may not fully capture environmental inequality in the Global South. Moving beyond conventional ethnoracial variables, this study presents findings exploring the link between skin tone and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure in Colombia. By matching household geolocations from a large-scale longitudinal survey with satellite-based PM 2.5 estimates, we find that skin tone predicts both initial pollution exposure levels and their changes over time. Although average exposure levels remained stable during our study period, the environmental justice (EJ) landscape in Colombia contemporaneously underwent a complete transformation. In 2010, lighter-skinned individuals faced higher PM 2.5 exposure, but darker-skinned individuals experienced steeper increases in the following years. By 2016, the EJ gap had reversed, with people with the darkest skin tones exposed to PM 2.5 levels nearly one SD higher than those faced by people with the lightest skin tones. These patterns remain robust when controlling for a comprehensive set of theoretically relevant covariates, including ethnoracial self-identification and income. Disproportionate exposure to pollution from fires partially explains the observed disparities. Decomposition analysis shows that this variable, local collective action, and economic marginalization account for a sizeable share of the EJ gap. However, one-third of the gap remains unexplained by observable characteristics. With climate change intensifying fire incidence, the disproportionate disease burdens that vulnerable groups face might deepen unless policy measures are taken to reverse this trend.",

Both tests, however, have well-known statistical limitations, sometimes suggesting discrimination even when there is none. Despite the fallibility of the benchmark and outcome tests individually, here we prove a surprisingly strong statistical guarantee: Under a common nonparametric assumption, at least one of the two tests must be correct; consequently, when both tests agree, they are guaranteed to yield correct conclusions. We present empirical evidence that the underlying assumption holds approximately in several important domains, including lending, education, and criminal justice—and that our hybrid test is robust to the moderate violations of the assumption that we observe in practice. Applying this approach to 2.8 million police stops across California, we find evidence of widespread racial discrimination.",

However, the varying degrees of epidemiological dominance among different lineages or clades of H9N2 AIVs have not been fully clarified. The matrix protein M1, a key structural component of the virion, plays a crucial role in maintaining the viral structure and lifecycle. To elucidate the intrinsic relationship between the genetic patterns of M1 and the adaptive dynamics of H9N2 AIVs, this study focused on the five major evolutionary patterns of M1 and conducted in vitro and in vivo investigations from the perspectives of vRNP release after viral uncoating, polymerase activity, mRNA and vRNA levels, the nuclear export of vRNPs, plasma membrane–binding capacity, proliferation capacity, growth competitiveness, and transmission potential. The results revealed a strong correlation between the epidemiological dominance of H9N2 AIVs and the specific patterns of M1, with M1 P5 standing out as particularly significant. This finding highlights the pivotal influence of the M1 gene patterns on the replication and transmission dynamics of H9N2 AIVs, thereby offering valuable insights into the mechanisms driving differences in adaptive evolution and shifts in epidemiological dominance within the H9N2 AIV population.",

The two main origins of BPVE are the shift and injection currents, arising from transitions in electron position and electron velocity during optical excitation, respectively. Recently, it was proposed that photon-drag effects could unlock BPVE in centrosymmetric materials. However, experimental progress remains limited. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of photon-drag effects inducing BPVE (photon-drag BPVE). Notably, we find that photon-drag BPVE can be directly linked to quantum geometric tensors. Additionally, we propose that photon-drag shift currents can be fully isolated from other current contributions in nonmagnetic centrosymmetric materials. We apply our theory explicitly to the 2D topological insulator 1 T ′ -WTe 2 . Furthermore, we investigate photon-drag BPVE in a centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal, where we demonstrate that linearly polarized light generates photon-drag shift currents.",

          "abstract": "The tuberculosis-causing agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) establishes its niche inside macrophages by secretion of several virulence factors and engaging many host factors. Mycobacterial infection of macrophages results in a proinflammatory trigger–mediated secretion of TNFα. Protein kinase G (PknG), a Serine/Threonine kinase, is essential for mycobacterial survival within the macrophage. Pathogenic mycobacteria, upon infection, can trigger the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine TNFα, but whether secreted PknG plays any role in TNFα secretion at early stages of infection remains undeciphered. Moreover, at early infection stages, prevention of macrophage apoptosis is vital to successful mycobacterial pathogenesis. Our studies show that mycobacteria-secreted PknG can dampen the expression and concomitant secretion of proinflammatory TNFα. During early infection, M.tb infection–induced generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) leads to S-nitrosylation of PknG on Cys109, thereby enabling its secretion into macrophages. Upon M.tb infection, secreted S-nitrosylated PknG phosphorylates macrophage Silencer of Death Domains (SODD) at Thr405, as identified through our phosphoproteomic studies. Thereafter, phosphorylated SODD, through an irreversible binding with the TNFR1 death domain, prevents Caspase8 activation and concomitant extrinsic apoptotic trigger. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from mice infected with PknG-knockout M.tb also exhibited SODD phosphorylation and hindered Caspase8 activation to prevent extrinsic macrophage apoptosis. Therefore, this work exhibits S-nitrosylation-mediated secretion of PknG to induce phosphorylation of macrophage SODD, which, through irreversible interaction with TNFR1, prevented extrinsic macrophage apoptosis at the early stages of infection.",

In this paper, we report that vimentin forms liquid condensates which appear to enable rapid filament growth. Given the transient nature of these droplets, we focus on properties of vimentin-Y117L, which has a point mutation that leads to formation of condensates but not IFs, enabling us to study these droplets in detail. The droplets dissolve under 1,6-Hexanediol treatment and under decreasing concentration, confirming that they are liquid, and phase separated. These condensates extensively wet actin stress fibers, rendering them resistant to actin-binding drugs and protecting them from depolymerization. We show similar behavior occurs in wild-type vimentin during its assembly into filaments.",

          "abstract": "NASA’s Kepler mission identified over 4,000 extrasolar planets that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. This sample has revealed detailed features in the demographics of planet sizes and orbital spacings. However, knowledge of their orbital shapes—a key tracer of planetary formation and evolution—remains far more limited. We present measurements of eccentricities for 1,646 Kepler planets, 92% of which are smaller than Neptune. For all planet sizes, the eccentricity distribution peaks at e = 0 and falls monotonically toward zero at e = 1. As planet size increases, mean population eccentricity rises from ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.05 ± 0.01 for small planets to ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.20 ± 0.03 for planets larger than ∼3.5 Earth-radii R ⊕ . The overall planet occurrence rate and planet-metallicity correlation also change abruptly at this size. Taken together, these patterns indicate distinct formation channels for planets above and below ∼3.5 R ⊕ . We also find size-dependent associations between eccentricity, host star metallicity, and orbital period. While smaller planets generally have low eccentricities, there are hints of a noteworthy exception: eccentricities are slightly elevated in the “radius valley,” a narrow band of low occurrence rate density which separates rocky “super-Earths” (1.0 to 1.5 R ⊕ ) from gas-rich “sub-Neptunes” (2.0 to 3.0 R ⊕ ). We detect this feature at 2.1σ significance. Planets in single- and multitransiting systems exhibit the same size–eccentricity relationship, suggesting they are drawn from the same parent population.",

          "abstract": "In the polar regions, which are vulnerable receptors of mercury pollution, atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) efficiently convert elemental mercury (Hg(0)) into oxidized mercury (Hg(II)) via bromine oxidation. Hg(II) subsequently deposits onto snow and sea ice. While field observations have shown that a large percentage of deposited mercury is re-emitted from the ice to the atmosphere by a photoinduced process, the fundamental photochemistry that drives the re-emission process remains unknown. Here, using multiconfigurational quantum chemistry, we find that the photoreduction of HgBr 2 , HgBr 3 − , and HgBr 4 2− in ice is more efficient than in the gas phase. This results from the influence of water molecules on the molecular geometry and electronic structure of mercuric bromides in ice, which enhances the absorption intensities at wavelengths relevant in the troposphere (λ &gt; 290 nm), as compared to gas phase. Kinetic modeling shows that ~30 to 60% of deposited mercury in AMDEs can be reemitted due to the photoreduction of mercuric bromides in ice, in agreement with field observations. Our results reveal a photoreduction mechanism of sunlight-induced excited state chemistry of mercuric bromides on ice. These findings strongly suggest that this chemistry should be incorporated into atmospheric models to account for ice-atmosphere mercury cycling in the polar environments, currently not considered.",

          "abstract": "Pathogen-derived nuclear localization signals (NLSs) enable vigorous nuclear invasion in the host by the virulence proteins harboring them. Herein, inspired by the robust nuclear import mechanism, we show that NLSs originating from the plant infection–associated Agrobacterium proteins VirD2 and VirE2 can be incorporated into the Cas9 system as efficient nuclear delivery enhancers, thereby improving the low gene-editing frequency in a model microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , caused by poor nuclear localization of the bulky nuclease. Prior to evaluation of the NLSs, IPA1 (Cre04.g215850) was first defined in the alga as the nuclear import-related importin alpha (Impα) that serves as a counterpart adaptor protein of the NLSs, based on extensive in silico analyses considering the protein’s sequence, tertiary folding behavior, and structural basis when interacting with a well-studied SV40TAg NLS. Through precursive affinity explorations, we reproducibly found that the NLSs mediated the binding between the Cas9 and Impα with nM affinities and visually confirmed that the fusion of the NLSs strictly localized the peptide-bearing cargoes in the microalgal nucleus without compensating for their cleavage ability. When employed in a real-world application, the VirD2 NLS increases the mutation frequency (~1.12 × 10 −5 ) over 2.4-fold compared to an archetypal SV40TAg NLS (~0.46 × 10 −5 ) when fused with Cas9. We demonstrate the cross-species versatility of the Impα-dependent strategy by successfully applying it to an industrial alga, Chlorella Sp. HS2. This work, focused on affinity augmentation, provides insights into increasing the frequency of gene editing, which can be advantageously used in programmable mutagenesis with broad applicability.",

This spontaneous intra-unit-cell orbital ordering, also known as electronic nematicity, breaks C 4 symmetry and is thought to arise from the Coulomb interaction (denoted by V pp ) between oxygen p x and p y electrons. In this work, we study the spontaneous emergence of electronic nematicity within the three-band Hubbard [aka the Emery-VSA (Varma-Schmitt-Rink-Abrahams) model], using cluster dynamical mean-field theory. This method incorporates short-range electronic correlations and gives us access to the density of states, a quantity that is directly probed in experiments. We argue that there is a delicate competition between V pp and V pd (the latter being the Coulomb interaction between copper d x 2 − y 2 and oxygen p x , y electrons) that must be taken into account in order to find a Zhang-Rice singlet band well-resolved from the upper Hubbard band, and a splitting of the charge-transfer band (one of the signatures of charge nematicity) by roughly 50 meV, as observed recently.",

TEX38 interacts and colocalizes with ZDHHC19, a testis-enriched acyltransferase catalyzing protein S-palmitoylation, at the plasma membrane of spermatids. ZDHHC19 and TEX38 are each downregulated in mouse testes lacking the other protein. TEX38 stabilizes and localizes ZDHHC19 to the plasma membrane of cultured cells and vice versa, consolidating their interdependence. Mice deficient in ZDHHC19 or harboring a C142S mutation that disables the palmitoyltransferase activity of ZDHHC19 display phenotypes resembling those of Tex38 KO mice. Strikingly, ZDHHC19 palmitoylates ARRDC5, an arrestin family protein regulating sperm differentiation.

          "abstract": "Sea otters are an iconic keystone predator that can maintain kelp forests by preying on grazing invertebrates such as sea urchins. However, the effects of sea otters on kelp forests vary over their geographic range. Here, we analyze two 30-y datasets on kelp forest communities during the reintroduction of sea otters along the west coast of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada, and around San Nicolas Island, CA. We developed a community model to estimate species interactions as dynamic rates, varying with community state. We find evidence of a classic trophic cascade off Vancouver Island; the arrival of otters quickly led to depletion of urchins and recovery of kelp. However, this cascade was muted around San Nicolas Island, with otters, urchins, and kelp all coexisting at intermediate densities for multiple years. Our models show that this difference came from a pulse of strong otter impacts on urchins following recolonization off Vancouver Island, but not off San Nicolas Island. The mean effects of otters on urchins and urchins on kelp were not stronger in the north, indicating that interaction dynamics and not average interaction strength are key to explaining differences in community trajectories. We also find stronger multistep interaction chains in the south, arising from competitive interactions that indirectly buffered otter effects. These findings shed light on long-standing hypotheses about how interspecific interactions can alter the function of keystone species across community contexts. More broadly, we show how community change can be more accurately predicted by considering dynamic interaction strengths.",

Seed exchange, hybridization, and cloning have played an essential role across their wild distribution from Mexico to South America to create the modern varieties of today. Archaeological sites with well-preserved and directly radiocarbon-dated botanical assemblages are rare, however, so we know very little about the complexities of the domestication process. Here, we define an early locus of avocado domestication using well-dated desiccated and carbonized avocado remains from El Gigante rockshelter in western Honduras spanning the last 11,000 y. Measurements of avocado seeds and rinds show evidence for long-term management resulting in selection for larger, more robust fruits through time that culminated by 2,250 to 2,080 calendar B.P. (cal. B.P.). However, human-directed selection for larger fruits with thicker rinds is evident as early as 7,565 to 7,265 cal. B.P. Seed morphology is similar to P. americana var. guatemalensis and is congruent with genetic data for the development of this variety in both the highlands of Guatemala and Honduras. Increases in seed size and rind thickness through time are consistent with genetic evidence for the enrichment of putative candidate genes for fruit development and ripening in this variety.",

Similarly, in COVID-19 infection cohort, hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 hospital admission were 1.23 (1.19, 1.27) for PM 2.5 and 1.22 (1.17, 1.26) for PM 10 , whereas HRs for COVID-19 death were 1.28 (1.18, 1.39) for PM 2.5 and 1.25 (1.16, 1.36) for PM 10 . Notably, significant interactions were found between PM 2.5 /PM 10 and genetic susceptibility in COVID-19 death. In COVID-19 infection cohort, participants with both high genetic risk and high air pollutants exposure had 1.86- to 1.97-fold and 1.91- to 2.14-fold higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death compared to those with both low genetic risk and low air pollutants exposure. Exposure to air pollution is significantly associated with an increased burden of severe COVID-19, and air pollution–gene interactions may play a crucial role in the development of COVID-19-related outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from its onset due to disease or trauma to either recovery or death is poorly understood. Currently, there are no generally accepted treatments aside from supportive care using mechanical ventilation. However, this can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which contributes to a 30 to 40% mortality rate. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a technique to quantify forms of energy transport and dissipation during mechanical ventilation to directly evaluate their relationship to VILI. A porcine ARDS model was used, with ventilation parameters independently controlling lung overdistension and alveolar/airway recruitment/derecruitment (RD). Hourly measurements of airflow, tracheal and esophageal pressures, respiratory system impedance, and oxygen transport were taken for six hours following lung injury to track energy transfer and lung function. The final degree of injury was assessed histologically. Total and dissipated energies were quantified from lung pressure–volume relationships and subdivided into contributions from airflow, tissue viscoelasticity, and RD. Only RD correlated with physiologic recovery. Despite accounting for a very small fraction (2 to 5%) of the total energy dissipation, RD is damaging because it occurs quickly over a very small area. We estimate power intensity of RD energy dissipation to be 100 W/m 2 , equivalent to 10% of the Sun’s luminance at the Earth’s surface. Minimizing repetitive RD events may thus be crucial for mitigating VILI.",

          "abstract": "Drainage divide migration alters the geometry of drainage basins, influencing the distribution of water, erosion, sediments, and ecosystems across Earth’s surface. The rate of divide migration is governed by differences in erosion rates across the divide and is thus sensitive to spatiotemporal variations in tectonics and climate. However, established approaches for quantifying divide migration rates offer only indirect evidence for the motion of the divide and provide only migration rate averages. Consequently, transience in divide migration cannot be resolved, hindering the ability to explore environmental changes that drive the dynamics of such potential transience. Here, we study a set of datable terraces identified as markers of paleo-divide locations, which provide direct evidence for the paleo motion of the divide. The location and age of the terraces reveal intermittent divide migration at timescales of 10 4 to 10 5 y, with phases of rapid migration—at rates more than twice the average—which coincide with documented regional paleoclimate fluctuations. These findings highlight the intermittent nature of divide migration dynamics over geomorphic timescales and its potential sensitivity to climate changes, underscoring the impact of such changes on the planform evolution of drainage basins.",

          "abstract": "To meet decarbonization targets, nations around the globe have made ambitious commitments to expand forested land. Operationalizing these commitments requires choosing a planting strategy: How many trees should be planted, of which species, and where? Given those choices must be made now but have long-term consequences, such decisions are plagued by uncertainty. For example, species that are well suited to present conditions may perform poorly under future climates, yet those future climates are themselves highly uncertain. Using the exemplar of the United Kingdom, a nation committed to achieving net zero emissions by midcentury, we quantify key uncertainties pertaining to coevolving climate and economic conditions and examine how modern methods of decision-making under uncertainty can advise on planting choices. Our analysis reveals that the best planting strategy assuming a “high-emissions” future is radically different to that for a future that remains on a “near-historic” path. Planting for the former while experiencing the latter results in substantial net costs to UK society. Assimilating uncertainty into decision-making identifies planting strategies that diversify risk and significantly reduce the probability of high-cost outcomes. Importantly, our research reveals that the scope for mitigating risk through choice of planting strategy is relatively limited. Despite this persistent risk, we find that tree planting remains a highly cost-effective carbon removal solution when compared to alternative technologies, even when those alternatives are assumed to be riskless.",

This study presents a database of over 2,000 pristine and defective nanoscale CNT bundles and other graphitic assemblies, inspired by microscopy, with associated stress–strain curves from reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive INTERFACE force field (IFF-R). These 3D structures, containing up to 80,000 atoms, enable detailed analyses of structure-stiffness-failure relationships. By leveraging the database and physics- and chemistry-informed machine learning (ML), accurate predictions of elastic moduli and tensile strength are demonstrated at speeds 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than efficient MD simulations. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Spatial Information (HS-GNNs) are introduced, which integrate chemistry knowledge. HS-GNNs as well as extreme gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) achieve forecasts of mechanical properties of arbitrary carbon nanostructures with only 3 to 6% mean relative error. The reliability equals experimental accuracy and is up to 20 times higher than other ML methods. Predictions maintain 8 to 18% accuracy for large CNT bundles, CNT junctions, and carbon fiber cross-sections outside the training distribution. The physics- and chemistry-informed HS-GNN works remarkably well for data outside the training range while XGBoost works well with limited training data inside the training range. The carbon nanostructure database is designed for integration with multimodal experimental and simulation data, scalable beyond 100 nm size, and extendable to chemically similar compounds and broader property ranges.

However, at micro- or nanometer scales, probe dynamics become inherently stochastic due to Brownian motion and complex interactions, leading to varied diffusion behaviors. Typically, analysis of such trajectory data involves certain moving-window operation and assumes the existence of some pseudo–steady states, particularly when evaluating predefined parameters or specific types of diffusion modes. Here, we introduce the stochastic particle-informed neural network (SPINN), a physics-informed deep learning framework that integrates stochastic differential equations to model and infer particle diffusion dynamics. The SPINN autonomously explores parameter spaces and distinguishes between deterministic and stochastic components with single-frame resolution. Using the anomalous diffusion dataset, we validated SPINN’s ability to reduce frame-to-frame variability while preserving key statistical correlations, allowing for accurate characterization of different stochastic processes. When applied to the diffusion of single gold nanorods in hydrogels, the SPINN revealed enhanced microrheological properties during hydrogel gelation and uncovered interfacial dynamics during dextran/tetra-PEG liquid–liquid phase separation. By improving the temporal resolution of stochastic dynamics, the SPINN facilitates the estimation and prediction of complex diffusion behaviors, offering insights into underlying physical mechanisms at mesoscopic scales.",

          "abstract": "Nucleotide sequence data are being harnessed to identify species, even in cases in which organisms themselves are neither in hand nor witnessed. But how genome-wide sequence divergence maps to species status is far from clear. While gene sequence divergence is commonly used to delineate bacterial species, its correspondence to established species boundaries has yet to be explored across eukaryotic taxa. Because the processes underlying gene flow differ fundamentally between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, these domains are likely to differ in the relationship between reproductive isolation and genome-wide sequence divergence. In prokaryotes, homologous recombination, the basis of gene flow, depends directly on the degree of genomic sequence divergence, whereas in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, reproductive incompatibility can stem from changes in very few genes. Guided by measures of genome-wide sequence divergence in bacteria, we gauge how genomic criteria correspond to species boundaries in eukaryotes. In recognized species of eukaryotes, levels of gene sequence divergence within species are typically very small, averaging &lt;1% across protein-coding regions in most animals, plants, and fungi. There are even instances in which divergence between sister species is the same or less than that among conspecifics. In contrast, bacterial species, defined as populations exchanging homologous genes, show levels of divergence both within and between species that are considerably higher. Although no single threshold delineates species, eukaryotic populations with &gt;1% genome-wide sequence divergence are likely separate species, whereas prokaryotic populations with 1% divergence are still able to recombine and thus can be considered the same species.",

          "abstract": "B cells generate pathogen-specific antibodies and play an essential role in providing adaptive protection against infection. Antibody genes are modified in evolutionary processes acting on the B cell populations within an individual. These populations proliferate, differentiate, and migrate to long-term niches in the body. However, the dynamics of these processes in the human immune system are primarily inferred from mouse studies. We addressed this gap by sequencing the antibody repertoire and transcriptomes from single B cells in four immune-rich tissues from six individuals. We find that B cells descended from the same pre-B cell (“lineages”) often colocalize within the same tissue, with the bone marrow harboring the largest excess of lineages without representation in other tissues. Within lineages, cells with different levels of somatic hypermutation are uniformly distributed among tissues and functional states. This suggests that the relative probabilities of localization and differentiation outcomes change negligibly during affinity maturation, and quantitatively agrees with a simple dynamical model of B cell differentiation. While lineages strongly colocalize, we find individual B cells nevertheless appear to make independent differentiation decisions. Proliferative antibody-secreting cells, however, deviate from these global patterns. These cells are often clonally expanded, their clones appear universally distributed among all sampled organs, and form lineages with an excess of cells of the same type. Collectively, our findings show the limits of peripheral blood monitoring of the immune repertoire, and provide a probabilistic model of the dynamics of antibody memory formation in humans.",

Bubbles appear at the freezing front and are then trapped in ice, making pores. These pores come in a range of sizes from microns to millimeters and their shapes are peculiar; never spherical but elongated, and usually fore-aft asymmetric. We show that these remarkable shapes result of a delicate balance between freezing, capillarity, and mass diffusion. A nonlinear ordinary differential equation suffices to describe the bubbles, which features two nondimensional numbers representing the supersaturation and the freezing rate, and two additional parameters representing simultaneous freezing and nucleation treated as the initial condition. Our experiments provide us with a large variety of pictures of bubble shapes. We show that all of these bubbles have their rounded tip well described by an asymptotic regime of the differential equation and that most bubbles can have their full shape quantitatively matched by a full solution. This method enables the measurement of the freezing conditions of ice samples, and the design of freeze-cast porous materials. Furthermore, the equation exhibits a bifurcation that explains why some bubbles grow indefinitely and make long cylindrical “ice worms,” well known to glaciologists.",

          "abstract": "Myosin-IC (myo1c) is a class-I myosin that supports transport and remodeling of the plasma membrane and membrane-bound vesicles. Like other members of the myosin family, its biochemical kinetics are altered in response to changes in mechanical loads that resist the power stroke. However, myo1c is unique in that the primary force-sensitive kinetic transition is the isomerization that follows ATP binding, not ADP release as in other slow myosins. Myo1c also powers actin gliding along curved paths, propelling actin filaments in leftward circles. To understand the origins of this unique force-sensing and motile behavior, we solved actin-bound myo1c cryo-EM structures in the presence and absence of ADP. Our structures reveal that in contrast with other myosins, the myo1c lever arm swing is skewed, partly due to a different actin interface that reorients the motor domain on actin. The structures also reveal unique nucleotide-dependent behavior of both the nucleotide pocket as well as an element called the N-terminal extension (NTE). We incorporate these observations into a model that explains why force primarily regulates ATP binding in myo1c, rather than ADP release as in other myosins. Integrating our cryo-EM data with available crystallography structures allows the modeling of full-length myo1c during force generation, supplying insights into its role in membrane remodeling. These results highlight how relatively minor sequence differences in members of the myosin superfamily can significantly alter power stroke geometry and force-sensing properties, with important implications for biological function.",

Defining the factors that regulate viral messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is thus critical to understand how viruses replicate and cause disease. To identify factors that might regulate viral mRNA translation, we developed a technique for identifying proteins associated with a native RNA expressed from its endogenous promoter and genomic locus. This approach uses a guide RNA to target dCas13b fused to a biotin ligase domain to a specific RNA, where it covalently labels proteins in close proximity. Using this approach, we identified multiple proteins associated with transcripts encoding the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 and IE2 proteins and found that several associated proteins positively or negatively regulate HCMV replication. We confirmed that one such protein, the cellular Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), binds to HCMV immediate early mRNAs and is required for efficient viral protein expression and virus replication. Ablating YBX1 expression reduced the association of HCMV immediate early mRNAs with polysomes, demonstrating a role for YBX1 as a positive regulator of viral RNA translation. These results provide a powerful tool for unraveling RNA–protein interactions that can be used in a wide range of biological processes and reveal a role for YBX1 as a critical regulator of HCMV immediate early gene expression.",

From mud films to lithospheres of rock or ice, fracture networks form two-dimensional (2D) tessellations of convex polygons whose geometry encodes their genesis. Here, we chart the geometry of 2D fracture mosaics across the solar system, and decode their formative conditions using a new dynamical crack model. We show that mosaics can be projected onto a Symbolic Ternary Diagram, where the relative proportions of “T,” “X,” and “Y” junctions are uniquely related to contributions from distinct modes of fracture. Most planetary mosaics cluster in a region associated with hierarchical fracture networks, where sequential cracking favors formation of T junctions. Exceptions to this rule may betray the presence of water. Europa’s fracture networks stand apart due to the predominance of X junctions; this is a special feature of ice, where healing of cracks by refreezing of water allows new fractures to overprint older ones. Several fracture networks on Mars appear as outliers due to the high proportion of Y junctions. These patterns—previously interpreted as ancient mudcracks and frozen polar terrain, based on geological evidence—are consistent with the twisting of crack junctions by cyclic volume change. Our findings suggest that counting cracks could aid in the identification of other water-influenced planetary environments.",

          "abstract": "Bdelloid rotifers are well known for their abilities to survive long periods of freezing as well as acquire foreign genes. Recently sequenced genomes of some bdelloid rotifers in England were found to encode several proteins similar to ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that are usually associated with freeze–thaw tolerance. Here, I describe bdelloid rotifers inhabiting an algal patch in Antarctica that have multiple homologs of these genes. Structures of the proteins predicted by AlphaFold show that they are well designed for ice-binding and a recombinant protein made for one of them showed strong ice-binding activity. The existence of multiple copies of these proteins is another characteristic of IBPs. Furthermore, multiple bdelloid rotifers in the algal patch were revived in less than an hour after storage at −25 °C for 24 y, an apparent record for laboratory-controlled studies. Several characteristics of these genes point to bacteria as their source: sequence homology, absence of introns, and a structural peculiarity so far found only in bacteria. The remarkable freezing tolerance of bdelloid rotifers can thus be at least partially attributed to horizontally acquired bacterial genes encoding IBPs.",

          "abstract": "Identifying conserved mechanisms used by viruses to delay host innate responses can reveal potential targets for antiviral therapeutics. Here, we investigated coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), which encodes a highly conserved endoribonuclease (EndoU). EndoU functions as an immune antagonist by limiting the accumulation of viral replication intermediates that would otherwise be sensed by the host. Despite being a promising antiviral target, it has been difficult to develop small-molecule inhibitors that target the EndoU active site. We generated nsp15 mutants of the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 and identified conserved residues within the amino-terminal domain that are required for EndoU activity. Loss of EndoU activity caused the activation of host sensors, which limited viral replication in interferon-responsive cells and attenuated disease in MHV-infected mice. Using transcriptional profiling, we found that MHV EndoU mutant viruses upregulate multiple host sensors, including Z-form nucleic acid-binding protein 1 (ZBP1). We found that nsp15 mutants induced early, robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis. EndoU mutant viruses also induced ZBP1-independent apoptosis and pyroptosis pathways, causing early, robust cell death that limits virus replication and pathogenesis. Overall, we document the importance of the amino-terminal domain for EndoU function. We also highlight the importance of nsp15/EndoU activity for evading host sensors, delaying cell death, and promoting pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Molluscan brains are composed of morphologically consistent and functionally interrogable neurons, offering rich opportunities for understanding how neural circuits drive behavior. Nonetheless, detailed component-level CNS maps are often lacking, total neuron numbers are unknown, and organizational principles remain poorly defined, limiting a full and systematic characterization of circuit operation. Here, we establish an accessible, generalizable approach, harnessing synchrotron X-ray tomography, to rapidly determine the three-dimensional structure of the multimillimeter-scale CNS of Lymnaea . Focusing on the feeding ganglia, we generate a full neuron-level reconstruction, revealing key design principles and revising cell count estimates upward threefold. Our atlas uncovers the superficial but also nonsuperficial ganglionic architecture, reveals the cell organization in normally hidden regions—ganglionic “dark sides”—and details features of single-neuron morphology, together guiding targeted follow-up functional investigation based on intracellular recordings. Using this approach, we identify three pivotal neuron classes: a command-like food-signaling cell type, a feeding central pattern generator interneuron, and a unique behavior-specific motoneuron, together significantly advancing understanding of the function of this classical control circuit. Combining our morphological and electrophysiological data, we also establish a functional CNS atlas in Lymnaea as a shared and scalable resource for the research community. Our approach enables the rapid construction of cell atlases in large-scale nervous systems, with key relevance to functional circuit interrogation in a diverse range of model organisms.",

Inhibition of G3BP1 by expression of its acidic or “B-domain” accelerates axon regeneration after nerve injury, bringing a potential therapeutic strategy for peripheral nerve repair. Here, we asked whether G3BP1 inhibition is a viable strategy to promote regeneration in injured mammalian central nervous system (CNS) where axons do not regenerate spontaneously. G3BP1 B-domain expression was found to promote axon regeneration in the transected spinal cord provided with a permissive peripheral nerve graft (PNG) as well as in crushed optic nerve. Moreover, a cell-permeable peptide (CPP) to a subregion of B-domain (rodent G3BP1 amino acids 190 to 208) accelerated axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury and promoted regrowth of reticulospinal axons into the distal transected spinal cord through a bridging PNG. G3BP1 CPP promoted axon growth from rodent and human neurons cultured on permissive substrates, and this function required alternating Glu/Asp-Pro repeats that impart a unique predicted tertiary structure. The G3BP1 CPP disassembles axonal G3BP1, G3BP2, and FMRP, but not FXR1, granules and selectively increases axonal protein synthesis in cortical neurons. These studies identify G3BP1 granules as a key regulator of axon growth in CNS neurons and demonstrate that disassembly of these granules promotes retinal axon regeneration in injured optic nerve and reticulospinal axon elongation into permissive environments after CNS injury. This work highlights G3BP1 granule disassembly as a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing axon growth and neural repair.",

          "abstract": "Telomerase elongates telomeres to maintain chromosome stability in most eukaryotes. Despite extensive studies across eukaryotic kingdoms, the telomerase holoenzyme in arthropods remains poorly understood. In this study, we purify the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex from the lepidopteran insect Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) and identify a copurified 135-nucleotide telomerase RNA (TR) component. This miniature S. frugiperda TR (sfTR), the smallest TR known to date, retains a universal pseudoknot structure and a structurally defined template. Despite its small size, sfTR assembles with the recombinant S. frugiperda telomerase reverse transcriptase (sfTERT) protein in vivo to reconstitute telomerase activity for the synthesis of insect telomeric DNA repeats (TTAGG)n. The sfTR gene, like other animal TR genes, features an snRNA-type RNA polymerase II promoter. Uniquely, the sfTR transcript harbors a 5′-7-methylguanosine (M 7 G) cap, as opposed to the more typical snRNA-type 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap. The difference in 5′-cap is likely because sfTR lacks the H/ACA snoRNA biogenesis domain necessary for cap hypermethylation. Moreover, sfTR also lacks the CR4/5 regulatory domain that is indispensable in vertebrate TRs for telomerase activity. This degenerate sfTR complements an enigmatic sfTERT that is missing certain telomerase-specific elements yet catalytically active in the absence of sfTR. Thus, insects have evolved a simplified telomerase, consisting of a small noncoding RNA that retains only minimal attributes essential for telomerase function. The simplified insect telomerase demonstrates a plausible evolutionary pathway for the emergence of telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex, arising from an ancient reverse transcriptase associated with a simple templating RNA component in early eukaryotes.",

Using the canopy height metrics products from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a space-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument specifically designed to characterize forest structure, we analyze the environmental correlates of spatial variation of global tropical forest canopy height. Our study demonstrates that climate, topography, and soil properties account for 75% of the variation in tropical forest canopy height. Elevation, dry season length, and solar radiation are the most important drivers in determining canopy height both locally and regionally. These results emphasize the vulnerability of tropical forest structure to ongoing changes in the earth’s climate and provide a valuable empirical baseline for tropical forest management.",

Here, we use a variety of in situ techniques to examine cholesterol monohydrate crystallization over multiple length scales. In this study, we first identified a biomimetic solvent to generate triclinic monohydrate crystals, while avoiding the formation of nonphysiological solvates and enabling crystallization at rates where the dynamics of surface growth could be captured in real time. Using a binary mixture of water and isopropanol, with the latter serving as a surrogate for lipids in physiological environments, we show that cholesterol monohydrate crystals grow classically by the nucleation and spreading of crystal layers. Time-resolved imaging confirms that layers are generated by dislocations and monomers incorporate into advancing steps after diffusion along the crystal surface and not directly from the solution. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and microfluidics measurements concertedly reveal abundant macrosteps, which engender a self-inhibition mechanism that reduces the rate of crystal growth. This finding stands in contrast to numerous other systems, in which classical mechanisms lead to unhindered growth by spreading of single layers.",

          "abstract": "B cell responses to membrane-presented antigens appear to be strongly favored over soluble antigens in vivo suggesting that vaccines that mimic membrane-presented antigens may be highly efficacious. We recently demonstrated that human B cell responses to membrane-associated but not to soluble antigens in vitro depended on the expression and activity of the plasma membrane mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo1. Here, we provide evidence that the efficacy of the current human papillomavirus virus-like particle (HPV VLP) vaccines may be due in part to their inherent ability to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane presentation of antigens to B cells. We compared HPV-specific human B cell responses to HPV VLPs versus soluble HPV pentameric capsomeres and showed that although both induced calcium responses, only HPV VLP-induced responses were blocked by Piezo1 inhibitors. The kinetics of internalization of HPV-VLP and capsomeres into HPV-specific B cells were similar and neither required Piezo1 function as shown by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Piezo. However, trafficking of HPV-VLPs into intracellular major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) + antigen-processing compartments was Piezo1-dependent, whereas trafficking of capsomeres was not. In addition, a time course of intracellular trafficking suggested that colocalization of HPV-VLP with MHC classII was more stable over time as compared to capsomeres. Taken together these findings suggest that the ability of HPV-VLP vaccines to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane antigen presentation may be exploited in the design of highly effective human vaccines.",

PwMS showed a distinct microbiome compared to HC, with Prevotella copri ( PC ) and Blautia species as drivers of microbial communities in HC and PwMS, respectively. Administration of MS-driving Blautia species ( Blautia wexlerae; BW ) to mice resulted in increased levels of gut inflammatory markers and altered microbiota with increased capacity to induce proinflammatory cytokines. Utilizing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, we identified a lower gut Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio as a hallmark of the disease. BW -administered mice also showed a lower Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio pre-EAE induction which correlated with increased disease severity post-EAE induction. The importance of the Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio at the species level, lower Bifidobacterium adolescentis to Akkermansia muciniphila ( BA:AM ), was validated in our MS cohort and a large International Multiple Sclerosis Microbiome Study. Thus, our findings highlight the BA:AM ratio as a potential gut microbial marker in PwMS, opening avenues for microbiome-based diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in MS.",

Structural studies of secreted mucins are complicated by the enormous sizes, flexibility, and complex supramolecular assembly modes of these glycoproteins. The two major respiratory mucins are MUC5AC and MUC5B. Here, we present structures of a large amino-terminal segment of MUC5AC in the form of helical filaments. These filaments differ from filamentous and tubular structures observed previously for the intestinal mucin MUC2 and the partial mucin homolog VWF. Nevertheless, the MUC5AC helical filaments support the proposed mechanism, based on MUC2 and VWF, for how noncovalent interactions between mucin monomers guide disulfide crosslinking to form polymers. The high-resolution MUC5AC structures show how local and limited changes in amino acid sequence can profoundly affect higher-order assembly while preserving the overall folds and polymerization activity of mucin glycoproteins. Differences in supramolecular assembly are likely to be functionally significant considering the divergence of mechanical properties and physiological requirements between respiratory and intestinal mucins. Determining the high-resolution structures of respiratory mucins provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which they clean and protect the lungs. Moreover, the MUC5AC structure enables visualization of the sites of human amino acid sequence variation and disease-associated mutations.",

These experiments provide insight into the interplay of intramolecular coordinates along the reaction coordinate. However, a general theoretical foundation for analyzing, and even for explaining rigorously, these data is lacking. In this work, we study vibrational decoherence in a model VCET reaction using the nearly exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulation method. We explore how analyzing the density matrix with quantum information measures can help elucidate the evolution of vibrational coherence in simulations of dynamics. We examine how vibrational coherence is affected by electron transfer on the timescale of approximately 100 femtoseconds. Our results suggest that electron transfer, in the nonadiabatic model, changes the vibrational equilibrium position abruptly—an example of a “quantum quench” event. This explains the concomitant vibrational decoherence. We find that abrupt vibrational decoherence can be mitigated by wavepacket motion occurring on the timescale of the electron transfer.",

Genomic analyses reveal a complex interplay among mutant genes, with co-occurring and mutually exclusive patterns. Hyperactivation of c-MYB and deficiency of PU.1 have been linked to myeloid disorders. We report a case of AML with concurrent PU.1 and c-MYB mutations, exhibiting early onset, high blast count, chemo-resistance, indicating high-risk features, along with elevated Pelger–Huët anomaly (PHA). However, the synergistic mechanism of c-MYB and PU.1 in sAML remains unclear. Using c-Myb-hyperactivation and Pu.1-deficient double-strain ( c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D ) zebrafish, we investigated MDS/sAML progression. Surprisingly, the double mutant exhibited a distinct type of neutrophil resembling clinical PHA cells and demonstrated a higher rate of MDS/sAML transformation. Further expression analysis revealed reduced lmnb1 expression in double-mutant zebrafish. Knockdown of lmnb1 resulted in PHA and increased blast cells, while overexpression of lmnb1 in c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D reduced PHA cell level. This suggests that c-Myb hyperactivation and Pu.1 deficiency synergistically reduce lmnb1 expression, inducing the development of PHA-like neutrophils and promoting MDS/sAML progression in zebrafish. Moreover, coadministration of cell cycle inhibitor cytarabine (Ara-C) and the differential inducer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) could effectively relieve the neutrophil expansion and PHA symptoms in c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D zebrafish. Our findings revealed that c-Myb hyperactivation and Pu.1 deficiency played a synergistic role in sAML development and suggests a phenotypic association between the emergence of PH-like cells and the transformation to sAML.

This study investigated the geochemical properties of Textularia agglutinans, a cosmopolitan agglutinated benthic species from the order Textulariida which has an exceptional inner calcareous test and is evolutionarily basal to Rotaliida. This study confirms the evolutionary link between textulariids and rotaliids based on their geochemistry and establishes T. agglutinans as a geochemical recorder of marine environments. Specimens from the Mediterranean coast of Israel were analyzed using laser ablation ICP-MS and compared to whole-test ICP-MS measurements of rotaliid and miliolid taxa from the same location. An Mg/Ca temperature calibration was established by LA-ICP-MS analyses of cultured specimens at 15, 17, 20, and 25 °C. Results show that T. agglutinans is a mid-Mg species (~19 to ~60 mmol/mol), with an Mg/Ca temperature correlation similar to high-Mg species. Its Pb, Zn, and Mn/Ca ratios are variable, generally overlapping with rotaliids and significantly lower than miliolids. Notably, T. agglutinans exhibits significantly higher Sr/Ca ratios (3.2 to 4.7 mmol/mol) compared to most foraminifera. Raman analyses reveal that the inner wall comprises a mix of aragonite and calcite, explaining these elevated Sr/Ca ratios. Rotaliida are the most prolific group of calcifying foraminifera. Our findings suggest that rotaliid tests evolved from an agglutinated textulariid ancestor with an inner aragonitic wall, a hypothesis that is further supported by the close phylogenetic relationship of the two groups.",

However, the dynamic alterations in systemic immunity during tumor development are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized connection that bridges the interaction between the spleen and tumor through erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which suppress tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. We performed the single-cell RNA-seq and RNA-seq to demonstrate the presence of EPCs and identify the characteristic and an immunomodulatory role of EPCs during tumor progression. These tumor-hijacked EPCs proliferate in situ in spleens and impaired systemic and local antitumor response through the interaction between tumor and spleen. Specifically, the splenic CD45 − EPCs secreted heparin-binding growth factor to regulate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression of splenic CD45 + EPCs. Educated CD45 + EPCs from the spleen then migrated to the tumors via the CCL5/CCR5 axis, thereby weakening local antitumor immunity. Consequently, targeting EPCs not only revitalized antitumor immunity but also improved the anti-PD-L1 effect by promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. Importantly, CD45 + EPCs are associated with immunosuppression and reduced survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of EPCs in orchestrating the interaction between the spleen and tumor, which could have significant implications for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapy.",

A critical parameter affecting the function of these molecules is the thermal half-life of the light state. Reports in the literature indicate that, in some cases, a binding partner can significantly influence the thermal half-life, while in other cases it has no effect. Here, we present a unifying framework for quantitatively analyzing the effects of binding partners on thermal reversion rates. We focus on photoswitchable protein/binder interactions involving LOV domains, photoactive yellow protein, and CBCR GAF domains with partners that bind either the light or the dark state of the photoswitchable domain. We show that the effect of a binding partner depends on the extent to which the transition state for reversion resembles the dark state or the light state. We quantify this resemblance with a ϕ switching value, where ϕ switching = 1 if the conformation of the part of the photoswitchable molecule that interacts with the binding partner closely resembles its dark state conformation and ϕ switching = 0 if it resembles its light state. In addition to providing information on the transition state for switching, this analysis can guide the design of photoswitchable systems that retain useful thermal half-lives in practice. The analysis also provides a basis for the use of simple kinetic measurements to determine effective changes in affinity even in complex milieu.",

          "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is a key clinical predictor of heart failure. High-throughput and AI-driven screens have the potential to identify drugs and downstream pathways that modulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Here, we developed LogiRx, a logic-based mechanistic machine learning method that predicts drug-induced pathways. We applied LogiRx to discover how drugs discovered in a previous compound screen attenuate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We experimentally validated LogiRx predictions in neonatal cardiomyocytes, adult mice, and two patient databases. Using LogiRx, we predicted antihypertrophic pathways for seven drugs currently used to treat noncardiac disease. We experimentally validated that escitalopram (Lexapro) and mifepristone inhibit hypertrophy of cultured cardiomyocytes in two contexts. The LogiRx model predicted that escitalopram prevents hypertrophy through an “off-target” serotonin receptor/PI3Kγ pathway, mechanistically validated using additional investigational drugs. Further, escitalopram reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in a mouse model of hypertrophy and fibrosis. Finally, mining of both FDA and University of Virginia databases showed that patients with depression on escitalopram have a lower incidence of cardiac hypertrophy than those prescribed other serotonin reuptake inhibitors that do not target the serotonin receptor. Mechanistic machine learning by LogiRx discovers drug pathways that perturb cell states, which may enable repurposing of escitalopram and other drugs to limit cardiac remodeling through off-target pathways.",

          "abstract": "Molecular-level understanding of the early stage of crystallization remains a significant challenge. For a wide range of fundamental research and applications, it is of great importance to understand the mechanism of crystal polymorph selections in different solvents or in the presence of additives. We studied glycine crystallization in aqueous solution with or without the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl), one crystal nucleation at a time, using the recently developed single-crystal nucleation spectroscopy (SCNS). It has been reported that glycine forms γ-glycine when salt is added to aqueous solution, and the mechanism has been considered as a classical nucleation where γ-glycine forms directly as a crystal nucleus. Our study shows that metastable polymorph β-glycine forms first in aqueous solution both with or without NaCl through a nonclassical nucleation pathway. NaCl can stabilize the metastable β-glycine over several hours and also prevent it from converting to α-glycine. Eventually γ-glycine nucleates on the surface of β-glycine and then grows while dissolving the mother β-glycine. The crystal habit of β-glycine suggests that the stabilization by NaCl occurs at its polar face. SCNS provides crucial information to accelerate the investigation of the early stage of crystallization toward the rational control of polymorphisms.",

The spatial component of the density of states for these special polarons is determined by the length scale of spatial modulation of electronegativity caused by a separate set of standalone topological defects. The latter length scale is fixed by the cooperativity size for structural relaxation; the size is largely independent of temperature in the glass but above melting, it decreases with temperature. Thus we predict that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity should exhibit a jump in the slope near the glass transition; the size of the jump is predicted to increase with the fragility of the melt. The predicted values of the jump and of the conductivity itself are consistent with experiment.",

          "abstract": "The continued emergence of antimalarial drug resistance highlights the need to develop new antimalarial therapies. Unfortunately, new drug development is often hampered by undesirable drug-like properties of lead compounds. Prodrug approaches temporarily mask undesirable compound features, improving bioavailability and target penetration. We have found that lipophilic diester prodrugs of phosphonic acid antibiotics, such as fosmidomycin (Fsm), exhibit significantly higher antimalarial potency than their parent compounds [R.L. Edwards et al. , Sci. Rep. 7 , 8400 (2017)]. However, the activating enzymes for these prodrugs were unknown. Here, we show that an erythrocyte enzyme, acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH), is the major activating enzyme of multiple lipophilic ester prodrugs. Surprisingly, this enzyme is taken up by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , where it localizes to the parasite cytoplasm and retains enzymatic activity. Using a fluorogenic ester library, we characterize the structure–activity relationship of APEH and compare it to that of P. falciparum esterases. We show that parasite-internalized APEH plays an important role in the activation of substrates with branching at the alpha carbon, in keeping with its exopeptidase activity. Our findings highlight a mechanism for antimicrobial prodrug activation, relying on a host-derived enzyme to yield activation at a microbial target. Mutations in prodrug-activating enzymes are a common mechanism for antimicrobial drug resistance [E. S. Istvan et al. , Nat. Commun. 8 , 14240 (2017); K. M. V.

Despite the development of various distinct probes that enable super-resolved stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging of mitochondria in live cells, most of these membrane-potential-dependent fluorophores cannot be retained well in mitochondria after chemical fixation. This lack of suitable mitochondrial probes has limited STED imaging of mitochondria to live cell samples. In this study, we introduce a mitochondria-specific probe, PK Mito Orange FX (PKMO FX), which features a fixation-driven cross-linking motif and accumulates in the mitochondrial inner membrane. It exhibits high fluorescence retention after chemical fixation and efficient depletion at 775 nm, enabling nanoscopic imaging both before and after aldehyde fixation. We demonstrate the compatibility of this probe with conventional immunolabeling and other strategies commonly used for fluorescence labeling of fixed samples. Moreover, we show that PKMO FX facilitates correlative super-resolution light and electron microscopy, enabling the correlation of multicolor fluorescence images and transmission EM images via the characteristic mitochondrial pattern.

          "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which connects these neuropathologies by a common phenotype. Various proteins and peptides form aggregates that are poorly degraded, and their ensuing pathological accumulation underlies these neurodegenerative diseases. Similarities may exist in the mechanisms responsible for the buildup of these aggregates. Therefore, therapeutics designed to treat one neurodegenerative disease may be beneficial to others. In ALS models, the compound NU-9 was previously shown to block neurodegeneration produced by aggregation-inducing mutations of SOD-1 and TDP-43 [B. Genç et al., Clin. Transl. Med. 11 , e336 (2021)]. Here, we report that NU-9 also prevents the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), small peptide aggregates that are instigators of Alzheimer’s disease neurodegeneration [M. Tolar et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 22 , 6355 (2021)]. AβO buildup was measured by immunofluorescence imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to exogenous monomeric Aβ. In this model, AβO buildup occurs via cathepsin L- and dynamin-dependent trafficking. This is prevented by NU-9 through a cellular mechanism that is cathepsin B- and lysosome-dependent, suggesting that NU-9 enhances the ability of endolysosomal trafficking to protect against AβO buildup. This possibility is strongly supported by a quantitative assay for autophagosomes that shows robust stimulation by NU-9. These results contribute additional understanding to the mechanisms of protein aggregation and suggest that multiple neurodegenerative diseases might be treatable by targeting common pathogenic mechanisms responsible for protein aggregation.",

Yet the genetic basis of adaptation is often unknown and potentially underpinned by a wide range of mutational types—from single nucleotide changes to large-scale alterations of chromosome structure. Copy number variation (CNV) is thought to be an important source of adaptive genetic variation, as indicated by decades of candidate gene studies that point to CNVs underlying rapid adaptation to strong selective pressures. Nevertheless, population-genomic studies of CNVs face unique logistical challenges not encountered by other forms of genetic variation. Consequently, few studies have systematically investigated the contributions of CNVs to adaptation at a genome-wide scale. We present a genome-wide analysis of CNV contributing to the adaptation of an invasive weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia . CNVs show clear signatures of parallel local adaptation between North American (native) and European (invaded) ranges, implying widespread reuse of CNVs during adaptation to shared heterogeneous patterns of selection. We used a local principal component analysis (PCA) to genotype CNV regions in whole-genome sequences of samples collected over the last two centuries. We identified 16 large CNV regions of up to 11.85 megabases in length, eight of which show signals of rapid evolutionary change, with pronounced frequency shifts between historic and modern populations. Our results provide compelling genome-wide evidence that CNV underlies rapid adaptation over contemporary timescales of natural populations.",

          "abstract": "The outer membrane (OM) of gram-negative bacteria is a robust, impermeable barrier that excludes many classes of antibiotics. Contrary to the classical model of an asymmetric lipid bilayer, recent evidence suggests the OM is predominantly an asymmetric proteolipid membrane (APLM). Outer leaflet lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that surround integral β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are shared with other OMPs to form a supramolecular network in which the levels of OMPs approach those of LPS. Some of the most abundant OMPs in the Escherichia coli OM are trimeric porins. How porins and LPS are incorporated into the OM of growing bacteria is poorly understood. Here, we use live-cell imaging and microfluidics to investigate how LPS, labeled using click chemistry, and the porin OmpF, labeled using the bacteriocin colicin N, are incorporated into the E. coli OM. Diffraction-limited fluorescence microscopy shows OmpF and LPS to be uniformly distributed and immobile. However, clustering of both macromolecules becomes evident by superresolution microscopy, which is also the case for their biogenesis proteins, BamA and LptD, respectively. Notwithstanding these common organizational features, OmpF insertion into the OM is cell-cycle-dependent leading to binary partitioning and strong polar accumulation of old OmpF. Old LPS on the other hand is diluted ~50% at each division cycle by new LPS, resulting in only mild polar accumulation of preexisting LPS. We conclude that although LPS and OMPs are destined to form the APLM their insertion dynamics are fundamentally different, which has major implications for understanding how the OM is assembled.",

Here, we show that increased S-nitrosylation of CRTC1 (forming SNO-CRTC1), as seen in cell-based, animal-based, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebrocortical neuron-based AD models, disrupts its binding with CREB and diminishes the activity-dependent gene expression mediated by the CRTC1/CREB pathway. We identified Cys216 of CRTC1 as the primary target of S-nitrosylation by nitric oxide (NO)-related species. Using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, we mutated Cys216 to Ala in hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons bearing one allele of the APP Swe mutation (AD-hiPSC neurons). Introduction of this nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 mutant rescued defects in AD-hiPSC neurons, including decreased neurite length and increased neuronal cell death. Additionally, expression of nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 in vivo in the hippocampus rescued synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation in 5XFAD mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that formation of SNO-CRTC1 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by attenuating the neuronal activity-dependent CREB transcriptional pathway, and suggests a therapeutic target for AD.",

Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material’s morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalizes puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics.

We analyzed whole exome sequences of 5,424 CHD probands. Rare damaging RGs were estimated to contribute to at least 2.2% of CHD, with greater enrichment among laterality phenotypes (5.4%) versus other subsets (1.4%). Among 108 curated human recessive CHD genes, there were 66 RGs, with 54 in 11 genes with &gt;1 RG, 12 genes with 1 RG, and 85 genes with zero. RGs were more prevalent among offspring of consanguineous union (4.7%, 32/675) than among nonconsanguineous probands (0.7%, 34/4749). Founder variants in GDF1 and PLD1 accounted for 74% of the contribution of RGs among 410 Ashkenazi Jewish probands. We identified genome-wide significant enrichment of RGs in C1orf127 , encoding a likely secreted protein expressed in embryonic mouse notochord and associated with laterality defects.

Genes with significant RG burden account for 1.3% of probands, more than half the inferred total.

Here, we integrate human brain and physiological data to investigate underlying mechanisms. Functional MRI analyses across four large datasets (totaling 19,300 participants) show that brain networks not only destabilize throughout the lifetime but do so along a nonlinear trajectory, with consistent temporal “landmarks” of brain aging starting in midlife (40s). Comparison of metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers implicate dysregulated glucose homeostasis as the driver mechanism for these transitions. Correlation between the brain’s regionally heterogeneous patterns of aging and gene expression further supports these findings, selectively implicating GLUT4 (insulin-dependent glucose transporter) and APOE (lipid transport protein). Notably, MCT2 (a neuronal, but not glial, ketone transporter) emerges as a potential counteracting factor by facilitating neurons’ energy uptake independently of insulin. Consistent with these results, an interventional study of 101 participants shows that ketones exhibit robust effects in restabilizing brain networks, maximized from ages 40 to 60, suggesting a midlife “critical window” for early metabolic intervention.",

          "abstract": "The recently identified histone modification lysine lactylation can be stimulated by L-lactate and glycolysis. Although the chemical group added upon lysine lactylation was originally proposed to be the L-enantiomer of lactate (K L-la ), two isomeric modifications, lysine D-lactylation (K D-la ) and N-ε-(carboxyethyl) lysine (K ce ), also exist in cells, with their precursors being metabolites of glycolysis. The dynamic regulation and differences among these three modifications in response to hypoxia remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that intracellular K L-la , but not K D-la or K ce , is up-regulated in response to hypoxia. Depletion of glyoxalase enzymes, GLO1 and GLO2, had minimal impact on K D-la , K ce , or hypoxia-induced K L-la . Conversely, blocking glycolytic flux to L-lactate under hypoxic conditions by knocking out lactate dehydrogenase A/B completely abolished the induction of K L-la but increased K D-la and K ce . We further observed a correlation between the level of K L-la and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression under hypoxic conditions and when small molecules were used to stabilize HIF-1α in the normoxia condition. Our result demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between HIF-1α and K L-la in lung cancer tissues and that patient samples with higher grade tend to have higher K L-la levels. Using a proteomics approach, we quantified 66 K L-la sites that were up-regulated by hypoxia and demonstrated that p300/CBP contributes to hypoxia-induced K L-la . Collectively, our study demonstrates that K L-la , rather than K D-la or K ce , is the prevailing lysine lactylation in response to hypoxia. Our results therefore demonstrate a link between K L-la and the hypoxia-induced adaptation of tumor cells.",

          "abstract": "Optimal activation of CD8+ T cells is crucial for immunity-mediated destruction of cancer, requiring a substantial amount of proteins involved in metabolism, proliferation, and effector function. Despite extensive studies emphasizing the role of transcriptional regulation in this process, paired transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal that the RNA profile is poorly correlated with protein levels. This discrepancy underscores the importance of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in controlling protein abundance during activation. However, the impact of PTMs on the CD8+ T cell protein dynamic remains underexplored. We identify that neddylation, a recently discovered PTM, is activated in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and enriched in effector CD8+ T cells from colon cancer patients. Mechanistically, we found the rate-limiting enzyme of neddylation, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8 activating enzyme E1 (NAE1), is induced by the NFATc1, a critical transcription factor downstream of TCR signaling. Our observation revealed that genetic ablation of NAE1 significantly disturbed the proteomic landscape related to activation and mitochondrial function. As a result, CD8+ T cells lacking NAE1 exhibited severely compromised activation, proliferation, and survival, which was accompanied by impaired mitochondrial function. Consistently, deletion of NAE1 in CD8+ T cells abolished their antitumor function and promoted tumor progression. By contrast, the overexpression of NAE1 significantly improved the function of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Overall, we uncovered neddylation, a previously underappreciated PTM, as a proteomic checkpoint for CD8+ T cell activation. Enforced expression of NAE1 offers promising therapeutic potential for boosting the antitumor CD8+ T cell responses.",

          "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are the most abundant cell type in the artery’s media layer and regulate vascular tone and lesion remodeling during atherogenesis. Like monocyte-derived macrophages, VSMCs accumulate excess lipids and contribute to the total intimal foam cell population in human coronary plaques and mouse aortic atheroma. While there are extensive studies characterizing the contribution of lipid metabolism in macrophage immunometabolic responses in atherosclerotic plaques, the role of VSMC lipid metabolism in regulating vascular function and lesion remodeling in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the liver X receptor (LXR) signaling pathway in VSMC is continuously activated during atherogenesis. Notably, we found that LXR deficiency in SMCs under hypercholesterolemic conditions influenced lesion remodeling by altering the fate of dedifferentiated SMCs and promoting the accumulation of VSMC-derived transitional cells. This phenotypic switching was accompanied by reduced indices of plaque stability, characterized by a larger necrotic core area and reduced fibrous cap thickness. Moreover, SMC-specific LXR deficiency impaired vascular function and caused visceral myopathy characterized by maladaptive bladder remodeling and gut lipid malabsorption. Mechanistically, we found that the expression of several genes involved in cholesterol efflux and FA synthesis including Abca1 , Srebf1 , Scd1 , Scd2 , Acsl3, and Mid1ip1 was downregulated in mice lacking LXRαβ in SMCs, likely contributing to the phenotypic switching of VSMC in the atherosclerotic lesions.",

We analyze basalt fragments collected by Chang’e-6, finding their composition resembles low-Ti basalts previously sampled by the Apollo missions. U-Pb dating indicates a basalt age of 2823.0 ± 5.9 Ma and a source 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio (μ-value) of 480 ± 56. This high μ-value indicates that the source contained materials that formed during late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. The results are consistent with the LMO model, but the Chang’e-6 basalt deviates from the trend in Apollo mission samples of younger basalts having higher μ-values.

Through iterative structural and sequence homology-based mining starting with a guide RNA-interaction domain of Cas9, we identified a family of RNA-guided DNA-targeting proteins in phage and parasitic bacteria. Each system consists of a Tandem Interspaced Guide RNA (TIGR) array and a TIGR-associated (Tas) protein containing a Nop domain, sometimes fused to HNH (TasH) or RuvC (TasR) nuclease domains. We show that TIGR arrays are processed into 36-nt RNAs (tigRNAs) that direct sequence-specific DNA binding through a tandem-spacer targeting mechanism. TasR can be reprogrammed for precise DNA cleavage, including in human cells.

A sacrificial network is introduced to shield the prime polymer network from collapsing. Under the hydro-locking mode, an alginate-polyacrylamide double-network hydrogel remains soft and stretchable within a temperature range that spans from –115° to 143°C.

Genetically impairing erucamide accumulation or exogenous application in Arabidopsis highlighted erucamide’s role in antibacterial immunity. Erucamide binds Hypersensitive response and conserved C (HrcC), a key T3SS component, to block injectisome assembly. Analyses of erucamide analogs and HrcC mutants indicated that the erucamide-HrcC binding is required for inhibiting T3SS in vitro and antibacterial resistance in plants, suggesting an essential role of erucamide-HrcC binding in disease resistance.

          "abstract": "Identifying the specific roles of precession, obliquity, and eccentricity in glacial-interglacial transitions is hindered by imprecise age control. We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic.",

          "abstract": "Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for life, and plant cells monitor Pi availability by sensing inositol pyrophosphate (PP-InsP) levels. In this work, we describe the hijacking of plant phosphate sensing by a conserved family of Nudix hydrolase effectors from pathogenic Magnaporthe and Colletotrichum fungi. Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze PP-InsP. Gene deletion experiments of Nudix effectors in Magnaporthe oryzae , Colletotrichum higginsianum , and Colletotrichum graminicola indicate that PP-InsP hydrolysis substantially enhances disease symptoms in diverse pathosystems. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants. Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism, used by multiple phytopathogenic fungi, that manipulates the highly conserved plant phosphate sensing pathway to exacerbate disease.",

          "abstract": "Interest in actinide–carbon bonds has persisted since actinide organometallics were first investigated for applications in isotope separation during the Manhattan Project. Transplutonium organometallics are rarely isolated and structurally characterized, likely owing to limited isotope inventories, a scarcity of suitable laboratory infrastructure, and intrinsic difficulties with the anaerobic conditions required. Herein, we report the discovery of an organometallic “berkelocene” complex prepared from 0.3 milligrams of berkelium-249. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction shows a tetravalent berkelium ion between two substituted cyclooctatetraene ligands, resulting in the formation of berkelium–carbon bonds. The coordination in berkelocene resembles that of uranocene, and calculations show that the berkelium 5f orbitals engage in covalent overlap with the δ-symmetry orbitals of the cyclooctatetraenide ligand π system. Charge transfer from the ligands is diminished relative to uranocene and other actinocenes, which maximizes contributions from the stable, half-filled 5f 7 configuration of tetravalent berkelium.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs) influence Earth’s climate by absorbing sunlight. However, the link between their evolving composition and their absorptive effects is unclear. We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs.",

We report that nonconvex, dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals (nanodumbbells) exhibit globally interlocking self-assembly behaviors governed by curvature-guided depletion interactions. By tailoring the local curvature of nanodumbbells, we can precisely and flexibly adjust particle bonding directionality, a level of control rarely achievable with conventional convex building blocks. These nanodumbbells can undergo long-range ordered assembly into various intricate two-dimensional superlattices, including the chiral Kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Kagome lattice is a thermodynamically stable phase, with depletion interactions playing a crucial role in stabilizing these non–close-packed structures. The emergence of Kagome lattices and other unusual structures highlights the vast potential of nonconvex nanocrystals for creating sophisticated architectures.",

Here we show, through field, lab, and virtual reality experimentation, that classical models of collective behavior cannot account for how collective motion emerges in marching desert locusts, whose swarms affect the livelihood of millions. In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals’ neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices. Our findings challenge long-held beliefs about how order can emerge from disorder in animal collectives.",

However, a partial decoupling of internal molecular motion from external degrees of freedom can reveal striking interference effects despite significant momentum exchange between the molecule and the bath of surface vibrations. We report state-prepared and state-resolved measurements of methane scattering from a room-temperature gold surface that demonstrate total destructive interference between molecular states related by a reflection symmetry operation. High-contrast interference effects prevail for all processes investigated, including vibrationally excited and vibrationally inelastic collisions. The results demonstrate the distinctly quantum mechanical effect of discrete symmetries in molecular collision dynamics.",

Although genome-wide data are routinely used for discordance-aware phylogenomic analyses, because of modeling and scalability limitations, the current practice leaves out large chunks of genomes. As more high-quality genomes become available, we urgently need discordance-aware methods to infer the tree directly from a multiple genome alignment. In this study, we introduce Coalescence-Aware Alignment-Based Species Tree Estimator (CASTER), a theoretically justified site-based method that eliminates the need to predefine recombination-free loci. CASTER is scalable to hundreds of mammalian whole genomes. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of CASTER in simulations that include recombination and apply CASTER to several biological datasets, showing that its per-site scores can reveal both biological and artifactual patterns of discordance across the genome.",

          "abstract": "Extreme heat is well-documented to adversely affect health and mortality, but its link to biological aging—a precursor of the morbidity and mortality process—remains unclear. This study examines the association between ambient outdoor heat and epigenetic aging in a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 56+ ( N = 3686). The number of heat days in neighborhoods is calculated using the heat index, covering time windows from the day of blood collection to 6 years prior. Multilevel regression models are used to predict PCPhenoAge acceleration, PCGrimAge acceleration, and DunedinPACE. More heat days over short- and mid-term windows are associated with increased PCPhenoAge acceleration (e.g., B prior7-dayCaution+heat : 1.07 years). Longer-term heat is associated with all clocks (e.g., B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 2.48 years for PCPhenoAge, B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 1.09 year for PCGrimAge, and B prior6-yearExtremecaution+heat : 0.05 years for DunedinPACE). Subgroup analyses show no strong evidence for increased vulnerability by sociodemographic factors. These findings provide insights into the biological underpinnings linking heat to aging-related morbidity and mortality risks.",

However, the postselection (PS) effect may also introduce unintended biases in precision measurements. Here, we investigate the influence of PS in the precision spectroscopy of the 2 3 S − 2 3 P transition of helium ( 4 He) using an atomic beam. We directly observe that PS based on atomic positions causes a shift in the measured transition frequency, amounting to approximately −55 kHz. After accounting for this PS shift, we obtain a corrected frequency of 276,764,094,712.45 ± 0.86 kHz for the 2 3 S 1 − 2 3 P 0 transition. Combining this result with existing data for 3 He, we derive a value for the difference in squared nuclear charge radii, which shows a σ deviation from measurements of muonic helium ions, potentially pointing to new physics that challenges lepton universality in quantum electrodynamics.",

          "abstract": "Seed dormancy determines germination timing, influencing seed plant adaptation and overall fitness. DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) is a conserved central regulator of dormancy cooperating with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) through negative regulation of ABA HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION (AHG) 1 and AHG3 phosphatases. The current molecular mechanism of DOG1 signaling proposes it regulates the activation of central ABA-related SnRK2 kinases. Here, we unveil DOG1’s functional autonomy from the regulation of ABA core signaling components and unravel its pivotal control over the activation of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE FIVE BINDING PROTEINs (AFPs). Our data revealed a molecular relay in which AFPs’ genuine activation by AHG1 is contained by DOG1 to prevent the breakdown of maturation-imposed ABA responses independently of ABA-related kinase activation status. This work offers a molecular understanding of how plants fine-tune germination timing, while preserving seed responsiveness to adverse environmental cues, and thus represents a milestone in the realm of conservation and breeding programs.",

While often attributed to nasal mucosa inflammation, the underlying causes of the olfactory loss remain unknown. Here, we characterized gene expression in olfactory epithelium cells from patients with CF using single-nuclei RNA sequencing and found altered expression of olfactory receptors (ORs) and genes related to progenitor cell proliferation. We confirmed these findings in newborn, inflammation-free samples of a CF animal model and further identified ultrastructural alterations in the olfactory epithelium and bulbs of these animals. We established that CFTR, the anion channel whose dysfunction causes CF, is dispensable for odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons, yet CF animals displayed defective odor-guided behaviors consistent with the morphological and molecular alterations. Our study highlights CF’s major role in modulating epithelial structure and OR expression, shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to olfactory loss in CF.",

In contrast, neurobiological circuits can function while simultaneously adapting to changing conditions. Here, we present a brain-inspired Super-Turing AI model based on a synaptic resistor circuit, capable of concurrent real-time inference and learning. Without any prior learning, a circuit of synaptic resistors integrating ferroelectric HfZrO materials was demonstrated to navigate a drone toward a target position while avoiding obstacles in a simulated environment, exhibiting significantly superior learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability compared to computer-based artificial neural networks.

However, GBHs pose a threat to soil fungal community, although fungi can degrade and use glyphosate as a nutrient source. How fungi respond to GBHs remains enigmatic. Here, we found that, not as in plants, the commercial GBH Roundup does not target the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the soil-derived fungus Trichoderma guizhouense , whereas it impairs fungal growth. We demonstrate that the herbicide adjuvant Triton CG-110 is more toxic to fungal cells than pure glyphosate. It limits nitrogen uptake, which induces the expression of proteinase YPS1 to catalyze the shedding of the MSB2 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of the MAPK TMK1 pheromone pathway. The downstream B2H2-type transcription factor STE12 directly regulates ergosterol biosynthesis, affecting membrane fluidity and stability. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that the pheromone pathway is implicated in ergosterol biosynthesis and plasma membrane integrity.",

Here, we report that components involved in lagging strand synthesis, DNA polymerases α and δ, have substantially reduced levels in stem cells compared to progenitor cells, and this promotes local asymmetry of parental histone incorporation at the replication fork. Compromising Polα genetically induces the local replication-coupled histone incorporation pattern in progenitor cells to resemble that in stem cells, seen by both nuclear localization patterns and chromatin fibers. This is recapitulated using a Polα inhibitor in a concentration-dependent manner. The local old versus new histone asymmetry is comparable between stem cells and progenitor cells at both S phase and M phase. Together, these results indicate that developmentally programmed expression of key DNA replication components is important to shape stem cell chromatin. Furthermore, manipulating one crucial DNA replication component can induce replication-coupled histone dynamics in nonstem cells to resemble those in stem cells.",

We overcame this problem by optogenetic current injection into all illuminated cardiomyocytes of mouse hearts in different action potential phases. Precisely triggered and patterned illumination enabled measuring R m and λ, which both were smallest at diastole. Pharmacological and depolarization-induced reduction of inwardly rectifying K + currents ( I K1 ), gap junction block, and cardiac infarction reduced I thr , showing the importance of high I K1 density and intact cardiomyocyte coupling for preventing arrhythmia initiation. Combining optogenetic current injection and computer simulations was used to classify pro- and anti-arrhythmic mechanisms based on their effects on R m and I thr and allowed to quantify I K1 inward rectification in the intact heart, identifying reduced I K1 rectification as anti-arrhythmic concept.",

By implementing a corresponding dynamical decoupling strategy, we are able to surpass the empirical limit and approach the upper physical limit T 2 = 2 T 1 for NVs, from room temperature down to 220 kelvin. Our observations, including the independence across different spatial sites and its dependence on temperature in the same way as spin-lattice relaxation, suggest an emerging decoherence mechanism dominated by spin-lattice interaction.

Perovskites have superior optoelectronic properties and structural diversity, making them ideal candidates for high-performing direct full-stokes polarimetry. However, perovskite suffers low chiroptical activity due to inefficient chiral transfer, which greatly limits its circular-polarization-vector discrimination. These issues urgently require remedy. Here, we demonstrate that perovskites’ chiroptical activity is highly related to their structural chiral-distortion extent. We propose using halide mixing to construct asymmetric chiral transfer to heighten its structural chiral-distortion extent. Accordingly, we report a 16-fold increment in the optical chiroptical activity. Further ab initio calculations verify that the enhancement is due to the strengthened magnetic transition dipole in mixed-halide structures. We herein report a self-powered, direct full-Stokes polarimetry with a high detectivity up to 1.2 × 10 12 Jones and low detection errors (Δ S 1–3 ≤ 5.0%).

Host caspase-3 cleaves the precursor NS1/2, leading to NS1 secretion via an unconventional pathway. An unbiased CRISPR screen identifies NINJ1 as an essential factor for NS1 secretion. During infection, NINJ1 is recruited to the viral replication site, where it oligomerizes and forms speckled bodies, directly interacting with NS1. Subsequent mutagenesis studies identify critical amino acid residues of NS1 necessary for its interaction with NINJ1 and selective secretion.

Under depolarizing conditions, it accumulates on mitochondria where it becomes activated, phosphorylating both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin, at Ser 65 . Our experiments reveal that in retinal pigment epithelial cells, only a fraction of PINK1 becomes stabilized after depolarization by electron transport chain inhibitors. Furthermore, the observed accrual of PINK1 cannot be completely accounted for without an accompanying increase in biosynthesis. We have used a ubiquitylation inhibitor TAK-243 to accumulate cleaved PINK1. Under these conditions, generation of unconjugated “free” phospho-ubiquitin serves as a proxy readout for PINK1 activity. This has enabled us to find a preconditioning phenomenon, whereby an initial depolarizing treatment leaves a residual pool of active PINK1 that remains competent to seed the activation of nascent cleaved PINK1 following a 16-hour recovery period.",

Here, high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy revealed how two clinically relevant inhibitors block CDK7 function. In cells, CDK7 inhibition rapidly suppressed transcription, but constitutively active genes were disproportionately affected versus stimulus-responsive. Distinct transcription factors (TFs) regulate constitutive versus stimulus-responsive genes. Accordingly, stimulus-responsive TFs were refractory to CDK7 inhibition whereas constitutively active “core” TFs were repressed. Core TFs (n = 78) are predominantly promoter associated and control cell cycle and proliferative gene expression programs across cell types. Mechanistically, rapid suppression of core TF function can occur through CDK7-dependent phosphorylation changes in core TFs and RB1. Moreover, CDK7 inhibition depleted core TF protein levels within hours, consistent with durable target gene suppression. Thus, a major but unappreciated biological function for CDK7 is regulation of a TF cohort that drives proliferation, revealing an apparent universal mechanism by which CDK7 coordinates RNAPII transcription with cell cycle CDK regulation.",

We find that the anhydrous hopping of lithium ions through the ordered and confined SSE lattice is highly distinct from ion migration through the hydrated free volumes of conventional nanoporous membranes, thus culminating in unique membrane transport properties. Notably, we reveal that the SSE provides unparalleled performance with respect to ion-ion selectivity, consistently demonstrating lithium ion selectivity values that are immeasurable by even the part-per-billion detection limit of mass spectrometry.

We found that TYLCV triggers the up-regulation of two β-myrcene biosynthesis genes in tomato, leading to the attraction of nonviruliferous B. tabaci . We also identified BtMEDOR6 as a key whitefly olfactory receptor of β-myrcene involved in the distinct preference of B. tabaci MED for TYLCV-infected plants. TYLCV inhibits the expression of BtMEDOR6, canceling this preference and thereby facilitating TYLCV transmission to uninfected plants. Greenhouse experiments corroborated the role of β-myrcene in whitefly attraction. These findings reveal a sophisticated viral strategy whereby TYLCV modulates both host plant attractiveness and vector olfactory perception to enhance its spread.",

Microglial Gi protein–coupled receptors (Gi-GPCRs) play a critical role in microglia-neuron communications.

In this study, we used Gi-based designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (Gi-DREADD) to selectively and temporally modulate microglial Gi signaling pathway. By integrating this chemogenetic approach with in vivo two-photon imaging, we observed that exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling transiently inhibited microglial process dynamics, reduced neuronal activity, and impaired neuronal synchronization. These altered neuronal functions were associated with a decrease in interactions between microglia and neuron somata. Together, this study demonstrates that acute, exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling regulates neuronal circuit function, offering a potential pharmacological target for the neuromodulation through microglia.",

In the long-wavelength IR (8 to 14 μm) region, near-unity emissivity was successfully achieved by 100-μm-deep metal microcavities with ultralow structural aspect ratios, facilitated by laser-textured multiscale surface morphologies that substantially enhance the light-trapping capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that microcavity-based patterns can produce local emissivity, tunable radiative intensity gradients, wide-angle feasibility, and high-temperature resistance, thereby enabling diverse applications in thermal IR displays such as thermal illusion, IR encryption, and grayscale thermal imaging. Notably, these blackbody microcavities are applicable to various metals, presenting considerable potential for use in extreme environments.",

Here, we use an optimized second-generation AID system to achieve the conditional and reversible loss of the essential centrosomal protein CEP192 in live mice. We show that the auxin derivative 5-phenyl-indole-3-acetic acid is well tolerated over 2 weeks and drives near-complete CEP192 degradation in less than 1 hour in vivo. CEP192 loss did not affect centriole duplication but decreased γ-tubulin recruitment to centrosomes impairing mitotic spindle assembly. Sustained CEP192 loss in vivo led to cell division failure and cell death in proliferative tissues. Thus, the second-generation AID system is well suited for rapid and/or sustained protein depletion in live mice to study essential functions in vivo.",

A key reaction pathway from perfluorocarboxylic acids to ketenes via acyl fluorides is proposed. We furthermore propose CF 2 /CF 3 radical–centered pyrolysis mechanisms and explain their roles in the formation of other products that may form in full-scale incinerators.

A210-CAART incorporating a CD8α transmembrane domain (TMD8α) showed functional but unstable surface expression, partially restored by inhibiting lysosomal degradation. A210-CAART with a CD28 TMD showed sustained surface expression, independent of TMD dimerization motifs. In a mouse xenograft model, A210.TMD8α-CAART demonstrated early control of anti-AChR B cell outgrowth but subsequent rebound and loss of surface CAAR expression, whereas A210.TMD28-CAART induced sustained surface CAAR expression and target cell elimination.

We show that SIC-induced radiation anomalies at the top of the atmosphere are sensitive to the location of SIC reduction in each season, which qualitatively explains how and why the effect of sea ice loss on Earth’s energy budget is determined by its spatial pattern. Idealized experiments indicate that SIC-induced surface warming is greater in the Arctic regions, resulting in a more negative Planck feedback. Global low-level cloud cover responses to Arctic and Antarctic SIC reduction are also distinct, leading to more negative SIC-cloud feedback in Arctic regions. SIC-induced albedo feedback is sensitive to latitude due to inhomogeneous solar radiation at the surface. As a result, the simulated radiative effect of SIC anomalies during 1980–2019 is dominated by variations in the spatial pattern of SIC.",

Using a tailored adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation algorithm designed for Ramsey interferometry using coherent population trapping (CPT), cold-atom magnetometry facilitates adaptive high-precision detection of a dc magnetic field with high dynamic range. Through implementing a sequence of correlated CPT-Ramsey interferometry, the sensitivity significantly surpasses the standard quantum limit with respect to total interrogation time. We yield a sensitivity of 6.8 ± 0.1 picotesla per square root of hertz over a range of 145.6 nanotesla, exceeding the conventional frequentist protocol by 3.3 ± 0.1 decibels.

Organoid drug profiling using a library of 153 clinical compounds identified methotrexate as an effective and selective drug against SCCOHTs with a clinically relevant IC 50 of 35 nanomolars.

The DET1-DDB1-DDA1 (DDD) complex associates with the Cullin-4 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) and a second ubiquitin ligase, COP1, to control ubiquitination of transcription factors involved in neurological, metabolic, and immune cell development. Here, we report the structure of the human DDD complex, revealing a specific segment of DET1 that can recruit ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes. Structural variability analysis, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis based on AlphaFold predictions suggest that dynamic closure of DET1, stabilized by DDA1, underlies coordinated recruitment of E2 enzymes and COP1. Biochemical assays suggest that the E2 acts as a recruitment factor to bring COP1 to DET1 for more effective substrate ubiquitination, which parallels a catalytically inactive E2 enzyme (COP10) in plant DDD complexes. This work provides a clear architecture for regulation and cooperative CRL4 DET1-COP1 complex assembly, which can affect degradation of diverse targets by COP1 complexes.",

Reducing the cavity loss has enabled resonators supporting 1 million roundtrips but with limited material choices and increased alignment sensitivity. Here, we present a high–numerical aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom single-photon absorption probability near its fundamental limit, reducing the mode size at the atom to order λ. This resonator provides a single-atom cooperativity of 1.6 in a cavity where the light circulates ∼10 times. We load single 87 Rb atoms into this cavity, observe strong coupling, and demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with fidelity of 99.55(6)% and survival of 99.89(4)% in 130 μs. Introducing intracavity imaging systems will enable cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.",

The spatial arrangement of these components and their contribution to sensory tuning are unclear. We report the three-dimensional architecture of the Pacinian corpuscle and reveal the role of its cellular components in touch detection. In the prevailing model, the outer core acts as a mechanical filter that limits static and low-frequency stimuli from reaching the afferent terminal—the presumed sole site of touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for the sensory tuning to transient touch and vibration; instead, these properties arise from the inner core. By acting as additional touch sensors, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast inactivating ion channels. Thus, functional tuning of the Pacinian corpuscle is enabled by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.",

Here, we resolve in combined ground- and excited-state spatiospectral ultrafast nanoimaging how structural characteristics are related to both molecular cation and polaron dynamics. We use the observed nanoscale spatial variations of the formamidinium (FA) cation transient vibrational blue shifts as a local probe of the nonlocal polaron-cation coupling. From the correlation with nanomovies of the polaron dynamics, we then infer how a softer more polarizable lattice supports stable polarons and longer-lived residual carriers.

While the level-of-global-warming approach can circumvent model climate sensitivity uncertainties in some applications, practitioners faced with specific adaptation responsibilities often find such projections difficult to use because they generally require time-oriented information. Earth system projections following specified emissions scenarios can, however, be constrained by applying the level-of-global-warming approach to observationally constrained warming projections to yield more reliable time-oriented projections for adaption planning and implementation. This approach also allows individual groups to produce consistent and comparable assessments of multifaceted climate impacts and causal mechanisms, thereby benefiting climate assessments at national and international levels that provide the science basis for adaptation action.",

The structure revealed an assembly distinct from those of dimeric F 1 F O -ATPases. The F 1 -like ATPase unit associated by two subunits GliD and GliE was named G 1 -ATPase as an R 1 domain of rotary ATPases. G 1 -β subunit, a homolog of the F 1 -ATPase catalytic subunit, exhibited a specific N-terminal region that incorporates the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase into the complex. Structural features of the ATPase displayed strong similarities to F 1 -ATPase, suggesting a rotation based on the rotary catalytic mechanism. Overall, the cryo-EM structure provides insights into the mechanism through which G 1 -ATPase drives the Mycoplasma gliding motility.",

However, their preparation methods remain a challenge. Here, we develop a gas-solid reactive sintering technique that successfully fabricates a variety of textured lithium ceramics, including electrolyte and electrode materials. These textured lithium ceramic electrolytes exhibit large columnar grains perpendicular to the surface. The textured electrodes indicate an out-of-plane crystallographic texture. As a result, the Li-ion transport pathways across the grain boundary plane are avoided in the textured lithium ceramic with low tortuosity, resulting in great ionic conductivity enhancement by 42 times compared to its traditional equiaxed counterpart. In addition, both Monte Carlo simulation and finite element analysis support the experimental results. This innovative gas-solid reactive sintering technique can extend to prepare various structured and functional ceramics with tailored structures and properties.",

However, in individuals with lower total spike-specific IgG, IgG4 acted in synergy with other IgG subclasses to improve FcγRI and FcγRIIa binding and consequently antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Furthermore, this trend was more pronounced with more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants where vaccination induced comparably lower total spike-specific titers. These observations were further confirmed by in silico modeling where antibody subclass concentrations and FcγR polymorphisms were modulated.

In Arabidopsis thaliana and Vicia faba leaves, FLS2 density was high in the epidermis and vascular parenchyma, low in mesophyll, and absent in sieve elements (SEs). Aequorin-based examinations disclosed dual cytosolic Ca 2+ peaks shortly after flg22 application, which corresponded with two voltage shifts from the epidermis to SEs. These signals were converted into rapid long-range action potentials (APs) or slower short-range variation potentials (VPs). Modified phytohormone-levels demonstrated systemic AP effects. Jasmonic acid up-regulation was significantly higher in wild-type than Atseor1/2 mutants. Abundant Ca 2+ influx associated with VPs was responsible for transient sieve element occlusion (SEO) near the flg22 perception site, whereas SEO was absent in Atseor1/2 and Atfls2 mutants. Biological relevance of SEO was demonstrated by higher susceptibility of Atseor1/2 mutants to Pseudomonas syringae than wild-type plants.",

This study reports that persistent priming in soft but not stiff niches that mimic primary tumor mechanical heterogeneity induces transcriptional reprogramming reminiscent of neuron and promotes the acquisition of brain metastatic potential. Soft-primed cells generate brain metastases in vivo through enhanced transendothelial migration across blood-brain barrier and brain colonization, which is further supported by the findings that tumor cells residing in local soft niches of primary xenografts exhibit brain metastatic tropism. Mechanistically, soft niches suppress cytoskeleton-nucleus–mediated mechanotransduction, which promotes histone deacetylase 3 activity. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 3 abolishes niche softness-induced brain metastatic ability.

We build a probability weight function based on the embedding energy of M in MN x sites as the descriptor for MN x formation statistics, and we predict that the alkali metals are prone to induce the formation of MVN 4 sites. By coordinating Co 2+ ions with AM-MVN x -C templates, we synthesize Co-N-C with CoN 4 sites, demonstrating remarkable oxygen reduction activity in anion exchange membrane fuel cells.

However, the cause of this trend in the BKS atmospheric circulation remains unknown. Here we show that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the primary driver of the strengthening of the BKS anticyclonic circulation, with anthropogenic aerosols playing a secondary role, both together accounting for about 86% of the observed circulation trend. Both forcings induce an amplified BKS low-tropospheric warming through coupling with strong sea ice loss. This amplified warming raises geopotential height aloft through thermal expansion, causing an anomalous anticyclonic anomaly, which in turn enhances warming and sea ice loss, forming a positive feedback loop. Our work provides a theoretical framework for understanding Arctic atmospheric circulation responses to anthropogenic warming and may have implications for climate and environment in the Arctic and beyond.",

We apply a statistical physics model—concurrence percolation—to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ( U , V ) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, ≤ V . This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they “superpose” parallel, nonshortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to nonshortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: When nonshortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.",

We have previously shown that as a lipid catalyst, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) electrostatically triggers vesicle fusion by lowering the hydration energy, and masking PIP2 arrests vesicle fusion in a state of the partial SNARE assembly. In this study, we show that calmodulin and protein kinase C–epsilon unmask PIP2 through the dissociation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate from membranes and, thus, rescue basal fusion and potentiate synaptotagmin-1–mediated Ca 2+ -dependent vesicle fusion.

Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridges between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in dense clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by their mutual gravity.

Single-nuclei transcriptomics and FISH studies revealed that GLP-1Rs are expressed primarily on GABA neurons in the VTA. Using in vivo fiber photometry, we found that the efficacy of a systemic GLP-1R agonist to attenuate cocaine seeking was associated with increased activity of VTA GABA neurons and decreased activity of VTA dopamine neurons.

Directional dichroism is the nonreciprocal phenomenon of light; the light transmittance varies depending on the direction of light propagation. It arises from interference between electromagnetic fields of light, resulting in the nonreciprocal transmittance determined by the resonance light absorption. For the maximum interference, it shows one-way transparency, and achieving this is an outstanding experimental challenge. Concerning energy dispersion, the resonance generally occurs only at a specific energy with a narrow bandwidth. When the excited state of the magnon spontaneously decays into lower energy states, the absorption linewidth gets broader.

          "abstract": "The volcanic episodes forming Ontong Java Nui (OJN) likely caused late Barremian to mid-Aptian paleoenvironmental perturbations, the most substantial of which was early Aptian oceanic anoxic event (OAE) 1a (120 million years ago). However, recent estimates on younger OJN eruption ages cast doubt on the link between OJN volcanism and OAE1a. Here, we further demonstrate the synchroneity between OJN volcanism and OAE1a by refining the chronology of Pacific volcanogenic sedimentary records on Magellan Rise, nearby OJN, with detailed osmium and carbon isotopic stratigraphy. Our geochemical data reveal that a thick tuffaceous interval at this site was deposited during OAE1a. Furthermore, multisite compilation of osmium isotopes, Pacific volcanic ash beds, and paleontological data just above OJN basalts illustrate that explosive OJN eruptions spanned ~5 million years, peaking around OAE1a. Their synchroneity strongly indicates that OJN volcanism most likely caused OAE1a and relevant late Barremian to mid-Aptian environmental perturbations.",

          "abstract": "Naturally occurring extracellular vesicles (EVs) and synthetic nanoparticles like liposomes have revolutionized precision diagnostics and medicine. EVs excel in biocompatibility and cell targeting, while liposomes offer enhanced drug loading capacity and scalability. The clinical translation of EVs is hindered by challenges including low yield and heterogeneity, whereas liposomes face rapid immune clearance and limited targeting efficiency. To bridge these gaps, biomimetic synthetic vesicles (SVs) have emerged as innovative platforms, combining the advantageous properties of EVs and liposomes. This review emphasizes critical aspects of EV biology, such as mechanisms of EV-cell interaction and source-dependent functionalities in targeting, immune modulation, and tissue regeneration, informing biomimetic SV engineering. We reviewed a broad array of biomimetic SVs, with a focus on lipid bilayered vesicles functionalized with proteins. These include cell-derived nanovesicles, protein-functionalized liposomes, and hybrid vesicles. By addressing current challenges and highlighting opportunities, this review aims to advance biomimetic SVs for transformative biomedical applications.",

          "abstract": "Earthquakes may seem random, but are often concentrated in some localized areas. Thus, they are likely controlled by fault materials and stress heterogeneity, which are little understood. Here, we provide high-resolution observations of fault material and stress heterogeneity in the Japan subduction zone through an integration of material and source imaging with numerical simulations. Our results present evidence for localized, anisotropic structures with a near-zero Poisson’s ratio in the medium surrounding 1 to 2 kilometer–sized earthquake clusters, suggesting that the fault medium is damaged, foliated, and enriched with fluid. Such localized structures may cause stress perturbations on faults that in turn favor the frequent occurrence of deep interplate earthquakes at depths of 60 to 70 kilometers. Therefore, identifying the distribution and properties of fault material heterogeneity is important for more informed assessment of earthquake hazards.",

          "abstract": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine vital for CD8 + T cell activation and proliferation, holding great potential for cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, inherent shortcomings of short half-life, activation of regulatory T (T reg ) cells, and systemic toxicity limit its application. To tackle these, a circular RNA (cRNA)–based IL-2 therapy using immunomodulatory lipid nanoparticles [ursodeoxycholic acid lipid nanoparticles (ULNPs)] and sustained-release hydrogel was developed. Fusing fragment crystallizable (Fc) region into IL-2 and encoding this fusion protein IL-2-Fc (IL-2F) in cRNA (cRNA IL-2F ) greatly extend the half-life. ULNPs containing ursodeoxycholic acid, a transforming growth factor-β1 inhibitor, suppress the function of T reg cells. Consequently, the ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F formulation promotes CD8 + T cells and suppresses T reg cells, increasing the CD8 + /T reg ratio for effective immunotherapy. Furthermore, a locally administrated hydrogel loading with ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F sustains the release, enhancing efficacy and reducing toxicity. This innovative approach achieves remarkable tumor inhibition in both melanoma and orthotopic glioma models with or without surgery, offering a promising future for cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "During meiosis, the parental chromosomes are drawn together to enable exchange of genetic information. Chromosomes are aligned through the assembly of a conserved interface, the synaptonemal complex, composed of a central region that forms between two parallel chromosomal backbones called axes. Here, we identify the axis-central region interface in C. elegans , containing a conserved positive patch on the axis component HIM-3 and the negative C terminus of the central region protein SYP-5. Crucially, the canonical ultrastructure of the synaptonemal complex is altered upon weakening this interface using charge-reversal mutations. We developed a thermodynamic model that recapitulates our experimental observations, indicating that the liquid-like central region can assemble by wetting the axes without active energy consumption. More broadly, our data show that condensation drives tightly regulated nuclear reorganization during sexual reproduction.",

          "abstract": "Site-2 proteases (S2Ps), conserved intramembrane metalloproteases that maintain cellular homeostasis, are associated with chronic infection and persistence leading to multidrug resistance in bacterial pathogens. A structural model of how S2Ps discriminate and accommodate substrates could help us develop selective antimicrobial agents. We previously proposed that the Escherichia coli S2P RseP unwinds helical substrate segments before cleavage, but the mechanism for accommodating a full-length membrane-spanning substrate remained unclear. Our present cryo-EM analysis of Aquifex aeolicus RseP ( Aa RseP) revealed that a substrate-like membrane protein fragment from the expression host occupied the active site while spanning a transmembrane cavity that is inaccessible via lateral diffusion. Furthermore, in vivo photocrosslinking supported that this substrate accommodation mode is recapitulated on the cell membrane. Our results suggest that the substrate accommodation by threading through a conserved membrane-associated region stabilizes the substrate-complex and contributes to substrate discrimination on the membrane.",

          "abstract": "Anisotropic heat–conducting materials play crucial roles in designing electronic, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric devices, where temperature and thermal stress are important. Despite substantial research efforts, a major obstacle to determining the anisotropic thermal diffusivity tensor in polycrystalline systems is the need for a robust, direct, and nondestructive technique to distinguish between distinct thermal diffusivities. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually unique thermal diffusivity microscope capable of performing high-resolution local measurements of anisotropic thermal diffusivity. The microscope features a unique micro four-point probe for fast, nondestructive scanning without calibration or extra sample preparation. It measures anisotropic thermal diffusivity based on thermal delay from a single heater. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the anisotropy of the measured thermal diffusivity correlates excellently with the crystallographic direction of prototypical Bi 2 Te 3 . The anisotropic heat transport shows that the lattice contribution dominates the heat transport for both in- and out-of-plane directions.",
