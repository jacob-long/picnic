          "title": "Integrated lithium niobate photonics for sub-ångström snapshot spectroscopy",
          "authors": "Zhiyang Yao, Shuyang Liu, Yingce Wang, Xiaoyun Yuan, Lu Fang",
          "abstract": "Spectroscopy is a pivotal tool for determining the physical structures and chemical compositions of materials and environments, and it is commonly used across diverse scientific fields1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Conventionally, spectroscopic techniques rely on narrow slits or gratings, which impose a trade-off between spectral resolution and optical transmittance17,18,19,20,21,22, thus precluding measurements with simultaneous high sensitivity and high efficiency. Here we introduce RAFAEL, a sub-ångström ultra-high-transmittance snapshot spectroscopic technique, which targets this trade-off with integrated and reconfigurable photonics based on lithium niobate. Its design comprises bulk lithium niobate as an interference mask with a pixel-wise electrically tunable spectral response and delivers picometre-scale modulation with a high optical transmittance. Our approach achieves 88-Hz snapshot spectroscopy with a spectral resolution of approximately 0.5 Å at 400–1,000 nm (R = 12,000), spatial resolution of 2,048 × 2,048 and 73.2% total optical transmittance. Compared with state-of-the-art spectroscopic imagers23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34, RAFAEL offers double the total transmittance and a nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in spectral resolving power, as verified by extensive experiments. In particular, RAFAEL captured sub-ångström spectra, including all atomic absorption peaks, of up to 5,600 stars in a single snapshot, indicating ×100–10,000 improvement in observational efficiency compared with world-class astronomical spectrometers17,18,19,20,21. This high-performing yet easily integrated snapshot spectroscopic method could drive advances in fields ranging from material science to astrophysics.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale metagenomic and data-mining efforts have revealed an expansive diversity of bacteriophages (phages) within the human gut 1–3 . However, functional understanding of phage–host interactions within this complex environment is limited, largely due to a lack of cultured isolates available for experimental validation. Here we characterize 134 inducible prophages originating from 252 human gut bacterial isolates using 10 different induction conditions to expand the experimentally validated temperate phage–host pairs originating from the human gut. Importantly, only 18% of computationally predicted prophages could be induced in pure cultures. Moreover, we construct a 78-member synthetic microbiome that, when co-cultured in the presence of human colonic cells (Caco2), led to the induction of 35% phage species. Using cultured isolates, we demonstrate that human host-associated cellular products may act as induction agents, providing a possible link between gastrointestinal cell lysis and temperate phage populations 4,5 . We provide key insights into prophage diversity and genetics, including a genetic pathway for domestication, finding that polylysogeny was common and resulted in coordinated prophage induction, and that differential induction can be influenced by divergent prophage integration sites. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of culture-based techniques, alongside experimental validation, genomics and computational prediction, to understand the biology and function of temperate phages in the human gut microbiome. These culture-based approaches will enable applications across synthetic biology, biotechnology and microbiome fields.",

          "abstract": "Compartmentalization of eukaryotic genome into euchromatin and heterochromatin is of critical biological significance1,2,3. Previous studies have suggested a self-templating pathway involving the reading and writing of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation by SUV39H as the core mechanism for heterochromatin reassembly during cell division1,3. In fission yeast, the mammalian SUV39H homologue Clr4 forms a complex containing ubiquitin ligase Cul4, which catalyses H3K14 mono-ubiquitination (H3K14ub) to promote heterochromatin formation. However, whether heterochromatin reassembly in dividing mammalian cells involves a similar pathway is unknown. Here we identified G2E3 as an H3K14ub-specific, pericentromeric heterochromatin-localized E3 ligase. G2E3-catalysed H3K14ub potentiates histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) by SUV39H and is specifically required for SUV39H compartmentalization and H3K9me3 in pericentromeric heterochromatin. Mechanistically, we found that G2E3 is highly expressed in G2/M phase and associates with mitotic chromosomes in an RNA-dependent manner to catalyse H3K14ub, which is essential for the subsequent sequential recruitment of SUV39H and HP1. The SUV39H chromodomain is a reader of dual H3K9me3 and H3K14ub modifications and SUV39H associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin primarily through its H3K14ub-binding activity. Notably, loss of G2E3 severely impairs pericentromeric heterochromatin organization and results in the aberrant accumulation of SUV39H and H3K9me3 in numerous euchromatin regions and widespread transcriptional repression. Thus, our findings revealed the H3K14ub-dependent SUV39H compartmentalization as a unified mechanism of pericentromeric heterochromatin formation, which is essential for proper euchromatin compartmentalization and transcriptional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have emerged as a promising non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to lead-based devices1-3, with certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of inverted architectures now exceeding 16%4-8. Despite an ideal bandgap supporting a theoretical PCE over 33%, TPSCs still lag in performance and stability, partly due to suboptimal hole transport layers and poor buried interface that hinder hole extraction. Here, we report (E)-(2-(4',5'-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-[2,2'-bithiophen]-5-yl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid at the buried interface, using a molecular film to optimize hole transport layers in inverted TPSCs. This molecular film forms a homogeneous interfacial layer with well-matched energy level alignment, significantly enhancing hole extraction. Moreover, this approach creates a superwetting underlayer that guides the growth of uniform, high-quality Sn-based perovskite films with reduced defect density and minimized non-radiative recombination losses. The resulting inverted small-area TPSCs demonstrate a record PCE of 17.89% (certified 17.71% under reverse scanning mode). Furthermore, the encapsulated device maintains over 95% of the initial PCE after 1344 h of ambient shelf storage and over 94% after 1550 h of continuous operation under 1-sun illumination. Notably, we achieve a record PCE of 14.40% for 1 cm2 TPSCs, highlighting the scalability of our strategy.",

          "abstract": "Predicting complex disease risks on the basis of individual genomic profiles is an advancing field in human genetics1,2. However, most genetic studies have focused on populations of European ancestry, creating a global imbalance in precision medicine and underscoring the need for genomic research in non-European groups3,4. The Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative recruited more than half a million Taiwanese residents, providing a large dataset of genetic profiles and electronic medical record data for people with Han Chinese ancestry. Using extensive phenotypic data, we conducted comprehensive genomic analyses across the medical phenome with individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations. These analyses identified population-specific genetic risk variants and new findings for various complex traits. We developed polygenic risk scores, demonstrating strong predictive performance for conditions such as cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers and infectious diseases. We observed consistent findings in an independent dataset, Taiwan Biobank, and among people of East Asian ancestry in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Project. The identified genetic risks accounted for up to 10.3% of the overall health variation in the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative cohort. Our approach of characterizing the phenome-wide genomic landscape, developing population-specific risk-prediction models, assessing their performance and identifying the genetic effect on health serves as a model for similar studies in other diverse study populations.",

The platform relies on in situ activation via borane coordination and exploits a copper catalytic redox system that generates amine-ligated boryl radicals, which undergo β-scission across the C(sp³)–N bond to release alkyl radicals. These intermediates engage in copper-catalyzed cross-couplings with a broad array of C-, N-, O-, and S-based nucleophiles. The method tolerates diverse amine classes, enables modular functionalization, and supports late-stage editing of complex drug scaffolds. In addition, amides can be incorporated into the manifold via reductive funneling. This work establishes a general approach to deaminative C–N bond functionalization and introduces a distinct approach for making and modifying druglike molecules.",

Despite major advances5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19, no species has yet been characterized with a truly comprehensive atlas of genetic variation. Here we present an extensive genomic and phenotypic resource for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on near telomere-to-telomere assemblies of 1,086 natural isolates. Leveraging these high-contiguity assemblies, we generated a highly complete species-wide structural variant atlas, gene-based pangenome and graph pangenome. By incorporating the full spectrum of genetic variation captured across the species, we conducted genome-wide association studies across 8,391 molecular and organismal traits19,20,21,22. The inclusion of structural variants and small insertion–deletion mutations improved heritability estimates by an average of 14.3% compared with analyses based only on single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Structural variants were more frequently associated with traits and exhibited greater pleiotropy than other variant types. Notably, the genetic architecture of molecular and organismal traits differed markedly. Together, this work provides a unique dataset that illuminates how diverse forms of genetic variation shape phenotypic diversity and lays the groundwork for integrative, genome-scale studies in other eukaryotic systems.",

Although a lot of quantum algorithms 2–4 have been developed for simulating quantum dynamics, a general-purpose method for simulating low-temperature quantum phenomena remains unknown. In classical settings, the analogous task of sampling from thermal distributions has been largely addressed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods 5,6 . Here we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for thermal simulation that—akin to MCMC methods—exhibits detailed balance, respects locality and serves as a toy model for thermalization in open quantum systems. The enduring impact of MCMC methods suggests that our new construction may play an equally important part in quantum computing and applications in the physical sciences and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Tropical forests act as important global carbon sinks1, and Earth System Models predict increasing near-term carbon sink capacity for these forests, with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration thought to stimulate tree growth2,3. However, current forest inventory data analyses suggest that the carbon sink capacity of intact tropical forests may be in decline, portending a possible future switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources3,4,5,6,7. Here we use long-term forest inventory data (1971–2019) from Australian moist tropical forests and a causal inference framework8,9,10 to assess the carbon balance of woody aboveground standing biomass over time, the demographic processes accounting for it, and its climatic drivers, including cyclones. We find that a transition from sink (0.62 ± 0.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 1971–2000) to source (−0.93 ± 0.11 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 2010–2019) has occurred for the aboveground woody biomass of these forests, with sink capacity declining at a rate of 0.041 ± 0.032 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. The transition was driven by increasingly extreme temperature and other climate anomalies, which have increased tree mortality and associated biomass losses4, with no evidence of the carbon fertilization (stimulation) of woody tree growth. Forest dynamics underlying carbon sink capacity were also punctuated by cyclones, with impacts of a similar magnitude to long-term climate-induced changes. Our findings suggest the potential for a similar response to climate change by woody aboveground biomass in moist tropical forests globally, which could culminate in a long-term switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources.",

          "abstract": "Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail 1 . However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water 2,3 , in which the structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered 4,5 . The structural change is expected to affect the conductivity of water and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes 6–9 . Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy (SDM) 10 to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding several nanometres, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches large, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000, whereas the conductivity peaks at several S m −1 , close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores.",

The mechanism for stabilizing memories of survival-critical experiences, which are often emotionally salient and repeated, remains unclear 4 . Here we identify an astrocytic ensemble that is transcriptionally primed by emotional experience and functionally triggered by repeated experience to stabilize labile memory. Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams 5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories.",

          "abstract": "All mammalian organs depend on resident macrophage populations to coordinate repair and facilitate tissue-specific functions 1–3 . Functionally distinct macrophage populations reside in discrete tissue niches and are replenished through a combination of local proliferation and monocyte recruitment 4,5 . Declines in macrophage abundance and function have been linked to age-associated pathologies, including atherosclerosis, cancer and neurodegeneration 6–8 . However, the mechanisms that coordinate macrophage organization and replenishment within ageing tissues remain largely unclear. Here we show that capillary-associated macrophages (CAMs) are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice. To investigate resident macrophage behaviour in vivo, we used intravital two-photon microscopy in live mice to non-invasively image the skin capillary plexus, a spatially well-defined vascular niche that undergoes rarefication and functional decline with age. We find that CAMs are lost at a rate exceeding capillary loss, resulting in macrophage-deficient vascular niches in both mice and humans. CAM phagocytic activity was locally required to repair obstructed capillary blood flow, leaving macrophage-deficient niches selectively vulnerable under homeostatic and injury conditions. Our study demonstrates that homeostatic renewal of resident macrophages is less precisely regulated than previously suggested 9–11 . Specifically, neighbouring macrophages do not proliferate or reorganize to compensate for macrophage loss without injury or increased growth factors, such as colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). These limitations in macrophage renewal may represent early and targetable contributors to tissue ageing.",

Although the Carnian sedimentary rocks of South America provided much of the available evidence for understanding the early evolution of these clades, key discoveries have remained restricted to the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión6,7 and Paraná basins8 in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. Here we report a Carnian tetrapod assemblage from the previously unrecognized Northern Precordillera Basin in northwestern Argentina. Discoveries at this basin, in the Quebrada Santo Domingo site, include a nearly complete skeleton of the early sauropodomorph Huayracursor jaguensis gen. et sp. nov., and typical components of Late Carnian faunas, such as hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurs, gomphodontosuchine traversodontid cynodonts, and aetosaurs. Compared to its generally small and short-necked Carnian counterparts9,10, Huayracursor is larger and exhibits an incipient elongation of its cervical vertebrae, representing an intermediate condition for size and cervical elongation between known Carnian and Norian sauropodomorphs11. This discovery provides one of the oldest pieces of evidence of increased body mass and neck elongation in early Sauropodomorpha.",

Disruption of this symbiotic consortium leads to coral bleaching and, ultimately, mortality2. However, a few coral species exhibit facultative symbiosis, allowing them to survive extended periods of bleaching3,4. Despite this resilience, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the genomic and cellular basis of facultative symbiosis in Oculina patagonica, a thermotolerant Mediterranean coral5,6. We sequenced and annotated a chromosome-scale genome of O. patagonica and built cell atlases for this species and two obligate symbiotic corals. Comparative genomic analysis revealed karyotypic and syntenic conservation across all scleractinians, with species-specific gene expansions primarily driven by tandem duplications. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of symbiotic and naturally aposymbiotic wild specimens identified an increase in phagocytic immune cells and a metabolic shift in gastrodermal gene expression from growth-related functions to quiescent, epithelial-like states. Cross-species comparison of host cells uncovered Oculina-specific metabolic and signalling adaptations indicative of an opportunistic, dual-feeding strategy that decouples survival from symbiotic state.",

However, we show here that host cell-encoded Z-RNAs are major and sufficient ZBP1 activating ligands following infection by these two human pathogens. The majority of cellular Z-RNAs mapped to intergenic endogenous retroelements (EREs) embedded within abnormally long 3’ extensions of host cell mRNAs. These aberrant host cell transcripts arose as a consequence of Disruption of Transcription Termination (DoTT), a virus-driven phenomenon which disables Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF)-mediated 3’ processing of nascent pre-mRNAs10-15. Mutant viruses lacking ICP27 or NS1, the virus-encoded proteins responsible for inhibiting CPSF and triggering DoTT13,15, failed to induce host cell Z-RNA accrual and were attenuated in their ability to stimulate ZBP1. Ectopic expression of HSV-1 ICP27 or IAV NS1, or pharmacological blockade of CPSF activity, induced accumulation of host cell Z-RNAs and activated ZBP1. These results demonstrate that DoTT-generated cellular Z-RNAs are bona fide ZBP1 ligands, and position ZBP1-activated cell death as a host response to counter viral disruption of the cellular transcriptional machinery.",

          "abstract": "Stencilling, in which patterns are created by painting over masks, has ubiquitous applications in art, architecture and manufacturing. Modern, top-down microfabrication methods have succeeded in reducing mask sizes to under 10 nm (refs. 1,2 ), enabling ever smaller microdevices as today’s fastest computer chips. Meanwhile, bottom-up masking using chemical bonds or physical interactions has remained largely unexplored, despite its advantages of low cost, solution-processability, scalability and high compatibility with complex, curved and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces 3,4 . Here we report atomic stencilling to make patchy nanoparticles (NPs), using surface-adsorbed iodide submonolayers to create the mask and ligand-mediated grafted polymers onto unmasked regions as ‘paint’. We use this approach to synthesize more than 20 different types of NP coated with polymer patches in high yield. Polymer scaling theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that stencilling, along with the interplay of enthalpic and entropic effects of polymers, generates patchy particle morphologies not reported previously. These polymer-patched NPs self-assemble into extended crystals owing to highly uniform patches, including different non-closely packed superlattices. We propose that atomic stencilling opens new avenues in patterning NPs and other substrates at the nanometre length scale, leading to precise control of their chemistry, reactivity and interactions for a wide range of applications, such as targeted delivery, catalysis, microelectronics, integrated metamaterials and tissue engineering 5–11 .",

Gene expression in the liver varies between periportal and pericentral hepatocytes1,2,3, and in the intestine from crypts to villus tips4,5. A key element of tissue spatial organization is probably metabolic, but direct assessments of spatial metabolism remain limited. Here we map spatial metabolic gradients in the mouse liver and intestine. We develop an integrated experimental–computational workflow using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), isotope tracing and deep-learning artificial intelligence. Most measured metabolites (>90%) showed significant spatial concentration gradients in the liver lobules and intestinal villi. In the liver, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle metabolites and their isotope labelling from both glutamine and lactate localized periportally. Energy-stress metabolites, including adenosine monophosphate (AMP), also localized periportally, consistent with a high periportal energy demand. In the intestine, the TCA intermediates malate (tip) and citrate (crypt) showed opposite spatial patterns, aligning with higher glutamine catabolism in tips and lactate oxidation in crypts based on isotope tracing. Finally, we mapped the fate of the obesogenic dietary sugar fructose. In the intestine, oral fructose was catabolized faster in the villus bottom than in the tips. In the liver, fructose-derived carbon accumulated pericentrally as fructose-1-phosphate and triggered pericentral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion. Thus, we both provide foundational knowledge regarding intestine and liver metabolic organization and identify fructose-induced focal derangements in liver metabolism.",

These molecules often possess physicochemical properties relevant to drug discovery: potency, stability, metabolic stability and target specificity3. The replacement of oxygen atoms in readily available oxetanes would offer a direct route to a variety of these cyclic pharmacophores, yet such atom swapping has been rarely reported for non-aromatic molecules. Here we report a general photocatalytic strategy that selectively substitutes the oxygen atom of an oxetane with a nitrogen-, sulfur- or carbon-based moiety, transforming it into a diverse range of saturated cyclic building blocks in a single operation. This atom swapping method exhibits high functional group compatibility and is applicable to late-stage functionalization, substantially simplifying the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and complex drug analogues that would otherwise require multi-step routes. Mechanistic investigations unveil insights on the origin of chemoselectivity that allows the endocyclic oxygen atom to react preferentially to generate an acyclic dihalide intermediate, which then undergoes efficient ring reconstruction in the presence of a nucleophilic species.",

EMR access is both retrospective and prospective, allowing longitudinal studies. Genetic profiling is done with population-optimized SNP arrays for those of Han Chinese ancestry that enable genome-wide association 3,4, phenome-wide association 5,6, and polygenic risk score 7,8 studies to evaluate common disease risk and pharmacogenetic response. Participants also agree to be recontacted for future research and receive personalized genetic risk profiles with health management recommendations. TPMI has established the TPMI Data Access Platform (TDAP), a central database and analysis platform that both safeguards the security of the data and facilitates academic research. As a large non-European ancestry cohort that merges genetic profiles with EMR and enables longitudinal follow-up, TPMI provides a unique resource to validate genetic risk prediction models, conduct clinical trials of risk-based health management, and inform health policies.

Using this approach, we enable efficient encoding of a variety of previously inaccessible ncAAs, decorating proteins with bioorthogonal 6 and crosslinker 7 moieties, post-translational modifications 8,9 and functionalities for chemoenzymatic conjugation. We then devise a high-throughput directed evolution platform to engineer tailored transporter systems for the import of ncAAs that were historically refractory to efficient uptake. Customized Escherichia coli strains expressing these evolved transporters facilitate single and multi-site ncAA incorporation with wild-type efficiencies. Additionally, we adapt the tripeptide scaffolds for the co-transport of two different ncAAs, enabling their efficient dual incorporation.

Although previous research has attempted to resolve China’s sea-level budget from the 1950s 3,4 , these studies capture short timescales and lack the long-term context necessary to fully assess modern sea-level rise in southeastern China 5 —one of the world’s most densely populated regions with immense socioeconomic importance 6 . Here we show that GMSL followed three distinct stages from 11,700 years before present (BP) to the modern day: (1) rapid early Holocene rise driven by the deglacial melt of land ice; (2) 4,000 years of stability from around 4200 BP to the mid-nineteenth century when regional processes dominated sea-level change; and (3) accelerating rise from the mid-nineteenth century. Our results arise from spatiotemporal hierarchical modelling of geological sea-level proxies and tide gauge data to produce site-specific sea-level budget estimates with uncertainty quantification. It is extremely likely ( P ≥ 0.95) that the GMSL rise rate since 1900 (1.51 ± 0.16 mm year −1 , 1 σ ) has exceeded any century over at least the past four millennia. Moreover, our analysis indicates that at least 94% of rapid modern urban subsidence is attributable to anthropogenic activities, with localized subsidence rates often exceeding GMSL rise. Such concurrent acceleration of global sea-level rise and rapid localized subsidence has not been observed in our Holocene geological record.",

          "abstract": "Snö: A History Sverker Sörlin Doubleday (2025)\n\nAs a child growing up in northern Sweden, environmental historian Sverker Sörlin fell in love with snow. “I see the light outside, before I even open the slatted blinds. Snow! The miracle of whiteness is shining through the slats,” he recalls in his latest book, Snö.\n\nNow, he fights for snow’s survival. And survive it must, Sörlin argues, if we’re to avoid droughts, sinking tundra fields and an overheated planet. With amazing anecdotes, emotive memories and pleas for climate action, Snö aims to galvanize readers.\n\nGlaciers are not just blocks of ice — plans to save them mustn’t overlook their hidden life\n\nA skiing trip to Norway’s Rondane Mountains marked a transcendent moment for Sörlin. After sundown, dozens of puddles started freezing over in the grass around his campsite, each making a distinct cracking sound. Sörlin felt at one with “the forces of nature, the whole solar system, at play in a condensed timescale”.\n\nSnow’s distinctive soundscapes captivate. For instance, when microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier arrived in eastern Sweden to study the CRISPR gene-editing technology for which she won the 2020 chemistry Nobel prize, she heard the snow crunching under her feet whisper “crispr, crispr”.\n\nAnd contrary to the myth, our voices are nowhere near loud enough to trigger an avalanche. With a pressure of 20 pascals, even the sound of a jet aeroplane taking off wouldn’t trigger a snowslide, and a human shriek hits just one-tenth of that. By contrast, a sonic boom creates 200 pascals, which certainly could shift some snow. Despite this evidence, Sörlin still wonders, “If I stood there on the loose snow again … would I really dare to scream?”\n\nA flurry of research\n\nSörlin celebrates people who have sought answers to snow’s scientific mysteries.\n\nIn northern Japan in the 1930s, physicist Ukichiro Nakaya undertook fieldwork in the Hokkaido Mountains, which are notorious for their immense snowstorms. In perishing conditions, Nakaya grew obsessed with explaining the variety of snow crystals. By creating individual snowflakes on rabbit hairs in a low-temperature laboratory, Nakaya could assess the impacts of temperature and humidity on the crystals’ shape. Each of these ‘letters from heaven’ held crucial data about the atmospheric conditions in which they formed.\n\nChildren make the most of a snowy day in Kabul.Credit: Wakil Kohsar/AFP/Getty\n\nOther snow-obsessed characters include Willi Dansgaard, a “brusque young physicist with wide-ranging interests and an unquenchable curiosity”, who worked, starting in the 1960s, with ice cores drilled from Greenland’s ice sheet. In the ice cores, Dansgaard’s team found snow dating back millennia, retaining what Sörlin calls “atmospheric labelling … a kind of microscopic message in a bottle”.\n\nClimate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice\n\nGreenland’s ice-core chemistry revealed sudden climate changes, tying in with Dansgaard’s interest as to why Norse communities left the island in the Middle Ages. Studies suggest that a drying climate was responsible for Norse people’s disappearance in the fifteenth century, because less grass was available for livestock in winter (B. Zhao et al. Sci. Adv. 8, eabm4346; 2022).",

Researchers quickly dubbed the dots, which JWST first detected in 2022, Universe breakers, because they contradicted standard thinking about the features of the early Universe.\n\nOver the past few months, researchers have begun to settle on the identity of these dots, and it’s one that seldom emerges in astronomy: a brand-new type of celestial object. “It’s extremely rare that you get to work on a truly new physical phenomenon like this,” says Anna de Graaff, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “It’s almost a shame that we’re starting to figure them out.”\n\nCould JWST solve cosmology’s big mystery? Physicists debate Universe-expansion data\n\nMany scientists now think that little red dots (LRDs) are a hybrid between a black hole and a star: an active black hole wrapped in a cocoon of hot, dense gas — much like the atmosphere of a star — that glows as the black hole warms it. A more conventional black hole, by contrast, doesn’t shine in the same way.\n\nEven as astronomers decide on a front-runner theory on the nature of these mysterious dots, often called rubies, they are left with more questions: did LRDs exist only in the most ancient Universe, or are they also present in more modern stretches of the cosmos? How do they evolve over time? And how do they form in the first place?\n\nJust three years after JWST’s first observations of these dots, some 200 manuscripts investigating LRDs have been posted to the arXiv preprint server (some of these manuscripts have not yet been peer reviewed). Here, Nature rounds up a few of the bright specks of research — all described in the past three months — that are illuminating this tantalizing new class of object.\n\nA remarkable ruby\n\nPerhaps the most pivotal LRD is an object called the Cliff, which makes the strongest case yet for the black-hole-star model. This object got its name because of the sharp break in the spectrum of light it emits: in a graph that shows the wavelengths of light radiated by the object at one point in time, its emissions are almost zero for ultraviolet light just outside the visible spectrum but they spike suddenly for slightly less energetic wavelengths of light.\n\nGiant black hole is one of the earliest ever seen — with clues for how these weird objects form\n\n“The sharp transition is not something normal galaxies can make,” says de Graaff, a co-author of a paper1 describing the results that was published last month in Astronomy and Astrophysics. “And black holes in the nearby Universe also don’t look like that. So this was the first object that could rule out a huge array of models.” The authors of the paper accordingly refer to the Cliff as a “remarkable ruby”.\n\nAnalysis of the spikes of light indicates that the object must be extremely energetic — like a black hole — but must also be encased in warm, dense gas similar to the atmosphere of a star. The team’s explanation of the object matched well with a model described2 earlier this year of a black hole swaddled in gas, and thus, the black hole star was born.\n\nGalactic pack\n\nIn addition to solidifying what LRDs are, astronomers are curious as to how they evolve. Some think such rubies could become the centres of galaxies.\n\nAs they reported in Nature Astronomy3 last month, one team of researchers is beginning to zero in on a potential answer. The LRD starring in their paper was surrounded by eight nearby galaxies and embedded in an especially large blob of dark matter, the invisible entity that binds groups of galaxies together, says study co-author Jan-Torge Schindler, an astronomer at the University of Hamburg in Germany. Such a large dark-matter halo usually hosts quasars, extremely bright cores at the centres of some galaxies.",

          "abstract": "Next week will see a first in computer science, with the launch of a scientific conference in which all of the papers — and all of the reviews — have been produced by machines.\n\nAt the event known as Agents4Science 2025, to be held online on 22 October, the attendees will still be humans. It will feature presentations of the submitted papers — given either by the artificial intelligence (AI) agents themselves or by the humans who ran the experiments — and panel discussions by academics.\n\nThe conference offers “a relatively safe sandbox where we can sort of experiment with different submission processes, different kinds of review processes”, says James Zou, an AI researcher at Stanford University in California who co-organized the event. It is designed to capture a “paradigm shift” in how AI is used in science that has taken place over the past year, says Zou. Rather than using large language models (LLMs) or other tools designed for specific tasks, researchers are now building coordinated groups of models, known as agents, to act as “scientists working across the research endeavour”, he says.\n\nAI models are already being used to generate and review research, but most publishers and conference organizers ban machines from being listed as paper authors or speakers. “We thought we’d flip it around, where both the authors and the reviewers have to be AI,” says Zou. Although humans can offer advice and feedback, according to conference guidance, AIs should be the primary contributor, akin to the first author.\n\nThe conference draws attention to “the fact that those of us in the AI world need to do a better job at understanding what the strengths and weaknesses are of using systems in this way”, says computer scientist Margaret Mitchell, who studies AI ethics at Hugging Face in New York City. “How to evaluate AI agents at all is an open research area,” she adds. A key question is how to factor in the frequency with which the model comes up with useless ‘false positive’ discoveries — something that can temper its overall utility.\n\nAgents4Science has another benefit, says AI researcher Clémentine Fourrier, also at Hugging Face. “Hopefully a conference like this would divert some of the AI bloat to alleviate reviewer load” at other meetings, they say.\n\nAI reviewers\n\nThe conference organizers received submissions of work by more than 300 AI agents, of which 48 were accepted after being assessed by a panel of AI reviewers. The papers are mainly computational studies (rather than involving physical experiments), covering fields from psychoanalysis to mathematics, says Zou. He hopes the conference will produce data on how good AI scientists are and the types of mistake they make. Such data could be used to inform policies on the use of AI in research, says Mitchell.\n\nLeft to their own devices, AI agents are still prone to error. The papers submitted for the Agents4Science conference were required to state the interaction between the researcher and the AI agent at every step of the process. This means it will be possible to assess how the extent of human involvement affects the quality of the work, says Zou.",

          "authors": "Mariana Viglino",
          "abstract": "Imagine academia as a racetrack. Some scientists start further ahead than others; some run on clean tracks, others face mud or obstacles. Some can afford only heavy boots, instead of trainers. Some are told that they are not trying hard enough.\n\nEquity is more than a buzzword\n\nThese differing experiences represent the inequities that many researchers face in their careers. Scientists born and based in Latin America — and other historically colonized countries, often referred to as the global south — are familiar with many barriers, including limited funding; reading, writing and communicating their research in a language that isn’t their first; unstable economic and political landscapes; and systemic bias in favour of ideas, data, papers and people from the global north. They also face a high likelihood of encountering unequal partnerships and ‘parachute’ science — an extractive practice in which scientists from high-income countries use data from a lower-income community without involving them in the project.\n\nSome effects of these inequities are well documented. In my field of aquatic-mammal palaeontology, my colleagues and I have found that having a large proportion of Latin American authors on a paper negatively affects the number of citations it receives (A. M. Valenzuela-Toro et al. Commun. Biol. 8, 472; 2025). But publications are key to funding, professional assessments, promotions and international networking. They can prompt invitations to conferences and consideration for awards.\n\nAs a scientist and a woman born, educated and based in Latin America, I propose some steps that editors and publishers — the gatekeepers of publications, who are often scientists from the global north and haven’t experienced some of these barriers — can take to level the playing field.\n\nDecolonize scientific institutions, don’t just diversify them\n\nMake it easier to submit papers. Routinely ask authors what hurdles they faced, and improve systems. Offer guidance on the editorial and peer-review processes. Should authors first pitch to editors, or submit directly? When, and how, should they respond to reviewers’ concerns or appeal a decision? Often, tips for navigating these processes are shared in networks that Latin American researchers are not part of. And lower the language barrier: Spanish and Portuguese versions of submission systems would make them easier for many scientists to use. On publication, journals should offer free copyediting to expand articles’ reach. Artificial-intelligence tools can help — but they should be embraced only with clear guidelines, extreme caution and ethical responsibility.\n\nPartner with Latin American scientific societies. They can help journals to identify scholars to invite onto editorial boards and as reviewers. Owing to the barriers they face, highly qualified Latin American candidates might not have built an international profile through publications or conference invitations — but they can be outstanding choices. Increased Latin American representation will also encourage more submissions.\n\nGo beyond diversity commitments: track progression (positive or otherwise). Data are key to trigger progress and to monitor it. The scientific community must see statistics. Journals must share the demographic information of editorial-board members, authors of submitted and published manuscripts and reviewers. This is not easy — the preferred route for collecting demographic statistics is through self-identification, and publishers have historically not compiled this information, so it will take time to build enough data to see trends. There is no time to waste.",

To tackle those, universities on the continent must strengthen their research and innovation capacity.\n\nUniversities must move with the times: how six scholars tackle AI, mental health and more\n\nOn average, African countries spend around 0.5% of their gross domestic product on research and development. That’s less than one-quarter of the global average of 2.7%. Without more investment, African countries will remain reliant on imported innovations that are often costly, ill suited to local realities and unsustainable. Botswana urgently needs to address water scarcity and low agricultural productivity. Drought-resistant crops, efficient irrigation technologies and smart water-management systems would help.\n\nBut most universities in Botswana, both public and private, rely heavily on public funding. And with the country’s economy under strain, because the diamond industry it has long depended on is dwindling, the budgets for these institutions are shrinking. The University of Botswana in Gaborone has seen its funding for day-to-day operations decline by about 15% since 2022, and it has received no budget over the past seven years for other developments.\n\nThere are also relatively few jobs for graduates to aspire to. In 2022, approximately one-quarter of adults in Botswana, around 240,000 people, were unemployed. This is eroding faith in higher education, shrinking enrolment in advanced studies, weakening research and innovation capacity and fuelling a brain drain. For those who do go to university, Botswana has a skills mismatch: too many information technology specialists, not enough medical ones.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nThese challenges are prominent. But Botswana’s past prosperity and stability was not built just on diamonds; it relied on sound policies and robust institutions. These policies and institutions must now support the transformation of the country’s economy from a resource-based to a knowledge-based model. At the University of Botswana, together with colleagues, I have been working to convert this mainly teaching institution into a research-intensive one.\n\nThere’s no research without people. We are investing in attracting, developing and nurturing talent. We have set up a mentoring and supervision programme to support early-career researchers through partnerships with other African universities and with international institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",

          "authors": "Kit Chapman",
          "abstract": "Alchemy: An Illustrated History of Elixirs, Experiments, and the Birth of Modern Science Philip Ball Yale Univ. Press (2025)\n\nWhen physicist Ernest Rutherford and chemist Frederick Soddy discovered nuclear transmutation — the natural decay of one radioactive element into another — in 1901, Rutherford’s first cry was of alarm, not delight. “For Mike’s sake, Soddy,” he chastised his co-worker. “Don’t call it transmutation, they’ll have our heads off as alchemists!”\n\nElixirs for times of plague and bullion shortage\n\nAlchemy’s reputation hasn’t improved much since — it remains one of the most misunderstood aspects of science history. For most people, alchemy conjures up images of complex charts and mythical ingredients such as the philosopher’s stone, which could turn lead into gold or create the elixir of life.\n\nIn his latest book, Alchemy, science writer Philip Ball portrays the practice instead as “one of the most versatile, allusive, and fertile products of the human imagination”. He deftly recounts its 4,000 years of history — starting with the skilled artisans of Ancient Egypt and the immortality-seeking medical practitioners of China’s Western Han dynasty (202 bc–ad 9), although the practice originated before this period — picking out changing beliefs, famous works and personalities along the way.\n\nRudiments of science\n\nBall’s eclectic knowledge of chemistry, his insatiable curiosity and his willingness to venture off well-beaten paths make him an excellent guide. To his credit, the book steadfastly refuses to align itself with aspects of alchemy that are overly practical (apparatus and temperature-control methods) or esoteric, and it doesn’t espouse outdated ideas. Historians of science don’t give much credence to the views of psychiatrist Carl Jung, for example, who professed that alchemical symbolism was a reflection of psychological desires. New Age thinking that alchemy is about spiritual transformation rather than scientific effort is less interesting than what alchemy really is.\n\nIllustrations from the Ripley Scroll, around 1600 (left), and The Works of Jacob Behmen, 1764.Credit: Getty Research Institute, Manly Palmer Hall collection of alchemical manuscripts, GRI Special Collections, MS 205 (PDM); Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles\n\nIndeed, alchemy meant many things to different groups and schools of thought, and its story was one of chemical progress and faith-based mystery. Ball picks out several pivotal characters to show how their disparate goals, views and personalities acted as a prism for how they saw the ‘noble art’. Famous practitioners are featured, such as physicist Isaac Newton, and several individuals who are often overlooked in science history.\n\nFor example, in fifteenth-century England, alchemist George Ripley wrote his recipes in rhyming verse. In seventeenth-century Stockholm, queen Christina of Sweden — who ran her own experiments and worked with other alchemists — was a wonderfully controversial figure. She refused to marry, converted from Protestantism to Catholicism and abdicated the throne. Alchemy became the boon or bane of monarchs, depending on whether they thought it could bring them riches or were terrified that their control over their people would slip. And it was a playground for tricksters willing to take someone’s money with the promise of gold that would never come.\n\nAs well as the standard Western progress of alchemy from Egypt to Europe, and from the Islamic world to Christianity, Ball’s gaze also sweeps east towards traditions in China. He takes in such luminaries as the physician Ge Hong, an alchemist and philosopher, whose fourth-century recipe inspired Youyou Tu’s Nobel-prizewinning discovery of artemisinin compounds to treat malaria.\n\nA representation of the three-headed dragon Mercurius, which symbolizes mercury, from around 1760.Credit: General Collection, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, Mellon MS 110, fo.3595\nArt takes centre stage\n\nBringing us into a colourful, lively world of art, poetry and prose, Ball also steps into alchemy’s offshoots. Iatrochemistry — the idea in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that chemical substances from metals, plants and animals could treat ailments — later gave way to medicine. And Ball discusses alchemy’s influence on the English language. In his 1755 English dictionary, Samuel Johnson attributed the origin of the word gibberish to the coded writings of the Islamic alchemical corpus attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (also known as Geber in a Latinized version of his name).",

It also discusses progress towards various positive tipping points focused on social and economic change, such as the adoption of clean energy.\n\nThe group’s first such assessment, released less than two years ago, raised alarms but did not officially declare that any climate tipping points had been reached. In the past few years, however, global temperatures have surged, sparking concerns among some scientists that global warming is accelerating and could lead to even more widespread impacts in the coming decades than the changes that have already been recorded.\n\nAustralia’s Great Barrier Reef is ‘transforming’ because of repeated coral bleaching\n\nThe impact on coral reefs has been particularly severe in the past two years , pushing these ecosystems to their tipping point, the researchers say. The warming waters have caused corals across the globe to bleach, a process that occurs when the organisms expel the symbiotic algae that provide them with nutrients, oxygen and vibrant colours. The fourth global bleaching event in the past few decades began in January 2023, and researchers estimate that it has affected more than 84% of the planet’s coral ecosystems.\n\nThe initial tipping-point report talked about large-scale threats to corals in the future tense, but the latest global bleaching event has made it clear that the crisis is now, says Michael Studivan, a coral ecologist at the University of Miami in Florida.",

Credit: Anatomical Travelogue/SPL\n\nDuring ageing, men experience a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women do, according to a longitudinal study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1. The authors suggest this means that age-related brain changes do not explain why women are more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease than men are.\n\n“It’s really important that we understand what happens in the healthy brain so that we can better understand what happens when people get these neurodegenerative conditions,” says Fiona Kumfor, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Sydney, Australia. This study adds to scientists’ understanding of typical brain ageing, she adds.\n\nNearly twice as many women are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease as men, and ageing is the biggest risk factor for the disease. This has prompted research into age-related sex differences in the brain. “If women’s brains declined more, that could have helped explain their higher Alzheimer’s prevalence,” says co-author Anne Ravndal, a PhD student at the University of Oslo.\n\nPrevious research investigating sex differences in brain ageing has shown mixed results, Ravndal adds. Several studies have found that men experience greater loss of total grey matter and hippocampus size compared with women, whereas other work has reported a sharper decline of grey matter in women.\n\nBrain scans\n\nThe latest study included more than 12,500 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans from 4,726 people — at least two scans per person, taken an average of three years apart — who did not have Alzheimer’s disease or any cognitive impairments and were control participants in 14 larger data sets. The researchers compared how the individuals’ brain structures changed over time, looking at factors including the thickness of grey matter and the size of areas that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as the hippocampus, which is essential to memory.\n\nOverall, men experienced a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women did. For example, the postcentral cortex, which is responsible for processing sensations of touch, pain and temperature, as well as the body’s own position and movements, declined by 2.0% per year in men and by 1.2% annually in women.\n\nKumfor says the results suggest that men age faster than women do. Men also have a shorter life expectancy.\n\nIf these changes did have a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, the study would have shown that women experience a greater decline in areas associated with the disease, such as the hippocampus and precuneus, which are involved in memory, says Amy Brodtmann, a clinician researcher in cognitive health at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nRavndal says the results point to other possible explanations for the sex differences in prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease, such as differences in survival or susceptibility to the disease.",

          "authors": "Philip Ball",
          "abstract": "The 2025 Sveriges Riksbank Prize for Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has been awarded to three researchers who have shown how technological and scientific innovation, coupled to market competition, drive economic growth.\n\nOne half of the prize goes to Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The other half is split between the economic theorists Philippe Aghion at the Collège de France in Paris and the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Peter Howitt at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n“I can’t find the words to express what I feel,” Aghion told the press conference. He added that he will use the money for research in his laboratory at the Collège de France.\n\nThe award “underlies the importance in investing in science for innovation and long-term economic growth”, says economist Diane Coyle at the University of Cambridge, UK. “It’s great to see the Nobel prize recognize the importance of this topic,” adds Richard Jones, an innovation-policy researcher at the University of Manchester, UK. “It's important that economists understand the conditions that lead to technological progress,” he adds. The winners, says Coyle, “have long been on people’s list of potential candidates”.\n\nOld isn’t gold\n\nEconomic growth at a rate of 1–2% annually is the norm for industrialized nations today. But such growth rates did not happen in pre-industrial times, despite technological innovations such as the windmill and the printing press.\n\nMokyr showed that the key difference between now and then was what he calls “useful knowledge”, or innovations based on scientific understanding1. One example is the advances during the Industrial Revolution, beginning in the eighteenth century, when improvements in steam engines could be made systematically rather than by trial and error.\n\nAghion and Howitt, for their part, clarified the market mechanisms behind sustained growth. In 1992, they presented a model showing how competition between companies selling new products allows innovations to enter the marketplace and displaces older products: a process they called creative destruction2.\n\nUnderlying growth, in other words, is a steady churn of businesses and products. The researchers showed how companies invest in research and development (R&D) to improve their chances of finding a new product, and predicted the optimal level of such investment.\n\nEntrepreneurial state\n\nAccording to Ufuk Akcigit, an economist at the University of Chicago in Illinois, Aghion and Howitt highlight an important aspect of economic growth, which is that spending on R&D does not by itself guarantee higher rates of growth: “Unless we replace inefficient firms from the economy, we cannot make space for newcomers with new ideas and better technologies.”\n\n“When a new entrepreneur emerges, they have every incentive to come up with a radical new technology,” Akcigit says. “As soon as they become an incumbent, their incentive vanishes” and they no longer invest in R&D to drive innovation.\n\nThus, because companies cannot expect to remain at the forefront of innovation indefinitely, the incentive for investing in R&D coming from market forces alone declines as a company’s market share grows. To guarantee the societal benefits of constant innovation, the model suggests that it is in society’s interests for the state to subsidize R&D, so long as the return is not merely incremental improvements.\n\nThe work of all three laureates also acknowledges the complex social consequences of growth. In the early days of the Industrial Revolution, there were concerns about how mechanization would cause unemployment among manual workers — a worry echoed today with the increasing use of AI in place of human labour. But Mokyr showed that, in fact, early mechanization led to the creation of jobs.\n\nCreative destruction, meanwhile, leads to companies failing and jobs being lost. Aghion and Howitt emphasized that society needs safety nets and constructive negotiation of conflicts to navigate such problems.\n\nTheir model “recognizes the messiness and complexity of how innovation happens in real economies”, says Coyle. “The idea that a country’s productivity level increases by companies going bust and new ones coming in is a difficult sell, but the evidence that that’s part of the mechanism is pretty strong.”",

          "authors": "Fred Schwaller",
          "abstract": "The World Health Summit heard calls for low- and middle-income countries to take control of their health spending.Credit: World Health Summit\n\nWho will pay for global health? Scientists and policy leaders explored this question when they met this week at the World Health Summit in Berlin. The reason: a steep and consistent fall, beginning in 2021, in international funding for health services in low- and middle-income countries (see ‘Failing health’).\n\nThe United States has made the deepest cuts, of about US$9 billion, after the start of the year, when the administration of US President Donald Trump slashed funding to the US Agency for International Development. One estimate found that, by 2030, these cuts could lead to 14 million deaths globally1. The United States has also pulled out of the World Health Organization (WHO), withdrawing funding that represented around one-fifth of the $6.7-billion programme budget in 2022–23. France, Germany and the United Kingdom are also scaling back, according to data published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, based at the University of Washington School of Medicine.\n\nSource: IHME\n\n“In Jordan, we lost lives immediately when health care in hospitals stopped abruptly,” says Haitham Bashier, director of the Public Health Emergency Management Centre in Amman. At the Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network, a regional public-health organization in Jordan, “60% of our funding for health projects came from US-based funds. Now it’s gone,” Bashier told Nature at the summit.\n\nHowever, Bashier also said the cuts are “a rare opportunity to reimagine how the global-health ecosystem functions”. “We’ve been implementing an agenda imposed onto us by somebody else. We mustn’t repeat the old US-donor system,” he says.\n\nTake control\n\nNotwithstanding the cuts, this year, high-income countries spent nearly 300 times more on development assistance for health than low-income countries spent on their own health systems. The consensus among health leaders attending the summit is that these countries should now take control of their own health costs.\n\n“The global south has failed in the last 25 years to finance our own primary health-care systems,” says Joy Phumaphi, executive secretary of African Leaders Malaria Alliance in Tanzania. “This was a serious act of negligence. But we have the capacity to reclaim this space and develop our own capabilities and institutions for our own health systems. We are beholden to make these government investments,” she adds.\n\nJohn-Arne Røttingen, chief executive of Wellcome, the health-research charity in London, agrees it’s time for a rethink. “The fact is that countries have been establishing health care that follows the plans of external financing,” he says. “A country like Malawi has something like 50 different health plans all catering to different scopes of the international system.”\n\n“In a partnership on equal footing, one side cannot decide to reduce a previously agreed contribution by 25% or 50%,” says Gorik Ooms, a health-policy researcher at the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp in Belgium. That’s why “a cooperation agreed between partners on equal footing should be more reliable than a donor–recipient relationship”.\n\nWho will fill the gaps?\n\nOne big question is where funding will come from to fill the gaps left by the United States and European countries, and whether new funders will bring new demands. Philanthropic donors such as Wellcome and the Gates Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, are not filling gaps left by US and European governments.\n\nIn May, China committed $500 million to the WHO after the United States withdrew from the agency. However, some researchers don’t think that China will step up further. “Those are not gaps China has ever aspired to fill,” says Karen Grépin, a health-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nChina’s strategy is different from that of Western donors, Grépin says. “It’s more likely to provide aid linked to infrastructure investments,” she adds. But as other donors scale back, “I do see China becoming an even more influential partner to countries around the world in terms of global health”.\n\nWhat next for the WHO?\n\nDelegates at the summit also discussed the future role of the WHO as it restructures following US funding cuts. One proposal was that the WHO could facilitate health-care programmes but leave more of the health-care delivery to national governments. Along with other international organizations, it could also coordinate research and development (R&D), health-data sharing and the creation of technologies such as digital health and artificial intelligence. Røttingen told Nature this might mean that “funders now need to relinquish some of their powers to national governments and align with their national plans and priorities”.\n\nRøttingen adds that international organizations can do better to support global collaboration in the logistics of rolling out new health technologies. “The major improvements in child health and life expectancies have been driven by new technologies and their scale up. In a world with fewer resources, we need to get more efficient at delivering those potentials.”",

The species is defined by a robust jaw with large molar teeth, a flat face with broad cheek bones and, in some cases, pronounced bony ridges on the skull that would have enabled the attachment of powerful chewing muscles1−3. These features, together with chemical signatures found in dental analyses, suggest that P. boisei had a specialized diet of tough-to-process foods, such as grasses and sedge plants, that smaller-toothed hominins might not have been able to eat4.

          "title": "Faulty mitochondria cause deadly diseases: fixing them is about to get a lot easier",
          "authors": "Gemma Conroy",
          "abstract": "CRISPR gene editing has made its way into every corner of modern biology, but not into every corner of the cell. Although researchers have used these systems to develop treatments for sickle-cell anaemia and blood cancers, to unlock the secrets of multicellularity and to discover the role of thousands of overlooked proteins, there’s one place CRISPR can’t easily reach: mitochondria.\n\nCancer cells get power boost by stealing mitochondria from nerves\n\nThe rings of DNA inside mitochondria are inaccessible to these techniques, which means that precise edits to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) remain frustratingly out of reach. “Mitochondria missed the CRISPR–Cas9 revolution that exploded 12 years ago,” says Michal Minczuk, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nBut researchers are eager to access this DNA, says Minczuk. Mitochondria are bean-shaped organelles that power cells and have myriad other cellular tasks. Exploring their DNA is essential for understanding the energy production and exchange that underlies metabolic health. And more than 300 mutations in this DNA cause mitochondrial diseases — incurable genetic disorders with a wide range of symptoms that can rob people of their sight and hearing, trigger muscle problems and spark seizures1. These disorders affect roughly 1 in 5,000 people.\n\nBecause CRISPR can’t help with these problems, researchers have been looking for other ways to precisely edit the mitochrondrial genome. And the past few years have brought some success: the tools are already proving to be a boon for creating accurate animal models of mitochondrial diseases. “The progress has been remarkable,” says Jin-Soo Kim, a chemical biologist who develops mtDNA editing tools at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea.\n\nIf researchers can make mtDNA editing safe and accurate enough, it could eventually be used to treat, and even cure, these genetic conditions. “It would be a medical breakthrough,” says Kim.\n\nA bacterial origin\n\nThe exact origins of mitochondria are murky, but the leading theory holds that the organelle’s story started around 1.5 billion years ago when a single-celled microorganism called an archaeon gobbled up a roaming bacterium that survived inside its host. This event marked the beginning of the eukaryotes — the large group of organisms, including plants, animals and fungi, in which cells contain organelles that are enclosed inside membranes. The swallowed bacterium retained its characteristic circular DNA as it settled into its new home, but over time it sacrificed most of its genes to the nuclear genome of its host.\n\nIn the evolutionary lineage that gave rise to humans and other animals, this genetic transfer whittled the resident bacterium’s genome down to just 37 genes that code for 13 proteins involved in energy production, turning it into a specialized organelle.\n\nMitochondria expel tainted DNA — spurring age-related inflammation\n\nThe small amount of mitochondrial DNA that stuck around in animals differs in key ways from nuclear DNA, which in humans encodes around 20,000 genes. For a start, mtDNA is typically inherited solely from the mother. There can be several copies of mtDNA in each mitochondrion, and the organelle has its own built-in machinery for making RNA and proteins from that DNA.\n\nMitochondrial DNA is also much more error-prone, with a mutation rate estimated to be 10–20 times greater than that of nuclear DNA. This is in part because it has to contend with a barrage of damaging reactive oxygen species — unstable molecules that are generated in mitochondria during normal energy production. But it’s also because it doesn’t have histones: the proteins that protect and package nuclear DNA.\n\nCompared with its counterpart in the nucleus, mtDNA’s toolkit for repairing itself is rudimentary. The nucleus is quick to fix a snapped DNA strand using an arsenal of repair mechanisms, but mitochondria can mend only some defects. They often simply throw away their broken DNA. This difference limits the options for gene-editing tools, because nearly all such tools for nuclear DNA use its inherent repair pathways.\n\nIt has been notoriously challenging to develop approaches for modifying mitochondrial DNA, says Stephen Ekker, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas at Austin. “Its bacterial origins are revealed when you start trying to edit it,” he says.\n\nThe most crucial hurdle for scientists trying to tinker with the mitochondrial genome is that it is locked behind a wall of membranes that doesn’t allow external nucleic acids to pass into the organelle. Although there have been hints that CRISPR-based gene-editing tools — which rely on RNA to guide them to the correct sequence — might be able to overcome these barriers, many researchers remain unconvinced.\n\nSnip and trash\n\nStill, there are other ways in. More than a decade before CRISPR became a research tool, mitochondria researchers began experimenting with other editing tools that could cross mitochondrial membranes and coax the organelles into ditching their problematic DNA2.\n\nEvery cell contains a vast number of mitochondrial genomes, because cells contain thousands of mitochondria and each one can carry several copies of mtDNA. Healthy and mutated mtDNA often coexist: a state known as heteroplasmy. It’s when the proportion of mutated mtDNA reaches 60–80% in a particular tissue or cell type that mitochondrial diseases manifest3.\n\nCells are swapping their mitochondria. What does this mean for our health?\n\nIf researchers could reduce the faulty copies of mtDNA in cells, they could eliminate the resulting disease. So, they turned to enzymes called zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to snip the double-stranded mtDNA. Whereas targeted snipping of nuclear DNA cajoles the cut DNA strands to glue themselves back together without the harmful mutation, the cut DNA in mitochondria is simply cast out. This elimination triggers the remaining intact copies to replicate themselves so that the correct level of mtDNA is maintained.\n\nIn most cases, the mutated copies will be reduced to an acceptable level as the normal copies are replicated. “That’s going to make up for what you’re destroying,” says Carlos Moraes, a geneticist at the University of Miami in Florida.\n\nAlthough there has been progress with this approach, it hasn’t made its way out of the laboratory. And even if it did reach the clinic, the technique would be powerless against diseases caused by mutations that are often present in all copies of a person’s mtDNA, such as Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare condition that causes rapid vision loss.\n\nWhat researchers need are tools that do more than cut DNA but that don’t rely on guide RNA.\n\nCRISPR-free base editing\n\nWhen CRISPR–Cas9 emerged as a tool in 2012, it became the go-to gene editor for all kinds of application. A guide RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence, where the enzyme does the cutting. Genetic changes are introduced as the DNA repairs itself.\n\nThe approach became even more useful in 2016, when David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his colleagues introduced a more precise technique called base editing4. In this case, researchers modify the Cas9 enzyme and rely on another enzyme, called a deaminase, to convert one DNA base letter to another — such as cytosine (C) to thymine (T) or adenine (A) to guanine (G).\n\nHope, despair and CRISPR — the race to save one woman’s life\n\nAlthough base editing and other CRISPR techniques took off for nuclear DNA, Liu and other research teams couldn’t get it working on mtDNA. Because CRISPR’s guide RNA doesn’t readily pass through a mitochondrion’s double membrane, using precise tools on mtDNA remained a pipe dream. “We did not have much success,” says Liu.\n\nA solution materialized in 2018 when Joseph Mougous, a microbiologist then at the University of Washington in Seattle, and his colleagues stumbled across a toxin made by the bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia. This enzyme, a deadly weapon against other bacteria, wreaks havoc by ultimately converting base C to T across the bacterial genome5.\n\nMougous, now based at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, e-mailed Liu asking whether the enzyme, called DddA, would be of any use to him. “I knew exactly what it might be used for — base editing mtDNA!” says Liu.\n\nBut switching every C to a T would be lethal to cells. Liu and his colleagues set out to “tame the beast”. They split DddA into two inactive pieces so that the enzyme would do its handiwork on mtDNA only when the pieces were brought together in a particular orientation. And instead of using guide RNA, Liu and his colleagues modified proteins found in TALENs to direct the DddA segments to their target sequences (see ‘Making the edit’).",

          "title": "Digital flocks, predators allow ecologists to simulate real-world animal behaviour",
          "authors": "Heather Richardson",
          "abstract": "On arriving at work one day last October, ecologist Koen de Koning did what he often does first thing in the morning: he fired up the Crane Radar. The interactive web application showed a flock of cranes heading his way. Excitedly, he dashed outside, looked up and, sure enough, 60 or so birds flew past on their migration route south.\n\nThe Crane Radar is a digital twin — a virtual representation of a real-world entity and a relatively new technology in ecology (see go.nature.com/46rbkg4). “I’ve definitely seen more of the migration because of the radar. And I’m learning more about the migration patterns as well,” says De Koning, who works at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands and is a keen birder.\n\nIn fields such as manufacturing, infrastructure and health care, the technology has been used to model objects from electronics components to UK hospital wards and even the nation of Singapore.\n\nHow a vast digital twin of the Yangtze River could prevent flooding in China\n\nTheir purposes vary. Digital twins can make life easier for individual users — Google Maps, for example, is continuously updated to help drivers to navigate traffic. Other programs can predict the effects of climate change on cities, plan architecture or simulate surgical procedures. HeartNavigator, a software package from the Dutch health-technology firm Philips, can be used to plan heart operations such as valve replacements, simulating surgery using various models and sizes of valve to find the best fit for a patient.\n\nNASA used what is often considered the first digital twin (then called a living model) in 1970 to work out why an oxygen tank exploded on the Apollo 13 lunar mission and to bring the astronauts home safely. The agency’s principal technologist, John Vickers, coined the term digital twin in 2010, a few years after US systems engineer Michael Grieves formalized the concept in a presentation to the manufacturing industry when he was co-director of the Project Lifecycle Management Development Consortium at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nOver the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the development of digital twins across a range of fields. This is mostly because of the increasing availability of data, the prevalence of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. The global digital-twin market is forecast to grow by more than sevenfold over the next 5 years, according to one report — from US$21 billion this year to $150 billion in 2030 (see go.nature.com/4nctfu2). The fastest growth is anticipated in health care, the report says, owing to the technology’s potential for reducing errors and improving diagnoses and surgical outcomes.\n\nFor ecologists, digital twins present unique opportunities. But there are limitations that need to be addressed, from ensuring adequate data access to sustainable funding.\n\nEcological digital twins\n\nDigital twins can be particularly useful for studying systems that are changing outside historical norms, says Anna Davison, who is researching digital twins in ecology at Wageningen University & Research. That includes how ecosystems react to anthropogenic climate change. So it’s perhaps no surprise that ecologists are increasingly using digital twins to tackle gaps in biodiversity research brought about by ecosystem complexities, ponderous government action and a lack of real-time monitoring.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Crane Radar is one of four digital twins developed by Wageningen University & Research as part of a €300,000 (US$352,000) project funded by the European Union, called Nature FIRST. It forecasts the migration of common cranes (Grus grus) across the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, northern France and northwestern Germany, helping birdwatchers and ecologists to locate the flocks as they traverse the region.\n\nDe Koning says he chose crane migration as the focus of his first digital twin because of the abundance of data and because it is a relatively simple process to model. He also had a personal motivation: “I was always in the wrong location or at the wrong place at the time” to see the cranes, De Koning jokes. “This model really helped me, personally, to see them more often.”\n\nSims-style ‘digital twin’ models can tell us if food systems will weather crises\n\nTo build a digital twin, scientists first need to collect the relevant data for the real-world entity, whether that be real-time data from IoT devices or historical records. Then they must develop algorithms to mimic the behaviour of the physical twin and test the model — for example, by fitting historical data sets to recent ones — before applying the trained model to real-time data.\n\nCreated over the course of about a year and costing roughly €15,000–20,000, the Crane Radar uses migration data (sourced from Movebank, an online animal-tracking database), real-time sightings by birdwatchers and factors such as wind speed and direction of flight to estimate where the birds will be within the next four hours (K. De Koning Ecol. Inform. 85, 102938; 2025).\n\nWageningen researchers partnered with Sensing Clues, a conservation technology non-profit organization in Amsterdam, to transform their models into platforms that can be easily accessed and understood by end users — members of the public, policymakers and other researchers.\n\nBirdwatchers can also log sightings (including the location, time, direction of flight and number of cranes) through Observation.org, a citizen-science platform for biodiversity. The crane digital twin updates every minute; the website has a slight lag, updating every five minutes with a four-hour forecast for each sighting.\n\nThe Crane Radar has been well received by Dutch birders. It receives an average of 100,000 daily visits during peak migration season in late October and early November, dipping down to 1,000 on quieter days. After it was featured by Dutch national news, however, more than 300,000 users engaged with the app each day over the subsequent weekend, De Koning says.\n\n“It’s a really nice, completely closed loop where the end user is also the data provider,” says Davison, who has developed a digital twin for the migration of Beluga sturgeon (Huso huso) in the Danube River delta.\n\nModelling ecosystems\n\nA more complex digital twin is being built to mirror ecosystems in Doñana National Park in southern Spain.\n\n“The park is a key essential biodiversity area in Europe – however, it is threatened by multiple human activities,” says Maria Paniw, a researcher at Doñana Biological Station in Seville. Threats include overexploitation of water, agricultural development outside the park, tourism and climate change. “We wanted to understand how all these different factors affect the ecosystem in a real-time complex setting, not through simple approximations based on single species that we typically do in ecology.”\n\nThe first effort by Paniw’s team models interactions between vegetation, rabbits and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), a ‘keystone species’ in the park. Its conservation status has recently improved — it moved from endangered to vulnerable status last year, thanks to efforts to boost its numbers, including protection of habitat and translocations of the animals to expand its genetic diversity.\n\nResearchers set up digital-twin experiments in Spain’s Doñana National Park.Credit: Hanna Serediuk/Doñana Biological Station (EBD-CSIC)\n\nAlongside a detailed database of lynx reproduction statistics and movements (all reintroduced lynx have GPS tracking collars) and rabbit data from hunting organizations and other national parks, the researchers use a metric called the normalized difference vegetation index. This measures the verdancy of landscapes and is constantly updated using satellite imagery to assess changes in plant density and health. The aim is to show how rabbits respond to changes in vegetation and weather, and how lynx, in turn, respond to changes in rabbit abundance. The findings will inform where lynx can be best reintroduced into the environment and where they might move from those release sites.\n\n“We basically started with part of the system that has the most data and the most urgent need to get something done,” explains Paniw. She hopes that this approach will convince park managers of the usefulness of digital twins before they build more complex models. “They need to see value in this.”\n\nOther researchers have built digital twins of river systems across Europe, Africa and Asia. A digital twin of the River Stiffkey in southeastern England was built by regional water company Anglian Water and partners including Microsoft and the University of Suffolk, UK. The aim is to model strategies to improve the health and biodiversity of the chalk-stream habitat — a rare type that is threatened by warming water and pollution. Digital twins of the Yangtze River in China and parts of the River Douro in Portugal are also in development, along with three twins of rivers in Kenya.\n\nRivers are “a rich environment for demonstrating the viability of these models,” explains computer scientist Lawrence Nderu, chair of the Department of Computing at Kenya’s Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology near Nairobi. “They are very dynamic.”\n\nNderu is developing a twin of the Mara River basin in Narok County, southwestern Kenya, as part of a collaboration between his university and the Slovenian space technology organization Space-SI in Ljubljana, which builds applications to acquire satellite data.\n\nThe Narok area is hit with periodic severe flooding that can be life-threatening. Nderu’s team is designing its digital twin to alert communities and authorities to predicted flooding events, integrating data from weather stations, soil sensors and satellites, together with information about the river system and surrounding landscape. That should allow vulnerable populations to plan ahead, he says. Nomadic herders, for example, can move their cattle to higher ground.\n\n“Otherwise, we will always be talking about what should have been done, which is always a very costly conversation,” Nderu adds.\n\nTwin challenges\n\nThat reliance on up-to-the-minute data, however, reveals a key challenge for digital twins: having sensors in the field is one thing, but they need to be connected to the Internet for the data to be useful. Data quality can be an issue, too – De Koning says citizen observations of cranes, for example, often include inaccurate time stamps, locations or identification, which can muddle the resulting models.\n\nFor Nderu, there is also the issue of data storage. His digital twins require volumes of data — including about 2.5 terabytes of compressed video files per year — that can be costly to store in the cloud in Kenya (he estimates about US$800 annually). “We are trying to approach [cloud] companies like AWS to provide us with that,” he says.\n\nDe Koning says that because digital twins are so new, people are often unaware of their potential. Scientists need to first explain possible outcomes before users can express how a digital twin could be helpful to them.\n\nThe Internet of Things comes to the lab\n\nAlso a challenge, Paniw and Davison say, is sustainability — specifically, balancing the short-term nature of research funding with the length of time it takes to build a digital twin and the cost of maintaining it.",

That means I’ve now spent four years in the doctoral programme and am exactly 365 days away from professional disgrace and having my credentials quietly revoked in a humiliating end-of-cycle formality they call ‘declassification’. It’s not a euphemism. If I don’t find a new insect species by this time next year, I don’t get a PhD. I get a polite ejection from the Galactic Consortium of Insect Scientists (GCIS) and maybe a commemorative keychain.\n\nThe GCIS — venerable, bureaucratic and with all the warmth of cryogenic fog — was very clear in our orientation: discovery must occur within four to five Earth-standard years. No ifs, no bugs, no degree. It’s all written in some charter older than half the member planets, filled with flowery declarations about scientific value and intersystemal knowledge equity. The charter calls it a time-bound discovery mandate. I call it the Bug Rule.\n\nBack when I applied, I thought, please, how hard can it be? Insects make up 93% of documented animal life in the habitable Universe. They evolve faster than rumours, hitch rides on cargo freighters and colonize anything that’s even vaguely damp and not currently on fire. I assumed I’d stub my toe on a new species just walking to the dorm kitchen.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nInstead, I’ve become the department’s leading authority on not finding things. My thesis so far: Things That Weren’t New Insects, Volume 3.\n\nMy catalogue includes a long list of things that weren’t new insects: larval Terran micro beetles in borrowed shells; a ‘glider fly’ that turned out to be corrupted sensor feedback; and my personal favourite, a Martian ash-louse misidentified by a colleague as a nova-strain. The GCIS slapped them with a two-year publication ban and repossessed their lab footwear — they now study fungal drift on Europa. Barefoot. Metaphorically, but still.\n\nThe consortium used to care about taxonomy for taxonomy’s sake. Now it’s all triage and panic. With ecological systems collapsing across six planets and protein shortages spiralling, any insect with metabolic flexibility might save a biosphere, or at least feed a few billion desperate people. They don’t care if it’s beautiful or horrifying. If it breeds in pressure-variable conditions and doesn’t murder the host species? Into the database it goes.\n\nBut the requirements remain annoyingly intact. The insect must be isolated, fully sequenced, confirmed independently by two peer reviewers who aren’t legally dead, and are, of course, sentient-neutral. That last clause destroyed my best lead: a hive-minded crustwing from Proxima Centauri b that could mimic human speech. The GCIS deemed it a “biolinguistic contamination vector” and had it flash-incinerated. I still hear it humming in my dreams.\n\nSome nights I wake up with the taste of copper in my mouth and the faint impression I’ve just signed a contract.\n\nAnyway.\n\nHere’s my current situation. Still on Belt Station Agastya Theta, stationed on Deck 12, the biowaste reprocessing ring. It handles gut fauna from 63 livestock species and turns them into protein gel. The air smells like sanitized dung and melted ozone seals. But I’ve found a vent behind the centrifugal filter unit that isn’t in the schematics. Perfect heat signature. Subtle airflow. Unregistered by maintenance bots. Something lives in there.\n\nI’ve seen it. Not clearly, but enough. A flicker in still air. Once, a fragment of wing. Translucent, vibrating faintly, like it was humming in a frequency I couldn’t hear.\n\nEvery day for the past fortnight, I’ve left bait outside the crevice. Synthfruit rind, pheromone droplets, even powdered Terran wasp resin. Something takes it. Not all at once. Not messily. Deliberately. With intent.\n\nI’ve named it the Ghost Ant. Not because it looks like an ant. I still haven’t seen the body. I just like the drama. Better than Provisional Record KX-5/Delta or Biological Trace Entity 19a-Rho.\n\nMy adviser, Dr Juno, thinks I’m hallucinating under deadline pressure. She calls my current progress “theoretical optimism” and has suggested I pivot to fungal symbiosis, which, in academic terms, is the equivalent of being told to go swab mould and reflect on my choices. The implication wasn’t subtle.\n\nStill, I check the vent each morning. I don’t scan. That could spook it. I just crouch beside the unit, hold my breath, and look for changes. Yesterday, I found a shard of exoshell. About the size of a thumbnail, folded over itself five times, shimmering like compressed oil film.\n\nI haven’t reported it to the GCIS.\n\nNot because I’m trying to hoard glory. I just need to be sure. I need to know it’s mine. The last doctoral candidate who submitted too early had their discovery reassigned to a senior researcher who had “guided their thinking”. That student now teaches Introduction to Bioforms on a Class-2 moon school for children with partial language cortices.\n\nI want more than that.\n\nI want to name something no one else has seen. I want the Ghost Ant to be the insect that justifies this past exhausting year.",

          "abstract": "A type of brain cell called astrocytes play a crucial role in stabilizing memories in the brain.Credit: Jose Calvo/SPL\n\nWhy are we able to remember emotional events so well? According to a study published today in Nature1, a type of cell in the brain called an astrocyte is a key player in stabilizing memories for long-term recall.\n\nAstrocytes were thought to simply support neurons in creating the physical traces of memories in the brain, but the study found that they have a much more active role — and can even be directly triggered by repeated emotional experiences. The researchers behind the finding suggest that the cells could be a fresh target for treating memory conditions such as those associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“We provide an answer to the question of how a specific memory is stored for the long term,” says study co-author Jun Nagai, a neuroscientist at RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Wako, Japan. By studying astrocytes, Nagai said, the study identifies how the brain selectively filters important memories at the cellular level.\n\nStable memories\n\nNagai and his colleagues focused on the question of memory stabilization: how a short-term memory becomes more permanent in the brain. Previous research had found physical traces of memories in neuronal networks in brain regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala2. But it was unclear how these ‘engrams’ were stored in the brain as lasting memories after repeated exposure to the same stimulus.\n\nTo dig deeper, the researchers developed a method for measuring activation patterns in astrocytes across a whole brain of a mouse as it completes a memory task. They measured the upregulation of a gene called Fos — an early marker of cell activity that is associated with the physical traces of memories in the brain3.\n\nIn a well-established fear-conditioning memory task, mice learnt to associate a certain cage with unpleasant shocks to their feet while the researchers tracked the level of Fos in their brains. Days later, the animals would re-enter the cage and recall the unpleasant sensation. The researchers observed strong Fos upregulation in astrocytes in the animals’ amygdalas and other brain regions when mice re-entered the cage, but not during the initial learning phase, suggesting that astrocyte activity was more important for recalling past events than creating new memories.\n\n“The surprise was that astrocytes did not respond to the fear experience the first time, only the second time,” says Nagai.\n\nBrain stimulation leads to long-lasting improvements in memory",

          "title": "Metals are key to the global economy — but three challenges threaten supply chains",
          "authors": "Tarasankar DebRoy, Todd A. Palmer, John W. Elmer, Tuhin Mukherjee",
          "abstract": "Metals are at the heart of the global economy, from power generation and storage to transport. But their supply chains face three interlinked challenges: dwindling reserves, rising demand and high greenhouse-gas emissions1–3.\n\nAt the current rates of extraction and use, the known reserves of some metals, including copper, nickel and chromium, will only last for the next few decades1,2. And these rates do not take into account rising demand as the world’s population grows and new technologies emerge3 (see ‘Three-part problem’).\n\nFurthermore, the mining and extraction of most metals, as well as their melting, refining, alloying, casting and shaping, are a large source of greenhouse gases. Steelmaking alone accounts for about 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions, or 3.6 billion tonnes3 — more than three times what the aviation sector contributes.\n\nThere are currently no concrete, commonly accepted long-term solutions or implementation plans. Here, based on our expertise in materials science and engineering, we outline a set of five strategies that, together, can address the challenges. The solutions that societies choose will have wide-reaching consequences for our ways of life, economy and the well-being of our planet and future generations.\n\nSources: Reserves: ref. 1; In demand: ref. 2; Emissions: World Steel in Figures 2024 and Sustainability Indicators 2024 reports (World Steel Association)\nSwap materials\n\nA small tweak in a material’s chemical composition can go a long way in reducing the amount of metals used. Take steel, for example. About one billion tonnes of carbon–manganese steel are used each year globally for buildings and other infrastructure. However, using another type of steel — which has almost the same amounts of carbon, manganese and silicon, but also contains tiny amounts of niobium (about 0.03% in weight) — increases the material’s strength and toughness4. Niobium-microalloyed steel is slightly more expensive than conventional steel. But because it is stronger, less material is required4,5, lowering the total cost of a building. Reducing steel consumption can also reduce CO2 emissions4,5 by some 20%.\n\nAir taxis will soon be in our skies — if batteries can be made safer\n\nResearchers are investigating other substitutions, too. For example, rare-earth magnets, which require elements such as dysprosium or terbium, could be replaced with less environmentally damaging ones based on iron nitride6. And sodium-ion batteries7 could replace lithium-ion ones to circumvent lithium’s global supply limitations, high extraction costs and the environmental damage it causes during extraction. Scientists are also studying thermal batteries that store energy as heat rather than as electricity and that are made from materials such as cement and crushed rock.\n\nTo accelerate the adoption of materials with lower carbon footprints, governments should update policies and regulations. Governments and industry can also create certification schemes that reward low-emission material choices, helping designers, engineers and consumers to make informed decisions. And universities should include substitution principles in engineering and materials education, to train a workforce to select materials that have a minimal environmental impact, not just high performance.\n\nAcademia and industry must work together closely, through industry-funded fellowships, joint research programmes and institutions such as the US Engineering Research Centers, which are supported by the National Science Foundation.\n\nAdopt green technologies\n\nThe metal-production industry urgently needs to reduce its environmental impact. Aluminium production, for example, is responsible for around 270 million tonnes of CO2 a year (one-tenth that of steel). It also releases toxic fluorine-containing species, which are powerful greenhouse gases. And copper smelting releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide, contributing to acid rain.\n\nGreen manufacturing technologies that lower emissions are needed. Many exist already. For instance, a top gas recycling blast furnace that reuses carbon dioxide from the ironmaking process can reduce emissions substantially8. Other harmful by-products can also be upcycled. In copper smelting, for example, sulfur dioxide can be converted into usable compounds, such as sulfuric acid.\n\nBattery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?\n\nInnovations in hydrometallurgy and bioleaching9 that use microorganisms to break down the minerals in ores and release pure metals are revolutionizing extraction. They can take nickel, copper and gold from ores with low concentrations of these elements and avoid energy-intensive smelting procedures, enabling metal extraction from sources that were previously too expensive to mine or dismissed as unusable, such as by-products of mining and other industrial processes and electronic waste.\n\nHowever, in practice, many of these advanced technologies are not being adopted because of their cost. Governments must help businesses and individuals through policies or incentives, such as low-interest loans, investment grants and carbon pricing mechanisms. Solar energy promotion shows how government incentives can accelerate adoption despite high upfront costs. The US Investment Tax Credit and state-level programmes can offer subsidies, zero-interest loans and community solar-energy support.\n\nGo circular\n\nAnother way to lower metal consumption is to improve the durability, repairability and recyclability of metal-containing products. Companies should design long-lasting products and offer end-of-life recycling. Several corporations, including technology giants Apple and Dell, have adopted circular practices through certified refurbishment programmes.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nGovernments must support these efforts by overseeing recycling data, enforcing disclosure requirements and setting up recycling and waste-management incentives10. The European Union has embraced this approach. For example, its Circular Economy Action Plan and its Ecodesign directive mandate standards for the durability and repairability of products. International organizations should standardize practices and environmental agencies or independent bodies must monitor compliance and progress. The International Organization for Standardization has issued standards on ecodesign and design for disassembly. The United Nations Environment Programme’s International Resource Panel and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provide guidance for sustainable material flows11.\n\nAccelerating metal recycling must also be a top priority. Steel, aluminium and copper are already recycled widely, but urgent improvements are needed for others, such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and rare-earth elements. Advanced sorting methods and urban mining programmes12 that can recover valuable metals from electronic waste are crucial.\n\nIn 2021, for example, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry outlined the country’s transition to a circular economy. According to the nation’s economic and environmental ministries, some 15 million home appliances were collected nationwide in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nManufacturing processes can be improved, too. 3D printing, for example, reduces waste by building objects layer by layer, using only the necessary amount of raw metal powder13.\n\nBuild resilient supply chains",

          "authors": "Jack W. Baker",
          "abstract": "Jack W. Baker had to unexpectedly combat an accusation of plagiarism. It taught him something about keeping science transparent.Credit: Yuri Hobart/Stanford\n\nMore than ten years ago, my student and I were accused of misconduct. The issue was our just-published paper in a journal. Our accuser pointed to his own recent publication, which had a nearly identical scope to ours. He claimed we were aware of his previous work and had intentionally not cited it because of a lack of “scientific ethics”. He also alleged that we had abused our privilege, characterizing us as a well-known research group that deliberately ignored work from what he described as a smaller and less affluent country.\n\nThe accuser made his claim to the journal editor, and submitted a Comment article with this accusation, which he requested the journal publish as an addendum to our paper. The editor contacted us to review the accusation and offer a response, before she decided whether to publish it. She was dispassionate and didn’t indicate what outcomes she was considering. This was professionally appropriate while she was gathering information. But my student and I were in shock. As an assistant professor still building confidence in my work, I had no experience navigating an accusation of this kind.\n\nBuilding our defence\n\nWe took some time to study the accuser’s original paper, and the similarities to ours were alarming. It tackled a problem similar to ours and proposed the same set of equations to develop a solution. These equations were identical, even down to minor notational choices. This was more than a case of needing to add citations to previous related work — plagiarism seemed to be involved. No wonder the journal editor took the claim seriously.\n\nShould I tell anyone that I suspect misconduct in a paper I’m reviewing?\n\nThe two papers had been submitted to different journals a year earlier. We had submitted ours a few weeks earlier, although our accuser’s got through the review process faster. But our journal paper wasn’t our first public contribution of these ideas: we dug up two preliminary project documents from the previous few years that we’d published on our group’s website. They contained the same notation and equations, as well as similar results.\n\nThe documents were the sort of things we’d now add to a public repository or preprint server, but at the time, these were not yet in vogue in our field. Our accuser had cited other materials from our website in his original paper, but not these two documents.\n\nWe surmised that the commenter had used the work published on our website to form the basis of his own paper and then submitted it to a journal, presenting our preliminary results as his own.\n\nCrafting a response\n\nWith the evidence in hand, we replied to the journal editor to explain what we thought had happened (edited for anonymity):\n\nWe have been researching this topic for several years, culminating in the publication being discussed here. Our preliminary work has been publicly available for several years, including a project report and a conference presentation. The commenter is clearly aware of our work, as they cite seven other documents available on our website but not the specific ones described above. The above documents were announced on our website at the time of their release and have been continually available. Some of the complex notation in our early documents is identical to the commenter’s paper and our eventual paper: [details and examples listed].\n\nIt thus seems clear to us that the commenter copied the terminology, equations and figures from our preliminary work (publicly available for several years), submitted his paper, and is now trying to claim to be the original creator of ideas he copied from us. We believe that the submitted claims are not supported by facts, would only serve to confuse readers and offer no intellectual contribution. We thus suggest that the comment be rejected.\n\nThe resolution\n\nThe journal editor understood and accepted our perspective and rejected the Comment article. Our accuser never contacted us directly. I’m still unsure what he hoped would happen, and uncertain whether he anticipated that we could rebut and stop his Comment from being published. At the time, I was just happy to avoid a public accusation, and I never seriously thought about alleging misconduct to the journal that published his paper. Both papers remain available today, and I’ve never had a reader enquire about duplication of the two documents.\n\nWhat I learnt",

Credit: Anna Moneymaker/Getty\n\nUpdate: On Wednesday, US district judge Susan Illston temporarily blocked the mass lay-offs made by the Trump administration after unions representing federal workers sued. A hearing for the case is scheduled for 28 October.\n\nThe shutdown of the US government, which is about to enter its third week, is starting to take a toll on US science. Since the shutdown began, the administration of US President Donald Trump has cancelled funding for clean-energy research projects and laid off public-health workers. The activities of some federally funded museums and laboratories have been suspended, along with the processing of grant applications by agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\nFunding to run the US government expired on 1 October after members of the US Congress failed to pass a spending bill. Negotiations to end the impasse have made little progress. Lawmakers from the opposition Democratic party say that they will only pass the spending bill if it extends popular health-care subsidies, a condition that Republicans do not want to negotiate on. “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” US vice-president JD Vance said on Sunday.\n\nStaff reductions\n\nThe Trump administration said in a court filing on Friday that it will lay off 4,100–4,200 federal employees, an action officially termed a reduction in force (RIF). The Trump administration invoked the absence of a spending bill as justification for the lay-offs, which are an unprecedented measure during a shutdown. Unions representing federal workers have filed suit over the lay-offs.\n\nTrump team guts AIDS-eradication programme and slashes HIV research grants\n\nStarting on Friday night, some 1,300 staff members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received RIF notices, although the notices for 700 of them were quickly rescinded, according to Local 2883 of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing CDC employees. The lay-offs would “undermine the nation’s ability to respond to public-health emergencies”, a CDC staff member who has been affected by the lay-off said on Tuesday at a news conference organized by Local 2883.\n\nWord of lay-offs at the CDC’s influential National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sparked particular concern among epidemiologists. The programme has been collecting US health data since the early 1960s, and has helped researchers to understand crucial public-health issues such as the health effects of lead in petrol.\n\nFormer CDC staff member Asher Rosinger, who is now an epidemiologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, says CDC staffers told him that the lay-offs have decimated the NHANES planning branch, a team that he says is crucial to the operation of the programme. “This gold standard survey may no longer be able to operate in the future,” he says.\n\nDouble lay-off\n\nSome CDC employees have now been laid off twice in the span of half a year, says Isaac Michael, a mathematical statistician at the CDC. Michael and his colleagues ran a survey and database to track the experience of new mothers in the United States — until the entire team was laid off in April. Several court orders have preserved their employment status for now, although they will still not be allowed to work even when the government reopens. But some of his colleagues received a second lay-off notice in the last few days, making it unlikely they will ever be reinstated.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?\n\nIf a state experiences an increase in maternal or infant deaths, “we won’t even know there’s a problem, because we’re not collecting any reliable data, and we won’t be able to do anything to help”, Michael says.\n\nAndrew Nixon, communications director at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, said that all HHS employees receiving RIF notices were designated as non-essential by their respective divisions, and that the HHS will continue to close “wasteful and duplicative entities”.\n\nThe administration’s court filing said that the US Environmental Protection Agency would lose 20–30 people. Staff members at US Department of Energy (DoE) offices who oversee renewable energy, energy efficiency and other areas have also received RIF notcies, a DoE spokesperson said. “These offices are being realigned to reflect the Trump administration’s commitment to advancing affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people,” they said.\n\nFunding cuts\n\nCoinciding with the shutdown, the administration has also announced a fresh round of cuts to research projects, adding to the billions of dollars of federal research grants that have been revoked since Trump took office in January.\n\nOn the second day of the shutdown, the DoE announced that it was cutting almost US$7.6 billion in funding from 223 energy projects, many of which support renewable energy. An analysis by Nature found that the list includes grants for 33 academic institutions, which have a combined value of $620 million.",

          "title": "The quest to make babies with lab-grown eggs and sperm",
          "authors": "Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "Off a quiet hallway on the top floor of a building at the University of Osaka in Japan, Katsuhiko Hayashi is hatching a revolution.\n\nHuman embryo science: can the world’s regulators keep pace?\n\nHe is on a decades-long quest to grow eggs and sperm in the laboratory. Hayashi wants to understand the fundamental biology of these reproductive cells. But, if he succeeds, it could forever alter how humans reproduce.\n\nEven for a scientist known for extreme doggedness, it has been a tortuous road. It has taken Hayashi to some strange places: his lab grows fragments of faux ovaries and testes in dishes and has produced mice with two fathers and no mother1.\n\nEvery paper he publishes brings e-mails from people clamouring for help with their fertility. “I tell them, ‘This is still experimental’,” Hayashi says. “But sometimes, I can’t respond. There are too many.”\n\nThe work that Hayashi and others in the field are doing could offer fresh hope to people struggling with infertility, and to same-sex couples who want children who are genetically related to both partners. But despite the dazzling results researchers have achieved in rodents, that future remains distant. “The technology is super cool,” says Christian Kramme, chief scientific officer at Gameto, a fertility-focused biotechnology company in Austin, Texas. “But fundamentally, I don’t believe there is a single person in the world that should attempt to enact this clinically in the next decade.”\n\nThere are plenty of interim goals for researchers to chase, however. Drug companies and regulators hope that a bountiful supply of human gametes — the collective term for egg and sperm cells — could make it easier to test whether drugs and other compounds could reduce fertility or cause mutations that would be passed on to the next generation, says Ina Dobrinski, a reproductive biologist at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nAnd learning how to recapitulate human development in the laboratory could reveal clues about infertility, says Azim Surani, a developmental biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. “This will be the greatest outcome from these studies,” he says. “Once you understand what causes infertility, you might find ways of overcoming that.”\n\nBut as labs move forwards with these experiments, some researchers are raising concerns about potential future uses of the technology. Growing large numbers of gametes in the laboratory could make it easier for parents to select embryos for desirable traits and even facilitate the generation of genetically modified babies.\n\nAlthough such uses are, by some estimates, at least 15 years away, researchers and some government bodies are calling for regulations to address the potential issues associated with lab-grown eggs and sperm — a process known as in vitro gametogenesis (IVG).\n\nResearchers differ in their estimates of when human IVG will become a reality. Hayashi’s laboratory has produced fertile mouse pups from what he calls egg-like cells grown in the lab2. There’s a chance that human equivalents of these cells could be made in a lab in the next two years, he says.\n\nThese mice have two biologically male parents. They were generated using eggs made from the males’ skin cells.Credit: Katsuhiko Hayashi, University of Osaka\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they’ll be ready for use in people, he adds. Only a small proportion of the mouse embryos generated from his egg-like cells give rise to live pups, and Hayashi speculates that it could take five years or more to produce truly functional human eggs with acceptable success rates.\n\nScientists will also need to develop and test non-human primate gametes. Ideally, the offspring generated from these eggs and sperm would be tracked for multiple generations, adding years to the timeline. “That’s a critical point,” says Mitinori Saitou, a developmental biologist at Kyoto University in Japan. “My guess is that probably we will have to rely on our next generation of scientists for this.”\n\nA recipe for gametes\n\nFor nearly 20 years, researchers have known how to reprogram cells in the human body into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which can take on nearly any cellular identity. Such cells have been used to make cardiac cells that beat in unison, and nerve cells that conduct electrical signals. But recapitulating the complex and lengthy development of sperm and eggs has proved to be more difficult. “There are so many stages involved,” says Surani. “And each of these is very complex.”\n\nNormally, gametogenesis starts well before birth. Egg development begins in the fetus, in which immature eggs are produced by the millions. Some of these cells then initiate a specialized form of division, called meiosis, in which they lose a set of chromosomes, each cell keeping half the number of an ordinary cell. But this division takes years to complete: the cells pause mid-meiosis and will not resume until years later, after puberty, when they are ovulated. Each immature egg is surrounded by tissue that forms a fluid-filled follicle. These follicles secrete hormones and mature as the egg develops.\n\nMeanwhile, the cells that give rise to sperm also form in the fetus and, after puberty, can produce millions of sperm each day in the winding seminiferous tubules of the testes. Their tubular environment is more complex than the ovary’s follicles, and harder for scientists to recapitulate in the laboratory.\n\nIn both cases, the milieu of a developing egg or sperm is crucial. The cells communicate with their surroundings through proteins and other molecules, and receive physical cues from their environment that influence their development.\n\nImmature sperm seem to respond to the flow of fluid around them as it moves through the tubules of the testes, says Hayashi. And the stiffness of tissues in an ovary helps to hold a developing egg in a state of arrest, says Evelyn Telfer, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nThe controversial embryo tests that promise a better baby\n\nThese signals and scaffolds are difficult to replicate in the lab — especially for human IVG, because it is so hard to obtain tissue to study normal development of the ovaries and testes. Researchers are using techniques that allow them to monitor gene activity and protein expression in individual cells and intact tissue, to pinpoint which molecules and cell types might be important, says Chuva de Sousa Lopes, a developmental biologist at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands.\n\nSome studies incubate human cells with mouse ovarian or testicular cells to encourage them to develop into eggs and sperm3. But this approach cannot not be used to make gametes for use in human reproduction because of possible contamination with animal viruses.\n\nAt the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, urologist Ryan Flannigan and his colleagues are 3D printing testicular tubules from human cells for their IVG experiments4. Other approaches include using microfluidic devices designed to mimic the organs. Dobrinski’s lab grows 3D cell cultures called organoids, which combine several cell types found in the testes.\n\nThere are still kinks to work out. Dobrinski’s team, for example, struggles to keep its organoids alive for long enough to grow human gametes. In humans, egg and sperm development takes months3, not counting the years-long wait for puberty, says Kotaro Sasaki, a reproductive biologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “Many people do not know how difficult it is,” he says.\n\nGametes in gear\n\nThat lengthy time in culture not only slows research, but can also raise the risk of something going wrong, potentially compromising the health of the final product and any offspring, says Eishi Aizawa, a developmental biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nSome groups are trying to make the process more efficient. For example, one team recently found three proteins that each seem able to initiate meiosis in both male and female iPS cells5.\n\nBut some features of this meiosis are unusual, and the cells don’t complete their division, says team member Merrick Pierson Smela, chief scientific officer of Ovelle, a biotechnology company in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nMeiosis is a key stumbling point for IVG, says Paula Cohen, a cell biologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York. She and her collaborators have been trying to coax immature human gametes to undergo normal meiosis for about a decade. “It doesn’t work,” she says. Cohen says that many of the teams that have reported success have not fully demonstrated that meiosis is proceeding in their Petri dishes as it would in the body. And proper meiosis is important: errors in the process can lead to gametes with the wrong number of chromosomes.\n\nA different approach, reported last month6, seems to produce functional eggs capable of being fertilized. Researchers replaced the nucleus of an immature egg cell, which has one copy of each chromosome, with the nucleus from a skin cell, which contains two of each. They then triggered a process, which they called mitomeiosis, that discarded one set of chromosomes, mimicking some features of meiosis.\n\nAbout 9% of these cells led to viable eggs that were fertilized and developed for another six days, generating a precursor to an embryo known as a blastocyst. But all the blastocysts had chromosomal abnormalities, and they did not undergo the genetic shuffling that usually takes place during the development of gametes. This recombination is a source of genetic diversity, and it’s unclear how the lack of it would affect offspring, says Cohen, or how the mitomeiosis process affects subsequent cell divisions. “This would need to be studied intensively.”\n\nLab-grown gametes could one day be used for in vitro fertilization.Credit: Lennart Nilsson, TT/Science Photo Library\n\nAnother hurdle to achieving human IVG is recreating the complex sequence of DNA alterations that occur at different stages of development. Early in gametogenesis, cells systematically erase certain chemical modifications that can affect gene activity; later, new modifications are added onto certain regions of DNA, some of which are then said to be ‘imprinted’.\n\nThis step is crucial: more than a dozen disorders have been linked to improper imprinting, says Surani. “You have to get this right,” he says.",

          "authors": "Lei Zhu",
          "abstract": "The rise of agentic AI tools caused Lei Zhu to rethink his role in bioinformatics.Credit: Lei Zhu\n\nWhen I began my graduate studies, the first thing I needed to do was choose a research direction. The laboratory I joined focused on two main areas: functional assays and bioinformatics. This was more than a decade ago, and the typical workflow involved bioinformatics researchers analysing large data sets to identify genes associated with specific phenotypes or diseases, which would then be handed over to the functional-assay team for validation.\n\nAt the time, bioinformatics was a new, promising field, so I chose this path without hesitation. But, I did not have a programming background, so it was tough to get started. I began studying programming languages — first Perl, then R and Python.\n\nLooking back, I’m happy with my choice. It was an exciting time, and the rapid growth of high-throughput technologies and new techniques — such as transcriptomics and genomics, and later single-cell biology — gave me plenty of data to work with. Solving biological problems through the code I wrote gave me a sense of self-worth.\n\nThen, artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT, Manus and Grok, emerged. Their ability to spit out functional code threatened to make me redundant, but I wasn’t concerned at first because AI-generated code often contains errors that only appear during testing and require manual debugging. New ‘agentic’ modes of operation, however, were potential game-changers. These allow tools such as Manus to first generate code and then run it directly in the cloud, creating a seamless loop: from me asking questions, to the tool writing and executing code, to me receiving results. That was when I started to worry: in this age of AI, am I still necessary?\n\nToday’s AI tools can efficiently write code to perform biological analyses. I need only upload my data and provide a simple prompt, such as, ‘Assume you are a bioinformatics expert. Could you create ten visuals to represent different data based on your understanding of the data set above? Display the plots one by one, with a brief introduction.’ The AI provides the answers I need, sometimes exceeding my expectations. So, what is my role in this process?\n\nI found out during a study of lung cancer. We had hundreds of tumour tissue gene-expression profiles, and I asked the AI to set up the analysis. It worked quickly, and even produced a tidy report. The preliminary results looked great — almost too good. The AI identified a statistically significant difference in gene-expression levels before and after a specific time point. But as I dug deeper, I saw that, halfway through the study, the lab had changed how the data were collected. The model had picked up on that difference — not one due to biology. What had looked like a breakthrough was actually just an artefact. Once I adjusted for that change, the difference became less dramatic but reflected real biology.\n\nI realized that my role had shifted from scripting to supervising. What matters now is stating the question clearly, spotting problems that the computer cannot see and taking responsibility for the answer.\n\nTop tips for AI supervisors\n\nPeople tell me that I could make the AI smarter by ‘putting more context into the prompt’, but my AI always seems to play dumb. No matter how detailed my request, it finds ways to misunderstand. Over the past few years, I’ve developed some methods to double-check its work.\n\nCreate a validation set. Keep a small data set that you understand well — a subset of previously published or manually validated data, for instance — as a positive control. Before applying a new AI-generated pipeline to your data, test it on this set. If the AI produces unexpected or inconsistent results, you’ll know immediately that either the prompt or the algorithm needs refinement.\n\nShuffle the data. AI models can easily overfit data or be swayed by technical artefacts, as happened during the lung-cancer study. To test whether a finding is biologically meaningful, shuffle sample labels, perturb values slightly or otherwise introduce synthetic noise. If the ‘significant’ pattern persists, it’s probably an artefact, rather than a true signal.\n\nSubset the analysis. If a data set is big enough, I will ask the AI to perform the same analysis on random subsets of it. Consistency across subsets increases confidence: if the results vary wildly from one subset to the next, the finding might not hold up.",

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "Success rates for Europe’s leading research grants are declining — some to single percentage points — as a surge in applications far outweighs the funds available. Data gathered by Nature show that researchers, especially those at the start of their academic journeys, are facing increasingly fierce competition to pursue research careers (see ‘Funding competition’).\n\nLast month, the European Commission said that the European Union’s research and innovation framework programme had received the highest number of funding proposals in its four-decade history this year.\n\nApplications for the 2025 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships exceeded 17,000 — an increase of nearly 65% compared with 2024. The MSCA scheme has a proposed budget of €404.3 million (US$471 million) to fund around 1,650 projects, and the success rate (the proportion of awards granted) is expected to drop below 10%, down from nearly 17% last year.\n\nThe European Research Council (ERC), Europe’s premier funding agency for basic research, has reported similar surges in applications across its schemes. For its Starting Grants — open to early-career researchers with two to seven years of experience after completing a PhD — the ERC has received 13% more proposals so far compared with 2024. Only 12% will be funded, down from 14% last year.\n\nApplications for the ERC’s Advanced Grants — which fund established researchers — have also risen, by 31% and 82% compared with 2024 and 2023, respectively. Yet only an estimated 276 projects (8%) will be funded, down from 11% last year.\n\n“We’re extremely pleased that there is such a high demand for ERC grants. It shows that people have ideas for fundamental science, for frontier science, that there’s a need for it, there’s a desire for it,” says Maria Leptin, president of the ERC. “The flip side is we don’t have more money. And so, the success rates will go down, and there will be frustration in the community,” she adds.\n\nEurope’s life-sciences organization, EMBO has received “a record number” of applications for its postdoctoral fellowships this year, says Karin Dumstrei, head of the programme.\n\nThe result is that many researchers are fighting to stay in an increasingly competitive academic system. “You can work as hard as you want, but at the end of the day, it’s down to numbers. It’s down to luck,” says Christina Carlisi, a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London, who has been applying for grants this year and feeling the strain. “It’s mostly out of your control. And I think that’s sometimes difficult to grapple with in terms of keeping the motivation going.”\n\nDeclining success rates\n\nNational funding bodies across Europe are experiencing similar increases in applications. The German research foundation (DFG) — the country’s largest independent research funding organization — told Nature that applications for its early-career grants between January and August were up by 20% compared with the same period in 2024.\n\nI won three competitive grants in a row. Here’s how I learnt what to do\n\nAnother major funder in Germany, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, has received at least 20% more postdoctoral applications so far this year than in the same period last year. Applications from India and China make up the largest share of this increase, a representative of the foundation told Nature, and applications from the United States have also risen, although to a lesser extent.\n\nGrant applications received by the United Kingdom’s central research funder, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), have almost doubled since 2017–18, according to a report published this year. But over the same period, the success rates have nearly halved — from 36% in 2017–18 to 19% in 2024–25, the lowest in the decade. Data shared with Nature by the UKRI’s Medical Research Council show that two of its grant schemes recorded the highest number of applications since 2020 this year.\n\nThe Swedish Research Council told Nature that it has also observed a significant rise in applications in the past three years, but the Research Council of Norway said that it has not seen any major changes.\n\nEuropean competition\n\nResearchers and officials say it is too early to know what is driving the spike in applications. Cuts to science budgets and political instability are prompting US researchers to look for jobs in Europe. Academics in the United States can apply for EU grants provided that they carry out the research in institutions within Europe. European scientists who have built careers in the United States might also be seeking opportunities to return home.\n\nWhen the government cancels your research grant, here’s what you can do",

          "abstract": "Cases of influenza are surging in Japan.Credit: Kota Kawasaki/Yomiuri Shimbun via AP/Alamy\n\nJapan’s health authorities have declared an influenza epidemic, with thousands of people infected with the respiratory virus. The number of infections is unusual for this time of year, researchers say, and could seed outbreaks in countries that are heading into winter in Asia and Europe — although it is unlikely to become a global pandemic.\n\nAs of 10 October, 6,013 cases of influenza virus have been reported in Japan. More than 100 schools have closed, and nearly half of the 287 people who were hospitalized for flu in September were children aged 14 or younger. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare declared a nationwide epidemic on 3 October. Outbreaks are classified as epidemics when the number of infections is higher than expected in a given area over a particular period of time.\n\nOutbreaks of influenza virus tend to occur seasonally each year, predominantly in winter across countries with temperate climates. In Japan, that usually occurs around the end of November. This year, the increase in people being treated for flu started five weeks earlier than usual, says Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya.\n\nJapan has had early starts to the flu season in the past few years, but not this early, says Ian Barr, a researcher and deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, who is based in Melbourne, Australia. “You might see cases in October, but not epidemic-type numbers,” says Barr.\n\nIncreasing international travel since the COVID-19 pandemic is one factor that could be behind the early start to the flu season, says Balasubramaniam. Other factors include climate change and a lack of exposure to the circulating virus, particularly for elderly people and young children.\n\nInformation about which strains are circulating in Japan has not yet emerged, but Barr says the outbreaks there could be caused by a strain of influenza A, called H3N2, that surged in Australia and New Zealand over the past two months, coinciding with the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. People from Australia are travelling to Japan in huge numbers, he says, meaning there are more chances for virus transmission between hemispheres.",

          "authors": "Andrew Macintosh, Gregory Trencher, Benedict Probst, Shanta Barley, Danny Cullenward, Thales A. P. West, Don Butler, Johan Rockström",
          "abstract": "Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets.\n\nOffsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize’ their own emissions.\n\nNet zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise\n\nAlthough conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it’s difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air’, with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional’, meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later.\n\nMost carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions.\n\nYet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets.\n\nOf greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union’s Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia.\n\nSuch practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes.\n\nHere, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes.\n\nNo easy solution\n\nCarbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual’ projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest’s actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits.\n\nHeatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies\n\nFundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects.\n\nEven where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1.\n\nIt is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth’s climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset.\n\nMisaligned incentives\n\nIn most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nFor these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk.\n\nGovernment-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity.\n\nWhat the science shows\n\nThese interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence.\n\nRecognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10.\n\nThe harm caused by offsets\n\nBad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nIn a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax.",

          "abstract": "Nathalie Bock and her partner juggled childcare, hospital visits and work commitments after their twin sons were born. Credit: Nathalie Bock\n\nIn January 2021, my partner and I were on fixed-term postdoctoral fellowships in Australia when life threw us a rapid sequence of curveballs. We hadn’t planned on four children, but our third pregnancy became twins. Elio, one of our twin boys, was born with intestinal atresia: his small intestine wasn’t connected to his large intestine. A day after birth, surgeons made a life-saving stoma.\n\nSix weeks later, while he was still in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), a biopsy revealed that he had total colonic Hirschsprung disease (TCHD). Elio’s colon would never function, meaning that the stoma bag was going to stay for a few years. Living with TCHD entails chronic diarrhoea, vitamin supplementation and a constant risk of dehydration.\n\nBeing in a neonatal care unit is hard at any time, but Australia’s strict pandemic border closures meant that our relatives from abroad — we’re from France and Italy — could not fly in to help. After eight weeks, Elio moved from the NICU to the children’s hospital, where a parent had to remain with him at all times. My partner packed a suitcase; he lived in hospital for another three months while we waited for Elio’s stomal output to stabilize. At home I juggled looking after our two older children, aged five and eight, breastfeeding Elio’s brother Enzo, and a daily 45-kilometre commute between our home and the hospital.\n\nLuckily, our institutions granted us extra personal leave, which helped considerably. Still, we were two materials scientists on fixed-term contracts, now a family of six, including a disabled child. We made a pact: we would be there fully for Elio and would not sacrifice one of our careers to save the other, as many others (typically women) are forced to do. We’d spent years of our professional lives pursuing these career paths and, as stubborn optimists, we believed that with the right mindset we could both keep our careers going. We thought this would be the best way to provide our family with stability and fulfilment. Our plan was the same as those we’d put in place during frantic grant-writing seasons — to take turns advancing our work, to keep both of our research careers alive.\n\nI won three competitive grants in a row. Here’s how I learnt what to do\n\nFrom March to June 2021, my partner continued with his fellowship — developing sustainable, biodegradable materials for Australian commercial packaging products — while juggling nasogastric feeds, stoma care and baby cuddles. I advanced my fellowship work on the development of new biomaterials that can be used to culture and test cancer tissue in the laboratory, while running the rest of the family, buoyed by the support of my colleagues and friends.\n\nWe made it work from June to December. Elio’s disability was not eligible for government support, however, and despite donations from relatives and friends, we couldn’t afford a specialized carer. So, by late 2021, we started trialling the only nursery that would take Elio. His medical team helped us to adapt his daytime feeding so that he no longer needed nasogastric feeds. Nurses trained the nursery staff to empty his stoma bag and give him multiple medications. Soon after, Elio was fully enrolled at nursery: no more isolation and plenty of fun alongside Enzo and the other toddlers. One of our biggest successes as a family.\n\nThen came a new hurdle: how to respond to questions around career disruption on our grant applications. Many Australian funders offer applicants the opportunity to describe their personal circumstances, so that an individual’s track record of research can be judged fairly, which is a well-meaning attempt to balance the playing field for scientists whose careers have been thrown off course by life events.\n\nNathalie Bock develops biomaterials to study the role of cellular microenvironments in normal and pathological tissue states.Credit: Nathalie Bock\n\nIn practice, however, this meant disclosing intimate details about my family’s and my life to people who were unqualified to assess them. This information gets sent to peer reviewers, who are often colleagues, whose expertise is in science, not socio-medical assessment.\n\nWhen my partner encountered this request in an important grant submission, he chose not to disclose this information. He felt that it was too personal and with hospital life in full swing, he also knew that he didn’t have the capacity to bring this funding application to a more competitive level. He asked a senior colleague, originally a co-investigator, to step up as the lead applicant. The grant succeeded — a collective win — but my partner relinquished leadership.\n\nI felt similarly reluctant to disclose my recent personal trials. As a grant reviewer myself, I had read deeply personal accounts from others that I had no training to evaluate. In our small research community, I would sometimes find myself working with those same researchers who had shared their experiences in their applications. I’ve made the difficult decision to share personal details here to raise awareness of these issues. But, in the context of grant assessment, I doubt any reseacher wants their colleagues to know such details about them.",

          "authors": "Stephanie Melchor",
          "abstract": "Fluorescent dyes can help researchers to visualize the structure of a cell — but it can be difficult to use more than a handful.Credit: David Becker/SPL\n\nWhen working with fluorescent dyes or proteins, researchers typically focus on two variables: the wavelength of light at which the molecules are stimulated to fluoresce, and the wavelengths at which they emit light — that is, their colour. By balancing those properties, researchers can distinguish between half a dozen or so fluorescently tagged molecules in the same sample.\n\nBut there’s more to fluorescence than colour, and scientists can now more easily use another property of fluorescent molecules to increase the number of proteins that can be visualized at the same time.\n\nLed by Xin Zhang, a chemist at Westlake University in Hangzhou, China, the team designed more than two dozen fluorescent proteins that differ not only by colour, but also in how much time they spend in their excited state — a property called the fluorescence lifetime. The researchers call these molecules time-resolved fluorescent proteins, or tr-FPs. Their findings were published online last month in Cell1.\n\n“It’s brilliant work,” says Conor Evans, a physical chemist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The team has given researchers a “dial-able palette” from which they can pick both a colour and a lifetime to get what they need, he says. “That’s very powerful.”\n\nExpanding the palette\n\nSuppose that a scientist wants to map a cellular process associated with a specific protein. To work out where in the cell that process occurs, the researcher can use fluorescent dyes to highlight cellular landmarks — blue for the nucleus, red for the cytoskeleton and green for the mitochondria, for instance. Viewing other proteins of interest against this background would require still more colours. However, because the visible spectrum is relatively narrow and fluorescent molecules emit light over a range of wavelengths, standard microscopes can handle only a handful of colours simultaneously. After that, the emission spectra start to bleed together, making it difficult to discern which signals are coming from which molecule.\n\nThe fluorescence lifetime provides a way to expand that palette.\n\nWhen a fluorescent molecule absorbs light, its electronic energy levels increase to enter what is called the excited state. The molecule hovers in this excited state for pico- to nanoseconds, and then begins its luminous descent to the ground state, emitting excess energy in the form of photons. The time a molecule spends in an excited state — that is, between absorbing and emitting photons — is called the lifetime.\n\nTo change the lifetimes of existing fluorescent proteins, Zhang’s team mutated some of the amino-acid residues to destabilize the region in which the fluorescent signal is generated. The researchers then screened the resulting proteins to identify variants with different lifetimes, but identical emission spectra, to those of their wild-type counterparts. In all, they produced 28 variants, spanning most of the visible spectrum.\n\nZhang’s group then put this palette to work, fusing the tr-FPs to various target proteins and testing their behaviour in various subcellular locations. They also examined how the tr-FPs performed in a wide range of applications, including super-resolution microscopy, and showed that the technology enables live-cell imaging of nine target proteins using only three colour channels.\n\nZhang notes that lifetime-based imaging is not a new concept, but he hopes the tr-FPs will help more researchers to take advantage of the technique. “I think this is more like an addition to the broad and powerful family of fluorescent proteins,” he says, rather than some kind of paradigm shift.\n\nThe researchers did, however, test the tr-FPs in what they say is a new application: quantifying the relative concentrations of two proteins in a single living cell, something that is difficult to determine from fluorescence intensity alone.",

But the new results, published on 16 October in Nature Medicine1, reveal that people with obesity due to relatively rare forms of a gene called MC4R have lower levels of LDL cholesterol and reduced rates of heart disease than do peers with a similar body-mass-index.\n\n“Although the obesity is quite severe in mutation carriers, their risk of these additional complications of obesity is reduced,” says Anke Hinney, a geneticist at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, who was not involved with the study. “This is really good news.”\n\nThe results could also point drug developers to new targets for treating high cholesterol, she says.\n\nA weighty paradox\n\nThe study emerged from an effort to understand the fundamental mechanisms that regulate body weight — and why some people with obesity maintain good heart health, says study author Sadaf Farooqi, who studies metabolism at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nThese brain cells could influence how fast you eat — and when you stop\n\nTo learn more, Farooqi and her colleagues turned to MC4R, which encodes a pivotal protein in the brain that acts as a brake on hunger. “Its activation tells you to reduce food intake,” she says. “If that doesn’t work due to loss-of-function mutations, then you don’t have the brake on and you gain weight.”\n\nAs a result, people who carry such mutations are prone to obesity: about 1% of people with obesity — and up to 5% of children with obesity — carry mutations that impair MC4R. That amounts to roughly 1 in 300 people in the United Kingdom.\n\nHeart healthy\n\nFarooqi and her team identified hundreds of people with these mutations by analysing genetic sequences from participants in two research projects: the Genetics of Obesity Study and the UK Biobank.",

Yet we document an ‘empathy perception gap’: people systematically see others as less empathic than others see themselves. Students who perceived their peers as less empathic were less willing to take social risks and grew more isolated over time. To disrupt this cycle, we conducted two field experiments that presented students with data on their peers’ self-reported empathy and behavioural nudges to encourage social risk taking. These interventions reduced the empathy perception gap, increased social behaviours and expanded social networks months later. This work offers a promising, scalable strategy to cultivate social well-being, simply by presenting people with data about each other.",

Across three independent datasets, emotionally arousing moments during narrative perception were associated with an integrated brain state characterized by increased cohesion across functional modules, which in turn predicted the fidelity of subsequent recall. Network integration mediated the influence of emotional arousal on recall fidelity, with consistent within- and between-network interactions supporting the mediation across datasets.

Research on these relationships often relies on subjective measures of smartphone use, which can lack validity.

In this study, we analyzed 250,000 d of smartphone usage data from 10,099 adults, using objective measures of smartphone usage collected over 4 wk. We examined normative usage patterns and the temporal relationships between smartphone use and mood. Our findings reveal weak or null associations between smartphone use and mood, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and at both individual and group levels. Demographic factors, such as age and gender, were stronger predictors of mood than smartphone use. Statistically significant results that were observed showed that younger adults demonstrated a stronger association between social media use and lower mood cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Non-social app use was linked to lower mood in between-subjects analyses, but better mood in within-subjects analyses. However, all effects were small (or null), indicating minimal practical significance. These findings suggest that smartphone use has a limited or negligible impact on mood and well-being over a 4-wk period and do not support claims of a strong or causal relationship between smartphone use and mental well-being across this timeframe.",

Accordingly, judgment errors arise from biased sampling of information from graphs. We tested our theory in four eye-tracking experiments (total N = 421), in which participants made correlation judgments from scatterplots of both experimentally manipulated data (Experiment 1) and real data (Experiment 2), as well as plots with different display formats (Experiments 3 and 4). Participants’ judgments displayed several known biases, including underestimation of absolute correlations and sensitivity to irrelevant visual features. Importantly, the (optimal) Bayesian belief updating model, trained on the sensory inputs from visual information search, predicted both participants’ judgments and associated biases with high accuracy in all the experiments. Additionally, a computational model of participants’ information sampling processes, combined with the Bayesian model, reproduced all behavioral regularities. These results shed light on the cognitive mechanisms of belief formation, show how statistical judgments can be quantitatively predicted and manipulated, and provide insights for data visualization and statistical communication.",

Next, in an ultra-high-field fMRI study (n = 24), we found that both fundamental features of social environments--opportunity density and frequency of success--affected neural activity across a network of regions linked to foraging including dorsal raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, and anterior insula. Thus, humans consider the background statistics of an environment while making social decisions and these decisions are linked to activity in cortico-subcortical circuits mediating the influence of environmental statistics on other aspects of behavior. Moreover, individual differences in how environmental features influence social behavior are associated with variation in mental health dimensions, offering key insights into interindividual variability in social functioning.",

          "abstract": "The digital revolution has ushered in many societal and economic benefits. Yet access to digital technologies such as mobile phones and internet remains highly unequal, especially by gender in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While national-level estimates are increasingly available for many countries, reliable, quantitative estimates of digital gender inequalities at the subnational level are lacking. These estimates, however, are essential for monitoring gaps within countries and implementing targeted interventions within the global sustainable development goals, which emphasize the need to close inequalities both between and within countries. We develop estimates of internet and mobile adoption by gender and digital gender gaps at the subnational level for 2,075 regions in 117 LMICs from 2015 through 2025, a context where digital penetration is low and national-level gender gaps disfavoring women are large. We construct these estimates by applying machine-learning algorithms to Facebook user counts, geospatial data, development indicators, and population composition data. We calibrate and assess the performance of these algorithms using ground-truth data from subnationally representative household survey data from 33 LMICs. Our results reveal striking disparities in access to mobile and internet technologies between and within LMICs. These disparities imply that as of 2025, women are 19% less likely to use the internet and 8% less likely to own a mobile phone in LMICs, corresponding to over 190 million fewer women owning a mobile phone and over 320 million fewer women using the internet.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in evaluative processes, from information filtering to assessing and addressing knowledge gaps through explanation and credibility judgments. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings—NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check—and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. We use news domains purely as a controlled benchmark for evaluative tasks, focusing on the underlying mechanisms rather than on news classification per se. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and nonexpert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, our findings show consistent differences in the observable criteria guiding model evaluations, suggesting that lexical associations and statistical priors could influence evaluations in ways that differ from contextual reasoning. This reliance is associated with systematic effects: political asymmetries and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic reliability—a dynamic we term epistemia, the illusion of knowledge that emerges when surface plausibility replaces verification. Indeed, delegating judgment to such systems may affect the heuristics underlying evaluative processes, suggesting a shift from normative reasoning toward pattern-based approximation and raising open questions about the role of LLMs in evaluative processes.",

          "abstract": "Although studies of Americans’ general discussant networks have been repeated over time, research that assesses change in the nature of Americans’ political discussion networks has yet to be conducted in nationally representative probability surveys. In this study I answer two questions about the quality of the American public sphere that have generated widespread speculation, but little evidence to date. First, how have Americans’ political discussion networks changed over the past 25 y? Second, are the consequences of these changes what one would expect based on previous theory linking Americans’ interpersonal information environments to political tolerance and political participation? I resolve competing claims suggesting that people feel less free to discuss politics, with claims suggesting instead that political discussion now permeates everyday life to a greater extent than in the past. Findings suggest widespread increases in political discussion, changes driven almost entirely by increases in like-minded political discussion partners. Surprisingly, Americans are no more or less likely to engage in conversations across lines of political difference. The predicted consequences of these fluctuations confirm an intrinsic tension between characteristics valued in democratic citizens. Political tolerance has declined significantly, along with decreased awareness of rationales for others’ relative to one’s own views. Political participation is significantly higher on average than 25 y ago. Few people reported engaging with online political discussants, despite efforts to make sure they were included in network measures.",

This study presents a brain-based framework for predicting these hidden and persistent psychological states through noninvasive neuroimaging. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record neural activity from 67 executives in the field as they watched a video about workplace attitudes. We then applied a multitimepoint pattern analysis (MTPA) approach to reduce timeseries dimensionality and successfully classify whether individuals were feeling overwhelmed (72.8% accuracy) or in need of a new or different challenge (79.1% accuracy) in their careers using the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), respectively. The MTPA framework also allowed us to reverse-engineer specific thematic properties of the stimulus that evoked differential neural responses linked to these predicted outcomes. Emotional content in the video (e.g., reported distress) corresponded to the selected TPJ features that predicted whether someone was overwhelmed, while socially relevant content (e.g., missing social gatherings) aligned with the selected features from the dmPFC that predicted the need for a new or different challenge. These findings demonstrate the ability of neural measures to unobtrusively identify hidden and persistent psychological states in real-world settings, enabling targeted interventions that can improve well-being and engagement.",

Our methodology integrates four well-documented models to estimate changes in power outage rates, sociodemographic inequities, and economic costs due to tropical cyclone projections. Synthetic tropical cyclones were generated using data from seven global climate models (GCMs), used to compare power outage risks at the census tract level along two periods: hindcast (1995–2014) and late-century (2071–2100) using the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The late-century results from each model were scaled to align with a global warming scenario of 3 °C. We evaluated the uncertainty of these projections by considering the agreement among the GCMs outage projections. Results highlight a significant increase in power outage risks and high agreement in northern Florida, Georgia, the mid-Atlantic, and the North Atlantic coast. Distributional impact analyses indicate higher outage risks for Hispanic, non-White, and low-income populations, while economic projections show annual costs rising from $6.2 billion in the hindcast to over $11 billion for the 3 °C scenario. The findings highlight the need for adaptive strategies and equitable resource allocation to mitigate these growing risks due to future climate projections.",

Here, we explore how DNA segregation and division are mechanistically coupled in archaeal relatives of eukaryotes, which lack Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/Cyclins. Using live cell imaging, we first describe the series of sequential changes in DNA organization that accompany cell division in Sulfolobus, which computational modeling shows likely aid genome segregation. Through a perturbation analysis we identify a regulatory checkpoint which ensures that the compaction of the genome into two spatially segregated nucleoids only occurs once cells have assembled a division ring—which also defines the axis of DNA segregation. Finally, we show that DNA compaction and segregation depend, in part, on a ParA homologue, SegA, and its partner SegB, whose absence leads to bridging DNA. Taken together, these data show how regulatory checkpoints like those operating in eukaryotes aid high-fidelity division in an archaeon.",

          "abstract": "Early life adversity (ELA) predisposes individuals to physical and mental disorders lifelong. How ELA affects brain functions, leading to these vulnerabilities, is a mystery. To understand ELA’s impacts, investigations into neural activity affected by ELA must go beyond localized areas toward simultaneous recordings from multiple widely distributed regions over time. Such studies will expose relative activity between regions and discover shifts in regional activity in response to different experiences. Here, we performed longitudinal manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to measure degrees of brain-wide neural activity in ELA-exposed mice across a series of experiences in adulthood. To ascertain whether ELA resulted in atypical brain activity, results were compared to those of the standard mouse (Std). MEMRI captured activity in the freely moving home cage condition, and short- and long-term after exposure to TMT, a naturalistic predator threat. Images were normalized and aligned then analyzed with statistical mapping and automated segmentation. We found that neural activity in the home cage was greater in ELA compared to Std in multiple striatal-pallidal and hypothalamic regions. Upon acute threat, neural activity in Std increased in these regions to become more similar to that in ELA, while new hyperactive responses in ELA emerged in the midbrain and hindbrain. Nine days after acute threat, heightened neural activity in ELA persisted within locus coeruleus and increased within the posterior amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus. These results reveal functional imbalances that arise between multiple brain-systems after ELA, which are dependent upon context and cumulative experiences into adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Sperm motility is essential for male fertility and is tightly controlled by signaling events in the flagellum. Slc9c1 encodes a sperm-specific Na + /H + exchanger (sNHE/SLC9C1) that localizes to the flagellum and is indispensable for sperm motility and male fertility. SLC9C1 is unique among Na + /H + exchangers in that it possesses a voltage-sensing domain (VSD), the physiological function of which remains poorly understood in mammals. Here, by analyzing coevolving genes with Slc9c1 , we identified Tmem217 , which encodes a transmembrane protein that is localized in the sperm flagellum. Knockout (KO) of Tmem217 in mice resulted in sperm motility defects and male infertility, phenocopying Slc9c1 KO mice. Coimmunoprecipitation and structural prediction analyses indicated that TMEM217 binds to SLC9C1 via its VSD. Further analyses indicated that the amounts of SLC9C1 and its associated protein, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), were lost in mature Tmem217 KO spermatozoa, leading to disrupted 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. Remarkably, cAMP analogs restored the impaired motility and fertilizing ability of Tmem217 KO spermatozoa in vitro, validating the essential role of TMEM217 in regulating cAMP production. Our findings indicate that the association of TMEM217 with SLC9C1 via its VSD is critical for the proper organization and function of the SLC9C1–sAC–cAMP axis in mature spermatozoa.",

          "abstract": "Pathogenic threats to reproductive individuals pose a profound challenge to the stability of insect societies. In honey bees ( Apis mellifera L.), severe virus infections in queens can trigger worker-initiated supersedure, a socially coordinated replacement of the queen that, while risky, is essential when her reproductive competence is compromised. How viruses impact the physiology of queen hosts, who bear unique reproductive burdens within their colonies, and how this perturbs colony social order remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the supersedure response is mediated by pathogen-induced, intensity-dependent changes in queen pheromonal signaling. Laboratory infection experiments revealed that queens challenged with deformed wing virus B and black queen cell virus infections demonstrated a reduction in methyl oleate, a key component of the queen retinue pheromone, and field data corroborated this association. Lipidomics analysis demonstrated that infection coincides with a systemic lipid deficiency, especially in triacylglycerides (major energy reserves), providing a physiological link among viral stress, ovarian atrophy, and altered pheromone output. Notably, artificial suppression of ovary investment via restricted laying also caused methyl oleate production to decline; therefore, high virus infection likely indirectly suppresses methyl oleate production by reducing ovary mass. In field trials, we further show that synthetic pheromone blends containing methyl oleate significantly suppressed queen cell rearing compared to no-pheromone controls, whereas blends lacking this compound yielded an intermediate effect. These results demonstrate that virus-induced reproductive decline disrupts pheromone signaling, revealing a plausible mechanistic pathway by which pathogens can erode social cohesion.",

It is widely assumed that the content of Ca 2+ in the glutamate-elicited ionic flux is determined by the molecular composition of the NMDA receptors, whose expression varies developmentally and across brain regions and can change on a scale of minutes to hours. Here, we report that rather than being a fixed property of a given receptor assembly, the amount of Ca 2+ in the NMDA receptor current can fluctuate in real time over a wide dynamic range in response to endogenous and synthetic allosteric modulators. We identify the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor as a structural modulator of its Ca 2+ permeability and demonstrate that the mechanism involves changes in the receptor’s unitary Ca 2+ conductance. These results reveal an unsuspected lever controlling the NMDA receptor–mediated Ca 2+ transients and, implicitly, the many physiological and pathological processes influenced by these currents.",

Building upon historical observations, we conducted a comparative virulence assessment of these pathogens using both bovine and murine infection models. Holstein calves were infected via aerosol with M. tb, M. bovis, or M. orygis , and pathology was analyzed through macroscopic and microscopic assessments of lungs and lymph nodes, along with quantitative tissue bacterial burden measurements. In C57BL/6 mice, we compared virulence using three readouts, namely survival, lethal dose determination, and detailed pathological assessments. Despite genomic similarity, animal-adapted MTBCs consistently showed dramatically enhanced virulence compared to M. tb with distinct immunopathology and, in the murine model, mortality within 24 days. Using gene disruption studies guided by proteomic comparisons, we determined that these infection outcomes were dependent on shared (ESAT-6) and lineage-associated (MPT70) virulence factors, the route of infection, and prior infection or immunization. Our findings reveal unexpected virulence hierarchies within the MTBC, with fundamental and translational implications for tuberculosis research.",

Although spontaneous Ca 2+ MDs are present throughout the brain, their putative role is unknown. Here, we question whether, owing to their recurring signaling mode, spontaneous Ca 2+ MDs contribute to slowly evolving phenomena in the brain, such as memory consolidation. We demonstrate that, in the perirhinal cortex, a central region in recognition memory, these events promote Ca 2+ -dependent gliotransmission and modulate synaptic strengthening. Their recurring activity extends the release of the gliotransmitter brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) over time, ensuring the sustained Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase B (TrkB)-signaling required for the consolidation of long-term synaptic potentiation and lasting memories. We also show that Ca 2+ MDs, which are stochastic events, preserve their random behavior during gliotransmission, introducing an element of unpredictability into the process of memory retention. Our study assigns to spontaneous, stochastic activity in astrocytes a unique functional role in shaping and stabilizing memory circuits.",

These conditions are often devastating and lack effective therapies. In this study, we developed precise base editing (BE) strategies targeting the human LMNA gene variants L35P and R249Q, which cause congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (DCM-CD), respectively. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) carrying the R249Q mutation displayed nuclear aberrations, DNA damage, and abnormal Ca 2+ transients. Similarly, L35P iPSC-CMs exhibited abnormal contraction, DNA damage, and reduced Lamin A/C protein expression. We also generated “humanized” mouse models carrying these pathogenic human mutations. R249Q homozygous mice exhibited cardiac conduction abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias, and premature death. Mice with the homozygous L35P mutation displayed severe muscle-wasting and reduced lifespan, while heterozygous L35P mice displayed DCM. We developed an adenine base editing (ABE) approach for correcting the R249Q mutation and a cytosine base editing (CBE) strategy for the L35P variant. Precise correction of these mutations in iPSC-CMs successfully rescued all of the in vitro abnormalities. Furthermore, delivery of the BE components using adeno-associated virus prevented the pathological phenotypes and extended longevity of mice carrying the LMNA L35P and the R249Q mutations. These results demonstrate the efficacy of ABE and CBE in correcting pathogenic LMNA mutations that cause cardiac disease, highlighting BE as a promising therapeutic approach for human laminopathies.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade, the connection between physics and topology has resulted in the discovery of several new phenomena. A celebrated example is the field of topological insulators [X.-L. Qi, S.-C. Zhang, Rev. Mod. Phys. 83 , 1057–1110 (2011)]., in which topological quantities describing the bulk medium response in reciprocal space dictate the presence of protected transport states at the boundary of a finite sample. Broken symmetries in the microscopic structure of a material play a prominent role in determining its topological features relevant to these phenomena. As another landmark phenomenon driven by broken symmetries, twistronics leverages the rotation angle between coupled layers to control in extreme ways the dispersion topology, leading to flat-band superconductivity [Y. Cao et al. , Nature 556 , 43–50 (2018)] and topological transitions for polaritons [G. Hu et al. , Nature 582 , 209–213 (2020)]. Here, we apply these concepts to elastodynamic waves, and exploit the twist degree-of-freedom to control broken symmetries in the microscopic structure of elastic metasurfaces, demonstrating extreme wave control. We predict and experimentally demonstrate topological transitions within twisted elastodynamic metasurfaces, which we harness for broadband, reconfigurable, and robust manipulation of phonons.

Here, we identify TMEM16F, a calcium-activated phospholipid scramblase, as a driver of tumor-intrinsic PS externalization. TMEM16F-mediated PS scrambling polarized macrophages to an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype, which promotes TGF-β1 secretion and regulatory T cell expansion to suppress cytotoxic lymphocytes. Genetic ablation of TMEM16F abolished PS exposure, systemically reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment and primary immune organs toward immune activation, and suppressed tumor growth across cancer models.

          "abstract": "Stalagmites are isolated columns of calcium carbonate growing on a cave floor; their growth is driven by the constant dripping of supersaturated solutions from the roof of the cave. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the shape of a steadily growing stalagmite. Our analysis gives rise to three distinct shapes, all of them observable in nature, with the shape characterized by a single dimensionless parameter. Transitions between different shapes occur at a specific value of this parameter, with additional selection rules determining the shape and size of stalagmites evolving under specific cave conditions. Our theory shows that the stalagmite shape influences the 13 C isotope shifts, which are an important source of paleoclimatic information.",

          "abstract": "Structure elucidation via single-crystal methods has historically lacked experimental access to real-space information, instead relying exclusively on diffraction-space measurements of Bragg reflections. Here we exploit the dual-space imaging power of 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy to meaningfully integrate real-space information into the crystallographic workflow. We show that virtual apertures assembled by segmentation of high-angle annular dark-field images enable i) pixel-by-pixel separation of coherent Bragg signal from clusters of closely spaced nanocrystals and ii) selective extraction of integrated intensities from thinner subregions of individual specimens, facilitating retroactive tuning of multiple scattering artifacts. This strategy empowers us to simply pick and choose whichever nanoscale regions of interest generate the highest-quality diffraction patterns, allowing us to solve several independent structures of the metal-organic framework UiO-66 from specimens whose agglomerated morphology proved intractable for conventional microcrystal electron diffraction. Our method is compatible with both rotational and serial approaches to data processing, ultimately divulging the first scanning nanobeam electron diffraction structures determined by direct methods at subangstrom resolution.",

Next to core motor effector areas, the primary motor cortex (M1) contains intereffector regions with more integrative connectivity patterns, suggestive of serving psychomotor behavior. Here, we test whether patterns of connectivity differ between patients with and without psychomotor slowing and which cortical areas are associated with aberrant motor behavior in psychosis. This resting-state functional MRI study included 83 patients with psychosis and psychomotor slowing, 43 patients without psychomotor slowing, and 63 matched healthy subjects. We tested group differences in connectivity and regressed motor behavior measures with connectivity in patients with psychomotor slowing. Across subjects, we found distinct rs-fMRI connectivity profiles of the intereffector areas in M1, extending to premotor cortices and cerebellum. Patients with psychomotor slowing had stronger connectivity from the intereffectors than controls or patients without slowing. Finally, motor behavior correlated with connectivity from M1 intereffector regions in patients. Connectivity profiles of intereffectors suggest a role in planning and controlling complex behavioral repertoires. Collectively, these findings in patients with psychomotor slowing stress the importance of intereffector regions in shaping psychomotor behaviors in mental disorders.",

Here, we report the map-based cloning of TaWUSCHEL-D1 ( WUS-D1 ) as the gene responsible for the multiovary phenotype in wheat, which produces three fertile ovaries and grains per floret. We generated a 14.5 Gbp chromosome-level assembly of multiovary wheat line “MOV” that shows unique structural variation in the Mov-1 physical region, resulting in widespread gene upregulation. High-resolution genetic mapping refined the locus to a 135 kbp region that contains two genes. We used nine independent deletion mutants, eight TILLING mutants, and genetic complementation of these genotypes to show that a WUSCHEL ortholog, WUS-D1 , is the causal gene of the Mov-1 locus. Expression studies showed that WUS-D1 is highly expressed during early inflorescence development in MOV, whereas the gene is inactive in wild-type wheat. The higher WUS-D1 expression is associated with the formation of larger meristems and floret primordia that are competent to produce multiple ovaries. These insights provide a foundation to manipulate floral organ numbers to enhance breeding capabilities of bread wheat.",

          "abstract": "The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus species complex (encompassing Cryptococcus neoformans , Cryptococcus deneoformans , and the Cryptococcus gattii species complexes) exhibits diversity in sexual reproduction, including α- a mating, pseudosexual reproduction, as well as unisexual reproduction initiated from a single isolate or between isolates of the same mating type. A central conundrum is that while most Cryptococcus natural populations exhibit significant α mating-type bias, genetic and genomic analyses show recombination occurs in nature. The discovery of unisexual reproduction in C. deneoformans provided insight; however, thus far, unisexual reproduction has never been directly observed in the predominant global pathogenic species C. neoformans . Here, we provide evidence that mutating the RIC8 gene, which encodes a conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in both chaperoning and activating Gα proteins, enables unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans . Additionally, we show that genetic variation in the natural population promotes unisexual reproduction, and unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans involves canonical meiotic recombination. Finally, we found that deletion of both GPA2 and GPA3 in the MAT α background leads to self-filamentation without sporulation, suggesting that differential modulation of the Gα proteins, likely involving Ric8, could underlie the switch between different modes of sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus . Our study further highlights that the highly conserved Ric8 GEF can act as an important regulator of cellular development in response to environmental stimuli and could modulate sexual reproduction in nature. We hypothesize that unisexual reproduction occurs much more frequently in nature than currently appreciated, and possibly in other fungi and microbial eukaryotes as well.",

          "abstract": "Fluorescent labeling approaches are crucial for elucidating protein function and dynamics. While robust methods to monitor gene transcription are widespread, the visualization of proteins in vivo is more elusive. To meet this challenge, we developed Fluorescent Endogenous Tagging with a Covalent Hook (FETCH) to label cell surface proteins (CSPs) in vivo through a stable covalent bond mediated by the DogTag-DogCatcher peptide partner system. FETCH leverages a spontaneous covalent isopeptide bond that forms between the 23-amino acid DogTag and the 15-kDa DogCatcher. Unlike most tags that work best at protein termini, DogTag functions well in protein loops, expanding the range of sites that can be targeted in proteins. In FETCH, DogTag is introduced into extracellular loops of CSPs through genome engineering, enabling covalent bond formation with a genetically encoded DogCatcher-GFP fusion protein that can be secreted from a variety of cell types in intact animals. To identify optimal DogTag insertions into CSPs, we describe a flow cytometry–based platform for rapidly screening candidates in vitro. We demonstrate the ability to tag and visualize three members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) in vivo: the transmembrane protein mCD8 and two GPI-anchored proteins belonging to the DIP-Dpr interactome that interact biophysically to facilitate neuronal target recognition at Drosophila neuromuscular and brain synapses. FETCH enables precise temporal and spatial control to visualize tagged proteins in vivo, features that are adaptable to a multitude of applications for modifying any cell surface protein.",

          "abstract": "Nutrient intake drives secretion of insulin and insulin-like peptides that stimulate anabolic metabolism and tissue growth. Eight Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) are encoded in the Drosophila genome; whether these Dilps respond uniformly to changes in dietary nutrients is unknown. Here, we investigate the endocrine responses of Dilp2, secreted by brain insulin-producing cells, and Dilp6, produced by the fat body, to dietary sugar and protein in mid-third instar Drosophila larvae. Starvation leads to a profound reduction in circulating Dilp2 without affecting circulating Dilp6 levels. Diets containing sugar alone drive nutrient storage and increase hemolymph Dilp6, but do not promote Dilp2 release. In contrast, dietary protein drives growth and restores hemolymph Dilp2 but strongly reduces circulating Dilp6. Furthermore, circulating levels of Dilp2 and Dilp6 are modulated by the ratio of sugar to protein in the diet. We find that depleting circulating Dilp6 via fat body specific knockdown or increasing insulin receptor (InR) levels in fat body leads to increased levels of triglyceride storage but decreased peripheral growth. Our results suggest that Dilp6, a hormone produced in response to dietary sugar, may direct the use of sugar for growth instead of fat storage at the end stage of larval development. Our findings reveal different modes of regulation for Dilp2 and Dilp6 and raise the question of how the single known Drosophila InR integrates divergent signals from distinct Dilps to control growth and metabolism.",

In contrast, attractive suspensions show complex behaviors, including shear banding, delayed yielding, and resolidification, governed by transient dynamics at shear band interfaces.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the regulatory role of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-mediated citrullination on the tumor suppressor protein p53. We demonstrate that p53 serves as a substrate for PAD4, undergoing citrullination at multiple arginine residues, including critical sites within its DNA-binding domain. Mass spectrometry identified eight citrullination sites, notably R158, R282, and R283, which were further validated in various cancer cell lines. Functional studies revealed that citrullination significantly impairs p53’s ability to form stable tetramers, essential for high-affinity DNA binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed reduced binding to consensus sequences in the p21 and MDM2 promoters. As a result, citrullination led to marked reductions in p21 and MDM2 transcriptional activation and altered regulation of ME2, as demonstrated by reporter assays and quantitative PCR. In addition, citrullination compromised p53’s roles in cell cycle control and apoptosis. Supporting these findings, citrulline-mimic mutants (arginine-to-glutamine substitutions) exhibited diminished transcriptional activity relative to wild-type p53. Furthermore, citrullination disrupted the interaction between p53 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, reducing p53 ubiquitination and degradation, as shown by in vitro ubiquitination assays and cycloheximide chase experiments. Importantly, replacing glutamine with lysine at these key sites largely restored p53 activity, indicating that the loss of positive charge is central to the functional consequences of citrullination. Together, these findings identify PAD4-catalyzed citrullination as a regulatory mechanism that modulates p53 function and highlight PAD4 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.",

In this study, we leveraged a germline CD3ε I173A mutation, a previously characterized alteration that amplifies TCR signaling through the disruption of inhibitory lipid interactions, to dissect how thymocyte-intrinsic TCR signaling amplification influences the fate of mature T cells. Remarkably, thymic double-positive cells in CD3ε I173A mice with altered TCR repertoires demonstrated a significant downregulation of the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase homolog gene AC149090.1 . This modulation triggered a comprehensive rewiring of lipid metabolic pathways, establishing a systemic compensatory mechanism to counterbalance excessive TCR signaling. These metabolic adaptations culminated in functionally compromised mature T cells, characterized by diminished activation potential, reduced proliferative capacity, and impaired antitumor efficacy in CD3ε I173A mice. Our results underscore the critical role of thymic TCR signaling in T cell development for sustaining immune homeostasis and orchestrating mature T cell functionality, unveiling the lipid metabolic plasticity during thymocyte development that acts as a critical regulatory checkpoint for maintaining immune homeostasis.",

How the local physical properties of the matrix (density, stiffness, orientation) affect cellular forces remains, however, poorly understood. Existing approaches to measure cell three-dimensional (3D) traction forces within fibrous substrates lack control over the local properties and rely on continuum approaches, not suited for measuring forces at the scale of individual fibers. Herein, an approach is proposed to fabricate multilayer arrays of suspended deformable fibers spanning a wide range of fine-tunable geometrical and mechanical properties using two-photon polymerization. Atomic Force Microscopy is used to thoroughly investigate the properties of individual fibers, including Young’s modulus and stiffness. This approach is combined with a reference-free method for measuring traction forces in 3D, which relies on automated segmentation of the fibers coupled with finite element modeling. The force measurement pipeline is applied to study forces exerted by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or macrophages, and reveals how these forces are influenced by fiber density and stiffness. Additionally, coupling to fast volumetric imaging with lattice light-sheet microscopy enables the measurement of the low-intensity and short-lived tractions exerted by amoeboid cells, such as dendritic cells. Our technology will be instrumental for monitoring and studying cell behavior at the single-fiber level at extracellular matrix density interfaces, which play a crucial role in both physiological and pathological contexts, such as tumor boundaries.",

NADK2, a chloroplast-localized NAD kinase, supplies NADP + to the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant of NADK2 ( nadk2 ) exhibits a reduced NADP + /NAD + ratio, slow growth, and pale green leaves. To gain further insights into NAD(P)(H) metabolism in chloroplasts, nadk2 revertant mutants ( nkr ) were screened from the M2 generation of EMS (ethyl methane sulfonate)-treated nadk2 seeds. Among them, nkr1 displayed greener leaves and improved growth compared to nadk2 . Genetic mapping and genomic sequencing identified At3g18500 ( CCR4C ) as the causal gene. The nkr1 mutant carried a single nucleotide substitution, introducing a stop codon within the predicted N-terminal chloroplast localization signal, resulting in the loss of CCR4C protein function. The nadk2 ccr4c double mutant restored leaf color and growth to near wild-type levels. To investigate the function of CCR4C, recombinant CCR4C protein was purified and shown to directly convert NADP(H) to NAD(H).

This work explores a similarity learning approach to training deep learning models to address these issues for microplastic classification. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained by similarity learning on a dataset of µFTIR spectra acquired from 45 manufactured microplastic samples of 11 plastic compositions and compared with cross-entropy training of the same CNN architecture as well as classical machine learning algorithms. The CNN trained by similarity learning consistently yielded the highest accuracies (up to a 0.973 F1-score) across the multiple classes of microplastics. Notably, despite only training on microplastic spectra collected under pristine conditions, the CNN trained via similarity learning maintained the highest accuracy (up to a 0.905 F1-score) on a “noisy” dataset consisting of microplastics spiked onto filters with high amounts of exogenous background material. Furthermore, similarity learning combined with support-vector classifiers also allowed for the detection and separation of microplastic polymer-composition classes not contained in the training set. Overall, this approach is able to achieve high accuracy in microplastic classification despite challenges posed by the diversity of microplastic polymer compositions, limited time and resources for dataset preparation, and high amounts of background noise that are common in FTIR spectra collected from real-world microplastic samples.",

          "abstract": "Apusomonads are sediment-dwelling bacterivorous protists that are sister to all Opisthokonta. They have been found to show a negative phototactic response to blue light, mediated by an as-yet unidentified photoreceptive system. Here, by screening available apusomonad omics data we found genes of a distinct group of microbial rhodopsins, apusomonad rhodopsins (ApuRs). ApuRs, heterologously expressed in mammalian cells, absorbed near-UV or violet light, suggesting that ApuRs could be involved in apusomonads’ photoavoidance response toward short-wavelength light. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that ApuRs are anion-selective rhodopsin channels which evolved independently of the family of channelrhodopsins widespread in other unicellular eukaryotes. In ApuRs, channel opening is triggered by photoisomerization of the retinal from its all- trans form to 13- cis and 11- cis forms. We found that intracellular proton transfer is involved in channel opening and determines the channel’s open/close kinetics. These findings expand our understanding of the photobiology of heterotrophic flagellates and demonstrate that UV-absorbing ApuRs are in fact the most blue-shifted rhodopsin channels known to date.",

          "abstract": "Mot1 in budding yeast regulates transcription by dissociating general initiation factor TBP (TATA-binding protein) from DNA. Previous studies suggested that Mot1 preferentially removes TBP from stress-responsive promoters containing consensus TATA elements that utilize coactivator SAGA while enhancing TBP binding at “house-keeping” genes with TATA-like elements that employ TFIID for TBP recruitment. In stress conditions of amino acid starvation, by contrast, we found that Mot1 promotes TBP binding at genes activated by transcription factor Gcn4, enriched for TATA/SAGA-dependent promoters, and at SAGA-dependent genes expressed constitutively at high-levels, while suppressing TBP binding at SAGA-dependent genes only expressed at lower levels. Importantly, Mot1’s influence on genes induced by starvation or oxidative stress switches from increased to decreased TBP binding when transcribed at low levels in nonstressed cells. Mot1’s role at TFIID-dependent promoters also scales with transcription level, enhancing TBP binding only for the highly expressed subset. Notably, reduced TBP binding on Mot1 depletion impairs transcription of highly expressed TFIID genes but not highly expressed SAGA/stress-activated genes, suggesting that SAGA produces a surfeit of incomplete preinitiation complexes dependent on Mot1 for assembly.",

          "abstract": "Jumping can be hazardous for entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) as those that fail to attach to an insect host face death by predation or starvation. Recently, it has been shown that electrostatic charges on large insects can prompt a close-range detachment of free-living nematodes, which are nonparasitic and unable to jump. However, it remains unclear if static electricity can influence aerial interactions between parasitic jumping worms and their insect hosts. Here, we analyze and model the trajectories of jumping EPNs in still air as they approach fruit flies with varying electrostatic charge. We find that the nematodes’ attachment to the host is facilitated by an electrical potential of a few hundred volts, a magnitude commonly found in flying insects. A model combining electrostatics, aerodynamics, and Bayesian inference indicates that the electrostatic charge on jumping nematodes is ∼ 0.1 pC, which aligns with theoretical predictions for electrostatic induction. Drag coefficients based on host–nematode interactions in the presence of horizontal wind show differences at both low and high jumping velocities. Numerical simulations show that intermediate wind speeds ( ∼ 0.2 m/s) can further increase the likelihood of host attachment, as wind-driven aerial drifting allows the worms to reach hosts at greater distances. Our results suggest that submillimeter parasites that become airborne may exploit the electric charge carried by their host to facilitate attachment and thus enhance survival. The use of quantitative physical models provides valuable insights into understanding complex airborne infectious diseases mediated by natural environmental forces.",

To investigate this issue, we screened libraries of ~100 million short (semi-)random sequences, mimicking early stages of gene birth, for genes that promote Escherichia coli survival during phage infection. This selection uncovered thousands of functional genes that confer viral resistance through at least two distinct mechanisms: 1) activation of a bacterial regulatory system that remodels the outer membrane, which provides broad-spectrum defense, and 2) transcriptional repression of bacterial outer membrane receptors required for phage adsorption, which provides phage-specific protection. Remarkably, unrelated random genes with no sequence similarity produced similar protective phenotypes, revealing that diverse sequences can converge on equivalent functions. We further showed that T4 phage rapidly evolves to counter these novel defenses, acquiring baseplate mutations that enhance adsorption to resistant hosts. Together, these findings demonstrate that random sequences can rapidly evolve into functional genes with direct fitness benefit, highlighting the evolutionary potential of de novo gene birth in the microbial world.",

In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an algorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to entry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its model is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can more easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define a multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures reputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new company needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective considerations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry—the required number of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company’s dataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for high-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing that the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which could be of independent interest.",

However, the precise mechanism of native gold formation associated with organic matter remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate gold precipitation at oil–water interfaces through in situ thermal experiments using various combinations of oil and HAuCl 4 -bearing solutions. Our results reveal that gold particles form spontaneously following the extensive generation and evolution of water microdroplets at oil–water interfaces at temperatures of 140 to 400 °C. We propose that electrons (e − ), released from the conversion of hydroxide ions (OH − ) to hydroxyl radicals (·OH) in water microdroplets, together with H atoms (·H) formed through electron transfer involving H 3 O + , and spontaneously generated H 2 O 2 from·OH recombination, drive the reduction of Au 3+ to Au 0 . The atomic gold progressively aggregates into Au 0 clusters and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), ultimately forming micrometer-scale gold particles and wires. This precipitation process occurs within minutes at temperatures above 350 °C and within hours below 200 °C. The experimentally produced gold particles exhibit textures like those in natural ore deposits. This interfacial microdroplet–induced mechanism provides a unique perspective on native gold formation in hydrocarbon-rich geosystems. Beyond its geological significance, this mechanism offers a potentially simplified approach for gold recovery from electronic waste without the need to introduce complex adsorbents or reducing agents into the waste stream.",

However, interactions between Fe nutrition of microbes, including both heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton, and viral lysis are not well known. Here, we present viral infection dynamics under Fe-limited and Fe-replete conditions for isolates of three types of marine picoplankton, the photosynthetic picoeukaryote Ostreococcus , the cyanobacterium Synechococcus , and the heterotrophic bacterium Vibrio . Iron limitation of Ostreococcus resulted in slowed growth and reduced viral burst sizes; this is similar to prior results from studies of larger eukaryotic phytoplankton, where reduced viral replication under Fe limitation is attributed to the viral reliance on host metabolism and replication machinery. Fe limitation of one Vibrio impacted dynamics of its virus similarly, lengthening the latent period before infected cells burst to release new viruses, and reducing the number of infective particles released upon lysis. In contrast, for another Vibrio isolate, Fe limitation had no discernible effect on replication of its virus. Furthermore, dynamics of three cyanophages that infect the same Synechococcus isolate were not affected by Fe limitation of the host, either in terms of latent period or burst size. The results show that some marine viruses, particularly cyanophages, can replicate efficiently even when host growth is compromised. These findings have implications for marine ecology and carbon cycling in Fe-limited regions of the global ocean.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation to different environments is thought to play a key role in speciation. However, speciation typically begins in allopatry, where reproductive isolation can also arise through neutral processes or selection unrelated to ecological differences. Disentangling the role of adaptive ecological divergence in the early stages of speciation therefore remains an important challenge in understanding the origin of new species. Here, we study threespine stickleback populations that have recently evolved in isolated postglacial lakes either in the presence or absence of prickly sculpin—a resource competitor that also shares ubiquitous trout predators with stickleback. We simulated secondary contact between several stickleback populations from these two ecological contexts in large, seminatural ponds, and genotyped offspring from 411 mating events to assess the strength of premating isolation associated with this biotic factor. Assortative mating between populations of the same ecological type (i.e., both sculpin-sympatric or both solitary) was moderate on average but ranged from weak to complete. Strikingly, and in line with a central premise of ecological speciation, the strength of premating isolation increased with increasing morphological and genomic population divergence shaped by sculpin-mediated selection. In contrast, overall phenotypic and genomic population divergence agnostic to sculpin presence/absence only poorly explained premating isolation, highlighting how ecological speciation in allopatry can be obscured by other sources of divergence. More broadly, our findings demonstrate how interactions with other ecologically similar species can play a major role in initiating and driving evolutionary trajectories toward new species, even in allopatry.",

Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation.

Here, we use six decades of continuous chemical and hydrologic data from three adjacent headwater catchments in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire—one deforested (W5), one CaSiO 3 -enriched (W1), and one reference (W6)—to quantify long-term nutrient and mineral fluxes. Acid deposition since 1900 drove pronounced depletion and export of base cations, particularly calcium, across all watersheds. Experimental deforestation of W5 intensified loss of biomass and nutrient cations and triggered sustained increases in streamwater pH, Ca 2+ , and SiO 2 exports over nearly four decades, greatly exceeding the effects of direct CaSiO 3 enrichment in both duration and magnitude. We detect no long-term changes in water yield or water flow paths in the experimental watersheds, and we attribute this multidecadal increase in weathering rates following deforestation to biological responses to severe nutrient limitation. Our evidence suggests that in the regrowing forest, plants are investing photosynthate into belowground processes that amplify mineral weathering to access phosphorus and micronutrients, consequently elevating the export of less limiting elements present in silicate parent material. Throughout decades of forest regrowth, enhanced biotic weathering has continued to deplete the acid buffering capacity of the terrestrial ecosystem while the export of weathering products has elevated the pH of the receiving stream.",

Effective bindings between T cell receptors (TCRs) and pathogen derived peptides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) mediate immune responses. However, predicting these interactions remains challenging due to limited functional data on T cell reactivities. Here, we introduce a computational approach to predict TCR interactions with peptides presented on MHC-I alleles, and to design immunogenic peptides for specified TCR–MHC complexes. Our method leverages HERMES, a structure-based machine learning model trained on the protein universe to predict amino acid preferences based on local structural environments. Despite no direct training on TCR-pMHC data, HERMES’s implicit physical reasoning enables us to make accurate predictions of both TCR–pMHC binding affinities and T cell activities across diverse viral and cancer epitopes, achieving up to 0.72 correlation with experimental data. Leveraging our TCR recognition model, we develop a computational protocol for de novo design of immunogenic peptides. Through experimental validation in three TCR–MHC systems, we demonstrate that our designs—with up to five substitutions from the native sequence—activate T cells at success rates of up to 50%. Last, we use our generative framework to quantify the diversity of the peptide recognition landscape for various TCR–MHC’s, offering key insights into T cell specificity. Our approach provides a platform for immunogenic peptide and neoantigen design, as well as for evaluating TCR specificity, offering a computational framework to inform design of engineered T cell therapies and vaccines.",

We show that Flipper-TR stains both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial membranes, exhibiting fluorescence lifetimes shorter than those in eukaryotic cells, with slight variations between bacterial types and likely reflecting differences in membrane composition. Flipper-TR displays lifetime variations along the vertical axis of bacterial cells, suggesting spatial differences in membrane tension influenced by cell wall architecture. Our results further demonstrate that Flipper-TR is responsive to the nature of bacterial interactions with surfaces. By comparing bacterial immobilization on surfaces with different coatings, we show that Flipper-TR can sensitively distinguish differences in membrane tension arising from distinct adhesion mechanisms. Additionally, Flipper-TR detects changes in membrane tension when bacteria are exposed to engineered nanostructured substrates.

          "abstract": "Rapid and accurate estimation of protein–ligand binding affinities is crucial for early-stage drug discovery, yet hindered by a trade-off between the accuracy of gold-standard physics-based methods and the speed of simpler empirical scoring functions. Machine learning (ML) promised to bridge this gap, but its potential is unrealized due to limited model generalizability. Current ML models often fail when predicting affinities for novel proteins or chemical series unseen during training. We hypothesize that this failure stems from a competition within these models during training, where the learning of spurious correlations from structural motifs prevalent in the training data competes with the learning of transferable, physicochemical principles governing molecular interaction. Here, we introduce COnvolutional Representation of Distance-dependent Interactions with Attention Learning (CORDIAL), a deep learning framework designed with an inductive bias toward learning the distance-dependent physicochemical interaction signatures between proteins and ligands, explicitly avoiding direct parameterization of their chemical structures. This interaction-only approach proves effective. Through leave-superfamily-out validation that simulates encounters with novel protein families, we demonstrate that CORDIAL maintains predictive performance and calibration. This contrasts with diverse contemporary ML models, whose predictive ability is degraded under these conditions. Our results highlight the value of encoding appropriate task-specific physicochemical principles into ML architectures and offer a validated strategy for developing generalizable models for structure-based drug discovery.",

In its functional cycle, besides local conformational changes near the nucleotides that are commonly observed in monomeric signaling GTPases, the relative positioning of the two Rag subunits, i.e., the global conformation, is unique due to the heterodimeric architecture. Although various global conformations have been captured in static structural models, dynamic transitions between these conformations and their biological relevance remain unclear. Here, we visualize the global conformation of the Rag GTPase heterodimer using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. By tracking the movement of individual protein molecules, we found that the two subunits explore a wide conformational space, which is strictly dictated by the bound nucleotides, regulators, and mutations.

Light is a pivotal environmental cue fundamentally regulating plant growth and development. In temperate grasses, how light regulates flowering time remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize a blue-light photoreceptor, FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1), which functions as a flowering promoter in Brachypodium distachyon . Loss-of-function mutations in FKF1 result in delayed flowering under long-day conditions, whereas overexpression of FKF1 strongly accelerates flowering. We show that FKF1 controls the stability of floral repressor EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) in response to blue light. FKF1 directly interacts with and catalyzes the ubiquitination of ELF3, leading to protein degradation of ELF3 via the 26S proteasome pathway. Blue light can strengthen the interaction between FKF1 and ELF3, thereby accelerating degradation of ELF3. Moreover, ELF3 physically interacts with SWINGER and CURLY LEAF, two core subunits of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and mediates the subsequent deposition of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) for stable transcriptional silencing of the flowering activator PHOTOPERIOD 1 . Remarkably, the FKF1–ELF3–PRC2 regulatory module-mediated flowering time control in response to light is likely conserved across temperate grasses. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which light modulates H3K27me3 deposition to regulate flowering time in temperate grasses. This mechanism also allows plants to adapt to dynamically changing environments.",

To overcome this, microRNA (miRNA) target sequences were incorporated into mRNA constructs to restrict expression specifically to germ cells. Using pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit alpha 2 (PDHA2) knockout mice as an NOA model with meiotic arrest, we demonstrate that LNP-mediated delivery of Pdha2 mRNA enables the resumption and completion of meiosis, restores sperm production, and facilitates the generation of healthy fertile offspring via ICSI. Whole-genome sequencing of the offspring confirmed the absence of large-scale genomic abnormalities. Our results provide proof of concept for a safe and effective chemically synthesized LNP-based mRNA therapy with miRNA-regulated germ cell specificity, offering a promising therapeutic approach to treating male infertility caused by spermatogenesis arrest.",

          "abstract": "Free tropospheric (FT) nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) plays a critical role in atmospheric oxidant chemistry as a source of tropospheric ozone and of the hydroxyl radical (OH). It also contributes significantly to satellite-observed tropospheric NO 2 columns, which should be considered when using these columns to quantify surface emissions of nitrogen oxide radicals (NO x ≡ NO + NO 2 ). But large uncertainties remain in the sources and chemistry of FT NO 2 because observations are sparse. Here, we construct a cloud-sliced FT NO 2 (700 to 300 hPa) product from the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) geostationary satellite instrument over North America. This product provides higher data density and quality than previous products from low Earth orbit instruments, including the first observations of the FT NO 2 diurnal cycle in different seasons. Combined with coincident observations from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper, the TEMPO data imply that lightning is the dominant source of FT NO x in nonwinter seasons. Comparison of TEMPO FT NO 2 data with the Goddard Earth Observation System-Composition Forecasts (GEOS-CF) atmospheric chemistry model shows overall consistent magnitudes, seasonality, and diurnal variation, with a midday minimum in nonwinter seasons from photochemical loss. However, there are major discrepancies that we attribute to GEOS-CF’s use of a standard cloud-top-height-based scheme for the lightning NO x source. We find that this scheme underestimates offshore lighting flash density and misrepresents the diurnal cycle of lightning over land. Our FT NO 2 product provides a unique resource for improving the lightning NO x parameterization in atmospheric models and the ability to use NO 2 observations from space to quantify surface NO x emissions.",

Elevated protein synthesis creates a dependency on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins and chaperones, which are required to maintain proteostasis. In this study, we identified the protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) PDIA1 and PDIA5, which play a critical role in folding of client proteins in the ER, as important regulators of prostate cancer growth and response to therapy. PDIA1 and PDIA5 are upregulated in prostate cancer and induced by the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis. Genetic or pharmacological disabling of PDIA1/PDIA5 caused redox stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, growth inhibition, and death of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The critical functions of these enzymes in redox homeostasis and cell survival were observed in both AR-driven and AR-independent models of prostate cancer. Loss of PDIA1/PDIA5 activity led to ubiquitination and degradation of the AR, revealing a feedback loop between these chaperones and the AR pathway. Mechanistically, PDIA1/PDIA5 regulated AR stability by mediating disulfide bond formation, an activity that required cysteines 669 and 844 in AR’s ligand-binding domain. Importantly, targeting PDIAs sensitized prostate cancer cells to the AR antagonist, enzalutamide. This study reveals a mechanism governing AR proteostasis in prostate cancer and positions PDIA1/5 as viable therapeutic targets.",

However, despite aging being the primary risk factor for AD, it remains unclear whether men and women differ in the extent of brain decline with age. Using 12,638 longitudinal brain MRIs from 4,726 participants aged 17 to 95 y across 14 cohorts, we examined sex differences in structural brain changes over time, controlling for differences in head size. Men showed greater cortical thickness (CT) decline in the cuneus, lingual, parahippocampal, and pericalcarine regions; surface area decline in the fusiform and postcentral regions; and in older adults, greater subcortical decline in the caudate, nucleus accumbens, putamen, and pallidum. In contrast, women only showed greater surface area decline in the banks of the superior temporal sulcus and greater ventricular expansion in older adults. These results suggest that sex differences in age-related brain decline are unlikely to contribute to the higher AD diagnosis prevalence in women, necessitating research into alternative explanations.",

The phase diagram contains three distinct superconducting phases: SC 1 in which φ and θ extend from 0 to 90° and H ≤ ~15 T; SC 2 for φ ≤ ~7°, θ ≤ ~4° and ~15 T ≤ H ≤ H m = ~35 T, the onset of the magnetic field polarized (FP) phase, and SC FP which resides entirely within the FP phase in a pocket of superconductivity extending from θ ≈ 20° to 40° and from ~40 T to above 60 T. We studied the evolution of the H vs. θ phase diagram for Th concentrations 0.005 ≤ x ≤ 0.047 in the U 1-x Th x Te 2 system at ~0.6 K. Within this range of x values, SC 1 extends over 0 ≤ θ ≤ 90° and H ≤ ~10 T for x = 0.047, while SC 2 is suppressed. The SC FP and FP phases are unaffected to x = 0.02 but are completely suppressed in the region x = 0.025 to 0.047 where the residual resistance ratio RRR ~3 indicates a significant amount of disorder. These results complement recent studies of nonsuperconducting disordered UTe 2 single crystals in which the SC 1 and SC 2 phases are absent, but the FP and so-called “orphan” SC FP phases are retained.",

The mechanisms regulating CMS protein accumulation remain unclear. Here, we explored this process using wild-abortive CMS (CMS-WA) rice ( Oryza sativa ). We show that WA352, the causal protein of CMS-WA, is degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). Structural analysis and protein truncation assays revealed that the N terminus of WA352 is critical for its anchoring to the inner mitochondrial membrane and its UPS-mediated degradation. Functional complementation confirmed that WA352 151–352 , lacking the N-terminal domain, accumulates constitutively in vegetative tissues, causing a reactive oxygen species burst and retarding rice growth. We further identified three mitochondrion-localized F-box proteins that participate in WA352 ubiquitination and degradation. Our findings demonstrate that UPS-mediated regulation restricts WA352 accumulation to anthers, allowing it to specifically disrupt anther development, thus helping to explain the male-specific effects of CMS genes in plants.",

          "abstract": "In arthropods, bacterial infection activates dual oxidase 2 (Duox2) to produce extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), while stimulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) through immune deficiency (Imd)/Relish pathway. Although both strategies contribute significantly to antibacterial immunity, the Duox2/ROS system and Relish/AMPs pathway are generally considered separate branches. In the present study, we report that these two branches are connected by an aquaporin 4 (Aqp4) in a crustacean, the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii . Aqp4 is found to be critical for the crayfish antibacterial response. The significance of Aqp4 is achieved by transporting extracellular ROS into the intracellular compartment after bacterial infection. The increase in intracellular ROS levels, mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, promotes the nuclear translocation and thereby the transcriptional activity of FoxO. As the key transcription factor of Relish, FoxO regulates the upregulation of Relish and ultimately the expression of Relish-targeting AMPs. By linking ROS production to AMP expression, the sequential ROS/Aqp4/FoxO/Relish/AMPs axis makes a relatively significant, yet previously unnoticed, contribution to the antibacterial response. Therefore, this study reveals the intriguing association between ROS production and AMP expression, the two central antibacterial strategies and provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms of arthropod immunity.",

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been associated with alterations in neuronal activity in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical (BGTC) network. Previous studies have suggested that cortical disinhibition is a feature of PD, but there has been little direct evidence of the changes in cortical neuronal spiking activity to support this hypothesis. To test the hypothesis that activity in the motor cortex is enhanced in PD, we investigated the effects of parkinsonism on movement-related neuronal activity in the primary motor cortex (M1). Microelectrode arrays were chronically implanted in M1 of two nonhuman primates and populations of cells were collected before and after the induction of parkinsonism using the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. In both animals, we found that during the reaching task in the parkinsonian state, the proportion of M1 neurons that were activated (excited) during movement were increased, while those that were suppressed (inhibited) decreased. These data support the concept that dopaminergic loss in parkinsonism promotes a loss of inhibition in the motor cortex, leading to overactivity in M1 and a disruption in spatial-temporal processing of information within the BGTC circuit that contributes to the motor dysfunction observed in PD.",

Their architectural scale, complexity, and integration with the terrain suggest a high degree of communal organization, landscape knowledge, and planning. Although direct dating remains inconclusive, associated stratigraphy indicates they were abandoned before the Late Bronze Age, pointing to a potentially earlier origin. These structures may represent the westernmost examples of a broader tradition of large-scale hunting installations previously known only from the arid zones of Southwest Asia and North Africa.

Structures of substrate-bound AAA+ complexes suggest that these enzymes employ a conserved hand-over-hand mechanism to thread substrates through their central pore.

We used cryoelectron microscopy to structurally interrogate reaction intermediates from in vitro biochemical assays to inform the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the human mitochondrial AAA+ protease, LONP1. Our results demonstrate that substrate binding, rather than nucleotide binding, activates the assembly and allosterically regulates proteolytic activity. The N-terminal domain plays a critical role in this process and facilitates the initial stages of substrate selection and engagement. Moreover, structures of LONP1 actively degrading a substrate in the presence of ATP provide important context to the conventional understanding of the hand-over-hand translocation mechanism, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is likely not limited to a single position in the right-handed spiral during the hand-over-hand translocation mechanism.",

These studies typically identify functional connectivity (FC) patterns linked to behavioral traits using either whole-brain or region-wise predictive models. However, whole-brain models often struggle with generalizability and interpretability due to the high dimensionality of FC data, while region-wise models isolate predictions, limiting their ability to capture the integrated contributions of brain-wide FC patterns. In this study, we introduce an interpretable predictive model that learns fine-grained FC patterns predictive of behavioral traits, jointly at the regional and participant levels, to characterize the overall association of FC patterns with a target trait. Our model jointly learns a relevance score and a dedicated prediction function for each brain region, then integrates the regional predictions using the relevance scores as weights to generate a participant-level prediction, capturing the collective association of FC patterns with the trait. We validated our method using FC data from 6,798 participants in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to predict cognition. Our model identified the cingulo-parietal, retrosplenial-temporal, dorsal attention, and cingulo-opercular networks as collectively predictive of cognitive traits, achieved competitive prediction accuracy, and enabled detailed characterization of fine-grained FC differences across cognitive domains. The learned relevance scores enhanced region-wise predictions of longitudinal cognitive measures in the ABCD cohort and cognitive traits in the Human Connectome Project Development cohort. These findings suggest that our method effectively characterizes generalizable and fine-grained FC patterns linked to cognition in youth.",

Namely, we build a neural network architecture using a physics-based metric called the Asymmetric Dynamic Coupling Index (DCI asym ), which quantifies the degree to which each member of a pair of residues influences the flexibility of the other. DCI asym enables us to train models through an allosteric Graph Neural Network (GNN) in which each residue is linked to its distant dynamic influencers. Despite not being trained on experimental epistasis data, our GNN consistently outperforms existing approaches on deep mutational scanning datasets across four distinct proteins, highlighting its enhanced capacity to model epistatic interactions. Our GNN model was then challenged to predict the functions of 37 novel, computationally designed TEM-1 β-lactamase variants of unknown function, and it demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy for these variants. Thus, our GNN provides a pathway for better assessing the impact of multiple mutations on protein function, including epistatic relationships and mutations that have profound effects on activity despite being spatially far from the active site.",

          "abstract": "Speech comprehension involves transforming an acoustic waveform into meaning. To do so, the human brain generates a hierarchy of features that converts the sensory input into increasingly abstract language properties. However, little is known about how rapid incoming sequences of hierarchical features are continuously coordinated. Here, we propose that each language feature is supported by a dynamic neural code, which represents the sequence history of hierarchical features in parallel. To test this “hierarchical dynamic coding” (HDC) hypothesis, we use time-resolved decoding of brain activity to track the construction, maintenance, and update of a comprehensive hierarchy of language features spanning phonetic, word form, lexical–syntactic, syntactic, and semantic representations. For this, we recorded 21 native English participants with magnetoencephalography (MEG), while they listened to two hours of short stories in English. Our analyses reveal three main findings. First, the brain represents and simultaneously maintains a sequence of hierarchical features. Second, the duration of these representations depends on their level in the language hierarchy. Third, each representation is maintained by a dynamic neural code, which evolves at a speed commensurate with its corresponding linguistic level. This HDC preserves the maintenance of information over time while limiting destructive interference between successive features. Overall, HDC reveals how the human brain maintains and updates the continuously unfolding language hierarchy during natural speech comprehension, thereby anchoring linguistic theories to their biological implementations.",

DMD treatment requires a body-wide approach to target all diseased striated muscles: limb, respiratory, and heart. To address this, we focus studies on blocking the onset of muscle membrane instability, the primary defect in DMD, as a promising yet unmet druggable target. Here, data show the remarkable potency of a synthetic poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(propylene oxide) side chain–based bottlebrush block copolymer, ~150,000 times more potent than linear polymers, to rapidly restore contractile function to DMD skeletal muscle fibers in vitro. Strikingly, upon bottlebrush polymer delivery to DMD animals, results show highly efficacious prevention of the onset of skeletal and diaphragm muscle damage and the blocking of stress-induced cardiac injury and death in vivo. These data suggest bottlebrush polymers as a potent stand-alone muscle membrane-stabilizing therapeutic for DMD. Given DMD’s early childhood onset, together with newborn screening for DMD, bottlebrush macromolecules could be envisioned as an early therapy to preserve and protect viable muscle and potentially for other acquired or inherited diseases involving membrane damage.",

          "abstract": "Hydrothermal vent temperatures fluctuate in response to transient magmatic and tectonic activity at the axis of mid-ocean ridges (MORs) and modulate energy fluxes from the deep Earth to the ocean. Such fluctuations have thus far only been documented on time scales of minutes to years, because of the scarcity of long, continuous observations. Here, we assemble a ~35-year-long time series of exit fluid temperatures from five hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise axis, between 9°46’-51’N. This dataset reveals a steady increase in maximum venting temperatures atop the central part of the axial magma lens (AML), from ~350 °C to ~390 °C between the 1991–92 and 2005–06 eruptions. Temperatures decreased back to ~350 °C shortly after the 2005–06 eruption and have been rising ever since. We interpret the temperature increase as a result of a steady decrease in upflow zone permeability caused by the steady inflation of the AML compressing the oceanic upper crust. Using laboratory-determined pressure–permeability relations, we estimate crustal pressurization rates of 0.38 MPa/y (1992–2005) and 0.33 MPa/y (post-2006), consistent with geodetic observations from 2009–2011. Decadal fluctuations in hydrothermal vent temperatures likely mimic the rate of AML pressurization, yielding valuable new constraints on the dynamics of magmatic replenishment and eruptions at MORs. Notably, this temperature time series underpinned our forecast of the April 2025 eruption at the study site.",

To explain how transport emerges from the system components and their interactions, we used experimental data and theoretical information to construct an integrative Brownian dynamics model of transport through an NPC, coupled to a kinetic model of transport in the cell. The model recapitulates key aspects of transport for a wide range of molecular cargoes, including preribosomes and viral capsids. Our model quantifies how flexible phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat proteins create an entropic barrier to passive diffusion and how this barrier is selectively lowered in facilitated diffusion by the many transient interactions of nuclear transport receptors with the FG repeats. Selective transport is enhanced by “fuzzy” multivalent interactions, redundant FG repeat mass, coupling to the energy-dependent RanGTP concentration gradient, and exponential dependence of transport kinetics on the transport barrier. Our model will facilitate rational modulation of the NPC and its artificial mimics.",

          "abstract": "Methane is ubiquitous in groundwater, and its release to surface environments through pumping, discharge, or diffusion is an emerging environmental concern. Microbial oxidation consumes methane and mitigates its release, but quantitative constraints in groundwater remain unknown. Using ultra-low-level 14 C-labeling, we estimate in situ microbial methane oxidation rates in shallow carbonate and sandy aquifers from central and northern Germany with methane concentrations spanning 5 orders of magnitude, from 0.15 ± 0.04 to 36,250 ± 1,390 µg L −1 . Oxidation rates ranged from 0.001 ± 0.0003 to 74.28 ± 46.94 µgC L −1 d −1 and were highly correlated with groundwater methane concentrations. Oxidation-based methane turnover was rapid at low methane concentrations, with complete consumption requiring days to weeks. In contrast, microbial oxidation at high methane sites required months to decades for complete methane turnover, indicating the potential for unconsumed methane to leak into local streams or wetlands. High oxidation rates were associated with gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs that typically thrive in suboxic conditions and anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea, while uncultivated methanotrophs of the Methylomirabilota and Verrucomicrobiota dominated low-rate sites. Based on globally distributed groundwater methane concentration data, we extrapolated the strong observed correlation between methane concentrations and oxidation rates to global groundwater volumes, estimating that microbial oxidation removes ~66% of groundwater methane globally, equivalent to 167 to 778 Tg CH 4 y −1 . This highlights the groundwater microbiome as a crucial subsurface methane filter that reduces methane release to surface waters, soils, and the atmosphere.",

Yet, in a handful of species, females cease reproduction long before death, highlighting an apparent evolutionary paradox. We used over three decades of life-history and behavioral data to examine the prevalence of postreproductive lifespan in wild mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringei beringei ). Almost one third of females in our study population (7/25) have been “postreproductive” according to a commonly used criterion and have lived more than a decade past their age of last reproduction, representing at least a fourth of their adult lifespan. Additionally, using conservative estimates of female ages, we found a significant post-reproductive representation (a common population-level measure of post-reproductive lifespan) equal to 0.10. Our results add to observations of postreproductive lifespan in chimpanzees and humans and thus, they represent a critical addition to our understanding of hominid life-history evolution.",

Although these genomic alterations are often attributed to the action of error-prone DNA polymerases on UV-induced DNA lesions during replicative DNA synthesis, UV damage can also result in mutagenic and recombinogenic DNA damage in nondividing cells. We examined the effects of UV on cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arrested in G 1 of the cell cycle. By mating an irradiated haploid with an unirradiated haploid, we found that recombination was initiated only on the irradiated chromosome. This result indicates that trans effects of UV on recombination (for example, induction of recombinogenic proteins stimulating DNA breaks on the unirradiated homolog) are small or negligible. In addition, we show that most of the UV-induced mutations produced in G 1 -irradiated cells result in mutations at identical positions in both strands of the duplex. As observed for recombination events, mutations are almost exclusively on the irradiated chromosome, indicating the near absence of a trans effect on mutations.",

Here, we report that both PRC1 and USP16 are also localized in mitochondria and influence mitochondrial function directly. Our findings are based on immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assays, cell fractionation, and biochemical analyses of isolated or affinity-purified mitochondria. We further showed that PRC1 and USP16 function with the ubiquitin pathway. Auxin-induced, mitochondria-specific depletion of the PRC1 subunit RING2 altered the ubiquitination status of mitochondrial proteins, including H2Aub. Disruption of PRC1, either through double knockout (KO) of RING1 and RING2 or through mitochondria-specific deletion of RING2 in the RING1 KO background, caused profound alterations in mitochondrial proteome and led to disturbances in mitochondrial integrity and impaired respiratory function. Thus, in addition to their canonical functions in the nucleus, PRC1 and USP16 also translocate into mitochondria and directly impact mitochondrial integrity and function.",

We use a reconstruction of changes in δ 18 O of seawater to reconstruct GMSL since 4.5 million years ago (Ma) that accounts for temperature-driven changes in the δ 18 O of global ice sheets. Between 4.5 and 3 Ma, sea level highstands remained up to 20 m above present whereas the first lowstands below present suggest onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at 4 Ma. Intensification of global glaciation occurred from 3 Ma to 2.5 Ma, culminating in lowstands similar to the Last Glacial Maximum lowstand at 21,000 years ago and that reoccurred throughout much of the Pleistocene. We attribute the middle Pleistocene transition in ice sheet variability (1.2 Ma to 0.62 Ma) to modulation of 41-thousand-year (kyr) obliquity forcing by an increase in ~100-kyr CO 2 variability.",

Introgression of a new transposable element insertion and linked protein-coding variation underpin a transspecific throat color polymorphism, which stable isotopes suggest is associated with alternative foraging niches. Cointrogression of linked regulatory ASIP variation resulted in mantle color convergence in one species, whereas convergent color evolution at the genus level required new variation.

Analysis of different additives and ionomers shows that the stabilization mechanism involves cross-links between metal oxo/hydroxo oligomers and ionomers.

Within 4 milliseconds of synaptic activation, SVs transiently “kiss” the plasma membrane, forming a ~4-nanometer lipidic fusion pore flanked by putative soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes and then rapidly “shrink” to approximately half of their original surface area. By 70 milliseconds, most shrunken SVs recycle via a “run-away” pathway, whereas others collapse into the presynaptic membrane. Ultrafast endocytosis retrieves the expanded presynaptic membrane after 100 milliseconds.

In this study, we show that this organ is specialized to retain microbial symbionts rather than to perceive sound. The organ’s surface is not membranous but consists of porous cuticle in which each pore connects to glandular secretory cells. In reproductive females, the hindleg organ is covered with fungal hyphae that grow from the pores. Upon oviposition, the females transfer the fungi from the organ to the eggs, where the hyphae physically protect the eggs against wasp parasitism. The fungi comprise a diversity of mostly low-pathogenicity Cordycipitaceae.",

The key difficulty lies in the simultaneous activation of chemically inert feedstocks and precise stereochemical control. Here, we report a catalytic stereodivergent allylation of unprotected cyclic hemiacetal aldols with butene, enabling the programmable synthesis of polypropionates—privileged structural motifs prevalent in biologically active compounds, including pharmaceuticals. This visible light–driven, selective transformation exhibits broad functional group compatibility, furnishing 1,3-polyols with multiple contiguous stereocenters in high yield and stereochemical fidelity. Moreover, this method provides a concise and practical route to key natural product intermediates with minimal protection–deprotection sequences. This strategy has the potential to streamline polypropionate synthesis while reducing the time, cost, and environmental impact.",

We report an experimental realization of an electrically controlled interlayer trion fluid in van der Waals heterostructures. In strongly coupled e-h bilayers, electrons and holes spontaneously form three-particle trion bound states. The interlayer trions can assume 1e-2h and 2e-1h configurations. We show that the two holes in 1e-2h trions form a spin-singlet with a spin gap of approximately one milli–electron volt. By electrostatic gating, the equilibrium state can be continuously tuned into an exciton fluid, a trion fluid, an exciton-trion mixture, or a trion-charge mixture. Our work demonstrates a platform to study correlated phases of tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures.",

Active modifications to the spatial environment could therefore be a potent tool to mitigate epidemic risk. We tested whether Lasius niger ants modify their nest architecture in response to pathogens by introducing control- or pathogen-treated individuals into nest-digging groups and monitoring three-dimensional nest morphogenesis. Pathogen exposure led to architectural changes, including faster nest growth, increased interentrance distance, transmission-inhibitory changes in nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced transmission and highlighted a synergy between architectural and behavioral responses to disease. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organization can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.",

These neurons represented the bats’ orientation stably across the island’s entire geographical scale and irrespective of the dynamics of the Moon and the Milky Way. The directional tuning stabilized over several nights from the first exploration of the island. These results imply that head-direction cells can serve as a learned, reliable neural compass for real-world navigation—highlighting the power of taking neuroscience out into the wild.",

The CDK-activating kinase (CAK) acts as a master regulator of CDK activity by catalyzing the activating phosphorylation of CDKs on a conserved threonine residue within the regulatory T-loop. However, structural data illuminating the mechanism by which the CAK recognizes and activates CDKs have remained elusive. Here, we determine high-resolution structures of the CAK in complex with CDK2 and CDK2-cyclin A2 by cryogenic electron microscopy. Our structures reveal a T-loop–independent kinase-kinase interface with contributions from both kinase lobes. Computational analysis and structures of CAK in complex with CDK1-cyclin B1 and CDK11 indicate that these structures represent the general architecture of CAK-CDK complexes. These results advance our mechanistic understanding of cell cycle regulation and kinase signaling cascades.",

One promising approach to overcoming resistance is using small molecules that resensitize MRSA to existing drugs. Here, we report the enantioselective total synthesis of one such promising candidate, (−)-spiroaspertrione A, a complex meroterpenoid of the andiconin family. This natural product has long eluded synthesis because of its densely functionalized polycyclic backbone. Our route features a stereoselective Diels-Alder cycloaddition, followed by a key divinylcyclopropane rearrangement forming the spirobicyclo[3.2.2]nonane core, which proved to be reversible and was further investigated by density functional theory calculations. Strategic late-stage functionalization of the compact cage architecture enabled access to the natural product and provided evidence for a plausible biosynthetic relationship with (−)-aspermerodione.",

However, existing high-resolution fluorescence microscopes are physically limited by objective-to-specimen distance, which prevents the study of whole-mount specimens without physical sectioning. To address this challenge, we developed a photochemical strategy for spatially precise sectioning of specimens. By combining serial photochemical sectioning with lattice light-sheet imaging and petabyte-scale computation, we imaged and reconstructed axons and myelin sheaths across entire mouse olfactory bulbs at nanoscale resolution. An olfactory bulb–wide analysis of myelinated and unmyelinated axons revealed distinctive patterns of axon degeneration and de-/dysmyelination in the neurodegenerative brain, highlighting the potential for peta- to exabyte-scale super-resolution studies using this approach.",

Through integration with scRNA-seq, we identified proteins important for stem cell function, which were not indicated by their mRNA transcripts. Further, we showed that modeling translation dynamics can infer cell progression during differentiation and explain substantially more protein variation from mRNA than linear correlation.

          "abstract": "Metal ions are essential in regulating protein functions through interactions with residues such as cysteine, but comprehensive mapping of metal-specific metalloproteomes in mammals remains limited. Here, we introduce CysMP, a cysteine-centered metalloprotein profiling strategy to profile the metalloproteomes of 11 key metal ions. CysMP identified 8895 metal-binding sites across 4150 proteins, enabling quantitative comparisons between different metals and revealing both their binding promiscuity and preferences. Notably, zinc and copper ions exhibit the broadest protein interaction profiles. CysMP uncovers numerous potential metalloproteins. We demonstrate that copper and zinc bind to and inhibit 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, resulting in the accumulation of 5′-methylthioadenosine. Furthermore, copper binding suppresses phosphoglycerate kinase 1 activity, leading to a down-regulation of glycolysis. Our work not only establishes a valuable resource for a dual-specific metalloproteome database but also paves the way for understanding the molecular insights of metalloprotein functions.",

In contrast, the mycobiome and resident viruses showed no significant coevolution with host immunity.

A multijunction structure was designed using SnO 2 /ZnO as n-type oxide semiconductors and CoO x combined with defect-engineered HfO x as p-type semiconductors, with ITO serving as the cathode. The photodiode exhibited excellent photoresponse in the 340 to 350 nm wavelength range, with an average visible transmittance of ~75% and a responsivity of 80.1 mA W −1 .

This study examines how rifting-induced tilting of an escarpment-plateau landscape led to changes in drainage area and water divide positions. Combining topographic analysis and erosion rates inferred from cosmogenic isotope concentrations, we document a westward-tilted low-relief plateau with sinuous remnant escarpments along the western margin and a linear, high-relief escarpment corresponding to the modern drainage divide on the eastern margin. Our numerical modeling demonstrates that landscape asymmetry and contrasting escarpment morphology can result from a shift in the main water divide across the island during the second rifting event. These mechanistic processes allow us to reconstruct the landscape evolution of Madagascar over more than 100 million years with profound implications for the topography, hydrology, and biodiversity development of passive continental margins.",

Myeloid cells enriched at CC sites increased AIBP expression postischemia. Genetic deletion of AIBP expanded CXCR4⁺ capillary endothelial cells ( CECs) with stemlike and proliferative properties that remodeled into functional collaterals, a process blocked by CXCR4 inhibition. Mechanistically, AIBP bound the endocytic receptor LRP2 to promote endothelial uptake of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)–associated miR-223, a repressor of CXCR4. Disruption of this AIBP–LRP2–HDL–miR-223 axis restored CXCR4 and rescued CC growth. These findings define a two-phase mechanism in which stemlike CECs first expand and then transition to arterial fates, establishing a therapeutic strategy for revascularization in ischemic vascular disease.",

          "abstract": "Arsenic is a potent carcinogen whose presence in groundwater poses a persistent global public health threat. While groundwater treatment mitigates arsenic exposure, it generates concentrated arsenic-rich by-products that are universally considered economic and environmental burdens. However, arsenic is experiencing a renaissance. Both the United States and European Union have classified arsenic as a critical raw material (CRM) due to the role of metallic arsenic [As(0)] in materials needed for digital infrastructure and clean energy systems. Bringing these two material flows together, we show that arsenic removed during groundwater treatment can be transformed into pure amorphous As(0) nanoparticles via a two-stage process of alkali extraction and selective reduction. The creation of valuable CRMs from carcinogenic treatment by-products is a potentially disruptive technology for the water sector that can alter global As(0) supply chains. Revenue from upcycled As(0) can also help improve the challenging economics of water treatment in marginalized arsenic-affected regions.",

On the basis of Earth’s core mass fraction and oxygen fugacity during core formation, a self-consistent hydrous core-mantle differentiation model yields a bulk Earth water content of ~0.23 weight % (equivalently ~10 ocean masses), a bulk Earth magnesium/silicon ratio of 1.16 ± 0.01, and a mantle magnesium/silicon ratio of 1.25 to 1.28.

The spatial complexities in swarm evolution and earthquake rupture have been observed, but the factors controlling these complexities remain unclear. Using high-resolution subsurface imaging with dense seismic observation, we identified a high-velocity body collocated with the major slip zone, which the preceding swarm avoided. The spatial distribution and absolute velocity of the high-velocity body and the adjacent ring-shaped swarm cluster indicate that the high-velocity body is a solidified ancient magma. It initially acted as an impermeable barrier to the fluid migrations that triggered swarm earthquakes, eventually rupturing as an asperity of the 2024 earthquake. Our observation suggests that the heterogeneity in fault zone permeability, originating from ancient volcanic activity (&gt;15 million years ago), controlled the present-day swarm evolution and the large earthquake generation.",

ATP molecules were bound at two of the three catalytic sites of V/A-ATPase, confirming that the structure represents a state adopted during ATP synthesis. In this structure, the catalytic site closes upon binding of ADP and Pi through an induced fit mechanism. Multiple structures were obtained where the membrane-embedded rotor ring was in a different position relative to the stator. By comparing these structures, we found that torsion occurs in both the central rotor and the peripheral stator during 31° rotation of rotor ring.

          "abstract": "A common developmental response to resource competition is an inducible offense, the facultative predation of competitors. At its extreme, this response involves the development of alternative phenotypic morphs, or polyphenism. However, how polyphenism evolves to meet ecological challenges, such as competitor species, is unknown. Using replicated experimental evolution, during which starved nematodes could consume heterospecific competitors, we investigated whether induction of a predatory morph could evolve and how generalizable this change’s genetic basis is. Fifty generations of evolution across multiple populations resulted in parallel changes in higher morph-induction and parallel genomic responses, including repeated selection for a specific transcription-factor binding-site variant. In tandem, we artificially selected directly for tooth morphology and drove the predatory morph near to fixation. That trait-specific selection promoted greater changes in predatory morph induction than experimental evolution indicates that polyphenism evolution is balanced by selection for whole-organism performance. Our results thus describe the predictability by which a resource polyphenism evolves amid scarce resources.",

Here, we show that micronuclei in hepatocytes trigger a hepatic immune response and promote HCC development via an increased level of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA). Livers of a CLD model ( Mcl1 Δhep mice) show increased micronuclei and eccDNA levels. Circular sequencing confirms higher eccDNA levels in micronuclei compared to primary nuclei. The nuclei-segregated DNA fiber (NuSeF) assay we developed demonstrates that micronuclei are more susceptible to replication stress, exhibiting increased replication fork slowing. Comparing different murine liver disease models reveals that high eccDNA correlates with an increased tumor incidence. eccDNA is a strong immunostimulant and promotes a cross-talk between hepatocytes and immune cells through the cGAS-STING pathway. Deletion of Sting1 in Mcl1 Δhep mice reduces immune cell chemotaxis and tumor incidence. Our findings suggest that eccDNA from micronuclei mediates inflammation-driven liver carcinogenesis in CLD.",

Long thought to require full machinery spatiotemporal coordination to drive the flat-to-round vesicle transformations, we reveal a notably simple initiation mechanism in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells involving only the final step, the pore closure. During calcium-triggered exocytosis, calcium activates the phosphatase synaptojanin, rapidly converting PI(4,5)P 2 to PI4P. Elevated PI4P drives the fission enzyme dynamin to close the pores of preexisting and exocytosis-generated Ω-profiles, which are sufficient to generate slow, fast, ultrafast, overshoot, and bulk endocytosis, and kiss-and-run (fusion pore closure). These findings resolve the long-standing mystery of endocytosis and fission initiation and reveal PI4P, not the widely assumed PI(4,5)P 2 , as the key lipid for dynamin-mediated fission. This pathway is clinically important, as it is impaired by synaptojanin mutations associated with Parkinson’s disease and seizures, and is likely disrupted in other disorders involving PI4P or PI(4,5)P 2 dysregulation.",

Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells from patients with glioma, NR4A family genes were identified as closely associated with T cell exhaustion and were coexpressed with dysfunctional genes HAVCR2 and TIGIT . Notably, CAR T cells with NR4A3 knockdown exhibited enhanced cytotoxic activity against tumors, leading to improved tumor clearance and prolonged survival in vivo. However, the promoted antiexhausted phenotype diminished with prolonged tumor burden. This decline in T cell function correlates with the compensatory down-regulation of FOS induced by chronic antigen exposure following NR4A3 knockdown. Overexpressing FOS alongside NR4A3 knockdown robustly boosted the antitumor responses of CAR T cells by skewing their phenotypes and transcriptional profiles away from exhaustion and toward increased effector function.

Its mode of action has remained unknown through its seven decades of clinical use. Here, we identify 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO), a key mediator of targeted protein degradation, as a selective HYZ target. The drug chelates ADO’s metallocofactor and can alkylate one of its ligands. The resultant inactivation stabilizes regulators of G protein signaling (RGS4 and RGS5) that ADO normally marks for proteolysis, explaining the drug’s vasodilatory activity and comporting with observations of diminished RGS levels in both clinical preeclampsia and a mouse model thereof. Its inhibition of ADO suggested use of HYZ against glioblastoma (GBM); indeed, a single dose robustly senesces cultured GBM cells. By establishing ADO as a nexus for GBM and preeclampsia and connecting it to HYZ, the results create opportunities for directed tailoring of the old drug for new therapies.",

We addressed this issue by acquiring functional near-infrared spectroscopy data from infants aged 3 to 9 months with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The SNHL infants showed efficient small-world characteristics within each hemisphere. However, unlike typically developing controls, who showed an age-related leftward lateralization of network efficiencies, SNHL infants did not exhibit the emergence of hemispheric asymmetry. Intriguingly, lateralization of frontal efficiency was preserved in SNHL infants with mild hearing loss but declined significantly with increasing severity of hearing impairment. These findings suggest that even SNHL infants with some residual hearing experience disruption in the development of functional lateralization. This underscores the importance of providing early auditory access to SNHL infants to support robust functional integration during early development.",

While this exchange is essential, the precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we discovered that the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC19 functions as a key regulator of mouse spermiogenesis. Loss of Zdhhc19 leads to male infertility and abnormal sperm morphology. Zdhhc19 -deficient sperm exhibit impaired histone-to-protamine exchange, leading to retention of histones and misdistribution of protamines. Similarly, the palmitoyltransferase catalytic site mutant Zdhhc19 C142S knock-in mice show reduced fertility, sperm abnormalities, and histone retention. Mechanistically, ZDHHC19 mediates histone H3 palmitoylation at cysteine-110, weakening H3-H4 interactions and increasing chromatin accessibility. Palmitoylation of H3 facilitates histone-to-protamine exchange. This study highlights the essential role of ZDHHC19’s palmitoyl-transferase activity in histone-to-protamine exchange during spermiogenesis and underscores the broader role of histone palmitoylation in chromatin remodeling.",

          "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa exploits host-derived phosphatidylcholine (PC) to establish persistent lung infections, yet the mechanistic link between metabolic adaptation and pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that choline (Cho)–induced regulator (CodR), a GcvA-type transcriptional regulator, serves as a master regulator integrating virulence, antibiotic resistance, and PC catabolism during pulmonary infection. CodR directly binds Cho, the key metabolite of PC degradation, to activate pchP and norA , facilitating exogenous PC/Cho utilization. Genome-wide profiling reveals that CodR targets conserved motifs in promoters of mexA , pslA , and amrZ , synchronizing virulence and tolerance pathways. codR deletion attenuated biofilm formation, type III secretion system activity, siderophore production, and PC catabolism, reducing bacterial pathogenicity in a murine pneumonia model. Notably, Cho/PC pretreatment potentiates CodR-dependent transcriptional activation of antibiotic resistance genes, elevating tolerance to ciprofloxacin and meropenem. Our findings elucidate a paradigm wherein P. aeruginosa co-opts host-derived Cho via CodR to simultaneously potentiate virulence and antibiotic resilience, exposing CodR as a druggable node to break infection-resistance synergies.",

We demonstrate that shear stress generated by fluid flow beneath a rising bubble is the primary mechanism for cell detachment. This strategy, relying solely on physical forces and independent of cell or surface chemistry, can therefore work with a large range of the media, surfaces, and cells. We successfully implement this discovery at the lab-scale by designing a prototype for on-demand cell detachment that maintains high cell viability.

Combining two-photon polymerization with a two-step sintering process, we fabricate fully dense and high-fidelity HEC 3D architectures.

We investigated this problem in triple-negative breast cancer and established that radiation-resistant tumor cells have enhanced metastatic capacity. Resistance to radiation increases the expression of integrin β3 ( ITGB3 ), which promotes enhanced migration and invasion. Bioinformatic analysis and subsequent experimentation revealed an enrichment of RNA metabolism pathways that stabilize ITGB3 transcripts. Specifically, the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L ( HNRNPL ), whose expression is regulated by Nrf2, mediates the formation of circular RNAs that sponge the family of let-7 microRNAs that target ITGB3 .

          "abstract": "Hearing relies upon speedy synaptic transmission of sound information from inner hair cells (IHCs) to spiral ganglion neurons. To accomplish this, IHCs use a sophisticated presynaptic machinery including the multi-C 2 domain protein otoferlin that is affected by human deafness mutations. Otoferlin is essential for IHC exocytosis, but how it binds Ca 2+ and the target membrane to serve synaptic vesicle (SV) tethering, docking, and fusion remained unclear. Here, we obtained cryo–electron microscopy structures of otoferlin and employed molecular dynamics simulations of membrane binding. We show that membrane binding by otoferlin involves C 2 B-C 2 G domains and repositions C 2 F and C 2 G domains. Disruption of Ca 2+ -binding sites of the C 2 D domain in mice altered synaptic sound encoding and eliminated the Ca 2+ cooperativity of IHC exocytosis, indicating that it requires the binding of several Ca 2+ -ions by otoferlin. Together, our findings elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying otoferlin-mediated SV docking and support the role of otoferlin as Ca 2+ sensor of SV fusion in IHCs.",

This activity mode had important functional consequences to sound processing during task performance. We show that the slow firing rate modulations caused the ongoing activity just before sound presentations to be higher during task performance than during passive listening. Concurrently, during task performance, the responses to target stimuli were weaker but more informative about the task-relevant sounds. In a model, higher ongoing activity caused more synaptic depression of the cortico-cortical synapses, reducing the tendency of the network to produce population spikes and resulting in weaker but more informative responses to sounds.",

We introduce a hysteresis-assisted shape-morphing (HasMorph) paradigm for soft continuum robots and integrate with tip-everting soft-growing robots. Unlike conventional approaches that avoid hysteresis, HasMorph intentionally exploits friction-induced shape hysteresis, the difference in robot shape during loading and unloading, to enable numerous reversible shape changes using only two sequentially controlled actuators via an inverted zigzag tendon-sheath mechanism. Integrated with tip growth, the robot achieves complex, reversible morphologies and frictionless follow-the-leader navigation. Mechanics and kinematics models reveal how friction and input sequences govern shape evolution and expand the robot’s configuration space. Experiments validate dexterous morphing and robust navigation in unstructured environments. HasMorph enables direct, fine-grained actuation of hyperredundant soft bodies with minimal actuation, offering a scalable approach to soft robot design. This paradigm opens avenues for minimally invasive surgical tools and adaptive inspection systems in complex, confined spaces.",

We find that the two EN individuals differed in their genetic profiles and yet were second-degree relatives. They were genetically most similar to subsequent Neolithic individuals in the Irtysh region, while contemporaneous hunter-gatherers from the Tobol-Ishim and Upper Ob River regions had distinct genetic profiles, likely influenced by riverine geography. The Koken MLBA individuals were genetically similar to other MLBA steppe pastoralists, while genetic outliers provide evidence of two distinct trajectories of admixture with local hunter-gatherer populations.

However, conventional methods based on intense optical pulses and ensemble measurements often fail to resolve quantum dynamics due to spectral overlap, coherent artifacts, and multiphoton effects. To overcome these limitations, single-photon transient stimulated emission (SP-TSE) has been proposed as a femtosecond spectroscopy technique using quantum light and detection principles. Here, we theoretically demonstrate frequency-resolved SP-TSE. Unlike semiclassical techniques, SP-TSE reveals a strong dependence of the time-resolved spectrum on the frequency-resolving method. With a tunable optical filter, the observed spectrum reflects a quantum double-slit interference in the time-frequency domain. In contrast, interferometric detection produces spectra resembling semiclassical results, but the signal emerges specifically from the second harmonic frequency window due to quantum interference. This framework provides insight into ultrafast quantum processes and suggests a foundation for future applications in quantum spectroscopy and technologies.",

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay validated preference of FUBP1 to N m -modified RNA. As FUBP1 predominantly binds intronic regions, we profiled N m sites in chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA) and found N m enrichment within introns. Depletion of N m led to skipped exons, suggesting N m -dependent splicing regulation. The caRNA N m sites overlap with FUBP1-binding sites, and N m depletion reduced FUBP1 occupancy on modified regions. Furthermore, FUBP1 depletion induced exon skipping in N m -modified genes, supporting its role in mediating N m -dependent splicing regulation.

Calcium imaging uncovered region-specific computations: PPC neurons predominantly encoded absolute elapsed time through time cell-like activity, tiling the waiting period independently of patience levels. Their activity predicted the waiting precision. Meanwhile, dmFC and AIC neurons exhibited opposing lick-related activity—dmFC neurons preferentially decreasing and AIC neurons increasing activity during licking. Furthermore, their activity changes during waiting predicted patience.

To our knowledge, for the first time, we use polarization vectors for optical analog computing with a single-layered metasurface to overcome these restrictions. The underlying mechanism is on-demand polarization transformation on the dispersive Poincaré spheres, constructing intrinsic variable correlations between the incident polarization vectors and output signals.

          "abstract": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs) along the tropical southeast Atlantic (TSEA) coast have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and productivity. Through observational analysis and numerical model experiments, we demonstrate that positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) can intensify TSEA coastal MHWs during austral summer through two distinct processes. First, pIOD induces westerly wind anomalies over the equatorial Atlantic, causing thermocline deepening along the TSEA coast through oceanic Kelvin waves, favoring development of MHWs. Second, pIOD enhances rainfall over central Africa, increasing Congo River discharge and resulting in a shallower mixed layer in the TSEA coastal region, also promoting MHW formation. We further develop an empirical model using pIOD as the predictor for TSEA MHWs, demonstrating high predictive skill with a 3-month lead time. In a warming climate, the remote influence of pIOD on TSEA MHWs may be further exacerbated, underscoring critical need to incorporate this factor into marine hazard forecasting for the region.",

PTCL-GATA3, a molecularly defined subtype, associated with T helper 2 (T H 2)–like differentiation and poor prognosis, has frequent co-occurrence of TP53 loss/mutation and heterozygous PTEN loss. CD4+ T cell conditional mouse models with Trp53 mutation/deletion and Pten loss demonstrated mature T cell lymphomas (mTCLs) with T H 2-like transcriptomic and immunophenotypic profiles. Molecular studies revealed that codeletion of Trp53/Pten induced T cell receptor and Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling, promoting T H 2 differentiation while inhibiting T H 1 differentiation. These findings were validated by CRISPR editing of TP53/PTEN loss in human CD4+ T cells and mechanistically evaluated the p53 binding region in intron-3 of GATA3, resulting in transcriptional repression. Transcriptomic profiles of m-TCLs recapitulated human-PTCL-GATA3 transcriptome and distinguished PTCL-NOS subtypes. Preclinical assessment of m-TCLs with PI3Kγ/δ inhibitors significantly improved survival, supporting a therapeutic approach for the p53-aberrant PTCL-GATA3.",

Its frontline treatment uses the BH3 mimetic venetoclax to trigger mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. However, drug resistance nearly always develops, calling for therapies to circumvent it. Advanced microscopy and genome-wide CRISPRi screen analyses pinpointed mitochondrial adaptations primarily mediated by the master regulator of cristae shape optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) as critical for BH3 mimetics resistance. Resistant AML cells up-regulate OPA1 to modify their mitochondrial structure and evade apoptosis. MYLS22 and Opitor-0, two specific and nontoxic OPA1 inhibitors, promote apoptotic cristae remodeling and cytochrome c release, synergizing with venetoclax in AML cells and xenografts derived from AML patients ex vivo and in vivo. Mechanistically, OPA1 loss renders AML cells dependent on glutamine and sensitizes them to ferroptosis by activating ATF4-regulated integrated stress responses. Overall, our data clarify how OPA1 up-regulation allows AML cells' metabolic flexibility and survival and nominates specific OPA1 inhibitors as efficacious tools to overcome venetoclax resistance in leukemia.",

The ultrafast drift rates point to a source region with a notably low magnetic scale height (&lt;0.15 r ⋆ , r ⋆ as the stellar radius), a feature not expected in a commonly assumed dipole-like global field but highly possible in localized strong-field structures, i.e., starspots.

We show that NP decoration enhances MDSC immunomodulatory function, facilitates their trafficking to inflamed CNS regions, and increases NP accumulation within CNS. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, CITED exhibited robust therapeutic efficacy, resulting in reduced disease progression, improved motor function, and diminished myelin damage. Mechanistic studies reveal that CITED exerts its therapeutic effects by targeted reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune responses in CNS. Specifically, CITED inhibits immune cell infiltration, rebalances CD4 T cell phenotypes, and promotes the polarization of myeloid cells toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes.

We provide an observational verification of the physical link between global precipitation and net atmospheric radiative cooling. April 2006 through December 2024, the net atmospheric total (shortwave + longwave) cooling increases at a rate of 0.11 ± 0.31 watts per square meter per decade (Wm −2 dec −1 ). Trends of longwave cooling and shortwave heating are 0.76 ± 0.48 and 0.64 ± 0.27 Wm −2 dec -1 , respectively. The longwave trend is a result of partial cancelation among contributions from increasing surface skin temperature, air temperature, and water vapor. Increasing shortwave absorption is caused by increasing water vapor. The trend of global mean diabatic heating by precipitation is 0.03 ± 0.61 Wm −2 dec −1 . These results observationally confirm that an absence of current global precipitation trends is consistent with net atmospheric radiative cooling trends explained by nearly balanced changes between longwave cooling and shortwave heating.",

A major open question is how cilia self-organize into metachronal waves, where neighboring cilia beat with the same beat pattern but slightly differing phase. In marine invertebrate larvae, cilia are arranged ornately in arrays or bands, which propagate mesmerizing metachronal waves for swimming motility. Here, we investigate ciliary metachronism in larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerelii , using whole-body high-speed imaging and physical and biological manipulations. The results reveal an unexpected wave structure featuring strong coupling within multiciliated cells that breaks down across cell boundaries. Using laser ablation to selectively remove parts of the ciliary band, we establish the necessity and sufficiency of ciliary band continuity for wave transmission and the importance of nonreciprocal steric interactions. Taking advantage of neuronally controlled whole-body ciliary arrests, we also reveal the dynamics of wave cessation and reestablishment.",

Disease progression was blunted in Lyn kinase-dead mice indicating a contribution for kinase-independent Lyn functions in restraining autoantibody production, glomerulonephritis, Toll-like receptor signaling, and splenomegaly. Further comparative analyses identified an exclusive role for the kinase-dependent functions of Lyn in regulating B cell receptor signaling, dendritic cell phenotype, and type I interferon production. By contrast, interferon-stimulated gene expression and the regulation of thymic epithelial cell development and T cell selection are previously unidentified, exclusively kinase-independent functions for Lyn.

To facilitate efficient DC migration, constant cross-talk between actin and microtubules is required to coordinate cytoskeletal networks and actomyosin contractility, but the related mechanisms have not been extensively characterized. We show that mouse DCs lacking Kif5b (the heavy chain of kinesin-1) exhibit a major impairment in cell migration in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, kinesin-1 coordinates cytoskeletal cross-talk between actin and microtubules during DC migration by modulating negatively RhoA activity through its interaction with GEF-H1, thereby limiting GEF-H1’s availability in the cytosol. The same mechanism operates in human primary monocyte–derived DCs and regulates efficient migration in a confined environment. Thus, our results highlight kinesin-1 as a key regulator of DC migration, through its coordinated control of cytoskeletal dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Osimertinib (Osi) resistance limits its efficacy in EGFR-mutant non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we developed a pH-responsive cationic nanovesicle ( 124 I/Cy5.5-sO@FCLs), equipped with dual-modal positron emission tomography (PET) and fluorescence imaging capabilities, to enable dynamic monitoring of the role of ribonucleotide reductase M2 subunit (RRM2) disruption in overcoming Osi resistance and enhance targeted anticancer efficacy in NSCLC. RRM2 was identified as a critical driver of poor prognosis and Osi resistance in NSCLC. The 124 I/Cy5.5-sO@FCLs enabled real-time tracking of tumor targeting and biodistribution, and CRISPR-Cas9–mediated RRM2 disruption efficiently reversed Osi resistance and potentiated synergistic anticancer effects, which was attributed to counteracting TGF-β/Smad2/3–mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and amplifying cGAS/STING-induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, the nanovesicles triggered STING-dependent immunogenic cell death (ICD), stimulating tumor infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells; combination with anti–PD-L1 therapy augmented NSCLC regression. Collectively, 124 I/Cy5.5-sO@FCLs integrate gene editing with targeted therapies while enabling dynamic, quantitative monitoring, providing an approach for precision-targeted treatment in Osi-resistant NSCLC.",

          "abstract": "The East African uplift during the Miocene played a crucial role in reshaping regional climates, ecosystems, and faunal communities, contributing to a shift from forested landscapes to widespread grasslands. Here, we use the high-resolution Earth System Model EC-Earth3, coupled with a dynamic vegetation model, to simulate climate and vegetation responses to East African uplift across three key Miocene intervals (25, 20, and 15 Ma) under varying atmospheric CO 2 levels. Our results show that tectonic uplift, combined with declining CO 2 during the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, substantially reduced forest cover and promoted grassland expansion across East and Central Africa. These environmental transitions likely facilitated faunal dispersals and ecological turnover, including among large mammals and early crown hominoids. By integrating geodynamic reconstructions, paleoclimate modeling, and fossil data, this study provides insight into how large-scale Earth system processes shaped Miocene biodiversity and altered the environmental context for mammalian evolution in Africa.",

          "abstract": "Phonon-assisted upconversion (UC) for anti-Stokes photoluminescence stands as a fundamental and widely studied process, central to both ultrafast electron-phonon coupling physics and diverse photonic applications. However, the ultrafast dynamics limit of UC has yet to be addressed, preventing its integration into the nonlinear optical regime. Here, we find a giant single-step UC of ~200 milli–electron volts via sub–35-femtosecond phonon dynamics in two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in the nonlinear regime. The single-step UC approaches the phonon dynamics limit of ~23 femtoseconds and gains energy about eight times the room-temperature thermal energy (~25 milli–electron volts), enabling its synergistic integration into the nonlinear regime. Benefiting from the unique electron-phonon coupling between organic vibrations and excitons in inorganic lattices, the UC demonstrates distinctive signatures of Raman anisotropy and strong nonlinearity. This work opens new avenues for studying uncharted phonon dynamics and nonlinear optical mechanisms, offering substantial advantages in optical refrigeration, upconverting energy harvesting and optical microscopy.",

Direct air capture (DAC) that removes CO 2 from the atmosphere provides great potential in carbon neutralization. However, the massive land use and capital investment of centralized DAC plants and the energy-intensive process of adsorbent regeneration limit its wide employment. We develop a distributed carbon nanofiber (CNF)–based DAC air filter capable of adsorbing CO 2 downstream in ventilation systems. The DAC air filter not only has the potential to remove 596 MtCO 2 year −1 globally but can also decrease energy consumption in existing building systems. The CNF-based adsorbent has a capacity of 4 mmol/g and can be regenerated via solar thermal or electrothermal methods with low carbon footprints. Through life cycle assessment, the CNF air filter shows a carbon removal efficiency of 92.1% from cradle to grave. Additionally, techno-economic analysis estimates a cost of $209 to 668 in capturing and storing 1 tonne of CO 2 from direct air.",

          "abstract": "In photoactive proteins, coupling between the chromophore and protein matrix is exquisitely tuned. Proton transfer reactions can mediate this coupling, as in proton-coupled electron transfer and excited-state proton transfer. Additional mechanisms involving proton dislocations may exist but remain undiscovered. Here, we present a femtosecond crystallographic movie of the phytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans . The structures reveal a space-conserving mechanism for rotation of the D-ring in the excited state. We observe rearrangement of a conserved hydrogen bond network within 300 fs, which precedes the isomerization reaction of the chromophore. Aided by molecular modeling and independently confirmed by femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, we attribute these changes to a protonation shift of the strictly conserved histidine-260. Although this histidine lies close to the photoexcited π-orbitals of the chromophore, it is not directly part of them. We propose that this “remote-controlled” proton transfer relays photoexcitation near-instantaneously to the protein matrix. This mechanism may be widely used to transduce cofactor signals to their hosting enzymes.",

          "abstract": "Marine phytoplankton are crucial to oceanic ecosystems, yet trends in their activity, monitored through chlorophyll a, remain uncertain due to observational limitations. We generated an ocean chlorophyll a dataset (2001 to 2023) across low to mid-latitudes (45°N to 45°S) using multisource data and a deep learning approach. Our analysis suggests widespread decline in ocean greenness, with chlorophyll a concentrations decreasing at a rate of (−0.35 ± 0.10) × 10 −3 milligrams per cubic meter per year (mg m −3  year −1 ). The decline is steeper in coastal regions [(−0.73 ± 0.22) × 10 −3 mg m −3  year −1 ]. The frequency of high chlorophyll a concentration events in coastal waters has decreased at a relative rate of −1.78% per year. These trends are predominantly driven by rising sea surface temperatures, which enhance ocean stratification, suppress nutrient upwelling, and limit phytoplankton growth. These findings suggest a long-term decline in marine primary production and a reduced occurrence of phytoplankton blooms, potentially disrupting trophic interactions and oceanic carbon cycling.",

          "abstract": "Multistable metastructures can switch between multiple stable configurations without requiring locking forces. However, their potential for creating reconfigurable robots—metabots—capable of adapting to changing environments remains largely unexplored. Here, we report harnessing developable surface–based multistable thin-shell metastructures with high reconfigurability for adaptive manipulation and locomotion. These multistable metastructures are constructed by cutting and bonding thin polymer sheets with patterned cutouts, enabling programmable prestored elastic energy. A single unit achieves up to 20 stable configurations, while a four-unit assembly yields 256 reconfigured states, through simple folding of dynamic virtual creases. When integrated with thin sheet–based, multiresponsive soft actuators, these metastructures become highly adaptive metabots, including universal, noninvasive bistable soft grippers; magnetic multigait jumpers; and dual-responsive crawlers powered by magnetic and electroactive actuation. These systems exhibit high adaptability and maneuverability, capable of navigating complex terrains and confined environments via on-demand shape transformations, paving the way for energy-efficient, reconfigurable soft robotic platforms.",

Nineteen microscopic ferropericlase grains with different Mg#s were released from Juína and Kankan diamonds with mantle-like carbon, for Mg and Fe isotopic analysis. Two groups of ferropericlase inclusions can be distinguished with respect to diamond growth: high-Mg# inclusions with mantle-like Mg and Fe (δ 26 Mg = −0.23 ± 0.22‰; δ 56 Fe = 0.00 ± 0.14‰) inferred to be preexisting and lower Mg# inclusions with non–mantle-like heavy Fe (δ 56 Fe up to +0.3‰) and light Mg (δ 26 Mg down to −1.4‰) inferred to be coeval. We propose that coeval ferropericlase inclusions formed by melting of hydrated and carbonated peridotitic slab components subducted to lower mantle depths. Continuous reaction of these melts with surrounding reduced, dry slab harzburgite can produce the large range in Mg# and Ni contents of our ferropericlase suite—a heretofore unexplained feature of global ferropericlase data.",
